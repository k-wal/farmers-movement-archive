The mega German carrier says it is “accelerating fleet modernisation” plan to replace older types on short, medium and long-haul routes. Accordingly, 175 new aircraft will be delivered to Lufthansa Group airlines this decade. The pandemic has preponed the retirement of four-engine passenger jets. “Current plans call for an initial fleet reduction, while at the same time extensively modernizing it in the future. The Boeing 787-9 and Airbus A350-900 will essentially replace the four-engine A340 long-haul aircraft as part of this process. Plans call for reducing the number of four-engine aircraft in the Lufthansa Group long-haul fleet to less than 15% by the middle of this decade; before the crisis, the share was around 50 percent,” Lufthansa said in a statement. With the fuel-efficient aircraft, it hopes to reduce operating costs by around 15%. Carsten Spohr, chairman of the executive board and CEO of Deutsche Lufthansa AG, said, “Even in these challenging times, we are continuing to invest in a more modern, more efficient and a lower emission Lufthansa Group fleet. At the same time, we are pushing ahead with the modernisation of our long-haul fleet even faster than planned prior to the coronavirus pandemic due to anticyclical opportunities. The new aircraft are the most modern of their kind. We want to further expand our global leadership role, among other things, with cutting-edge premium products and a state-of-the-art fleet – especially because we have a responsibility to the environment.” The first Boeing 787-9 are scheduled to start flying for Lufthansa from next winter, with others to follow in the first half of 2022. Monday's decision brings the total number of firm orders for Boeing 787-9s and Boeing 777-9s to 45 aircraft. “Due to the dramatic impact of the coronavirus pandemic on global aviation, aircraft that had been ordered by some airlines could not be delivered in the past twelve months. Lufthansa held talks with Boeing and found a way to buy five 787-9 that were already manufactured,” Lufthansa statement said. The five newly ordered Airbus A350-900s will be delivered in 2027 and 2028. This brings the total number of firm orders for the A350-900 to 45 aircraft. “The investment in new aircraft is in line with the framework agreement between the Economic Stabilisation Fund of the Federal Republic of Germany (WSF) and Deutsche Lufthansa AG. The investments are also in line with the Group's policy of limiting annual capital expenditures to the level of depreciation and amortisation and strictly focusing on increasing company value.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/covid-lufthansa-hastens-fleet-modernisation-4-engine-planes-share-to-drop/articleshow/82376460.cms||Saurabh Sinha

According to sources, Pakistani forward posts manned by 10 Chenab Rangers fired around four mortar rounds and 20 rounds from small weapons towards Indian forces deployed at the Majra border outpost. "Indian security personnel observed restraint. No loss of life or injury was reported," a BSF spokesperson said. On April 25, alert BSF troops had foiled an attempt by Pakistan to fly a drone into Indian territory over the IB in Arnia sector of Jammu. India and Pakistan had agreed to a ceasefire along the border in a joint statement on February 25, following which the guns had fallen silent, bringing much relief to border populations. Currently, harvesting of standing crops is in progress along the fence in border villages. The two countries had signed a ceasefire agreement in 2003 but it was hardly followed in letter and spirit, with more violations than observance. The last three years were the worst, with 2,936 ceasefire violations by Pakistan in 2018, 3,289 in 2019 and 5,133 in 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/two-months-into-truce-pakistan-resorts-to-unprovoked-firing/articleshow/82376846.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

Health ministry data show that after crossing 4 lakh cases on April 30, the number of daily new cases dropped marginally to 3,92,488 and 3,68,147 on May 1 and May 2, respectively. The seven-day moving average growth rate in active cases is now 2.9%. On Sunday morning, the active caseload stood at 34,13,642.

---||India||Supreme Court rejects Election Commission's plea to limit court reporting by media||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday rejected the Election Commission’s stand that the media should only report court orders and not the scathing observations of judges during hearings, and said intense, minute-to-minute reporting of court proceedings fostered a sense of transparency and public confidence in the adjudication process. “In the 1950s, the proceedings of constitutional courts were reported by a handful of newspapers. But in today’s age, the proceedings before any constitutional court in important matters relating to public interest get reported minute by minute not only by the mainstream media and the electronic media but also by social media. That does not mean the judges should feel restrained from asking uncomfortable questions about the functioning of authorities, both executive and constitutional,” a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah said. The bench explained to the EC that judges asking questions to a lawyer was reflective of the unique dialogue process of scrutiny adopted by Indian courts before making a decision. “A lawyer is always in the dock and judges ask searing questions. That does not mean the judge is against the lawyer or the client he is representing. It is to elicit the best response,” it added. While referring to the EC as an important pillar of democracy, the bench said, “Media is an important watchdog to maintain the sanctity of democracy. The dialogue process of scrutiny in court proceedings, by getting reported by the media, reflects genuine application of mind (by judges) and fosters confidence in the minds of the general public about the system.” Appearing for the EC, senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi said, “We as lawyers welcome questions from judges. We cannot say the media should not report. But the judges must ask questions which are contextual and give an opportunity to parties before making scathing remarks.” Justice Chandrachud said, “There are judges and judges. Some are reticent while some are garrulous. The observations are reflective of a judge’s individual personality and in the adjudication of public interest matters, especially when citizens are under immense stress because of exponential rise in Covid cases, it is bound to reflect the public sentiment. The endeavour of the judiciary is to ensure greater public good. “We cannot say the media will not report the dialogue process intrinsic to the adjudication process in constitutional courts. In today’s time, the media cannot be gagged in this manner.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/supreme-court-rejects-election-commissions-plea-to-limit-court-reporting-by-media/articleshow/82377744.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||India||Schools must reduce fees for online-only classes: Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: As the Covid-19 pandemic forced closure of schools with a shift to online classes, the Supreme Court on Monday said educational institutions must reduce fees as their running costs have come down with various facilities provided on campus remaining closed. A bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari said the management of educational institutions should be sensitive to the problems faced by people due to the pandemic and take steps to provide succour to students and their parents in these harsh times. It said insisting on payment for facilities not provided to students would amount to profiteering which must be avoided by the schools. Read AlsoParents can be part of process to fix school fee structure, days SCThe Supreme Court on Monday held that that a law can be framed to regulate fees in private unaided schools to stop profiteering by the management and parents can also be made a part of the process to decide fees.“In law, the school management cannot be heard to collect fees in respect of activities and facilities which are, in fact, not provided to or availed of by its students due to circumstances beyond their control. Demanding fees even in respect of overheads on such activities would be nothing short of indulging in profiteering and commercialisation. It is a well-known fact and judicial notice can also be taken that due to complete lockdown, schools were not allowed to open for substantially long period during the academic year 2020-21. Resultantly, the school management must have saved overheads and recurring cost on various items such as petrol/diesel, electricity, maintenance cost, water charges, stationery charges, etc,” the bench said. Coronavirus live updatesWhile adjudicating a batch of pleas of private unaided schools of Rajasthan against the state government’s direction to them to forgo 30% of tuition fees during the pandemic, the bench held that there is no law giving mandate to the state government to pass such an order but agreed that the schools had to reduce the fees. Accordingly, the appellants are justified in assailing the order by the director, secondary education and must succeed. However, that does not give licence to the appellants to be rigid and not be sensitive about the aftermath of the pandemic. The school management supposedly engaged in doing charitable activity of imparting education, is expected to be responsive and alive to that situation and take necessary remedial measures to mitigate the hardship suffered by students and their parents. It is for the school management to reschedule payment of school fees in such a way that not even a single student is left out or denied opportunity of pursuing his/her education, so as to effectuate the adage— live and let live,” the bench said. The parents, who are demanding cut in fees, told the bench that the schools have saved colossal amount of money during the online classes towards electricity charges, water charges, stationery charges and other miscellaneous charges which are required for physical running of the school. Agreeing with the parents' contention, the bench said, “Indeed, overheads and operational costs so saved would be nothing, but an amount undeservedly earned by the school without offering such facilities to the students during the relevant period ... the principle of quid pro quo must come into play. However, no accurate (factual) empirical data has been furnished by either side about the extent to which such savings have been or could have been made or benefits derived by the school management. Without insisting for mathematical exactitude approach, we would assume that the school management(s) must have saved around 15 per cent of the annual school fees." Granting relief to students, the bench said the fees should have been refixed by the regulating authority but decided to pass order for minimum 15 percent cut to settle the issue once and for all. “The appellants (school management of the private unaided schools) shall collect annual school fees from their students as fixed under the Act of 2016 for the academic year 201920, but by providing deduction of 15 per cent on that amount in lieu of unutilised facilities by students during the relevant period of academic year 2020-21," it said. The court also directed the schools to not debar any student from attending either online classes or physical classes on account of nonpayment of fees, arrears/outstanding fees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/schools-must-reduce-fees-for-online-only-classes-supreme-court/articleshow/82377796.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

Students will be given a month’s time before the NEET-PG is held. The decision, taken at a review meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is cited as a step that will make a large number of qualified doctors available for Covid duties. The government said states and UTs must make all efforts to reach out to prospective NEET candidates and request them to join the Covid –19 workforce in this hour of need. “The services of final-year MBBS students can be utilised for providing services like tele-consultation and monitoring of mild Covid cases after due orientation by and under supervision of faculty,” said an official announcement. The measures will reduce workload on existing doctors engaged in Covid duty and provide boost to efforts of triaging. It has also been decided that services of final-year PG students (broad as well as super-specialities) as residents may continue to be utilised until fresh batches of PG students have joined. Also BSc and GNM qualified nurses may be utilised in full-time Covid nursing duties under the supervision of senior doctors and nurses. The PMO statement asserts that individuals providing services in Covid management will be given priority in forthcoming regular government recruitments after they complete a minimum of 100 days of Covid duty. Also all health professionals will be covered under the insurance scheme of the government for health workers engaged in fighting Covid-19. Listing out the incentives, the statement said, “All such professionals who sign up for minimum 100 days of Covid duty and complete it successfully will also be given the PM’s Distinguished Covid National Service Samman from Government of India.” It was decided that states can make available additional health professionals to private Covid hospitals as well in surge areas. “The vacant posts of doctors, nurses, allied professionals and other healthcare staff in health and medical departments be filled through accelerated processes within 45 days through contractual appointments,” it was decided at the review. The central government had issued guidelines in June 2020 to facilitate engagement of doctors and nurses for Covid duties. A special Rs 15,000 crore public health emergency support was provided to ramp up facilities and human resources. Through the National Health Mission, an additional 2,206 specialists, 4685 medical officers and 25,593 staff nurses were recruited.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/government-defers-neet-pg-to-rope-in-doctors-in-covid-war/articleshow/82377890.cms||---
---||India||11 killed in Bengal post-poll violence, Centre seeks report||KOLKATA/NEW DELHI: The Union home ministry on Monday sought a detailed report from the Bengal government on the “post-election violence targeting opposition political workers in the state” that left 11 people dead since Sunday evening. BJP reported six deaths in the alleged backlash, including of a party worker in Kolkata who was lynched soon after he posted videos on Facebook narrating how goons killed his pet dogs, and of an elderly woman in North 24-Parganas trying to save her son from a mob. Trinamool said it lost four workers in the wave of alleged political vendetta even as CM and party chief Mamata Banerjee appealed for peace. The ISF, which partnered Congress and Left in the polls, said one of its workers was killed. As violence raged across districts, governor Jagdeep Dhankhar summoned the state home secretary, DGP and Kolkata Police commissioner to Raj Bhavan. When Mamata met him later, he urged her government to "take all steps to ensure post-poll violence, arson, loot and killings end". BJP national president J P Nadda will make a two-day visit to Bengal starting Tuesday to take stock. The party on Monday announced nationwide protests on Wednesday against the violence allegedly unleashed by TMC workers after the poll results were declared. Covid-safety protocol will be adhered to during the demonstrations, the party said. "Houses of over 4,000 BJP workers were ransacked overnight and at least 100 shops were looted," BJP's Bengal minder Kailash Vijayvargiya said. BJP's Chakdah MLA Bankim Ghosh allegedly came under attack, too. "We are informing the Election Commission and the Union home minister about the situation," state BJP president Dilip Ghosh said after meeting governor Dhankhar. "There is an atmosphere of fear. The ruling dispensation is not doing anything, the police are silent and ineffective." Former Rajya Sabha MP Swapan Dasgupta, who contested the Tarakeshwar seat on a BJP ticket but lost the poll, urged Union home minister Amit Shah to rush central forces for the safety of Hindu families at Nanoor in Birbhum district. "Alarming situation in Nanoor (Birbhum district) with more than a thousand Hindu families out in the fields to escape marauding mobs seeking to take it out against BJP supporters. Reports of molestation or worse of women. Amit Shah please rush some security to the area," he tweeted. In Kolkata, slain BJP worker Abhijit Sarkar's mother accused TMC's re-elected Beliaghata MLA Paresh Paul of being involved in the fatal attack on her son and his pets. The legislator contested the allegation. "I do not know him and have no idea what happened to him," Paul said, seeking an inquiry to unearth the truth. Shovarani Mandal, an elderly woman from Jagaddal in North 24-Parganas, allegedly got killed when she tried to protect her cornered BJP worker son. Uttam Ghosh, a BJP man from Ranaghat, was also allegedly killed by rival party workers. A 19-year-old Sitalkuchi youth, Manik Baidya, was killed by suspected TMC workers at the same site where another young party worker had been slain on polling day, state BJP chief Ghosh said. At Deganga in North 24-Parganas, an ISF worker died on Monday morning when goons hurled three crude bombs at him. Clashes broke out at East Burdwan’s Nabagram between Trinamool and BJP, leading to the death of a BJP supporter identified as Kakoli Khetrapal. TMC said at least two of its supporters, Saju Shah and Bivas Bagh, were killed for chanting "Jai Bangla". In Hooghly’s Khanakul, TMC worker Debu Pramanik was hacked to death in his home. At Raina in East Burdwan, Ganesh Malik, another party worker, was allegedly killed by BJP men. A CPM office was set ablaze at Chopra in North Dinajpur. "I want to remind BJP that what they are doing is not right...I want to tell the police that some of them have worked in favour of BJP. But this is the time we should perform Raj Dharma," CM Mamata said, questioning the role of the Cooch Behar SP while violence continued unabated in the north Bengal district. Mamata said handling the pandemic was her immediate priority. She urged all to show restraint and celebrate the birth anniversary of Rabindranath Tagore on May 9 to "showcase the cultural ambience of Bengal".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/11-killed-in-bengal-post-poll-violence-centre-seeks-report/articleshow/82378005.cms||---
---||India||Poll official nixed TMC recount plea ‘at gunpoint’: Didi||KOLKATA: Mamata Banerjee on Monday alleged electoral malpractice in Nandigram on a massive scale, claiming a returning officer who turned down Trinamool’s pleas for a vote recount subsequently reported a threat to his life, suggesting he may have been “working at gunpoint”. The Bengal CM, who lost in Nandigram to her former aide and BJP candidate Suvendu Adhikari by 1,956 votes, questioned how her 8,000-plus lead “suddenly became zero” after a server breakdown and a power cut. “A returning officer sent an SMS at 11pm on Sunday night. I will not say to whom this was sent,” Mamata said, reading out the message that she said came to her as a forward. “The message goes, ‘Sir, it is not my purview. Sir, please save my family. My family will ruin (sic). I have no other option but to commit suicide. Life threat is coming. I may be murdered. I had nothing to do. Please forgive me, I have a little daughter’.” When TOI contacted the returning officer (a deputy magistrate), he declined to comment on Mamata's allegation and requested that he be not named. EC officials in Kolkata, too, refused to speak on the controversy. "Can you understand what took place? The returning officer is saying it is a question of life and death," Mamata had said, questioning the Election Commission’s "interest" in denying a recount and declaring she would "definitely move court" against the decision. "What is there to fear in a recount? Why did the EC not allow this? What is their interest? All the journalists saw (what happened). The governor called me. And then everything turned upside down. I haven’t seen such mafiagiri. I want justice to prevail. Will definitely move court," she said, adding that the BJP would not have crossed even the 50-seat mark had the EC been fair. "The rest of the 77 seats are the EC’s contribution." EC sources said a poll result announced by a returning officer could be challenged only in a court. Mamata demanded that all postal ballots, EVMs and VVPATs involved in the Nandigram vote be kept separately and sealed. "There should be forensic tests if the seals are tampered with. They should be kept in safe custody," she said. "I am happy that the Supreme Court has upheld the Madras high court order (on the EC’s handling of the Covid situation). People depend on courts for justice." The CM was alluding to the aapex court's denial of an EC plea to stop media from reporting judges’ oral observations. "People have decided that BJP is not Shahenshah. I thank Bengal’s people (all religions and linguistic groups) for showing that their spine is still very strong. Our mothers and sisters have shown us the path," Mamata said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/poll-official-nixed-tmc-recount-plea-at-gunpoint-didi/articleshow/82378048.cms||---
---||India||Serum, Bharat Biotech got advance of Rs 2,500 crore for 16 crore doses, says government||MUMBAI: The government on Monday said it had paid an advance of over Rs 2,500 crore to Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech for supply of 16 crore doses of Covid vaccine between May and July. While Serum Institute is to supply 11 crore doses of Covishield, the rest will be Covaxin manufactured by Bharat Biotech. Based on the advance paid on April 28, the price works out to a little under Rs 160 per shot. SII CEO Adar Poonawalla had suggested that the Centre should increase the price as the company needed to boost capacity. The government’s statement came after Poonawalla’s interview to The Financial Times, where he had suggested the company did not expand capacity due to the absence of orders. Besides, the Centre has been facing criticism for not procuring enough vaccine before opening inoculations for those over 18 years. It said that against an earlier order of 10 crore doses, Serum had delivered 8.7 crore shots till Monday, while Bharat Biotech had delivered 88 lakh against an order of 2 crore shots. The Centre had announced last month that it is making an advance payment of around Rs 3,000 crore to Serum Institute and Rs 1,500 crore to Bharat Biotech. The controversy also forced Poonawalla to issue a statement, saying the firm has been working closely with the government for the past year and is committed to ramping up capacity. “...it is not possible to ramp up production overnight. We also need to understand that the population of India is huge and to produce enough doses for all adults is not an easy task. Even the most advanced countries and companies are struggling in relatively smaller populations,” he said, adding he would like to clarify since his (overall) comments may have been misinterpreted. Poonawalla said against overall orders of over 26 crore doses, Rs 15 crore had been supplied to the government. “Another 11 crore doses will be supplied in the second channel for state and private hospitals,” he said.

---||India||Supreme Court sympathises with Election Commission, but says drop ‘touch me not’ stand||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday sympathised with the Election Commission's hurt over Madras High Court's searing "EC should face murder charges" observation but said HC judges must feel free to put bitter questions to the authorities to elicit proper responses while dealing with citizen-centric litigation. The HC’s observations were made on April 26 and 30 during the hearing of a PIL alleging non-observance of Covid-19 norms during the just-held polls, and that it could endanger the lives of lakhs of people. The EC sought erasure of the observations and said uncalled for and non-contextual remarks by a constitutional court against a constitutional body entrusted with conducting free and fair elections, without giving it an opportunity to explain, were not only in bad taste but had also demoralised  officials. For the EC, senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi said the HC said all sorts of things against the commission in a series of “out of context remarks” without giving it an opportunity to explain. "If the PM or a CM holds a rally and two lakh people gather, what can the EC do? Police and CRPF are not in EC's administrative control. EC's role remains confined to carrying out free and fair elections and managing related officials. Dignity of the EC and its officials needs to be protected. When the HC says EC and its officials must face criminal proceedings and FIRs should get registered, what remedy could the officers have?" Dwivedi asked. A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah said HCs played an important role in protecting the fundamental rights of people and had a wider jurisdiction than even the SC. "We understand the point of view of the EC and its hurt feelings. But we have to protect the sanctity of HCs and the judicial process of scrutiny. HC judges should have the liberty to ask questions and not feel restrained while dealing with matters relating to public interest," the bench said. Explaining the process of scrutiny in constitutional courts, Justice Chandrachud said, "I would not have made such a remark (as was done by Madras HC). Ordinarily, we are careful not to say anything during the hearing which is inappropriate for inclusion in the order." Justice Shah said, "In adjudication of issues relating to public interest, there is always a human element that is involved and judges reflect the public sentiment while asking questions to the authorities. Treat the Madras HC observations like a bitter pill, which a doctor gives to patients for speedy recovery." The bench further said, "We understand why EC felt pained. But for the EC to say that the HC was trying to overwhelm it or trying to demean it will not be correct. Parliament is the sovereign body of representatives for India. Yet, the Supreme Court can examine the validity of laws enacted by the sovereign body and strike them down. That does not make the Supreme Court more powerful than Parliament. So, it will be completely unacceptable if the EC says it is not amenable to judicial scrutiny." It said judges, in discharge of their constitutionally mandated task, have to ask uncomfortable questions with the sole purpose of eliciting better responses and invigorate the executive to discharge its duties. The bench added that the EC's SLP said it was an independent constitutional body and the HC was an independent constitutional authority and that both should not tread on one another's jurisdiction. The bench suggested to the EC not to adopt a “touch me not” approach but promised to strike a balance between the roles of the EC and the HC in the context of the issue arising from the observations made by Madras HC. Recognising the service rendered by the EC, the bench said, "In the last 70 years, the EC has given free and fair elections, which is the essence of democracy. EC is an important pillar of democratic set up in India." The bench reserved its order and indicated that it could be pronounced on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/supreme-court-sympathises-with-election-commission-but-says-drop-touch-me-not-stand/articleshow/82378173.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Mumbai||Posting scam: ‘Deshmukh kin’ call under CBI scanner||MUMBAI: CBI is currently examining a telephone conversation allegedly involving a close relative of former state home minister Anil Deshmukh, which forms part of the conversations tapped by former state intelligence chief Rashmi Shukla in the police postings scam. CBI has registered an FIR against Deshmukh for allegedly asking some police officers to raise Rs 100 crore every month from bars and restaurants. Some of the witnesses who recorded their statements to CBI reportedly said they were asked to identify a voice in the audio recording and whether it was of Deshmukh’s relative. TOI approached CBI to confirm the information but it declined to comment. Deshmukh was unavailable for comment. Recently, CBI recorded the statement of Shukla, special director general of CRPF, in the case as she headed Maharashtra’s State Intelligence Department when the phones were tapped. Last year, Shukla had received complaints that some influential people had promised postings to police officers, including IPS officers, in exchange for money. Thereafter, she tapped their phonesand submitted a report to the then DGP Maharashtra Subodh Jaiswal, requesting to bring it in notice of the CM. Jaiswal forwarded the report to the CM, but no action was taken. Chief secretary Sitaram Kunte, who was then additional chief secretary (home), had said in a report that Shukla had misled the government to obtain permission for tapping the calls and had later apologised.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/posting-scam-deshmukh-kin-call-under-cbi-scanner/articleshow/82378195.cms||Vijay V Singh

In a joint petition for dissolution of marriage filed in King County Superior Court in Seattle, the couple stated: "The marriage is irretrievably broken." But the foundation said Bill Gates, 65, who co-founded Microsoft Corp, and Melinda Gates would continue to work together in their existing roles as co-chairs and trustees of the organization. The divorce filing, which states that the couple have no minor children, comes after the youngest of their three children is believed to have recently turned 18. The spouses asked the court to approve their agreement on division of assets but did not disclose details. "After a great deal of thought and a lot of work on our relationship, we have made the decision to end our marriage," the two said in a statement posted on each of their individual Twitter accounts. "We no longer believe we can grow together as a couple in the next phase of our lives. We ask for space and privacy for our family as we begin to navigate this new life," they said. Launched in 2000, the nonprofit Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation ranks as the largest private philanthropic foundation in the United States and one world's biggest, with net assets of $43.3 billion at the end of in 2019, according to the latest full-year financials shown on its website. From 1994 through 2018, Gates and his wife, who is 56, have provided gifts of more than $36 billion to the Seattle-based foundation, the website said. Last year, investor Warren Buffett reported donating more than $2 billion of stock from his Berkshire Hathaway Inc to the Gates Foundation as part of previously announced plans to give away his entire fortune before his death. The Gates Foundation has focused on public health, education and climate. Its initiatives include supporting development of coronavirus vaccines, diagnostic tests and medical treatments as well as support for public radio and the manufacture of solar-powered toilets. Joint foundation work to continueThe pair "will continue to work together to shape and approve foundation strategies, advocate for the foundation’s issues and set the organization’s overall direction," the Gates Foundation said in a statement. The split comes two years after another leading American billionaire and philanthropist, Amazon.com Inc founder Jeff Bezos, said that he and his then-wife, MacKenzie, were getting divorced. Gates dropped out of Harvard University to start Microsoft with school chum Paul Allen in 1975. Gates owned 49% of Microsoft at its initial public offering in 1986, which made him an instant multimillionaire. With Microsoft's explosive growth, he soon became one of the world's wealthiest individuals.

He remained chairman until 2014 and left the company's board in March 2020. Known in the technology industry as an acerbic and ruthless competitor, Gates drew the ire of rivals and eventually the US government for Microsoft's business practices.

But the verdict was overturned on appeal, and the company then settled the case out of court.

Gates' spouse, who recently began referring to herself as Melinda French Gates on most websites and social media, was raised in Dallas and studied computer science and economics at Duke University. She later joined Microsoft, where she met her future husband.

Italian authorities sent each of the 230 passengers, eight cabin crew members and two pilots for paid quarantine in a hotel for 10 days. Comments have been sought from Air India and are awaited. It is learnt that under arrangements for this special flight, the crew was not to be quarantined in Italy and was were supposed to operate the flight back to India the next day. On landing in Rome, the aircraft was taken to a remote bay at the airport and everyone was made to undergo rapid antigen test in the terminal. Those found this antigens were subjected to RT-PCR test and when two crew members tested positive, Italian authorities decided to quarantine all crew members — including those who tested negative — and the return flight could not operate. The quarantined people are having a tough time there as they have reportedly been sent to a Covid care hospital and not a hotel. Sources say Air India and Indian officials in Rome have been trying their best — to no avail — to provide food to them and also get clearance to fly the pilot and seven cabin crew members who are not positive back home. However that permission did not come. AI had to fly two Boeing 787 Dreamliner pilots and a cabin crew member from Delhi to Frankfurt and from there to Rome. They flew the B787 stranded in Rome since last Wednesday to Delhi on Sunday as a ferry flight — which means no passengers on board. A person who flew to Rome on this flight recounts the ongoing experience: “When the aircraft landed in Rome on April 28 at 9 pm (local time), it did not stop at an aerobridge at the terminal. It stopped at a remote part of the tarmac. Local authorities asked for deplaning to happen in batches. So the past person from the aircraft reached an empty terminal after four hours. Everyone was subjected to rapid antigen test and those who came positive were subjected to RT-PCR.” “Once some people tested positive, everyone was sent to a hotel, actually a Covid centre, in ambulances escorted by police cars for being quarantined there. The rooms and toilets are not very clean. For five days we are having pasta for lunch and dinner,” that person said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/all-240-on-ai-flight-to-rome-isolated/articleshow/82378705.cms||Saurabh Sinha
---||World||Biden raises Trump refugee cap after delay backlash||WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden on Monday formally raised the nation's cap on refugee admissions to 62,500 this year, weeks after facing bipartisan blowback for his delay in replacing the record-low ceiling of 15,000 set by former President Donald Trump. Biden last month moved to expand the eligibility criteria for resettlements, removing one roadblock to refugees entering the US put in place by Trump, but he had initially stopped short of lifting the annual cap, with aides saying they did not believe it was necessary. But Biden faced sharp pushback for not at least taking the symbolic step of authorizing more refugees to enter the US this year and swiftly reversed course. Biden, in a statement Monday, said the new limit “erases the historically low number set by the previous administration,” adding that Trump's cap “did not reflect America's values as a nation that welcomes and supports refugees." “It is important to take this action today to remove any lingering doubt in the minds of refugees around the world who have suffered so much, and who are anxiously waiting for their new lives to begin,” Biden added. Biden said it was a “sad truth” that the US would not meet the 62,500 cap by the end of the fiscal year in September, given the pandemic and limitations on the country's resettlement capabilities — some of which his administration has attributed to the Trump administration's policies to restrict immigration. That said, they maintain Biden remains committed to setting the cap at 125,000 for the 2022 fiscal year that starts in October, while they were working to improve US capabilities to process refugees to be able to accept as many of them as possible under the new cap. Refugee resettlement agencies applauded the action after criticizing Biden for months for letting Trump's cap remain. “We are absolutely thrilled and relieved for so many refugee families all across the world who look to the U.S. for protection,” said Krish O'Mara Vignarajah, head of Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, one of nine resettlement agencies in the nation. “It has a felt like a rollercoaster ride, but this is one critical step toward rebuilding the program and returning the US to our global humanitarian leadership role.” Secretary of State Antony Blinken notified Congress on February 12 of a plan to raise the ceiling on admissions to 62,500, but no presidential determination followed. Then in an emergency declaration on April 16, Biden stated the admission of up to 15,000 refugees set by Trump this year “remains justified by humanitarian concerns and is otherwise in the national interest.” That set off a deluge of criticism from his allies on Capitol Hill. Second-ranking Senate Democrat, Dick Durbin of Illinois called that initial limit “unacceptable." New Jersey Democratic Senator Bob Menendez, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote in a letter to Biden that “failing to issue a new Determination undermines your declared purpose to reverse your predecessor's refugee policies." Within hours the White House made a quick course correction. The administration vowed to increase the historically low cap by May 15 — but said it probably would be not be as high as the 62,500. In the end, Biden returned to that figure, though agencies agree it is unlikely to be reached. “We are dealing with a refugee resettlement process that has been eviscerated by the previous administration and we are still in a pandemic," said Mark Hetfield, president of HIAS, a Maryland-based Jewish nonprofit that resettles refugees. “It is a challenge, but it's important he sends a message to the world that the US is back and prepared to welcome refugees again." The new allocation instituted by Biden added more slots for refugees from Africa, the Middle East and Central America and ended Trump's restrictions on resettlements from Somalia, Syria and Yemen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-raises-trump-refugee-cap-after-delay-backlash/articleshow/82378924.cms||---

The 84 reserved seats – 68 for SC and 16 for ST – saw a much closer contest between the two major rivals in terms of seats won as well as vote shares than the general seats. The TMC won 45 of the reserved seats, the BJP 39. Thus, the TMC had just 15% more reserved seats than BJP. In general seats, on the other hand, TMC’s tally of 169 was four and a half times as much as BJP’s 38. The gap in vote share between the two in general seats was 13 percentage points – 49.2% against 36.2%. In the seats reserved for SC, that narrowed to under four percentage points with TMC getting 46.2% and the BJP 42.8%. In ST seats the gap was even narrower, the TMC’s share being 45.2% and the BJP’s 44%. The good news for the Trinamool is that in both SC and ST seats, the current performance improved upon the 2019 showing, when the BJP had led in 46 segments and the TMC in just 37. In terms of vote share, too, the BJP had the edge over TMC in the reserved seats two years ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bjp-got-39-tmc-45-of-84-reserved-seats-in-bengal/articleshow/82378935.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Polarised voting hurt Mamata Banerjee in Nandigram||NANDIGRAM: Religious polarisation — even in areas where Hindus and Muslims had together fought the 2007 land acquisition battle — helped BJP’s Suvendu Adhikari script a narrow win in Nandigram, which stood out amidst the Trinamool Congress’s success story elsewhere. As the cliffhanger entered the last stages, with Mamata Banerjee leading after the penultimate (16th) round, Sonachura and Gokulnagar — among the few villages with a sizeable Hindu population in the Nandigram-1 Block that bore the brunt of the 2007 police firing — sealed the race in Adhikari’s favour. Banerjee lost Nandigram by 1,956 votes, with Adhikari getting more than 1.1 lakh votes (48.5%) and Banerjee more than 1.08 lakh (47.6%). The semi-urban constituency in East Midnapore has around 2.5 lakh voters, with Nandigram-1 having 1.5 lakh and Nandigram-2 having 1 lakh voters. Nandigram-1 has around 49,000 minority community voters; Nandigram-2 has around 11,000. Both Trinamool and BJP campaign managers said Banerjee had got almost all the Muslim votes and about 50,000 of the 1.9 lakh Hindu votes. “Adhikari would have got very few Muslim votes and we can safely say his 1.1 lakh-plus votes were almost entirely from the majority community,” a BJP poll manager said “Banerjee knew she would not have to woo minority voters. So she decided to step into Adhikari’s lair and reach out to Hindu voters, visiting temples, reading shlokas and attempting to neutralise the BJP’s minority-appeasement charges against her,” a Trinamool Nandigram leader said. “It was a close call,” a BJP leader admitted But it was not just Banerjee’s appeal, or only minority voters, that made the fight a nail-biting one. Poll analysts said every move of Banerjee was targeted to create “maximum impact”. Adhikari repeatedly addressed her as “begum” to polarise the Hindu vote bank, but Banerjee chose to stay in Reyapara’s Sibmandir — a Hindu-dominated zone that shifted allegiance from CPM to BJP — rather than in a “friendly” neighborhood. Ultimately, the win came as a face-saver for Adhikari and BJP on a day when several party heavyweights suffered losses across Bengal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/polarised-voting-hurt-mamata-in-nandigram/articleshow/82378987.cms||Suman Mandal
---||Kolkata||Didi’s swearing-in on Wednesday to be low-key affair||KOLKATA: Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee is set to take oath as CM of Bengal for the third time on Wednesday. On Monday, she met governor Jagdeep Dhankhar to stake claim to form the next government. Banerjee said the event would be a low-key affair because of the pandemic. Banerjee called on the governor around 7 pm and tendered her resignation. The governor later tweeted that Banerjee would take oath at 10.45 pm on Wednesday. Banerjee also handed over a list of the newly-elected Trinamool MLAs, who elected her leader of the Trinamool legislative party, and staked her claim. It is still not clear whether Banerjee will be sworn in along with her other cabinet colleagues. Party leaders Partha Chatterjee, Firhad Hakim and Subrata Bakshi accompanied her to Raj Bhavan. “The CM resigned and it has been accepted. She has been requested to continue till alternative arrangements are made,” the governor said. Earlier in the day, Banerjee said handling the pandemic would be her priority and asked her newly-elected MLAs to stand by people of their area. She asked the MLAs to work sincerely and not be saddened if they did not find their name in the list of ministers. She also made it clear that the Lok Sabha battle for 2024 would resume only after the more immediate battle against Covid. Banerjee said one could not take on Delhi “alone”, and it must be done “together” once Covid was brought under control. “Now is not the time,” she said, when asked if her Bengal poll successes could lead her to Delhi, adding, “Let us first fight the battle against Covid. No minister, CM or PM matters. The only thing that matters now is people.” Banerjee said she didn’t receive any call from the PM, but received calls from CMs Uddhav Thackeray, Naveen Pattnaik, Arvind Kejriwal and Amarinder Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/didis-swearing-in-on-wednesday-to-be-low-key-affair/articleshow/82379008.cms||Debashish Konar
---||Kolkata||‘Taunts like Didi, o Didi, Bermuda comment reflected in ballot box’||KOLKATA: If a section of Kolkata’s women’s rights activists are to be believed, BJP partially lost its plot the day the party chief in Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, ridiculed chief minister Mamata Banerjee at a rally in Purulia and asked her to “wear a Bermuda” if she wanted to “show her leg”. Added to that were Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Didi O Didi’ chant at rallies. Women’s rights activist Anuradha Kapoor pointed out such slogans impacted voters. In March, around the time the poll campaign began in Bengal, Uttarakhand CM Tirath Singh Rawat had said in Dehradun that girls wearing ripped jeans, showing their knees, were setting a “bad example”. “During the campaign, a person no less than the Prime Minister of our country ridiculed our chief minister. The state BJP president used misogynist comments against her. High profile leaders, like Yogi Adityanath, said women in the state were not safe but himself said ‘women are not capable of being left free or independent’. Such toxic masculinity was called out by women in Bengal,” she said. Social worker Piya Chakraborty, who was part of the think tank behind ‘Nijeder mote nijeder gaan’ video against fascism, also believed such a discourse had its effect on voters. “These leaders never took into account the gender factor. Women were put off. The Bermuda comment impacted the urban woman. But the tone of ‘Didi O Didi’ reflects the larger mentality of the party and how they look at women. It violated the progressive, liberal spirit of Bengal,” said Chakraborty, who claimed their video also offered perspective. Politicians have often banked on this kind of discourse with an eye at the vote bank. Kapoor pointed out that a large number of women candidates this time did not shy away from calling out those making misogynist comments. Such discourses would have to change as women voters were now aware and vocal, she said. Ghosh’s Bermuda comment apparently did not go down well within his own party. “The comment is sexist. Neither the original Bengal wing of BJP nor swayamsevaks of RSS support it. . Many within our system agree the party paid the price for passing such irresponsible comments,” said a BJP worker, in the party since 2013. On May 2, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, tweeted the election results were a “hard-hitting reply to BJP’s ‘Didi o didi’ jibe which was nothing less than an attack on a woman and her dignity”. The same day, Srivatsa YB, national campaign in-charge of Indian Youth Congress, tweeted “every time prime minister said ‘Didi o Didi’ like a roadside romeo, BJP lost five seats in Bengal”. West Bengal Commission for Protection of Child Rights chairperson Ananya Chakraborti had also urged people to protest against the Bermuda comment. “I didn’t know how many seats BJP lost during that jibe. Anyone from Bengal, except for the bhakts, will not take it well. It violates all decency levels and is a direct assault on the culture of Bengal and a chief minister,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/wear-bermudas-other-sexist-jibes-backfired-on-bjp/articleshow/82379039.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Kolkata||Did Bengali pride trump Hindutva?||KOLKATA: The Trinamool Congress worked on caste, sub-caste and linguistic groups and also the Bengali sub-nationalism sentiment against BJP’s majoritarian approach to counter-polarize Hindu votes. The BJP strategy worked in pockets but could not give it the push to attain the magic number Sociologist Prasanta Roy said not all Hindus could fit into one lot, much as BJP might have strategized. “There is a degree of Hinduness in each one of us. A section is rational and calculative. Not all are Hindus at all costs. They took an informed decision,” he said. Roy pointed to the fact that even CM Mamata Banerjee ensured she recited slokas at her meetings and visited temples in Nandigram. “Perhaps she knew she needed to reach a certain section of voters to ensure they did not vote against her,” he said. Contrary to the 2019 LS polls when BJP got the majority of SC/ST votes, TMC this time won 36 SC seats and BJP 32. TMC also had an edge over BJP in seats reserved for STs, winning 9 against BJP’s 7. Sekhar Bandyopadhyay, an expert in social and political history, said TMC juxtaposed ‘Brand Mamata’ against BJP’s Hindu consolidation. “Mamata Banerjee, despite all her mistakes, is an identifiable brand, one very Bengali in nature,” he said. “It was a matter of Bengalis’ self-respect or ‘asmita’,” said Trinamool MP Saugata Roy. “We pitched it as a fight between outsiders and Bengal’s own daughter.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/did-bengali-pride-trump-hindutva/articleshow/82379078.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

But questions were raised about female representation, as only 39 women MLAs will be sworn in, making for merely 13% of the total members in the assembly. Trinamool had fielded 50 women candidates, among whom 32 won the elections and at least three others — including CM Mamata Banerjee — lost by a thin margin. “Our CM has always been focused on women’s empowerment and that has reflected in the representation of women, be it in the party or in the legislative assembly. The progression will continue,” said Chandrima Bhattacharya, former cabinet minister who won from the Dum Dum North constituency. Partha Chatterjee, one of the longest serving Trinamool MLAs since the party’s first election in 2001, also supported the induction of more women in the assembly in future. Winning from Mamata Banerjee’s home turf Bhowanipore, Sovandeb Chattopadhyay, who had been ridiculed for his age by his BJP rival, said he felt ecstatic being the senior-most MLA at the age of 78. Among MLAs across all parties, the from Sanyukta Morcha, Naushad Siddiqui (28), who represented Rashtriya Secular Majlis Party from Bhangar. Also in the team will be four-time MLA from Kasba, Javed Ahmed Khan, who also happened to be the richest MLA, according to the affidavit, which mentioned property and assets worth Rs 30 crore.

Though Sonowal has been chief minister for the past five years and BJP has returned to office, his name was not announced while Sarma has made it clear that he expects his claim to be considered by the BJP brass. Agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar will arrive in Guwahati on Tuesday as an observer of BJP’s parliamentary board amid some discussion on the post of deputy chief minister being created for the first time in the state The choice is not easy as Sonowal is a popular leader with a non-controversial style. His roots in AASU politics make him an organic figure that Assamese sentiment can relate to. Sarma has proved his mettle as an astute political manager who has helped expand BJP's presence in the north-east. He is also a successful electoral campaign. Unlike in 2016, BJP did not name the CM face in the state this time, which has fuelled a debate on who will take the top post. Sarma has responded to queries by saying it was for the parliamentary board to decide. He has even gone on record saying that if Modi-Shah decide on a name other than him, he would not have any regrets. Sonowal on Monday thanked all sections of people of the state for giving a clear mandate to the BJP-led alliance. While BJP has still not made up its mind, a section of top leaders is said to be wary of changing the leadership given Sonowal’s success in governance and welfare schemes. Sarma’s chances are not ruled out given that he not only campaigned rigorously and played a key role in highlighting AIUDF chief Badruddin Ajmal as a patron of illegals but also has been the driving force behind the North-East Democratic Alliance, which was formed by BJP to consolidate itself in the region.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sonowals-image-sarmas-astuteness-leave-bjp-with-tough-choice-on-cm-in-assam/articleshow/82379123.cms||Prabin Kalita
---||Business||Foreign aid: Track, allot plan firmed up||New Delhi: The government has put together an elaborate strategy to distribute the foreign aid pouring in from countries, multinational corporations and individuals and has taken measures to scrap duties on relief material for faster rollout on ground. On Monday, the government did away with Integrated GST (IGST) on Covid-related relief material such as some medicines, oxygen and related equipment, ventilators and test kits donated or received free of cost from overseas and meant for free distribution. The move follows a series of requests since last week as the IGST on some of the products was as high as 28% and imposed a significant burden although the government had announced a customs duty waiver for a limited period earlier. In fact, there were several consignments lying at customs ports as the recipient was not paying the levy. The exemption would also cover goods already imported but lying uncleared at the customs ports. For an equipment such as a concentrator that costs, say Rs 1 lakh, the freight and IGST of 28% often added up to Rs 40,000-45,000, government officials acknowledged. The finance ministry said that representations had been received from charitable organisations, corporate entities, and other associations and entities resulting in the exemption being made available till June 30. The Centre was earlier waiting for a meeting of the GST Council, chaired by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, but decided to expedite the exemption. Following the government decision, revenue secretary Tarun Bajaj, Central Board of Indirect Tax and Customs chairman Ajit Kumar and NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant urged states to use the facility quickly. All government-to-government aid is being handled by the External Affairs Ministry. The allocation to various entities is being handled by the Health Ministry. The NITI Aayog has set up a digital dashboard and a control room for tracking all allocation from the private sector, multinationals, associations, industries Indian diaspora, and professionals. Nodal officers have been set up in NITI Aayog, MEA, Health Ministry to deal with the situation. The Indian Red Cross society has also been roped in. “End to end tracking is being done by a team of young officers for transparency and to ensure that the relief material is reaching the end beneficiaries,” said Kant. State chief secretaries have been told to appoint nodal officers for distributing the relief material. He said no relief material is being stored and they are moving directly to places after allocation. Donors can now approach entities in states directly as well if they want to provide relief material but they have to get a certificate from the state nodal officer for free cost of import of Covid relief materials as well as the authenticity of the entity. State-run logistics company Concor is transporting the relief materials to the end beneficiaries. Top government sources said that the Centre is keeping close tabs on port clearances and trying to ensure that goods meant for relief or sent directly to Covid-19 patients are not lying at ports. Although customs officers are also hit by the infection, the government is seeking to ensure smooth flow of consignments, they said. The IGST exemption given on Monday would be subject to nodal authorities, appointed by the state governments, authorising any entity, relief agency or statutory body, for free distribution of such relief material. They said goods can be imported free of cost by a state government or, any entity authorized to distribute them for free.

---||Business||Currency in circulation hits Rs 29L cr on 2nd wave||Mumbai: The unrelenting rise in currency in circulation has continued into FY22 with Indians withdrawing over Rs 57,800 crore in the first four weeks of April 2021. The second wave of the pandemic has given a renewed impetus to the ‘dash for cash’ phenomena, which was seen worldwide in the aftermath of Covid. According to Reserve Bank of India (RBI) data, currency with the public has risen to Rs 29,07,067 crore as of April 23, 2021 — an increase of Rs 7,352 crore over the previous week. On March 26, the amount had stood at Rs 28,58,547 crore. Interestingly, the hoard of cash is happening even as the use of digital channels for transactions is growing every month. While UPI crossed 2.3 billion transactions in March 2021 for a value of Rs 5 lakh crore, debit card use has also been on the rise after the lockdown was lifted. Bankers attribute this behaviour to rising insecurity, which prompts people to hold more cash at home during a lockdown despite there being fewer avenues to spend the money. According to ATM operators, although monthly withdrawals have not hit the pre-pandemic peak, depositors are not returning the money they have withdrawn, which is resulting in the hoarding of cash. Also, the average value of cash withdrawal is on the rise despite a fewer number of ATM transactions. Pre-pandemic the average withdrawal was around Rs 4,000 which has now gone up to Rs 4,500. Bankers say that the currency in circulation could rise further if the government were to introduce a cash-transfer scheme. Although most of the Jan Dhan Yojana account holders have a debit card, last years’ experience showed that the tendency among accountholders was to immediately withdraw funds from their account. In its recent report on the trend and progress of banking, the RBI has said that currency with public surged last fiscal in response to the “Covid-induced dash for cash”, while solvency issues related to a private sector bank also brought about some reassignment of deposits. The demand for cash is now prompting ATM companies to step up their investments after a period of decline. ATM numbers had been dropping in recent months following banks’ decision to rationalise their network and the inability of some white label ATM network companies to meet their targets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/currency-in-circulation-hits-rs-29l-cr-on-2nd-wave/articleshow/82377095.cms||Mayur Shetty

We have contacted the manufacturers who said the gang had not returned around 80 cylinders for refills in the past three weeks. We have traced 44 cylinders so far. We are trying to find the source from where they managed to refill them,” an investigating officer said. Police had used decoy customers to nab kingpin Jay Asutosh Mittal (39), a medicine stockist, from Lake Town. According to Enforcement Branch officers, the gang sold Remdesivir at Rs 25,000-Rs 30,000 per vial and accepted money online. The MRP of the injection is under Rs 3,000. “They quoted a price and sold to the biggest bidder,” said DC (EB) Kankan Prasad Barui. The deliveries were made near Park Street, with buyers asked to meet at pre-designated sites to hand over the drug. Altogether, 18 vials of Remdesivir have been seized. Police have approached the court to hand over the entire seized lot of 18 Remdesivir vials and oxygen cylinders to various Covid hospitals so they can be used to treat patients. The gang operated from two locations — near Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road close to Park Street and Bangur Avenue near Lake Town.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/police-bust-gang-selling-remdesivir-o2-at-a-premium/articleshow/82377081.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

And for the first time, domestic sales pipped exports which remained unchanged at Rs 25,000 crore in a truncated fiscal which saw lockdowns for nearly 2 months due to the Covid pandemic. Garment production increased 12% by volume. With nearly six lakh workers, Tirupur exports knitwear to global giants. With Covid induced lockdowns during March 2020 and sputtering restart a couple of months later, export of garments took a beating. “Domestic market turned buoyant as more Indians preferred leisure wear for their WFH, pushing the sales of T Shirts and track bottoms. On the exports front, the demand for ‘knee drop’ T shirts for women sold like hot cakes as more women combined WFH and home wear. “Knee drop was a big hit and sees continued traction among overseas buyers,” said Raja M Shanmugam, president of Tirupur Exporters Association (TEA). For the domestic market, garment makers received a price mark-up. “We don’t know if there was an increase in tag price, but large garment brands increased procurement prices by 10 to 12% while we asked for a 15% increase to compensate for the unprecedented rise in yarn prices,” he said. Remaining optimistic, TEA has projected for a 20% increase in both exports and domestic sales for the current fiscal. “While second wave of the pandemic is worrying, going by the current orders, we may see a 20% growth this year,” Shanmugam added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/garment-hub-tirupurs-local-sales-pip-exports/articleshow/82376510.cms||Rajesh Chandramouli

An order issued by the state forest department said that entry of people to all units under the department, where large congregations may take place, would be strictly regulated. Bengal has 12 zoos. Last year on March 17, the zoos across the state were shut during the first wave of Covid-19. They were re-opened in October. Not only zoos, visitors will also not be allowed in conservation reserves, wildlife sanctuaries, national parks and tiger reserves under the control of the forest department. “All eco-tourism projects and lodges shall not allow guests/visitors. Suitable steps may be taken for cancellation of bookings and refund of the amount if and where required,” the order stated. It may be noted that on April 30, the National Tiger Conservation Authority had ordered chief wildlife wardens of all states to suspend tourism inside tiger reserves, sanctuaries and national parks with immediate effect and till further notice in view of the second wave of Covid-19 in India. “In respect of parks and gardens under the department, entry of visitors will be curtailed to avoid congregations and gatherings,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/zoos-shut-wildlife-tourism-suspended/articleshow/82377094.cms||---

The RBI governor discussed the current economic situation and the extent of credit that the microfinance institutions (MFIs) were able to provide. The RBI governor also sought information on whether the companies were able to meet their funding requirements and the extent of defaults that they were seeing. MFIs have been the worst-hit segment in NBFCs with gold loans and housing being among best performers.The stress in the sector surfaced after the RBI lifted the moratorium that was introduced in March 2020 after the Covid outbreak. Recognising the key role of NBFC-MFIs in making credit accessible at grassroots level, Das stressed the RBI’s expectations in terms of the companies maintaining their business resilience and managing risks prudently. He advised NBFC-MFIs to pay focussed attention on strict adherence to fair practices code, improve customer grievance redress mechanism and strengthen their IT systems in the interest of the institutions and their customers. According to rating agency CARE, asset quality metrics across the sector will remain supported in FY21 because of the RBI’s restructuring schemes, moratorium and the revival in the economy after September 2020. For FY22, the rating agency expects some level of stress particularly in the portfolio under restructuring and those under moratorium, with the impact of these likely to be visible next year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-guv-meets-mfi-heads-to-assess-stress/articleshow/82377306.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Business||Policyholders get only 45-80% of Covid bills||CHENNAI: As the number of people hospitalised due to Covid rise, many find that they have to settle a big chunk of the bill out of their own pockets despite having health insurance. Policyholders are again caught in the crossfire between hospitals and insurers over the treatment of consumables like personal protection equipment (PPE) kits resulting in only 45% to 80% of hospital bills being recoverable by customers. For 81-year-old diabetic and hip fracture patient K Saraswathi, who was treated for Covid-19 for eight days got only Rs 56,500 reimbursed of the total Rs 1.18 lakh bill from third-party administrator Raksha. Among other things that were disallowed included Rs 17,600 for PPE claims. While insurers cite General Insurance Council (GIC) norms their argument may not hold water as IRDA has not approved any norms. “How can a hospital treat a patient without PPEs?” asked an official at the Insurance Ombudsman office which is snowed under with complaints for short-settlement. “We used to get a few cases last year, now we have 88 pending cases, 70% to 80% of which are short settlements,” the official said. For some insurers, the exclusions amount to a third of hospital bills. Liberty General officials said around 35% of the bill does not fall under the ambit of insurance coverage. Its VP and national claims manager for accident & health, Amol Sawai said, “On the industry level, the average Covid claim severity is Rs 1,40,000, the settlement severity is about Rs 95,000 of the claimed amount. We have seen almost 20% of the total bill is attributed to PPE costs.” India’s largest health insurer Star Health settles nearly 80% to 90% of claims under cashless settlement within two hours of receiving claims. S Prakash, MD of Star Health said, “One doctor who takes a round in the same PPE kit, cannot charge for each of ten patients he visits. The controversy is not in the reimbursement for PPEs, but in the number of PPEs covered. One cannot claim for ten PPEs per day. For ICUs, we allow a higher number of PPE kits compared to the ward,” he said. According to the GIC officials, the referral rate for PPE kits is Rs 1,200 per day for moderate sickness and Rs 2,000 per day for severe sickness. “We also see a spike in claims made for CT scans per person. We allow maximum two CT scans per patient,” he added. Officials at the GI Council blamed the hospitals for this situation. “Why are no directions given to hospitals on billing?” asks a council official. He points out an instance where a Tamil Nadu hospital charged Rs 14,000 for medicines, Rs 55,000 for diagnostics and Rs 50,000 for PPE besides room rent. When the insurer raised a red flag, the bill was halved to Rs 1.5 lakh. “Is it okay for hospitals to loot with such high bills, whose money are we paying? It is the public’s money. If the premium doubles next year, will anyone even think of medical insurance. If we raise our hands and give up covering medical insurance, can anyone force us to provide a cover,” the official asked. The short settlement by insurance companies is resulting in a rise in complaints at the office of Insurance Ombudsman in Chennai. “Insurers are citing some GI Council norms for claims settlement. Whatever they are saying does not hold water as IRDA has not approved any norms. How can a hospital treat a patient without PPEs?,” an official at the Insurance Ombudsman office said. Hospitals on their part blame the westernization of healthcare where insurance companies call the shots. “How can an insurance company decide on medication? A Dolo works for some while a Combiflam works for another, both these have a price differential. Now to say I will pay Dolo charges for a Combiflam or vice versa is plain stupidity. We need someone who looks at the bill and the patient and not one size fits all,” a MD and head of infectious diseases in a private hospital said. “The need is a regulator who understands medicine,” he said.

While a major demand for reducing the integrated GST on imported concentrators has been accepted, there are suggestions to simplify rules to remove the need for KYC verification or validation by authorised courier. “Shipments arrive fast but there is a risk of delays because courier operators do not start clearance till they are convinced about an individual’s KYC, which has been mandated,” said a government source. Besides, with price and demand of medicines such as Remdesivir, Favipiravir and Tocilizumab rising and black marketing rampant, companies have demanded that they should be allowed to import these drugs directly for their employees. They have suggested that provision should be made for registered companies to import 500 doses of drugs such as Remdesivir, which they will issues free of cost to their employees and vendors employees against prescription issued by doctors. “As we are experiencing an unprecedented surge in number of Covid-19 cases across the country, oxygen and essential drugs for the disease are experiencing severe shortage. Drugs such as Favipiravir, Tocilizumab & Remdesivir are used for the treatment of this disease and therefore currently in high demand. This demand is also compounded by the fear of its possible shortage in the coming days. This dearth has resulted in an opportunity for pharmaceutical vendors to black market the essential drugs several times it’s official price, leading to victims being forced to cough up the amount in desperation to save his/her kin,” said one of the representations to the department of pharmaceuticals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/cos-seek-nod-to-import-drugs-directly-for-staff/articleshow/82377223.cms||Sidhartha

While kesar mangoes have started trickling in the markets, farmers say there is a huge loss in the crop this year due to the climate change effect. The recent rain and hail have only added to the woes. Farmers fear a loss of around 40% in these three districts, which grow maximum kesar mangoes. Last year they were hit by the cyclonic condition that prevailed around the time of fruiting and later the Covid-induced lockdown. The production is likely to be low even as the area under kesar cultivation has increased to 25,000 hectares from 20,000 hectares a few years ago. Gafoor Qureshi, a progressive mango farmer who grows several varieties in his orchard near Talala in Gir-Somnath district, said, “Last year, I got about 80 tonnes of kesar, but this year I don’t expect more than 30 tonnes. The average production in Junagadh and surrounding area is nearly 40% less compared to last year.” Qureshi explained that all was good till the flowering stage in February and March, but thereafter many flowers did not convert into fruits due to climate chagne. Tushar Dhameliya, who runs farmer producers organization (FPO) in Gir-Somnath and Junagadh districts, added, “The kesar production is expected to be just half compared to last year. Besides the weather, another reason is excessive use of pesticides by the farmers. Those doing organic farming are getting consistently good yield.” Ukka Bhatti, a mango farmer in Dhari taluka of Amreli said, “I got eight tonnes yield last year, which will be down to just around 4 tonnes this season. The unseasonal rain and hail has completely destroyed the fruits on the trees.” DK Varu, head of department of fruit science at Junagadh Agriculture University (JAU) said, “The flowering was good this year, but there was a huge dropping of flowers due to vagaries of weather.” INSET Tommy Atkins adapts well The Tommy Atkins variety, which has 75% less sugar compared to other mango varieties, has been successfully grown by Junagadh’s progressive farmer Vishal Gandecha. “From just one tree which took seven years to grow, I have 20 trees now and all are yielding fruits. This purple coloured mango is good for diabetics.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rain-hail-hit-kesar-production-farmers-fear-40-loss-in-yield/articleshow/82377164.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

"A week ago, we closed the OPD. Now we are discharging non serious non-Covid patients from other wards,” superintendent Pramod K Tiwary told this newspaper on Monday. “GMCH is now a dedicated Covid hospital,” he said. The hospital has added another floor, thus augmenting Covid beds with oxygen facilities to 210. “At the moment, we already have 250 patients that include quite a few awaiting tests but showing symptoms,” Tiwary said, breathing a sigh of relief after the hospital’s oxygen stocks after falling to just a few hours support were replenished in the nick of time on Monday. “The oxygen plant at Harsiddhi is operating 24X7. It had got frozen,” he said, adding that the GMCH is getting 500 cylinders a day. One patient, the superintendent said, needed almost four cylinders of oxygen per day, being administered about 15 litres per minute. Fortunately, new daily admissions have been in single digit in the last two days, he said, while observing that patients from rural areas are increasing. “Thankfully, a few patients are also being discharged after recovery. We discharged ten such patients on Sunday,” he said. The still under-construction 850-bed GMCH has at present around 450 beds. “But we are not in a position to increase the number of Covid beds from around 200-250. We are already working to full capacity,” Tiwary said, reasoning, “That would require approximately 2000 oxygen cylinders per day.” Though the GMCH has been declared to be a dedicated Covid hospital, the hospital administration has decided to continue providing service to trauma and obstetric patients. “Trauma cases like injuries and burns and obstetric cases inflow of full term pregnant women are emergency services and we shall continue to attend to such cases,” the superintendent said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bettiah-hospital-sees-increase-in-cov-patients-from-rural-areas/articleshow/82376051.cms||Abhay Mohan Jha

Speaking to reporters, the district collector confirmed that the media reports and complaints from relatives of the patients were true. “Some of the senior doctors are found to be absenting themselves from Covid-19 duties and are forcing their juniors to attend to patients which is unfortunate and cannot be tolerated.

He also asked companies to bear the cost of not sending employees out and said that there was a need to plan for a third wave. The Kotak Mahindra Bank chief said that the RBI had already lent its balance sheet by announcing a buy-back programme for government securities, however, more could be done given the circumstances. Kotak Mahindra Bank has told employees not to come to work for a week unless they are part of essential services and authorised by senior managers to leave home, he said. During the period, the bank would operate branches with minimal staff. Kotak, who is also president of Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), followed up his call for restriction on economic activity to prevent Covid transmission, saying that industry should voluntarily curtail all non-essential economic activity requiring physical presence of employees at the workplace for the next two weeks. He said that auto majors like Maruti Suzuki, Hero MotoCorp, JCB India, MG Motor, Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India have halted production and companies like TCS and Kotak Bank have adopted work-from-home. “In spite of all efforts, the overall numbers continue to rise. The healthcare system and medical personnel are stretched to the limit and exhausted. Measures to break the chain of transmission are of paramount importance to mitigate human tragedy and loss of lives, alongside augmenting health infrastructure and medical supplies”, said Kotak. Kotak Mahindra Bank on Monday reported a net profit of Rs 1,682 crore for the fourth quarter — a 33% increase over Rs 1,267 crore in the year-ago period. For FY21,the bank reported a net profit of Rs 6,965 crore — a 15% increase over Rs 5,947 crore in FY20. The bank’s loans were up less than 2% at Rs 2.2 lakh crore, while deposits rose 6.8% to 2.8 lakh crore. Consolidated net profit for FY21 increased to Rs 9,990 crore from Rs 8,593 crore in FY20, up 16% and for Q4FY21, the consolidated profit rose to Rs 2,589 crore from Rs 1,905 crore in Q4FY20, up 36%. On succession planning, Kotak said that he would be in office until end of 2023 when his current term ends. Responding to a question on his bank’s interest in Citi’s retail business, which is on the block, Kotak said that the bank was looking at a large number of acquisitions opportunities, but preferred to chug along rather than “make headlines”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/kotak-calls-for-rbi-to-expand-balance-sheet/articleshow/82377268.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Business||RIL pays bonuses to over 2 lakh employees for FY21||Mumbai: Reliance Industries (RIL), India’s biggest company in terms of market value, has rolled out bonus/variable payout to its over 2 lakh employees for fiscal 2021. The bonus payout was cited in a company note to employees on Monday. The move comes after RIL reported a 35% growth in profit to Rs 53,739 crore in 2020-21, the first full financial year of the coronavirus epidemic. The variable payout was made to employees of its five divisions including oil-to-chemicals (O2C) and consumer (retail & telecom). RIL added more than 75,000 people to the consumer business in fiscal 2021, which was among the large hires in corporate India. During the same year, the company’s employee benefits expenses increased 5% to Rs 14,817 crore. Consumer business contributed significantly to RIL’s earnings on the back of people increasingly shopping online and using data for work and otherwise amid the pandemic. But O2C’s contribution declined due to demand contraction for major products, including jet fuel. In April 2020, RIL had cut salaries of O2C employees earning more than Rs 15 lakh annually by 10% in the wake of the “adverse impact” of Covid on the division. Annual bonus/performance-linked incentives, which are normally paid in the first quarter of a year, were also deferred. At that time, RIL said that its chairman Mukesh Ambani would forgo his entire compensation for fiscal 2021. Ambani’s salary in fiscal 2019 was Rs 15 crore, which had remained constant for 11 consecutive years. However, six months later, RIL reversed the 10% cut in salary retrospectively from April 2020 and paid bonuses that were deferred to the O2C employees. Operating profit of O2C, the traditional business of RIL, declined 29% to Rs 38,170 crore. In its latest earnings presentation, RIL said oil demand recovery in 2021 will be lower to the level in 2019, the year before Covid hit India. It added that lockdowns with rising coronavirus cases in India may impact demand growth. Additionally, supply overhang coupled with higher exports from China are challenges for its O2C business.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ril-pays-bonuses-to-over-2-lakh-employees-for-fy21/articleshow/82377317.cms||Reeba Zachariah
---||Kolkata||Death cert delay: Cov bodies lie at homes for hours||Kolkata: A 39-year-old woman and a 50-year-old man died of Covid in their south Kolkata homes on Sunday. Cremating the bodies, however, was a challenge — firstly, owing to difficulty in getting death certificates (since both had died at home) and secondly, due to the KMC helplines not responding to calls. The woman, Sandhya Mahato, living alone in a house on Fern Road died on Sunday after displaying Covid symptoms. Police clad in PPE had to break open the main door to recover the body after being alerted by neighbours. Blood was drawn from the body to conduct a rapid antigen test at MR Bangur Hospital to ascertain if the woman in deed had Covid. Following a positive report, police arranged for the body to be transported to a Covid-designated crematorium. In the other instance, which was reported from Behala’s Sakherbazar, an 80-year-old man, Maniklal Chatterjee, a retired state government official, had to wait for 13 hours before the body of his son could be sent to the crematorium. The deceased, Prabir, a well-known trader in the area, died of Covid at home after his condition deteriorated. A routine test at a hospital after he got admitted for a hernia operation revealed that he was Covid positive. But he could not be admitted there as the hospital did not have a Covid unit. Back home, as his condition began to deteriorate, he consulted a telemedicine doctor and took what was prescribed. On Sunday, he fell while going to the bathroom. His father tried to contact doctors, but failed. Repeated calls to the KMC helpline number proved futile as no one responded. “In both cases, there was also a problem with issuing death certificates. The local OC or the former councillor has to convince local doctors to cooperate. This takes time. Arranging KMC hearses also takes time,” said an officer at Lalbazar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/death-cert-delay-cov-bodies-lie-at-homes-for-hours/articleshow/82377089.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Business||Fintech banking to help serve every Indian||By Dinesh KharaFintech in its broadest sense refers to the use of technology to deliver financial services. The technology transformation journey of Indian banks spans over three decades, starting in the mid-1990s. With the adoption of core banking solutions, to deployment of ATMs and scaling of mobile app-based banking, the technology adoption in Indian lenders has come a long way, in the process, making banks more fintechs in orientation. Even some NBFCs are now attempting this fintech journey, using technology engine as the key differentiator. On the other hand, ‘Tech Fins’ are those who start with technology and data and add financial services to their value-chain. Many non-financial startups in India are also taking this route and addition of payments or wallets is the financial add-on in their business model. What have banks like State Bank of India (SBI) achieved that shaped their evolution into fintechs? A use-based classification of fintech will include deployment of technology in customer interface, data security and operations and risk-management function of banks. In each of these areas, the SBI experience is one of using technology that is either developed in-house or in collaboration with technology partners. The purpose ranges from bringing efficiency in operations, to monitoring and finally to data-driven decision making. At the customer interface level, SBI’s flagship YONO app has taken the lead position with market share just touching a quarter. The account opening functionality of the app has achieved 91% migration with around 22,000 accounts opened on an average daily. The impact of the app is also visible with branches seeing share of digital transaction approaching 80% with a whole bank average of around 67%. In operations, the efforts are on to reduce the delivery time using technology. We are in the process of digitising the end-to-end process of retail loans to improve the efficiencies in delivery including an integrated retail loan management system. The YONO app already has a pre-approved personal loan functionality, which presently generates over 4,500 loans daily. In the area of data-driven decision making, we have taken a number of initiatives. Loan monitoring activity has been mostly digitalised with real-time visibility of key areas including stressed assets, pending legal cases, business metrics and ATM outages. An in-house analytics team uses AI models for generating early warning indicators for various loan segments, fraud alerts and risk assessment. With the RBI encouraging a less-cash economy by emphasising innovation through sandboxes, the opportunity for banks to deepen the fintech-isation process only gains strength. Thus ABCD — AI, blockchain, cloud and data — will be the catalyst in the transformation process. The advantage of traditional banks becoming fintechs is that it reduces the probability of regulatory blind spots thus protecting financial stability. The rollout of the national blockchain policy, liberalisation of geospatial data and much needed legal framework on cryptocurrency and data protection will also go a long way in managing business and other risks more efficiently. The front and back offices today interact through the bridge of technology, creating greater synergies. Today, all discussions, be it at the ground level or in the board room, start and end with technology. What we strive for is bringing not just an impersonal technology platform but a platform as a service. The true challenge lies in preserving the relational aspect of financial services while delivering value at efficiency through smart use of technology. (The author is chairman, SBI.

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: His bamboo biz is booming, but he’s not a happy man||AHMEDABAD: A group of about 22 persons work tirelessly at a large workshop in Shahpur area of the city as they cut dried bamboo stems into three-feet pieces and make piles on Monday evening. “The demand for it has not ceased for the past one month. We are making about 6,000-odd pieces a day, which gets consumed in two to three days. Earlier, the stock would last for 20 days or more. The business is booming,” says Govind Rathod, 54, proprietor of the business. His ‘business’ is to supply the bamboos used to make bier (nanami in Gujarati, arthi in Hindi) to carry a dead body to the crematorium for the last rites. According to the Hindu rituals, the body is tied to the bier, which is then carried by four persons, without which the last rites are considered incomplete. As the city has recorded a major rise in mortality, the demand for biers has also shot up. Considering each bier takes about 10 horizontal and two vertical pieces, Rathod’s workshop, at 6,000 pieces, creates raw material for 600-odd biers which is then supplied to smaller traders across the city near crematoriums. “The bamboo pieces are also used to keep the body on the frame inside the CNG furnace. Thus, we are also supplying a large quantity to AMC,” said Rathod. “The raw material primarily comes from south Gujarat. To meet the increased demand, we have also created a workshop at Naroda.” But Rathod says that he is not happy with the boom in business. “Who can be? I lost my aunt in the pandemic. Every day, we hear about someone’s illness or death. We just pray to God to free us from this calamity. It’s our ancestral business, and I’m not doing it for profit. I’m supplying it to the smaller traders and AMC covering my cost,” he said. On the brighter side, he said that it’s his tireless work to ensure that the dead get the proper send-off, his family including five daughters and a son have not even got sick once in the past one year. “I see it as an omen to extend my help to those in need. Bamboo is considered crucial for a person’s last journey and I become a part of that journey in some way for many citizens,” says Rathod. Narrating a recent incident, Rathod said that a man in an expensive car came searching for the bier for his deceased mother at 10 pm. “He had searched everywhere but due to night curfew, he could not get it from anywhere. Eventually, someone pointed him to us and we made him one. He offered us triple the money, but we refused, considering it as a humanitarian work. He cried, saying that all his money cannot buy his mother’s life or the bier,” recounts Rathod.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/his-bamboo-biz-is-booming-but-hes-not-a-happy-man/articleshow/82377087.cms||---

SHO D K Roy said an FIR had been lodged against four unknown persons. “Raids have been going on to nab the culprits,” he said. According to police sources, the incident took place when the manager, Parmnand Singh, was on the way to the bank on his motorcycle. After 4km from his business premises at Karawandia, four criminals on two motorcycles intercepted him near Bansa village and tried to snatch the bag containing the cash. One of the criminals tried to open fire when Singh resisted, but three bullets misfired, following which the criminals assaulted the manager badly and fled with the cash.

---||Patna||As opposition hails Mamata, Kushwaha’s ‘Chakravyuh’ tweet creates buzz||PATNA:The congratulatory message tweeted by JD(U) parliamentary board chairman Upendra Kushwaha on Sunday to West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee for leading her party to a spectacular win in the assembly election has seemingly unbolted the doors of Bihar politics to possible new scenarios in the future. The one-line tweet of Kushwaha, issued on Sunday, said, "Many congratulations to Mamata Ji for registering a spectacular win once again by breaking the heavy ‘chakravyuh’ set against her." In itself, Kushwaha’s tweet might have been taken as a tweet by one politician to another, but the use of the metaphor ‘Chakravyuh’ by him has made all the difference, observers felt. In the process, Kushwaha’s tweet has seemingly taken the form of a guided missile which is also addressed to politicians and parties who matter in Bihar and are interested in looking beyond the present limits around them, observers felt. Implicitly, Kushwaha has pointed to the likely scope for new permutations and combinations. For, the word ‘chakravyuh’ has taken a two-fold meaning. One, it points to Mamata fight against BJP whose charge was led by PM Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah, aided by Union ministers, BJP CMs from UP and Madhya Pradesh, and the party president J P Nada. Second, there were parties such as Congress, Left, ISF and AIMIM led by Asaduddin Owaisi to checkmate her moves. Kushwaha’s tweet also points to the Bihar scene, where the then JD(U) national president and CM Nitish Kumar, even though a part of the NDA, was virtually trapped in a ‘Chakravyuh’ that, as the perception goes, and the circumstances lend credence, was set by BJP, during the October-November assembly election last year that was the first in the country to be held amid the pandemic. From outside the NDA, LJP chief Chirag Paswan, calling himself ‘Hanuman’ and treating PM Narendra Modi as his ‘Ram,’ fielded candidates mostly against JD(U) to cut slices of votes from it. JD(U) could win only 43 of the 122 seats and its partner HAM(S) led by former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi contested against the grand alliance comprising RJD, Congress, and three Left parties – CPI(ML), CPI and CPM. Consequently, BJP became the bigger partner in the NDA by winning 74 assembly seats. The multi-pronged import of Kushwaha’s tweet would become amply clear when seen relative to the congratulatory message of Nitish for Mamata issued on Monday with utmost caution and making it as formal as it could get. In his tweet, Nitish did not name Mamata. "My heartfelt congratulations and best wishes to the TMC for getting victory third time in the West Bengal assembly elections." But what he left unsaid, Kushwaha had done on Sunday. As if to complement Kushwaha, RJD national president Lalu Prasad, now out of jail, hailed the victory of Mamata and also thanked the people of West Bengal who "wholeheartedly voted for Didi and did not fall for vitriolic & divisive propaganda of BJP". Similarly, the leader of opposition and RJD face Tejashwi Prasad Yadav referred to the "critical circumstances facing the country today," and noted that the ‘Mamatamayi (euphemism for both Mamata and kindness)’ people of West Bengal reposed their faith in CM Mamata Banerjee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/as-oppn-hails-mamata-kushwahas-chakravyuh-tweet-creates-buzz/articleshow/82376015.cms||Abhay Singh

While keeping the vote bank intact after coming to power is an uphill task as many start deserting the ruling party or the opposition rakes up various issues, the Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy-led YSRC has improved its margin with TDP by over nine per cent in the Tirupati Lok Sabha by-election. The chief minister had not addressed even a single meeting during the Tirupati campaign while TDP supremo Chandrababu Naidu and his son Lokesh spent close to one week in the campaign. Analysts initially were of the opinion that YSRC winning 85 per cent seats in the assembly and Lok Sabha elections in 2019 would be a one-time wonder that could primarily be attributed to the shortcomings of the then incumbent government. However, YSRC’s performance in successive elections has shown that the 2019 mandate was a positive vote in its favour. The chief minister went ahead with implementation of Nava Rathnalu (promises made before the polls) despite the state facing financial troubles. For the first-time, the state government prepared a calendar to implement welfare programmes and released financial assistance for almost every section of society. The release of funds was not delayed despite the state losing over Rs 20,000 crore revenue due to Covid-19 last fiscal. The government also distributed house sites to over 31 lakh families in the state. “The expansion of Aarogyasri, renovation of public schools, grant of financial assistance under Amma Vodi, sanction of three pairs of uniform, shoes, books and bag under Jagananna Vidya Deevena, reimbursement of college tuition fees, hostel and mess charges has made Y S Jagan the people’s favourite,” said Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy, YSRC general secretary and advisor to the government. Ramakrishna Reddy said the government is covering nearly a population of nearly four crore in the state through its welfare schemes. YSRC bagged 81 per cent of seats in the recent village panchayat elections while TDP lost Kuppam panchayat, the native place of party chief N Chandrababu Naidu. TDP’s performance further deteriorated with the party drawing almost a blank in municipal elections. “Tirupati by-election has proved that TDP has no future in the state. People are firmly with Y S Jagan,” said MP Mopidevi Venkata Ramana. YSRC’s vote share in all seven assembly segments of Tirupati Lok Sabha constituency has gone up by nearly six per cent. The improvement of the party’ vote tally even two years after coming to power might encourage the CM to continue his welfare agenda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/tirupati-win-gives-impetus-to-ysrcs-welfare-agenda/articleshow/82376276.cms||Samdani MN

The proposed 300-bed make-shift Covid hospital started with 90 beds, including 50 for ICU. The remaining beds will be added in a phased manner. The state had told private hospitals to take up government properties like stadiums and other spaces and transform them into hospitals to tide over the infrastructure crisis in the wake of the second Covid wave. Charnock Hospitals had bid for Haj House and had been working to covert the building into a hospital to run on a PPP model. “This PPP initiative taken up by the Bengal government is a powerful tool in augmenting bed numbers. We will be taking in both government and private patients,” said Prashant Sharma, MD, Charnock Hospitals. Equipped with bed monitors, ventilators, HFNC, BiPap machines and investigative test facilities, like X-ray and USG, the temporary hospital will also have facilities for collection of swab samples from suspected Covid patients. But the RT-PCR test and other advanced imaging will be done at its main unit off VIP Road. Since an liquid medical oxygen (LMO) plant is yet to be set up, the hospital has procured 100 oxygen cylinders for now. “The LMO plant and oxygen pipeline is expected to be functional by May 15. We will keep adding beds as this work progresses. We intend to have 100 ICU beds out of the proposed 300,” said Sharma. Entrepreneurs of Kolkata (EOK), an organization headed by Sagar Daryani, founder of Wow! Momo, has promised to pump in Rs 3 crore for purchase of medical equipment. “EOK is glad to support Charnock Hospitals in this initiative. We request more people to come forward and contribute,” said Daryani. Since the Haj House is a replica of a hospital set-up and does not have AC, the hospital has decided to keep an economical rate for patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/haj-house-covid-facility-starts-ops/articleshow/82377070.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The bank on Monday reported its first full year profits after five years with a four-fold jump in Q4 net profit to Rs 512 crore from Rs 135 crore in the previous year. Although the tax refund gains were more than the profit, the bank’s MD & CEO Rakesh Sharma said that the entire refund amount has been used for making accelerated provisioning as a prudent measure. “The tax refund was of Rs 2,305 crore. Of which the interest component was Rs 1,308 crore, which has gone into income part and has been taken for provision,” he said. A large chunk of the tax refund has been used to make provisions for bad loans under the Stressed Asset Stabilisation Fund– a bad-bank like entity that was created to house the non-performing assets of Industrial Development Bank of India when it underwent a reverse merger with its subsidiary IDBI Bank. Sharma said that the SASF still had Rs 2,700 crore of bad loans which had to be provided for if they were not recovered in three years. Sharma said that prospects for the bank had improved as it has been removed from RBI’s prompt corrective action framework which placed lending restrictions on the bank. “We will take a calibrated approach to growing our loans. We are looking at 8-10% growth in corporate loans and 10-12% growth in retail. Overall we are looking at a 10% growth in loans,” said Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/idbi-bank-provides-for-npas-with-tax-refund/articleshow/82377284.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ahmedabad||Left to own devices: Patients bring even ventilators to hosps||Ahmedabad: As doctors face the distressing duty of telling Covid patients’ kin that ICU-ventilator beds are not available, the relatives are braving extraordinary struggles to organize the lifesaving machines on their own. It is stupendously difficult for common people to get such specialized equipment, but the despair-powered hunt gives the only chance to save their seriously ill kin. The benevolence of strangers is coming as life support, literally, as most machines are lent by unrelated people to ward off human tragedies. Manish Patel, an Ahmedabad resident, undertook the tortuous journey of managing medicines, oxygen, buying a BiPAP machine, and finally borrowing a ventilator to ensure the survival of his wife’s brother, Pawan Patel. Pawan is only 26. “I decided to fight hard for his life. For four days, I queued up for oxygen cylinders,” says Manish. “When his saturation dipped further, I bought a BiPAP machine and planned one step farther by calling all friends and acquaintances to organize a ventilator.” The Patels found a bed at a city-based heart hospital but all their machines were serving patients. “I promptly got a ventilator from my friend’s house who had bought it for his father's critical care,” Manish says. The ventilator has been put on standby as Pawan’s condition has stabilized. Manish says he is ready to lend the BiPAP machine to anyone in need. Experts say as a thumb rule, out of 100 admitted patients of Covid-19, 20 would require ICU and out of 20, 8 would require ventilator. "But during this wave, the number is more than 25% for ICU requirements and 8 to 10% of that number for ventilators. With exponential rise in cases, the numbers have also skyrocketed,” said a senior pulmonologist based in Ahmedabad. “Oxygen beds can be arranged or prepared with some efforts, but it’s really difficult to get an ICU or ventilator bed. The reason is also the relatively longer stay of the patients. For Ahmedabad, the figure hovers around 7 to 10 days.” Thus, the first instinct of the caregiving doctors is to prevent the patients from going on ventilator, as even today the mortality rate is as high as 40-50% for the patients on ventilators in the city, said experts. Hospital administrators say that citizens are investing their full might into the war against Covid. “In four instances, patients brought ventilators to the hospital when all our machines were occupied,” says a hospital chief. "Once a hospital ventilator is available, we put a patient on it. But the gritty effort people are demonstrating now to save lives is unparalleled.” Strangers are helping in kin in distress. Mumbai-based Bijoy Balappan says a good Samaritan loaned him ventilator for his 73-year-old father, T S Balappan who developed lung complications though his RT-PCR test was negative. His father, an Amdavadi, is the general secretary of Asia Charitable Trust and hundreds of people in his network stuck to their phones to get him an ambulance, find a hospital, and later secure a ventilator. “My father’s condition has stabilized and we will return the life-saving machine shortly. I thank God for this miracle.” In another case, a paramedic from a village brought a ventilator with a critically ill patient after getting it sanctioned from a local hospital. Dr Bharat Gadhvi, the president of Ahmedabad Hospitals & Nursing Homes Association (AHNA), said that ventilator beds have been extremely scarce. “We have seen patients getting ventilators which may not be of great quality,” Dr Gadhvi says. “We have also seen people offering to donate ventilators if we assure them that their referred patients will get two beds. Of course, we cannot accept donations on such terms.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/left-to-own-devices-patients-bring-even-ventilators-to-hosps/articleshow/82377128.cms||Radha Sharma

According to PU registrar Manoj Kumar Mishra, students should be informed about the schedule of online classes to be held and the details of teachers engaging classes should also be furnished by the heads of institutions to the registrar. PU office and all other wings would now reopen on June 1 after the vacation. Meanwhile, appreciating the chancellor’s decision to advance the summer vacation in view of the alarming surge in Covid-19 cases, All India Federation of University and College Teachers’ Organisations’ secretary Arun Kumar has urged the Union HRD ministry and the UGC to shut all the educational institutions, right from primary to university level, for a month in view of the surging cases of Covid-19 across the country. In an SOS to the HRD ministry, Kumar said education is important, but life is even more important. Saving the lives of people must be the topmost priority of any government and, hence, schools and colleges should not be kept open at this critical juncture, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/pu-to-hold-online-classes-during-summer-vacation/articleshow/82376217.cms||B K Mishra

The TDP leader was being treated at a corporate hospital in Vizag city after testing positive for Covid-19 last month. He had, however, tested negative a few days ago but a lung infection persisted, his son Venkat said. The 69-year-old Sabbam Hari was one of the prominent political personalities of north Andhra Pradesh and a noted political analyst. After testing positive for the virus, he was admitted to a hospital in Vizag city on April 15. He was placed on ventilator support but succumbed on Monday afternoon. Sabbam Hari is survived by his two daughters and a son. His wife died a few years ago following an illness. Sabbam Hari was instrumental for several of the development activities in the city, including setting up of the Swarna Bharathi indoor stadium and statues of prominent personalities along the beach road. Born on June 1, 1952 at Tagarapuvalasa in Vizag city, Sabbam Hari started his career in politics in the Congress party. He worked as a Visakha Yuvajana Congress leader in 1985 and was elected as mayor of VMC in 1995. He contested for Parliament in 2009 on a Congress ticket and won from Anakapalle constituency.

---||Patna||Attendants go on rampage in Sasaram Sadar hospital||SASARAM: Relatives of a patient went on a rampage and damaged valuable equipment in the Covid-19 dedicated ward of Sasaram Sadar hospital Monday morning in protest against his death due to alleged failure of the doctor on duty to attend him on time. The relatives also allegedly assaulted the doctor and paramedical staff. The police arrested one person in this connection. Sasaram additional sub-divisional magistrate (ASDM) P Kuraishi confirmed the incident. Besides other equipment, about 75 oxygen flow meters were damaged. Now, the 84 beds in the Covid dedicated ward have only 12 functional oxygen flow meters. The local health administration has requested the State Health Society for supply of at least 75 oxygen flow meters so that supply of oxygen could be restored to the patients in the ward. Pintu Singh, a relative of the deceased, alleged that he brought the patient to the Covid ward on Monday morning, but despite their earnest requests, the doctor on duty did not attend him, causing his death in the ward. Additional chief medical officer (ACMO) of the hospital Dr K N Tiwary denied the allegations, saying the “patient was brought dead”. Meanwhile, Rohtas district has registered total 167 Covid deaths and more than 2400 active cases within one month. Though the recently declared three private nursing homes at Sasaram as dedicated Covid care facilities have become functional from Saturday, the Covid patients are advised to come with their own oxygen cylinders as these nursing homes have no proper facility of oxygen. The owner of a nursing home said on the condition of anonymity that their request to the administration failed to get oxygen. “We have been left with no option but to ask the attendant to arrange oxygen for proper treatment of their patients,” he said. Vijay Kumar, a contractor of Sasaram, lamented, “I am running from pillar to post for the last two days for arranging oxygen as a dedicated care private hospital agreed to admit my mother only when I promised to provide it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/attendants-go-on-rampage-in-sasaram-sadar-hospital/articleshow/82376030.cms||Alok Chamaria
---||Patna||RJD, JD(U) draw a blank in Assam, Kerala and Bengal||PATNA: The leading political parties of Bihar -- JDU and RJD- failed to open their account in any of the three states Assam, Kerala and West Bengal, where they contested the just-concluded assembly polls. While Nitish Kumar's JDU contested solo in Assam and West Bengal, the Lalu Prasad-led RJD contested only one seat in Assam as an ally of the Congress-led eight-party ‘Mahajot’ (grand alliance) and two seats in Kerala on its own. The RJD did not contest any seat in West Bengal. The party had extended its “unconditional support” to Mamata Banerjee-led TMC to check the split of anti-saffron votes to ensure the defeat of BJP. Except for RJD candidate Hira Devi, who secured 13,283 votes (10.17% of polled votes) in Assam’s Tinsukia constituency, none of JDU or RJD candidates in the three states could save their deposits. Bihar’s ruling JD(U) had put up its candidates in 37 assembly constituencies, out of a total 126, in Assam. Though nearly half a dozen senior leaders of the party, including Bihar’s rural development minister Shrawan Kumar, campaigned in different constituencies, the RCP Singh-led party could not garner a “noteworthy” number of votes in any of the 37 seats. In many seats, JD(U) candidates could not bag even 1,000 votes. The JD(U) performance in Assam can be gauged from the fact that the party’s biggest leader, its state unit convenor Samsul Alam, could bag only 478 votes in the Rupohihat constituency. Alam had earlier claimed to TOI that he was giving a tough contest to his rivals in Rupohihat. Around a week before the first phase of polling in Assam, JD(U) national secretary and party in charge for the northeast, Sanjay Verma, had told TOI that his party’s candidates were giving a good contest in two of the six seats in the first phase. “Our candidates-- Shahnaz Begum in Dhing and Anupam Baruah in Batadroba - are giving a tough fight to their rivals,” Verma had told TOI. In Dhing, the JD(U) candidate bagged only 767 votes. In Batadroba, it got 815 votes. TOI tried to take the JD(U) leaders’ view over the party’s poor performance in Assam. But neither Verma nor Alam picked up any of the several calls made by this reporter on Monday. In West Bengal, JD(U) contested around 20 seats. The party is yet to officially release the number of seats it fought in West Bengal. None of its candidates could bring more than 2,000 votes in any of the constituencies in West Bengal. JD(U)’s former West Bengal state president Ashoke Das told TOI on Monday that the party contested 17 seats on the ‘Arrow’ symbol while it supported Independents in another three seats. “JD(U) candidate Raj Kumar Paswan bagged 1,612 votes in Raniganj constituency. It is the highest vote the JD(U) got in a constituency in West Bengal,” Das claimed. Similar was the performance of RJD in Kerala. The party contested two seats. It got only 339 votes in the Ranni seat and just 172 votes in the Kundara seat in Kerala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rjd-jdu-draw-a-blank-in-assam-kerala-and-bengal/articleshow/82375976.cms||Madan Kumar

Prasad also gave credit to DM Udayan Mishra for strengthening the healthcare facilities in the district as well as making 200 beds functional for Covid patients in the town. An agency at Katihar has been tagged with a firm at Bhagalpur for supply of oxygen, causing delay sometimes. When Prasad’s attention was drawn towards this, he instructed the Bhagalpur and Purnia DMs to provide all support to Katihar administration in this regard. Barari MLA Vijay Kumar Singh urged the deputy CM to ensure uninterrupted and regular supply of Remdesivir to critically ill Covid patients. District programme manager Manish Kumar said at least 264 patients recovered from Corona on Sunday. “At least 64 Covid patients in the district are on oxygen support,” said Kumar, adding, “Around 8-10 patients had been referred to Madhepura so far.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/200-more-beds-in-katihar-for-cov-patients-dy-cm/articleshow/82376062.cms||---

Its medical superintendent Dr Manish Mandal said the number of beds for Covid patients was being increased in phases after ensuring all the required medical facilities. In addition to the existing facilities in government and private hospitals, four dedicated Covid healthcare centres (DCHCs) with a total 532 beds have come up in the state capital. While 432 beds are ready for admitting patients, the remaining 100 would become functional within three days. Patna DM Dr Chandrasekhar Singh on Monday said 112 beds in the Rajendra Nagar eye superspecialty hospital have been made functional for Covid patients. Four patients were already admitted there. The Patliputra Sports Complex at Kankarbagh has been turned into makeshift Covid care facility with 115 beds, including 84 with oxygen support. It also became functional on Monday. The 162-bed healthcare facility is already functional in Hotel Ashoka Patliputra. The DM said while 100 beds in the ESIC hospital, Bihta, have already become functional and over 25 patients were admitted, 100 more beds were slated to get ready in three days. Then the number of new beds would increase to 674. A 105-bed DCHC for judicial officers set up on the Hardinge Road has also become functional with admission of three patients, he said. “These DCHCs would help a large number of Covid patients with mild and moderate symptoms to recover under the care of doctors and paramedical staff. The patients with serious complications would be referred to higher hospitals like AIIMS, PMCH or dedicated Covid hospitals like NMCH and IGIMS,” the DM said. Meanwhile, following a direction from the health department, the PMCH administration also started increasing the number of beds for Covid patients. Patna civil surgeon Dr Vibha Kumari said doctors and nursing staff from additional primary health centres of the district have been deputed at these DCHCs. As these facilities are new, the number of patients admitted there was very low. In Rajendra Nagar hospital , only four patients were admitted till evening, she said. Hospitals and more beds IGIMS -- 142 R Ng hosp - 112 Patliputra Sports Complex - 115 Hardinge Road DCHC - 105 ESI Hospital, Bihta -- 100 (100 more beds to be ready soon) Total functional 574||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/574-new-covid-beds-made-functional-at-city-hospitals/articleshow/82376152.cms||VK Tripathi

DM Chandrashekhar Singh, along with other officials concerned inspected the two sites. Earlier on Sunday, the Patna district administration had deployed magistrates, police officials and cops to enforce the timely closure of the big ‘mandis’ located at Digha, Bazar Samiti, Rajendra Nagar, Mithapur, Marufganj Kirana market and Malsalami wholesale market by 4pm, because the coronavirus pandemic has become virulent and also reached a critical stage in the district. Besides the local purchasers, people from other districts also gather at the wholesale markets and aid in the spread and transmission of Coronavirus, the district administration order said. The Sunday order has also designated the magistrates and aligned policemen to enforce the closure of the market and also the staggering or the shifting of the ‘mandis’ to more spacious places. The wholesale dealers in vegetables and fruits have also been shifted to the open ground of Food Corporation of India (FCI). Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) had been asked to level the ground and make it plain by Monday. Similarly, the vegetable and fruit sellers of Rajendra Nagar and Kankarbagh have been shifted to Rainbow Maidan. These mandis would remain open from 7am to 4 pm, as the general curfew will remain in force from 6pm to 6am. The order has noted that the mobile ‘thelas’ selling vegetables and fruits would remain in operation till 6pm in the colonies. Further, the designated magistrates and police personnel will ensure that the sellers of various items maintain six feet social distancing among them, besides wearing masks.

This facility, being set up on the youth hostel premises of the stadium, will have provisions for oxygen. However, there won’t be any HDU or ICU beds as such. “We are trying to work out a process so that we can use this facility as a step-down unit where patients who are getting better and won’t be needing critical care or O2 support will be transferred. These beds may also be used like a general isolation ward. It is scheduled to be operational from this Friday, starting with 50 beds,” said an AMRI Hospital spokesperson. Utilization of some portion of Salt Lake stadium as a safe house had been planned by the North 24 Parganas district health authorities with the rapid surge of Covid cases in Bidhannagar and its adjacent areas. The district administration was asked to take up the issue with the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) authorities to work on the details. The New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) is also planning to open a 30-bed safe house in Action Area III by next week. “The safe-house facility is being planned to be set up on two floors of the NBCC building where the health department will also be running a safe-house facility. The plan is to club the NKDA-run and the state health department-operated facilities together for better management,” said an NKDA official. The NBCC building in New Town was being used as a safe house during the lockdown last year. In the two-storey building in Action Area II which was used as a 20-bed safe house last year, and later as a vaccination centre earlier this year, the authorities are ascertaining if an oxygen tent facility could be set up through the public-private-partnership (PPP) mode. “We are working on the plan. With huge demand of oxygen and hospital beds, having an oxygen tent would benefit Covid patients who are in urgent need,” said an official. BMC authorities are working on plans to set up more safe houses in Salt Lake and Rajarhat. The adjacent South Dum Dum Municipality authorities have already opened a 40-bed safe house in the civic body-run Rabindra Bhavan complex.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/50-bed-cov-unit-to-open-at-salt-lake-stadium-this-weekend/articleshow/82377061.cms||Suman Chakraborti

He also asked the officials to speed up the process of procurement of oxygen concentrators to meet the Covid patients’ demands. The CM was holding a review meeting on Covid management on Monday. Gehlot said the medical and health department along with UDH and industry should coordinate in the setting up of the plants. UDH minister Shanti Dhariwal said that his department is exploring the possibility of setting up plants in major cities and under UITs. He added that land has been identified at some places. He said in such places work orders will be issued soon. Health minister Raghu Sharma suggested that the plants be set up close to hospitals to reduce transportation time. He said oxygen could be supplied by pipelines to hospitals. Chief secretary Niranjan Arya said the government was able to get some nitrogen and LNG tankers which have been converted into oxygen tankers and is being pressed into service to transport medical oxygen.

---||Vijayawada||Court reserves orders on Sangam Dairy management plea||VIJAYAWADA: The high court on Monday reserved orders in the petitions filed by the present directors of Sangam Dairy challenging the orders of the state government to take over the management of the dairy. They had argued that the state government’s decision was without jurisdiction and illegal. The state government had issued a GO on April 27 revoking the transfer of management as terms of that transfer were violated and misappropriation of government assets took place in the process of turning a cooperative society into a producer company. Arguing on behalf of the petitioners, senior counsel B Adinarayana Rao said the state government did not have any power to take over the management of the dairy on the premise of public interest. He said the conversion of the cooperative society into a mutually aided cooperative society and then into a company was done in accordance with law. He further argued that if the government’s contention was about alleged misappropriation of assets, it can contend before appropriate courts to recover the same. He said the state government occupied the dairy by claiming ownership where its ownership is still a subject matter of adjudication. He said the dairy management requires expertise and if it is given to an officer sans such expertise, the entire system will crumble. Arguing on behalf of the government, advocate general S Sriram said the land transfer to the trust from Sangam Dairy was done based on a resolution in 1994 when it was still a cooperative society. When it was still a cooperative society, approval of the government was necessary to transfer the assets which never acquired. He further argued that when the cooperative society is converted into a mutually aided cooperative society through which the state government transferred the management of the assets of the dairy, they should return the loans and assistance of the government and an MoU should be entered into with the government, if holding any assets. Though the share capital amount that the state government infused in 1978 was returned, they neither returned the assets in which the state government has a stake nor entered into an MoU. Further, the state government has only transferred the management of its assets with certain guidelines, and when the terms of that transfer were violated, the same transfer of management is being revoked. Upon hearing both sides, Justice D V S S Somayajulu reserved orders. The senior counsel for the petitioners argued that the government did not have any power to take over the management of the dairy on the premise of public interest||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/court-reserves-orders-on-sangam-dairy-mgmt-plea/articleshow/82376092.cms||Srikanth Aluri

The telemedicine cell is set up in Sangli Civil Hospital. Doctors attend the call of the home isolated patient, who can consult the former regarding their health conditions and treatment measures. District collector Abhijeet Chaudhary inaugurated the service. He said, “Most of the active patients are home isolated. The doctors will guide them on the precautions to be taken and steps to recover faster. In case, a patient’s condition deteriorates then the doctor can guide them accordingly. Currently, we have opened two lines. I have asked the health authorities to add more staff and open more lines if the number of calls increases.” For some days, the service will be open from 8am to 8pm daily. Of the 13,595 active patients, 10,526 are home isolated. Those in-home isolation have to monitor their body temperature and oxygen saturation level regularly. In case sudden fluctuations in health parameters, the patients call on 0233-2621400, 2621700, said Chaudhary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/telemedicine-cell-launched-in-sangli/articleshow/82375146.cms||---

Head of the solid waste management department of Nashik Municipal Corporation, Kalpana Kute, told TOI that the workload of employees at all the 17 Amardham has come down since the daily deaths due to the disease are reducing. “The civic body has also issued directions that bodies of the deceased should be cremated in the local crematorium from the area where the patient belonged, rather than at the Amardham located on the banks of Godavari in Panchavati area,” said Kute. She added that NMC has ensured steady supply of wood for cremations using traditional pyres. Even the electric ones are working without any technical snags. She opined that the restrictions imposed by the state government are hugely helping in curbing the spread of the infection. “The Covid situation in Nashik city is gradually improving and this is having a positive impact on Covid related deaths in the city,” added Kute. Some staff at the Amardham at Panchavati said that they were fatigued with the daily deaths but the decline in the past few days has been comforting. “Our Amardham gets the maximum number of bodies for cremation, not only from the city but also from rural pockets near the city. We have been assisting the bereaved families in every possible way to carry out the cremation smoothly,” added those employees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/fewer-covid-deaths-ease-pressure-on-crematoriums/articleshow/82375151.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

Sources said the CM wanted to decide on the date of the session to pass some important bills. In March, the budget session was cut short by over two weeks and adjourned to July 19, after the state election commission declared the schedule for the second phase of the municipal elections and brought into force the model code of conduct. Sawant had set a deadline to form the Goa Mining Corporation by the end of this month. He had told TOI that he would promulgate an ordinance to form the corporation. However, sources said that the state government cannot issue an ordinance when the assembly is in session. Earlier on Monday, leader of opposition Digambar Kamat decided not to attend the BAC meeting. “What is the hidden agenda behind this meeting? I cannot be party to decisions with ulterior motives,” Kamat said. The former CM said that at a time when Goa’s healthcare infrastructure has collapsed due to the surging second Covid wave, the only business the government needs to prioritise is providing free and timely medical aid to patients. “All other business can be done later,” Kamat said. “The CM needs to clarify why the BAC meeting was convened now, when the assembly session is adjourned to resume on July 19,” he said. “There is almost two-and-a-half months’ time. What is the urgency, unless there is some hidden agenda?”  At a time when Goa’s healthcare infrastructure has collapseddue to the surging second Covid wave, the only business the government needs to prioritise is providing free and timely medical aid to patients||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-bac-meet-as-oppn-calls-out-hidden-agenda/articleshow/82378010.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan does not have enough tankers to ferry 255MT of allotted oxygen daily||Jaipur: Even as the Centre has allocated 255 metric tonnes of oxygen to Rajasthan, the supply management is a challenge with the state having just 28 operational tankers. The state government has sought 54 more tankers, with fleet size having a combined capacity of 500 metric tonnes, from the centre for an uninterrupted supply of oxygen from states like West Bengal and Odisha. The allocation includes 100 metric tonnes from Bhiwadi’s Inox Air Products oxygen plant, 40 MT from Jamnagar (Gujarat), 15 MT from Panipat (Haryana), 40 MT from Steel Authority of India (Burnpur, West Bengal) and 60 MT from Tata Steel (Kalinganagar, Odisha). “They have not got back to us. They are planning that exercise and will have to tell us when they will send it (oxygen). There is definitely a shortage of tankers. If you need to bring oxygen from West Bengal and Odisha and if 100 metric tonnes are to be lifted per day, and travelling takes five days, then we have to send tankers having a total capacity of 500 metric tonnes. So, currently, our total fleet size is barely 300 metric tonnes. Hence, to lift oxygen from these places daily, a dedicated fleet would be needed having a capacity of 500 metric tonnes,” said an official. Chief secretary Niranjan Arya, while reviewing the need and availability of oxygen in the state on Monday, directed the officials to expedite delivery of oxygen concentrators in the state. Additional Chief Secretary (ACS), mines and petroleum department, Subodh Aggarwal on Monday said that by May 15, about 11,000 oxygen concentrators will be delivered (across the state). Vice-chairman of Rajasthan Foundation Dheeraj Srivastava informed that 450 concentrators of 10 litre capacity will be available by May 7 and 250 concentrators by May10 and these will be directly supplied to the districts. “There has been an increase in the production of oxygen by local manufacturers from 125 MT (rated capacity) to 142 MT,” said an official. Hence, with the Government of India increasing the allocation for Rajasthan, the total availability of oxygen would add up to 397 MT per day. “The requirement of oxygen per day keeps changing. The formula is active Covid cases x .12 x 2.5/100. One metric tonne of oxygen is equal to 100 cylinders,” said an official. “We have asked the central government to supply oxygen to the state as per the formula,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-struggles-to-get-allotted-oxygen-quota-as-it-doesnt-have-enough-tankers/articleshow/82377249.cms||---

He directed that those who do not have an oximeter should be provided one along with a Covid kit. The officials gave the CM detailed information about the facilities being provided to people in home isolation and how their health was being monitored, Delhi government said in a statement. Kejriwal informed the authorities about the need to strengthen the home isolation system so that patients could get effective treatment with timely counselling. He directed that a clear data be maintained on the daily Covid reports, which should also show the number of people who have tested positive, number of people who may need hospitalisation and the number of those undergoing treatment in home isolation.

At the same time, a large number of people from 18-44 years age group were unable to get the jab as Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) continued with only three centres following shortage of doses. It was for the fifth consecutive day that Covid-19 vaccination was affected in the city following shortage of doses. As per NMC data, vaccination of 45-plus citizens took place at only three centres — two at GMCH and NMC’s Mahal Diagnostic Centre — where Covaxin has been facilitated. Inoculation was started at five centres where doses of Covishield were exhausted after covering 339 people. Moreover, 137 centres were not operated due to lack of Covishield doses. The civic body had brought 3,000 doses of Covaxin from Bhandara, which helped in continuation of vaccination at the three centres. NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said, “Vaccination for 45-plus will continue only at three centres — two at GMCH and NMC’s Mahal Diagnostic Centre on Tuesday. Covaxin doses will be given here. GMCH will provide only second dose.” Activist Narayan Ahuja said, “Many 45-plus people did not get the jab for the last five days due to shortage of vaccine. Unfortunate part is that people have continued to get messages about their second dose being due and appointment fixed at the centre where they took the first dose. These people turned up at the centres and returned. At least, the messages should be stopped if doses are not available,” he said. Inoculation of 45-plus was also affected in Chandrapur district. Only 267 as against average of 10,000 people could get the jab in the day. Amravati division was most affected compared to Nagpur division. As per data of Amravati divisional commissionerate, there was no vaccination of 45-plus in two districts — Washim and Yavatmal. Only one centre was operated in Buldhana district followed by two at Akola and three at Amravati. The central government is supposed to provide vaccination for healthcare workers (HCWs), frontline workers (FLWs) and 45-plus population. Private hospitals have stopped vaccination as the Centre has made it mandatory to purchase vaccine directly from manufacturers. None of the private hospitals in the region could do it from May 1 to May 3. In city, the NMC continued vaccination of 18-44 years age group at three centres — Indira Gandhi Rugnalaya (IGR), Isolation and Pachpaoli hospitals on Monday. 670 took the jab. The state government had supplied 6,000 doses especially for this age group so vaccination has been started at these three centres from May 1. Over 10 lakh people are estimated in this age group and many are eager to take the vaccine. Mayank Sharma, a resident of Wanjari Nagar, told TOI, “I have been trying to get appointment online at three centres since May 1, but failed. There is no availability of appointments till May 10. Appointment for our age group is not allowed at these centres from May 11.” As reported by TOI on Monday, people from this age group were able to fix appointment on Co-Win website at all centres situated in the city despite vaccination being done only at three centres. This has continued to cause more inconvenience for the people. An NMC official said, “We have intimated about this error to the government.” A few youths were lucky to get appointment and the jab too. One such luck person, Shoeb M, said, “I got appointment in a private hospital on May 1, but vaccination was not started at that centre. Therefore, I had to return. On May 2, I got appointment online and took the jab at Pachpaoli hospital.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-vaccination-for-45-plus-at-137-of-145-nagpur-centres/articleshow/82377253.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

With his wife battling the viral infection and both daughters outside India, the last rites were performed by his friends. Asith Dev Dsouza, his daughter, told TOI from Canada, “He developed fever on April 26. We don’t know how he contracted the virus, could be from the school as he had been working relentlessly.” He died on May 2. After a lot of struggle, the family was able to get him a hospital bed at Adarsh Super Specialty Hospital in north Delhi. “He died of respiratory failure as we became late in getting oxygen for him. By the time we could arrange and take oxygen to the hospital, he was gone,” said Dsouza breaking down every time she spoke. Devasia would have turned 62 years old in July. He had been working at the school for the last 30 years. According to Dsouza, he had joined the school in April 1991. “My father did not have any major comorbidity. He just had gout and his blood pressure was on the higher level but nothing alarming,” said Dsouza. Her mother is now admitted in a hospital. “My sister is in Singapore. She just gave birth via C-section so she cannot travel. I am stuck here not knowing what to do. I had a flight for Wednesday, which has been cancelled. I have re-booked for May 10, but I don’t know if that will also fly,” she added. “He has been buried somewhere in Faridabad. It was difficult to find a space in Delhi,” said Dsouza. Hearing of his demise, several alumni took to social media to highlight the oxygen crisis in the city. Prasanto said, “He wasn’t critical. Would have made it if his oxygen hadn’t run out. No ICU bed was available, other hospitals said they had no oxygen even for regular beds.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/st-xaviers-vice-principal-dies-of-covid/articleshow/82395581.cms||Shradha Chettri

As Covid rages like wild fire and the number of Covid cases are rising continuously, the HCBA in a resolution has urged the Acting Chief Justice of Allahabad High Court Sanjay Yadav to consider complete closing of the court till May 7, 2021, and thereafter, preponing the summer vacation so that the spread of coronavirus can be contained. The HCBA resolution, signed by president Amarendra Nath Singh and secretary Prabha Shankar Mishra, said, “There is immense pressure on our High Court and district courts in pending bail matters, which even in these troubled times need to be addressed in view of the issue of human liberty and Article 21 of our Constitution, which provides protection of life and personal liberty.” The HCBA further said, “In case interim bail is granted for a fixed period then the same will result in saving lives of not only the undertrials but also our judicial staff, who in the present times are also like Covid warriors. Further, the pressure on our already overburdened judicial system will also get some much needed respite.” The HCBA has requested the Acting Chief Justice to seek immediately a jail-wise report from the state government with details of the inmates who can be given immediate relief. “The said order can very well be passed in the PIL no-564 of 2020 (In Re),” the HCBA added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/prepone-summer-vacation-grant-bail-to-undertrials/articleshow/82377993.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey

On the first day, the officials received a dozen queries from Rajasthan. The invitation for application is open for individuals as well as organisations from across the country. Transport commissioner Mahendra Soni told TOI, “In the country, all the states are trying to procure tankers to transport oxygen and we have issued this order as an extra measure in case there is any individual or organisation which by any chance has a tanker which has not been used till now. In Rajasthan, at present we have 27 tankers and are trying to get more. There are four Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) tankers which have to undergo a process called purging (cleaning it with oxygen) so then we can use those as well. The cryogenic tankers used for transporting liquid oxygen are highly specialised and normal tankers cannot be used. We have circulated this order across the country and will pay higher rent as well if required.” According to the order, all organisations, including those from outside Rajasthan, that can provide tankers on rent, can send their applications via email to transport@rajasthan.gov.in as well as on WhatsApp number 9829180005. A six-member committee has also been constituted, which will decide on the rental fee as and when the application reaches them. The committee will take the decision on the same day when the applications are received to avoid any delay in procurement of tankers and expedite transportation of liquid oxygen. Officials said four more tankers are to come from abroad as well, though the date of delivery is yet to be told.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/transport-dept-yet-to-get-proposals-for-renting-of-oxygen-tankers/articleshow/82377257.cms||---

Hence, the state government has placed an order of 2,500 oxygen cylinders to BHEL. Since BHEL does not have the expertise to manufacture oxygen cylinders, it has, in turn, asked BPCL to manufacture them,” said senior leader of the employee union, RLD Dubey “As per the order, BPCL is manufacturing 2,500 oxygen cylinders, each of the capacity of 46.7 litres. They will be supplied within 21 days. An amount of around Rs 3.69 crore has been transferred to the company for manufacturing these cylinders,” said deputy director (industries) Ajay Kumar Chaurasia. BPCL Employees’ Association have submitted a memorandum to deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya, demanding the merger of BPCL with BHEL.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/bpcl-to-supply-2500-o2-cylinders-to-bhel/articleshow/82378001.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Clots & heart attacks now common among young Covid patients||JAIPUR: Earlier, Covid effects such as clotting, thickening of blood that could lead to brain stroke, paralysis and heart attack were seen in patients aged 45 years and above, especially those who had comorbidities. But in the second wave, these symptoms are being seen among young patients. Doctors are now prescribing blood thinners and anticoagulants to ensure patients don’t face these complications. Doctors treating patients at Rajasthan University of Health Sciences (RUHS) and other hospitals said in the past month, they have seen deaths of patients due to heart attacks after clotting. “Covid patients are developing clots which can be dangerous for patients. We have been giving them blood thinners, which have been advised for almost a fortnight since they got their Covid positive report. We also suggest medrol and few other steroids,” said Dr Ajeet Singh, superintendent of RUHS. He added that patients under home isolation should be extra careful and cautious. “For home isolation patients, blood thinners are advised for a longer period to avoid any strokes or clotting,” he added. Doctors of Covid care and management also urged young patients to be extra careful. “We have been giving blood thinners and steroids to patients aged 45 years and above and also to those having co-morbidities. But this is a must even for the young patient,” said Dr Sudhir Bhandari, principal and controller, SMS Medical College. Doctors said young patients are also advised to do some tests including urea, CBC, bilirubin, IL-6, CRP, ECG and others. “Also if the oxygen saturation falls after six minutes of walk, HRCT is advised,” he added. Some of the young patients who died recently while undergoing treatment for Covid had developed heart complications and even suffered brain strokes and paralytic attacks. “I have been advised blood thinner Ecosprin for initial five days. Thereafter, doctor asked me to repeat it for five more days. Since I had also gone for Remdesivir in the day care of RUHS, they had also given me Dexona injection. My oxygen saturation is now 96-98 and I will again go for the test to get negative report in a day or two,” said Neeraj Sharma, a 28-year-old living at Jhotwara area. He is under home isolation after getting Covid-19 positive on April 18.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/clots-blood-thickening-now-found-in-young-covid-patients/articleshow/82377258.cms||Ashish Mehta

The cops seized two duplicate remdesivir injections, 15 empty bottles and glucose bottles from Jagdish Parmar, a resident of Umreth.According to the police, Parmar was selling duplicate remdesivir to the needy over last one-and-half months. “We got information that Parmar was selling duplicate remdesivir following which we set a trap for him. A decoy customer was sent to buy the drug from the accused and we nabbed him when he arrived with the duplicate remdesivir,” said K G Chaudhary, police sub-inspector, SOG. Chaudhary said that 35-year-old Parmar used to mix glucose water with remdesivir and sell it to needy persons. “Parmar had got a job as a ward boy in Nadiad Civil Hospital about two months ago. He used to steal some amount of remdesivir from the bottles that were to be given to the patients. Parmar used to mix 60% glucose water in remdesivir and fill it in empty remdesivir bottles,” Chaudhary told TOI. The police said that Parmar had got hold of 50 empty remdesivir bottles complete with stickers from Nadiad civil hospital where they were disposed. “He used to get many calls from the needy as he was working in the hospital. Parmar charged Rs 4,500 to Rs 5,000 per bottle. No one suspected that Parmar was selling adulterated remdesivir due to the brand stickers on the bottle,” Chaudhary added. He told the cops that he has already sold 35 adulterated remdesivir bottles in the last one-and-half months. “Investigations so far have revealed that Parmar was a lone player but we are trying to find out if anyone else helped him in the racket,” Chaudhary said. The cops have booked Parmar for culpable homicide not amounting to murder and cheating and under The Disaster Management Act. The Ahmedabad police had recently busted a duplicate remdesivir racket wherein the accused used to sell anti-biotics in remdesivir bottles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/ward-boy-selling-glucose-water-mixed-remdesivir-held-in-anand/articleshow/82377266.cms||---

As per the act, a master plan is prepared for towns and cities giving emphasis on zoning regulations for the use of land. The master plan of towns and cities must be reviewed after conducting necessary surveys once in five years. However, the government has not granted approval for review of the master plan for the past 15 years. The authorities are still using the old master plan, which was prepared several years ago, despite the fact that the classification and usage of land parcels have completely changed at present, he said.As per the master plan of the city, most of the land parcels are classified as agricultural land and people have to approach the authorities seeking change of classification of land parcels. The applications for change of classification have to be sent to the government to be notified. The process is not only time consuming but also a burden to the authorities and causes difficulties for the public to get an approval for constructing a building, the PIL stated.He stated that use of the old master plan, which was drafted several years ago, would also affect the industrial and commercial growth of the region as no one would show interest in investing in the region. Hence, the petitioner moved the Madurai bench of the HC seeking periodical review of the master plan of Madurai city as per the act. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-seeks-response-on-plea-for-madurais-master-plan-review/articleshow/82378007.cms||---

As a part of this continuous exercise, the general manager of NCR, Vinay Kumar Tripathi reviewed status of Covid-19 with PHODs of NCR and DRMs of Prayagraj, Jhansi and Agra divisions through video conferencing on Monday. Meanwhile, NCR has also intensified the immunisation drive of railway employees and their family members above 45 years of age, as well as also of eligible railway employees and their family members below 45 years of age in Prayagraj, Agra and Jhansi divisions. North Central Railway is playing an important role in Indian Railway’s initiative of ensuring faster availability of liquid medical oxygen through RO-RO and container train service. Apart from the formation of four MBWT (tank wagon) rakes in Jhansi division equipped with 106 wagons being used in the Oxygen Express, North Central Railway is also playing an important role in the fast transport of the empty and loaded rakes of the Oxygen Express. “The NCR has so far operated six empty rakes and six loaded rakes for transportation of Liquid Medical Oxygen through RO-RO and container trains”, said the chief public relation officer of NCR, Ajeet Kumar Singh. With continuous monitoring of the three divisions and headquarters of the NCR, the Oxygen Express is operating uninterrupted at an average speed of more than 55 kmph over the NCR territory. So far, 15 liquid medical oxygen loaded tankers and containers have been transported to the National Capital Region through six loaded trains, added Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/ncr-intensifies-vaccination-of-employees-and-their-kin/articleshow/82378009.cms||---

But we need intensive and immediate help to ensure proper oxygen supply in Delhi, and we are in touch with private entities, social sector, the central government for the same,” Sisodia said on Monday. According to a source, Sisodia has written that Delhi government also needed the Army’s help in procuring about 40,000 D-Type medical oxygen cylinders, apart from medical and paramedical teams to augment the healthcare manpower of the capital. He has also sought Army’s help to set up and manage Covid care centres with about 10,000 oxygenated non-ICU beds and 1,000 ICU beds. According to the source, Sisodia in the letter said that on average, Delhi was recording 25,000 new Covid cases every day, and about 10% of them required some form of hospitalisation, including oxygen support. The additional allocation of oxygen to Delhi has been made from the plants that are located over 1,500km from Delhi, such as Durgapur, Rourkela and arid Kalinga Nagar. One of the major problems being faced was the availability of cryogenic tankers to bring liquid medical oxygen to the capital. Sisodia said that it would be an extraordinary help if the ministry could provide cryogenic tankers. He has written that since the entire health infrastructure in Delhi was overwhelmed with the management of the existing hospitals and the upcoming Covid hospitals, it would be of timely help if the defence ministry, with considerable resources at its command, was tasked with the responsibility to provide and man the additional Covid health facilities. He has also requested the ministry to arrange for supply of medical oxygen at these Covid health facilities. At present, Delhi has 16,272 oxygen beds and 4,866 ICU beds. Delhi government would be creating an additional 15,000 oxygenated non-ICU beds and 1,200 ICU beds, which are likely to get operationalised in the next 10 days, depending on the supply of medical oxygen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/second-wave-still-raging-sisodia-goes-to-rajnath-for-armys-help-in-crisis-control/articleshow/82378019.cms||Sidharatha Roy

However, the party has not only drastically improved its vote share but also settled for nothing less than the third or fourth spot in all these segments in this assembly election.The party had fielded an equal number of male and female candidates across the state, thereby sending a strong message on gender parity. In as many as 42 seats, the party has come third, pushing behind AMMK and MNM, while in the remaining 18 it came fourth with AMMK in the third spot.NTK candidates have secured a total of 8.96 lakh votes in the 60 constituencies now, which is 89.5% more than the 4.73 lakh they secured in the region in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The party’s vote share has also drastically risen in comparison to that it secured in the bypoll in nine assembly constituencies in 2019, from 55,577 votes to 1,49,717 now. It had secured less than 10,000 votes in these nine constituencies in 2019. But now, the party has secured more than 11,000 votes in the same assembly constituencies with their candidates securing more than 22,000 votes each in three assembly segments.In Tuticorin, its candidate V Velraj secured 30,937 votes, the highest in the region for the party. In adjoining Ottapidaram, M Vaikundamari secured 22,413 votes pushing Puthiya Tamilagam’s K Krishnasamy – a two-time MLA – to the fourth spot with 6,544 votes. Velraj is a prominent anti-Sterlite protester who had more than 130 cases against him for his involvement in the protests. Since the Sterlite plant is situated in Ottapidaram, close to Tuticorin city, this is cited as one reason for the rise in NTK’s vote share.NTK state organiser C Vetrikumaran is a civil engineer who contested from Madurai West securing the third place with 18,224 votes. He told TOI that nearly 60% to 70% of first time voters have plumped for NTK. The party’s growth has been better in southern districts compared to other regions, he said adding that the party had fielded 50% women candidates this time, thereby prompting more women to vote for NTK. This apart, college students and first-time voters have also influenced their parents to vote for NTK for a change, instead of continuing to vote for the two major Dravidian parties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/ntk-comes-3rd-in-42-seats-in-south-tn-vote-share-up-90/articleshow/82378008.cms||Kaushik Kannan

The auction had been stopped at the APMC on April 27 in a bid to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Earlier, onion auctions here had been stopped for eight days between April 18 and 25 after the number of Covid cases had seen a spike in Lasalgaon and adjoining areas. The auction resumed for a day on April 26, but the APMC decided to stop operations for another six days — till May 2 — following a directive from the district administration. “The APMC resumed operations from Monday (May 3). Initially, the volume of onion arrival was low, but it picked up eventually. Most farmers, who were unable to sell their produce over the past couple of weeks, had brought their onions to the mandi,” said Narendra Wadawane, the secretary of the Lasalgaon APMC. The average wholesale onion price dropped marginally due to a rise in supply. On Monday, 28,300 quintal onions were auctioned at the Lasalgaon APMC — including 27,000 quintal summer onions and 1,300 quintal late kharif onions. The average wholesale price of summer onions was recorded at Rs 1,251 per quintal on Monday, against Rs 1,320 per quintal on the previous working day (April 26).

A businessman in Surat, who slayed the coronavirus infection, decided to go home from a Covid isolation centre on a horse. In fact, his family too wanted to celebrate his victory over Covid-19 in a different fashion. Ketan Rangani, 27, who owns a textile unit, left the Sudama Chowk community hall in Mota Varachha riding a horse and carrying the Tricolour to signal his triumph. While he recovered on Saturday, the photos of his procession started doing the rounds on social media late on Sunday evening. Rangani was admitted for seven days in the isolation centre and his condition had also turned worrisome. “Rangani was critical and his oxygen level had dropped to 75. He needed ventilator support but the family could not find a bed in hospital,” said Ronak Patel, a volunteer at the isolation centre. Rangani was admitted to an isolation centre where there were basic facilities. While Rangani was fighting Covid, his family members stayed at the isolation centre and started serving other patients as well. Rangani had requested the administrators of the isolation centre to allow them to organize a small procession. “Rangani’s family lives in Velanja village adjoining Surat city and it was not comfortable for them to daily go home and come back. Hence they stayed at the isolation centre and started serving other patients in their free time,” said Patel. “His recovery improved due to family’s support,” said Patel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/bizman-celebrates-triumph-over-covid-with-horse-ride/articleshow/82377282.cms||---
---||Kanpur||Bikru tastes democracy after 25 yrs,elects a Dalit woman as village head||Kanpur: Democracy was restored finally after a long gap of 25 years in Bikru village, which gained notoriety for the brutal massacre of eight policemen, including a deputy SP, in July last year by the dreaded ganglord Vikas Dubey and his henchmen. Dubey, who was later arrested and killed in an encounter, used his muscle and gun power to terrorise the villagers and had hijacked the entire electoral process. The people of Brahmin-dominated Bikru village, which saw candidates picked by Dubey getting elected election after election, finally got to exercise their franchise and have elected a Dalit woman Madhu as their village head. The post of the head of Bikru gram panchayat was reserved for the Scheduled Caste this time and with no fear of the ganglord as many as 11 candidates had filed nominations. Madhu polled 381 votes and got elected as head of Bikru village on Sunday, defeating Bindu Kumar who got 327 votes. Villagers, who had voted on the diktats of Dubey for over two decades, said it’s an entirely new feeling for them. “Earlier, no one could even dare to think of contesting or voting for any other candidate, else they were tortured by the gangster and his goons,” said a local Gunjan Singh. “Democracy or elections existed merely on paper here in Bikru. No one used to campaign here and Dubey would field his relatives or henchmen as candidates. This time, the contestants went door-to-door to seek votes,” said Meena, an elderly woman of Bikru. Dubey was himself elected unopposed as the head of Bikaru gram panchayat in 1995. In 2000, when the seat was reserved for Scheduled Castes, Dubey fielded Gayatri Devi and got her elected unopposed. In 2005, Anjali Dubey, the wife of Dubey’s younger brother Deep Dubey, was elected unopposed. In the 2010 panchayat elections, when the seat was reserved for other backward classes, Dubey got his aide Rajnikanth Kushwaha elected as village head. In 2015, Vikas again fielded his younger brother’s wife Anjali and she was elected unopposed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/bikru-tastes-democracy-after-25-yrselects-a-dalit-woman-as-village-head/articleshow/82360731.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

In a big relief for such families, members of the NGO Urvanam are now offering to take care of the pets free of cost if the members are unable to do so.P R Viswanath, coordinator of Urvanam, said that two days ago, they had received a call from the neigbour of a family, which had been affected by the disease in TVS Nagar in Madurai. As all the members had been infected, they had no option but to leave the dog tied to its leash in the garden and go to hospital. The family had been concerned for their dog. Viswanath said that they went to the house and found the dog hungry and frightened in the garden. “I sat by her and spoke to her, and brought her to our rescue centre in Thirunagar, where she is now looking happy,” he said.In the second wave, streets are being contained. The second main road in Gomathypuram, was contained because six members of a family tested positive. “Anyone who needs us to take care of their pets, be it dogs, cats, birds or even fish, amid this ciris, we are ready to extend our help,” said Vishwa.During the first wave, many dogs and pets were abandoned near the Pandikoil junction in Madurai, during the total lockdown, and NGO Nandrimaraval fed about 20 such dogs throughout the crisis. Founder K P Marikumar also managed to find homes for these animals.Urvanam members said that people with pets could prepare a small chart of their pets’ needs and any medicines that they give them and keep it in a spot outside their homes so that it would help us take better care of the animals.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 2 bookies accuse Singh & Sharma of Rs 5cr extortion||Mumbai: Two bookies have alleged that former police commissioner Param Bir Singh and former encounter specialist Pradeep Sharma booked them in false cricket-betting cases and extorted around Rs 5 crore from them in 2018, when Singh was Thane police chief. Singh did not respond to calls and text messages from TOI, while Sharma said that the “complaint is an afterthought and criminals are making allegations after three years”. Bookies Sonu Jalan and Ketan Tanna, along with businessman Noor Ahmed, have written to the chief minister, home minister and the director general of police alleging that in 2018, police officers Sharma, N T Kadam and Rajkumar Kothmire arrested them and extorted money. The duo alleged that a person with whom they had a financial dispute filed a false complaint and the police implicated them in a betting case. In the five-page complaint, they alleged that they were booked under the stringent sections of Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act and threatened with dire consequences. They claim the police extorted Rs 3.45 crore from Jalan and Rs 1.25 crore from Tanna. All the collections were carried out by middlemen. Jalan said: “If no inquiry is initiated, I will move the court seeking justice.” But Sharma said, “Why did Jalan keep quiet for three years? There are nine betting cases against him and he is being probed by the Enforcement Directorate. The Intelligence Bureau is also probing his links with the underworld. Our investigations showed his links with gangster Ravi Pujari. Thane police is likely to take Pujari’s custody soon and Jalan too will be re-arrested in the case, hence he is making these allegations now.” Acting DGP Sanjay Pandey declined to comment. The fresh complaint comes close to a complaint by inspector Bhimrao Ghadge levelling corruption charges against Singh and 32 others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-2-bookies-accuse-singh-sharma-of-rs-5cr-extortion/articleshow/82378025.cms||Ahmed Ali

He also said he was ready to quit his MLA post if chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao thinks he had won on TRS party’s ‘car’ symbol. Eatala he would discuss his future course of action with his constituency people before taking any decision. He stuck to his guns that he would rather die than give up his ‘atma gouravam’ (self-respect). “Naa aatma ni nenu ammokonu (my self-respect is not for sale). You can drag me down, file cases and get me arrested,” he said at a press conference. Eatala said: “The chief minister is harassing me by subverting the law and the system. I know how he works and wants to see the end of a person by targeting him. In my case too, it is going to happen. I have travelled with him for 14 years in Telangana movement. It does not suit his stature.” Saying that he would seek legal recourse, he stoutly refuted allegations that Jamuna Hatcheries had encroached upon the assigned land. “Medak district collector has submitted a report without serving a notice on the firm before taking up the survey on the controversial land. The survey was completed by deploying hundreds of cops and creating terror in the villages. I am ready to face any action, including cases and arrests if there is any assigned land in my firm’s possession. We will approach the court on this,” Eatala said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/eatala-set-to-move-court-on-charges/articleshow/82377286.cms||Koride Mahesh

Nashik Road police have registered a case of hit-and-run against the tractor driver who fled from the spot without informing the police or taking the victim to the nearest hospital. According to Nashik Road police station, the incident occurred when the victim — identified as Tushar Nawle — was heading home on his motorbike. “The tractor was coming from the opposite direction and it was a head-on collision. Due to the impact the deceased was thrown on the side of the road where he sustained serious head injuries,” a police officer said. “Nawle died on the spot. At the same time, a worker who was sitting on the tractor also fell from the vehicle and sustained injuries on his head and legs. Still, the tractor driver did not stop and fled,” he added. Police have booked a case of causing death due to negligence under section 304 (A) of the Indian Penal Code along with various sections of Motor Vehicle Act against the accused who is believed to be a resident of Pimplas Ramache — a village near Chandori in Niphad taluka.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/motorcyclist-dies-in-nashik-after-being-hit-by-tractor/articleshow/82376490.cms||---

---||India||After romping home, Pinarayi claims BJP traded votes to UDF nominees||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday alleged that the BJP had traded its votes to UDF candidates even in those seats won by UDF in the assembly election. He said the UDF’s hope of coming back to power till the last moment was owing to this assurance from BJP. Back in the capital after the emphatic win by LDF, the chief minister said the UDF had won at least 10 seats with the votes of BJP cadres, and the fall of UDF would have been worse without this vote trade. In as many as 90 constituencies, BJP has lost its votes when compared to the 2016 elections, and the winning margin of the UDF candidates in some seats matches the loss of votes for BJP in them, which is a clear indicator that BJP votes have gone to UDF, he said. The chief minister said BJP lost a total of 4,28,531 votes compared to the 2016 elections in two constituencies in Kasaragod, five in Kannur, two in Wayanad, nine in Kozhikode, nine in Malappuram, five in Palakkad, six in Thrissur, 12 in Ernakulam, five in Idukki, six in Alappuzha, nine in Kottayam, five in Pathanamthitta, five in Kollam and 10 in Thiruvananthapuram. The UDF candidates in constituencies like Sulthan Bathery, Perumbavoor and Kundara won with the help of these lost BJP votes, he said. Vijayan said such trading of votes could also reduce the winning margin of LDF candidates in some constituencies like Thavanur, Kuttiyadi, Koyilandy and Nemom. He said it is clear that such a vote trading agreement between UDF and BJP was with the clear knowledge of the state leadership of both parties and fronts. He said the BJP should introspect and ensure that it retains the character of a political party instead of a vote trading system. Meanwhile, the chief minister on Monday submitted his resignation to governor Arif Mohammad Khan. TheCPM state secretariat will meet on Tuesday to discuss the formation of the new government. It will also take a call on the date of the swearing-in ceremony. Besides CPI, Kerala Congress (Mani) led by Jose K Mani will also have representation in the government. There are reports of KC(M) already staking claim of two cabinet berths. CPI had four ministers in the previous cabinet and it is learnt that they will have the same representation this time too. CPM may give one cabinet berth to JD (S) and KC(B)..||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/after-romping-home-pinarayi-claims-bjp-traded-votes-to-udf-nominees/articleshow/82379169.cms||---
---||Delhi||Covid-19: Vitamins, testing for Delhi zoo inmates||NEW DELHI: The Delhi zoo is keeping all its animals under watch and giving them vitamin supplements as preventive measures after eight lions tested positive for Covid-19 at the Hyderabad zoo. Zoo officials in the capital said swabs and samples from the animals will be collected and sent for testing if they show symptoms or have fallen ill recently. Ramesh Pandey, Delhi Zoo director, said that all sanitary drills undertaken at the zoo after the bird flu outbreak are still being continued. “We are disinfecting each enclosure and even the open premises where free-ranging birds are seen. Since the zoo has shut down, all staff has been taking measures to deal with animals with the proper gear and each and every animal is under watch currently,” said Pandey, stating those showing symptoms may be tested. Zoo officials say all possible precautions are being taken on the zoo premises, including spraying lime solutions, virkon-S and sodium hypochlorite. “Food is also being boiled before being given to the animals,” said an official. In 2016, Delhi zoo was shut down for nearly three months after several bird deaths were reported due to bird flu. A similar outbreak occurred earlier this year, with multiple bird samples testing positive for the avian flu. The zoo reopened for visitors on April 1, 2021, but, was subsequently shutdown as cases continued to rise in the city. A senior CZA official said zoological parks across the country had been asked to take precautions and ensure proper sanitisation measures were in place. “More samples can be collected if an animal shows symptoms. Each zoo has been asked to keep a vigil,” said the official. Similar measures were undertaken last year too, when a tiger tested positive for Covid-19 at the Bronx Zoo. Among the directions given by the CZA then included CCTV surveillance of animals and using PPE kits and safety gear to deal with animals. In case an animal shows any symptoms, it is to be isolated and kept away from the remaining animals in the enclosure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/vitamins-testing-for-zoo-inmates/articleshow/82395648.cms||---

Under such programme, we had discussions with the military hospital administration and have jointly decided to increase ventilator beds and provide workforce required to the hospital so that more Covid patients can be admitted,” said Mandhare. “Since this is a military hospital, the access of civilians is limited. We are having discussions over the same to ensure the patients – in need of the treatment – can access the hospital. The administration will chalk out the plan accordingly,” he said. The state will provide the workforce required to increase the bed capacity at the military hospital. The workforce, including nurses and ward boys, will be sourced from the state government through recruitment by the civil hospital. A system will be finalised for the admission of the patients in the hospital after completing the formalities, said the collector||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/dist-admin-military-hosp-to-strengthen-health-infra/articleshow/82375187.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Chief of AAP’s medical cell, Dr Mariano Godinho, said that the damning letter by the Goa Association of Resident Doctors (GARD) exposes a lot of serious issues that were sought to be covered up by Sawant and health minister Vishwajit Rane, including the most serious issue of shortage of oxygen. He said that it was shameful that even the basic demands of CCTV cameras and security personnel to ensure the safety of the doctors have not been met yet. On the contrary, the government is allowing its VIP friends to throw their weight around and make things even more difficult for the already beleaguered doctors, he alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/not-the-time-for-photo-ops-at-o2-plants/articleshow/82378047.cms||---

The revenue earned by transportation of goods for financial year 2020-21 increased by more than 50% as compared to 2019-20, surpassing even the set target. While the division earned more than Rs 350 crore in 2019-20, this year the revenue was nearly Rs 600 crore. Officials claimed that this was essentially because railways tapped new markets like transportation of stones, automobiles and other items. Mukesh Saini, senior division commercial manager (DCM), Jaipur told TOI, “Goods and parcel transportation has always been the main source of revenue for railways, but since last year we started looking at previously untapped markets. We met private stakeholders and discussed ways to use trains for transporting goods. Trains are now being used to transport stones, oil, automobiles etc. as far as down south which was not done earlier as trucks were used. People gradually started having faith as the speed of the goods trains was increased. Now railway transportation is proving to be both cost and time effective.” The revenue of 2020-21 was 56% more than the previous financial year. The target for 2020-21 was Rs 479 crore but it was 24% more than that. “During Covid-19 we also gave rebate for goods transportation and while there is still competition from road transport, railways is being preferred as more quantity can be sent from one location to another in shorter duration of time’, added Saini. The division’s passenger train revenue, which was over Rs 55 crore in February 2019, dipped by almost Rs 20 crore in February 2021. The earning was brought down to half in March this year as compared to the same month in 2019. In April 2021, the revenue was approximately Rs 15 crore whereas in the same month a couple of years ago, it was a whopping Rs 62 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jaipur-rly-divisions-goods-revenue-50-more-than-last-year/articleshow/82377309.cms||Yeshika Budhwar

In a meeting on April 27, additional chief secretary mines Subodh Agarwal told the officials in the geology wing of the department to ascertain the status of the blocks as to whether the earlier applicant had carried out exploration as per the rules. “If exploration is done as per the rules by the previous title holder, then the blocks can be set aside for auction. If there was no exploration, then the same be carried out up to the level where as per MEMC Rules for giving composite licence,” he said. The blocks pertain to leases where reconnaissance permits or prospecting licences were granted, but mining leases could not be obtained by the block owners due to lack of various approvals. Since the time period to grant them approvals have elapsed as per the amendments to the MMDR Act in 2015, the leases have been cancelled. Mines dept earns Rs 44 cr from amnesty scheme Jaipur: The mines department has earned Rs 44 crore from its amnesty scheme that ended on March 31. The scheme was launched in September, 2020 for unpaid royalty and dead rent by mining lessees, contractors and royalty collection contractors. The scheme was applicable to those lessees, royalty collection vendors and contractors of various departments on whom demand has been raised by the department till March 31, 2019.

Of the 29 vaccination centres in Nashik city, only five were operational on Monday. In most cases, only beneficiaries waiting for their second doses and those in the 18-44 years category were given the jabs.According to the officials of the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC), in some centres beneficiaries above the age of 45 were turned away as there were no vaccines available.“We had received 4,000 vaccines for beneficiaries in the 18-44 category. These were administered at two centres. For the above-45 years group, we had very few vaccines doses at three centres. Only the second doses were given to beneficiaries above 45 years,” said the NMC officials.Many of the 18 private hospitals also ran out of stock in the city. They are not sure when they would get fresh supplies.The vaccination drive was affected in the rural areas. There are over 200 vaccination centres in Nashik rural and within the jurisdiction of the Malegaon Municipal Corporation (MMC). On Monday, only 28 were working.“We are facing an acute shortage of vaccines in the district. We expect the fresh stock to arrive in the next couple of days,” said Ravinda Chaudhari, the additional district health officer.Overall, five vaccination centres have been identified for the 18-44 years age group, including two in Nashik city, two in rural areas and one in Malegaon city. Vaccination for this category took place at all the five vaccination centres on Monday. Total of 1,355 such beneficiaries have been vaccinated in the last three days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/most-vaccination-centres-in-nashik-stay-shut-on-monday/articleshow/82375196.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Misleading information on dashboard foxes patients||LUCKNOW: Families having a critical Covid-19 patient at home are having a harrowing time as they claim that the online dashboard started by the district administration is giving incomplete and misleading information about availability of beds in city hospitals. “When I searched the dashboard, the status of many hospitals said that there were no ICU or oxygen-supported-beds. However, the status of a few hospitals showed that some oxygen beds were vacant, but when I called to verify, the staff denied any such availability,” said Sarvendra Vikram Singh of Talkatora, who is desperately looking for an oxygen-supported bed for his critically ill 59-year-old father. “My father’s blood oxygen level dropped to 84% and he had difficulty in breathing. We have made arrangement of oxygen for him at home but for proper treatment, he needs to be hospitalised. The administration should take action against hospitals which are putting out incomplete or inaccurate information,” he said. The district administration had recently launched ‘Lucknow Covid Hospitals Bed Dashboard’ (https://beds.dgmhup-covid19.in/EN/covid19bedtrack), the only tracker through which people can find the status of beds in Covid hospital. The hospitals are supposed to update their status twice daily — morning and evening. However, only 59 out of 72 Covid hospitals had put their details on the dashboard by 10pm. Like Vikram, the family of Asha Srivastva (45), also found the information in the dashboard inaccurate. “She has diabetes which makes a Covid-19 patient more vulnerable. When her blood oxygen level dropped to 87% in the morning, I searched the dashboard and dialled five hospitals where oxygen beds were said to be available, but everywhere the staff told me that the status on the dashboard is old and all the beds are occupied,” said Asha’s brother-in-law, Parth. “I also called up a senior health officer and he admitted that bed availability status on the dashboard is inaccurate and mixed up. He, however, helped me get a bed in a government hospital after a six-hour struggle,” he added. District administration officers said strict warning had been issued by the government to all Covid hospitals to provide complete details about beds and update it twice on the dashboard. “We will look into the complaints and take action,” a senior officer said. Meanwhile, long queues for oxygen refill continued on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/misleading-info-on-dashboard-foxes-patients/articleshow/82378044.cms||---

It went under 250 only for the second time in the last 11 days. The number of new cases dipped to 11,148 for the first time since April 12. However, cases reduced due to low testing on Sunday. All 11 districts in Vidarbha together conducted 45,697 tests on Sunday against the daily average of 65,000. But reduction in number of deaths is good news for sure.

Recovery rate is showing improvement since the last 4 days. Still, it’s less than state average of 84%.

---||Nashik||IMA: O₂ scenario better but still not comfortable||Nashik: The drop in number of Covid patients in the district has brought huge relief to the medical fraternity as it has also reduced the demand for oxygen beds. The supply of oxygen is still far from comfortable, the Indian Medical Association, Nashik unit office-bearers said. “The falling Covid cases has resulted in improved availability of oxygen but the things are just slightly getting better. A period of three days is too short to describe the situation. Regular supply of oxygen to smaller hospitals is a must to ensure comfortable treatment for all patients needing oxygen support,” Dr Hemant Sonanis, IMA city unit president, said. There are more than 125 small hospitals in Nashik city catering to demand for treatment of covid patients. “We are in touch with the district administration to ensure that we have all the required oxygen for the patients needing it. Since the hospitals are smaller, their demand for oxygen is met by the refuellers. Even today, there is no confirmation about the oxygen being supplied the next day,” Sonanis said. The administration is taking efforts to smoothen the supply of oxygen. “We have now added a couple of oxygen producing companies in Sinnar and other areas. They are contributing total of 100 tonne oxygen, 90 tonne of which comes from the factories in Raigad and Thane districts in the form of liquid medical oxygen,” said Dattaprasad Nade, additional collector of Nashik, who is the incident commander. The administration is also in talks with sugar factories in Nashik to see if they could also provide oxygen  NAMCO starts CCC The Nashik Merchants Cooperative Bank’s charitable hospital has started 42-bed covid care centre which is equipped with oxygen bed. .

Last week, Mustafa managed to escape while NCB teams from Mumbai and Goa were conducting a search at shack ‘Negi Cafe’, Arambol. During the operation, the NCB seized 58gm of amphetamine (commercial quantity), 15 blots of LSD (commercial quantity), cocaine, mephedrone and heroin in intermediate quantity, he said. “This drug syndicate was being operated by Mustafa, a Nigerian national. Negi Cafe caretaker Ranbir Singh has been placed under arrest,” Wankhede had said. Wankhede had said Tiger is a notorious drug trafficker who is active in North Goa and was allegedly running his operations from Negi Café.

---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Botched sampling, delayed reports drive patients into a critical state||LUCKNOW: Jagriti Pandey (30), who is six-month pregnant, tested Covid-19 positive on April 10, and after going through medication, is asymptomatic for the last one week. She gave her samples to the district health team for RT-PCR test again on April 30, so that she can go to SGPGIMS to get herself examined. However, the team that took samples conducted rapid antigen test and forgot to submit it for RT-PCR test, leaving her in a difficult situation. Like Jagriti, there are many in the city who are having sleepless nights due to improper sampling by teams sent by the chief medical officer’s (CMO) office and delay in results by government labs due to huge backlog. “The sample collection team specifically told me that RT-PCR test will be done but the results uploaded on the lab test portal after three days showed that rapid antigen test was conducted which came out to be negative. It brought some relief, but left me puzzled because rapid antigen test report can be given on the spot and does not require three days. However, bigger issue for me is that without RT-PCR test report, no hospital, including SGPGIMS, will not conduct physical examination,” said Jagriti, a resident of Khurramnagar, who had a miscarriage last year and does not want to take any chances this time. People are also worried that if there is need for hospitalisation, they will not get admission in any hospital for want of mandatory RT-PCR report. Also, many people start taking medicines meant for Covid-19 due to delay in result but later find they are suffering from some other disease with similar symptoms. Saumyata Shukla (35) of Mahanagar called the CMO office on April 20 for tests of all the five members of her family after her father developed fever and breathlessness. “The team came after five days to collect samples and the lab took four more days for results, but we all started medication immediately. Thankfully, we all came negative. I took my father to a doctor who found that he had some other infection,” she said. CMO Dr Sanjay Bhatnagar was not available for comments, but other district health officers said that human error might have caused such incidents, but the percentage is very low. Regarding delay in response time and results, they said it was because of tremendous workload. Hospitals refusing admission without RT-PCR report: The condition of Prakash Narain (65), a Mahanagar resident, deteriorated on Monday afternoon with blood oxygen dropping to 80%. He had Covid-19 symptoms and his RT-PCR test report from a private lab is awaited. No hospital is ready to take him without an RT-PCR test report. Family tried everything for hospitalisation, even sent SOS to senior officers but all insisted on getting RT-PCR report at the earliest. “He has diabetes and his condition is critical. We will submit the report as soon as it arrives, but by that time, he should be given emergency care,” a relative said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/botched-sampling-delayed-reports-drive-patients-into-a-critical-state/articleshow/82378062.cms||---
---||Delhi||‘No reason for pet owners to panic’||New Delhi: Despite eight lions testing positive for Covid-19 at the Hyderabad zoo, veterinarians said that pet owners have no reason to panic, stating the virus is unlikely to spread from humans to pets and vice versa. In the past, there were a few cases of people abandoning pets in fear of transmission of the virus, but experts said that animals naturally carry a number of viruses, with the effect of Covid-19 on them still relatively unknown. Gauri Maulekhi, an animal activis, urged people to not abandon their pets. “Ever since the Covid-19 outbreak, there have been questions on the issue. There is no evidence that suggests pets can get it or spread it further. Animals naturally carry several viruses and diseases, and how they cope up with them differs significantly to how humans deal with it. We urge people not to abandon their pets,” said Maulekhi, who is also trustee at People For Animals (PFA). M Shah Hussain, scientist-in-charge at the Aravalli Biodiversity Park (ABP) said that while rare, the chance of an animal getting Covid-19 exists. However, it is unlikely to spread through them. “Animals have antibodies to deal with a number of infections and viruses that exist in nature. Most wild animals fight it off naturally and pets get regular vaccines to develop antibodies against pathogens. Had this been a problem, we would have seen many more such cases already,” said Hussain. Kanika Dewan, director, partnerships and strategy at PFA also agreed that an animal itself is unlikely to cause or increase transmission of the virus. However, as a precautionary measure, pets can be kept away from a positive, isolating patient. “The collar of the pet may hold droplets and transmit it further, but it is unlikely to be a source of transmission in itself. We are educating pet owners on some of these misconceptions,” she said. Veterinarian Dr Ranjit Kharb, meanwhile, questioned the methodology in collection of the samples from the lions. “We have to firstly see how the samples were collected. Saliva samples, too, can get contaminated. You also have to realise that a variant of the coronavirus can also be naturally found in wild animals, said Kharb, adding that owners should continue to interact normally with their pets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-reason-for-pet-owners-to-panic/articleshow/82395707.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: New guest cap on weddings puts families in tight spot||JAIPUR: The cap of 31 guests at weddings has left hundreds of families in a fix as they had already scheduled marriages on the 13 auspicious days in May in advance. The families have to submit names and other details of their wedding guests, along with the time and venue to the district administration. This is leading to many families keeping the ceremonies discreet. Many are hunting for venues like small hotels or resorts on the city’s outskirts. Piyush Sharma, a manager at a heritage hotel in Jaipur, is calling people in his network to find a resort in the interiors. His cousin brother’s marriage was postponed from November to May, hoping the conditions would be better, which has now backfired. “This is worse than November-December. Other than 31 people, the ceremonies have to be completed in three hours which is difficult for us. Limiting guests to 31 means that we are missing out on family members, forget relatives and friends. Even if we get a community hall or a resort away from the city, I will go for it,” said Sharma. Many fear that police have been given undue powers and that they would harass wedding guests. The marriage halls have been booked in advance and the owners of the hall are ready to give the next date, but not the advance payment. “It is difficult for us to convince our relatives and friends that the government has cut down on the number of guests from 200 guests to 100 and from 50 to 31. The violators have to pay Rs 1 lakh, will keep us counting guests all the time, if at all I will go ahead with the marriage of my son,” said Aakash Gupta, a businessman from Jaipur, whose son’s marriage is lined up on May 28. Pandit Dinesh Shastri based in Jaipur has expressed concern over the security of priests, without whom marriages are not possible. “If marriages are allowed, the priests have to be given passes or permits. In Hindu tradition, marriage is not possible without the rituals, which are done by the priest. They should be counted over the permissible limit of 31,” said Shastri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/new-guest-cap-on-weddings-puts-families-in-tight-spot/articleshow/82377360.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Chittorgarh: Sarpanch’s hubby, aide held for raping & killing 28-yr-old woman||UDAIPUR: Police on Monday recovered the body of a 28-year-old woman who had been missing since April 16. The body had almost decayed as it was found buried some 30 feet beneath the ground on the main road of Chhachhar village, some 60km from the district headquarters under Vijaypur police station limits in Chittorgarh. When police did not take the matter seriously even after a fortnight, Chittorgarh MLA Chandrabhan Akya intervened on Sunday and rebuked the SHO for negligence, following which they took the accused, a sarpanch’s husband and his driver into custody, who confessed to their crime and hence the heinous incident came to light. The SHO has been sent to lines. Victim Janta Devi Banjara had on April 16 gone to the police station to lodge a complaint against the accused Bharat Dhakad for making her nude pictures viral on social media, but police did not lodge her complaint and reportedly advised her to settle the matter at a personal level. Dhakad's wife is the sarpanch of Amarpura panchayat and is said to have considerable influence in the area. When Janta Devi went missing, her family filed a missing complaint and instead of interrogating thoroughly, SHO Ashok Kumar was cordial with Dhakad at the police station and allegedly served tea and snacks. The family made several rounds at the police station to take updates of the woman and finally approached the legislator for help. The family even threatened to immolate themselves if action was not taken. Seeing the pressure, the cops took Bharat Dhakad and his driver Pratap Singh into custody and when the men were thoroughly interrogated, they confessed to their crime. The accused told police that they took the woman in their car, raped her in turns, killed and buried her deep in the ground. On their identification, police dug the pit and recovered the decomposed body.

---||Pune||Pune: Pausing 45+ drive for 18-44 age group ‘makes no sense’||PUNE: Public health experts in the region have questioned the move by the state health department to prioritise vaccinations of the 18-44 group over the 45-plus population, which they said is more at risk of developing severe Covid-19. Both the PMC and the PCMC have suspended vaccinations for the 45+ age group, citing a shortage of doses. Whatever stock is left has been redirected to inoculate the 18 to 44 population. Subhash Salunke, advisor to the state government on Covid-19, said, “We cannot take such decisions just because of pressure. This move, which makes no sense, had nothing to do with reducing mortality rate. Factors such as epidemiology and pandemic control were not considered by the person/s who decided to go ahead with the 18-44 vaccination.” Healthcare activist, Abhijit More said the Centre has failed to give proper guidelines for the vaccination process. “Vaccination of the 18-44 age group is a political gesture, which has nothing to do with priority protection of vulnerable age groups,” he said. Ashish Bharati, head of the PMC’s health department, said the process to start vaccinating the 18-44 group was started after directives were issued by the state government. He added that the PMC will resume vaccinations for those above 45 as soon as more doses become available. Officials from the Pune circle deputy director's office, which distributes doses from the state to Pune, Pimpri Chinchwad and Pune rural region, said the decision to pause 45-plus vaccination and start with the 18-44 group was taken by the state government. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said, “We have clear instructions to use vaccines allotted by the Centre for the 45+ age group and those procured by the state — from vaccine makers — for the 18-44 group.” He added that last week, the state did not receive any fresh stock from the Centre. The state procured Covishield doses on April 30 from SII, which are now being used for the 18-44 group. “We are expecting to get a fresh stock from the Centre on Tuesday. Vaccination for the 45-plus can then begin again,” he said. On Monday, as many as 2,507 people from the 18-44 age group were inoculated in Pune district — 1,262 were vaccinated in Pune rural, 665 in Pune city and 580 in Pimpri Chinchwad. Pune rural areas continued with routine vaccination as well, amid limited vaccine stock. They vaccinated 1,990 people on Monday (including the 1,262 from the 18-44 age group). Health officials in the PMR have so far been unable to reach their target of one lakh beneficiaries due to vaccine shortages. The target was set sometime in March, to ensure pace of coverage is maintained in the region. However, officials said intermittent supply and Covid-linked restrictions over the weekend have impacted turnouts at sites.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pausing-45-drive-for-18-44-age-group-makes-no-sense/articleshow/82376530.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi cops crack down on those fleecing Covid-affected||NEW DELHI: Over a dozen people were arrested in the last two days for selling Covid-related equipment and injections in the black market, and other similar offences. Delhi Police on Tuesday said it had also identified around 200 mobile numbers and 95 bank accounts being used by crooks to contact people and receive money. The crackdown, ordered by Delhi Police commissioner S N Shrivastava, took place on Monday and Tuesday. In many of the cases, the cops posed as customers to catch the accused, who were fleecing family members of Covid patients. To stop such activities, police have zeroed in on 33 Unique Transaction Reference numbers and 17 UPI/wallets that have been used by crooks to dupe people. The cops have roped in National Payment Corporation of India and I4C of MHA to stop payments, freeze the accounts and block these numbers. Shrivastava reviewed the developments through video conferencing again on Tuesday. “On May 3, a payment of Rs 74, 380 was stopped. Earlier, two payments of Rs 11,000 and Rs 20,000 were stopped as well,” PRO Chinmoy Biswal said. Recently, a Jharkhand-based fraudster was arrested for duping people on pretext of providing Remdesivir injections and oxygen cylinders. “The accused, Rohit Yadav, was tracked down to Faridabad following a complaint,” DCP (south) Atul Thakur said. Similarly, the cops recovered a dozen oxygen concentrators and arrested two men in Dwarka for trying to sell them in black, said DCP Santosh Meena. In northwest Delhi, four people, including a nurse at Moolchand Hospital, were arrested for selling Remdesivir injection for Rs 70,000 each. Seven vials were seized from them. The nurse, Lalitesh, procured unused injections of patients who had recovered, showed them as ‘administered’ in hospital records and sold them through her friends, police said. Her associates were identified as Vipul, Vishal and Shubham. A man in north Delhi was nabbed for trying to sell portable oxygen canisters to a Covid patient for Rs 1,800, four times the price. The Crime Branch also arrested two men, including an ayurvedic doctor, for selling Remdesivir in black for Rs 32,000 each. Five vials were seized from the accused, Dr Prashant and Ashwani. Similarly, in Jahangirpuri, two people were arrested for selling oxygen cylinders in black. Two ambulance drivers were also nabbed in the crackdown for overcharging family members of Covid patients. Two chemists, one in Sarita Vihar and the other in Kalkaji, were arrested for overcharging customers. The latter was selling an oxygen concentrator for Rs 1.45 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cops-crack-down-on-those-fleecing-covid-affected/articleshow/82395740.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi HC pulls up hosp for holding O2 tanker to ransom||NEW DELHI: Even as Delhi High Court continued hearing a suo motu case on issues related to the pandemic, including oxygen and Covid-19 resource management, it pulled up Batra Hospital on Monday after learning that it had detained an oxygen tanker and driver on its premises in a bid to get more oxygen from the supplier. Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli noted that against the 2.5 metric tonnes of oxygen Goyal Gases was to have delivered to Batra Hospital, it was forced to deliver 4.8 MT on Saturday. “We have made it clear to the executive director of Batra Hospital, who appeared with his counsel, that such conduct will not be tolerated. If this kind of conduct is adopted by anyone on the chain, others will be affected. The executive director of Batra Hospital has given us an assurance that such conduct will not be repeated.” The issue was brought to the court’s notice by advocate Rohit Ranjan of Goyal Gases. He said that Goyal Gases had supplied Batra Hospital more than its allocation on Friday, and such acts were uncalled for. Tushar Thareja, the hospital’s counsel, argued that Batra was allocated 5 MT, but only received 2.9 MT. “I shouldn’t have to come on a daily basis. Some timetable should be given,” he said. The court, however, reprimanded the hospital and said it couldn’t resort to this kind of arm-twisting. “They went to deliver liquid medical oxygen to you and you insisted and bogged them down to deliver more… You can’t seize the vehicle and driver. If this happens, the whole system will collapse,” the court told the counsel for Batra Hospital. The bench continued, “This will not do. It doesn’t give you the right to forcibly detain tankers or threaten them. You are breaking the discipline. This will not do. Tell us, if everyone were to do this, the tanker wouldn’t even reach you.” The executive director of Batra Hospital responded that he was “deeply apologetic” on behalf of his institution. “I have just been informed about this. Never in the future will this happen again. This is very critical for other hospitals also. We understand this,” he said. The court expressed surprise at the senior hospital administrator being unaware of the incident. “Could it happen without your approval?” asked the justices. The executive director assured that he hadn’t approved any such measure. The court noted too that the allocation of oxygen to healthcare facilities was being done on the basis of what was in supply. “We all know there is a shortage. Hospitals are not getting oxygen as per requirement. Following the Supreme Court’s order, the central government is bound to supply 700 MT to Delhi right away. Till they get that, it is a problem no doubt. Some hospitals have reduced the number of beds, which is again to the detriment of people. Where will they go?” the court remarked. On other issues such as installation of pressure swing adsorption plants, Delhi government’s senior advocate Rahul Mehra sought time to submit a response. He earlier informed the bench that deputy CM Manish Sisodia had written to defence minister Rajnath Singh seeking the Army’s help. When the court queried about the same, the Centre’s additional solicitor general Chetan Sharma said all aspects of assistance from the Army were being looked into by the defence minister himself.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-pulls-up-hosp-for-holding-o2-tanker-to-ransom/articleshow/82378085.cms||Aamir Khan

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Shukla claims political vendetta, asks court to stay police probe||Mumbai: As interim relief from the Bombay high court, Rashmi Shukla, former commissioner of state intelligence, wants the investigation launched against her by the government stayed and the police to be restrained from taking “any coercive step” against her. Her contention is that the state is attempting to “victimise” her to “settle political vendetta” so that she “withdraws her report just as former commissioner of police Param Bir Singh was also pressured by the senior police officer to withdraw the complaint against the former home minister”. On March 26, the state had registered the FIR alleging an unknown person got hold of Shukla’s “confidential report” and handed it to opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis in an “illegal manner”, violating the Indian Telegraph Act. On April 26, cybercrime police summoned Shukla. She now apprehends arrest. Fadnavis had cited her report after API Sachin Waze’s arrest, leading to allegations from the MVA that phones were tapped sans permission. Shukla said as state intelligence chief, last year, she hadnoticed information of corrupt practices between politicians and police officers “over favourable postings and transfers” . She said “with permission of competent authority”, phones of certain politicians and police officers were kept under surveillance, and on August 20, a detailed report made. On August 25, she submitted the report to then DGP Subodh Jaiswal. Shukla said she had shown CM Uddhav Thackeray the “damaging call transcript and data” on August 11, and again on August 16, and he had “asked for certain details”. She said former home minister Anil Deshmukh “did not grant her time” when she sought to brief him, and on September 2, 2020, she was “illegally and arbitrarily transferred” to post of DG (civic defence). Shukla said the state created nine DG posts sans cabinet and home ministry nods. The transfer order was silent on character of duty assigned, showing the state’s “mala fides”, she said. When Deshmukh met her in September, he “brusquely informed” her that the transfer was “for submitting” the report. The petition has not made Deshmukh a party, but is versus the state through BKC police station, assistant police commissioner K B Irani and CBI. Shukla’s petition said instead of taking action against the “wrongdoers”, the state “arbitrarily relieved then DGP (Jaiswal)...to CISF as DG in January 2021”. Seeking urgent hearing for May 4 before the bench of Justices S S Shinde and Manish Pitale, her lawyer wrote the “approach of the state is to arm twist the petitioners by bogus and frivolous case”.  Shukla’s petition said AG Ashutosh Kumbhakoni had informed HC during the hearing of an earlier PIL by Singh that her report had been considered and the “file closed” since “nothing of substance was found”. The phone surveillance permission was “granted many times by then additional chief secretary Sitaram Kunte from July 17-29, 2020,” her petition said, adding that as the probe progressed, more numbers were added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-shukla-claims-political-vendetta-asks-court-to-stay-police-probe/articleshow/82377423.cms||---
---||Jaipur||SC order disappoints parents, schools call it ‘win-win’ for all||Jaipur: The Supreme Court judgment over school fees on Monday has left parents discontented, while the private schools have hailed it calling it a ‘win-win’ situaltion for all.The apex court judgment has left parents with no choice, but to deposit the remaining fees with a discount of 15%. The Society for Unaided Private Schools in Rajasthan (SUPSR), a petitioner in the case, has called the SC judgment in the interest of schools and their employees. Parents must pay up to Rs 20,000 of the remaining fees of the previous academic session.Damodar Goyal, president of SUPST, said the apex court has observed that the government cannot evoke Article 162, disaster management Act and Rajasthan epidemic Act on private schools. “The court has upheld the autonomy of private schools and at the same time expected the schools to be sensitive towards parents. The judgment made it clear that the government cannot direct schools when it comes to fees. It has a lesson for the government to issue orders only after consulting with all stakeholders, including schools,” said GoyalThe order has advised schools to act in a sensible manner given the present situation while referring to the petitioner’s school (Maharaja Sawai Man Singh Vidyalaya). The MSMSV was the first school in the state to have declared 25% fee waiver considering the pandemic situation.The decision has closed the doors for the parents who were hoping to see some reprieve from the apex court. “I have two children, both studying in an elite school. This decision would mean that I have to shell out around Rs 40,000 in the midst of the second wave and at a time when my business is just sustaining. I now expect schools to show some humanity and at least give some waiver,” said Rishi Choudhary, a parent whose children study at a private school in Chitrakoot.TOI called up some school principals who refused to share their views on the order. They maintained that they will soon revise the fee structure of the previous year by deducting 15% fees as stated by the court. For parents who have paid the entire fees, 15% excess amount will be adjusted in the current year’s fees.Abhishek Jain Bittu, self-proclaimed chairman of Joint Parents Association, Rajasthan, said the parents’ community is disappointed with the judgment and have full faith in the judiciary. “The judgment has not prevented us from filing a review petition against this order. I am sure that we were not able to present the case properly in court. This time we will present the case in an effective manner,” said Bittu. The association is planning a stir demanding waiver in school fees in the new session 2021-22.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sc-order-disappoints-parents-schools-call-it-win-win-for-all/articleshow/82377363.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Forest dept nod to filmmakers in R’bore draws flak||Jaipur: The state forest department has allowed wildlife filmmakers to shoot tiger pictures at Ranthambore National Park (RNP). The permission is in alleged violation of the ministry of environment, forests & climate change advisory as instruction were issued to shut all sanctuaries, national parks and other protected areas with immediate effect till further orders. A source in the department said the tiger reserve is closed for tourists and administration is making all efforts to minimise human-animal interaction in the forest to cut the risk of transmission of Covid from humans to wild animals. But, nothing much can be done to restrict filmmakers as permission has been provided by the higher authorities. “Earlier, three permissions were provided by the state government to shoot a wildlife movie. However, after Covid outbreak, two teams went and only one group of filmmakers are shooting at the park. As these filmmakers have prior commitments, the permission was issued by the higher authorities,” said a source. Recently, a driver ferrying wildlife photographers allegedly went off route and parked the gypsy to capture a shot of tiger T-112 and tigress T-03. After a complaint, the forest department immediately swung into action and banned the entry of the driver and the nature guide till the next order. A gypsy driver who wished not to be named said, “In absence of monitoring, these filmmakers may venture close to the animal. The authorities should not be allowed when Covid infection is spreading rapidly.” Meanwhile, a senior official at the park said all the precautionary measures were taken and filmmakers have also submitted their negative RT-PCR report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/forest-dept-nod-to-filmmakers-in-rbore-draws-flak/articleshow/82377364.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The university has received a letter from DM Jaipur office, requesting the university to be converted into a Covid facility, owing to the rising cases in the city. “The university administration has accepted the request made by the local administration by giving them the entire campus.

---||Coimbatore||Independent candidates fail to alter political landscape||Coimbatore: Challenging political giants, several professionals, industrialists and activists had contested as independent candidates in the state assembly election in the district.Several of them made a splash, toiled and made tall promises during the campaign. Even though many of them were confident of attending assembly sessions, the ground reality differed at large as voters seem to prefer political candidates to them.Of the 137 candidates, who contested from Coimbatore district, as many as 65 about 47% of them had contested as independents. While constituencies like Singanallur, Coimbatore North, Coimbatore South and urban segments of the district had more than 10 independents, the number of independents in rural segments like Pollachi and Valparai was low.Some of the independent candidates scored only single-digit votes or zero in several rounds. Even by the end of counting, they managed to gain votes only in double digits. In fact, the number of people voted for independents is much lesser than the number of people who opted for Nota.For instance, K Maniraj, an industrialist and president of the Kovai Power Driven Pumps and Spares’ Manufacturers Association (Kopma), who contested from Singanallur constituency, scored only 87 votes, which is just 6% of the Nota score of 1,407, and 0.10% of the winner’s score of 80,437. “Even though I am a resident of Cheran Managar, which falls under the Kavundampalayam constituency, I chose Singanallur because there are 1.5 lakh MSMEs, especially foundries, pumpset units and grinder industries there. I wanted to amplify the voices of industrialists in the assembly,” he said.The situation seems to be not much better for M Loganathan, an advocate-turned-activist, who contested from Coimbatore North. He had been rallying people, uniformly clad in white shirts and dhotis, during the campaign. As many as 200 people joined his campaign on the first day and several others had expressed willingness in social media platforms to join him. But the enthusiasm failed to turn into votes. Loganathan scored only 139 votes, 8% of Nota score of 1,678 and 0.17% of the winner’s score of 80,815 votes.Requesting anonymity, an independent candidate said, “I wanted to bring a change at least in my segment. But voters seem to be unwilling and have braced themselves to live with complaints for another five years.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/independent-candidates-fail-to-alter-political-landscape/articleshow/82377373.cms||Nivedha Selvam

In its affidavit filed in response to the HC’s query in the suo motu PIL on Covid-19, the Centre stated that its supply between April 21 and May 9 would be 3.07 lakh remdesivir vials from all seven manufacturers. The state government had last week demanded 4 lakh more vials after the central government decided to allocate the drug to states centrally on April 21. The centre also stated that it is to import 4.5 lakh remdesivir vials from Gilead Sciences Inc of the US and Eva Pharma from Egypt in the near future to meet the increasing demand. The central government also supplied information regarding the allocation of oxygen to Gujarat. It said that on April 26, the state of Gujarat lifted 904 MT of oxygen of the allocated 975 MT, against the Centre’s estimated requirement of 1,000 MT. The state has a production capacity of 847 MT, the central government said. Regarding the increasing oxygen demand in Gujarat, the Centre has projected an increase in active Covid cases from 1.33 lakh on April 28 to 1.72 lakh on May 5. With this, the oxygen requirement will also increase from 301.06 MT to 505.12 MT for patients occupying 29,247 oxygen and 5,161 ICU beds in hospitals across the state. To meet the increasing demands, the Centre has laid down plans on a war footing to send seven naval ships to transport consignments of the gas, and to commission 500 more pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen plants at hospitals across the country in the near future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/centre-to-allocate-3-07l-remdesivir-vials-to-gujarat/articleshow/82377395.cms||---

But with an increasing demand for this drug, doctors are unable to administer this injection to most of them who require it. “We had our first baby and my wife tested positive. She was admitted in the PGI for her delivery. But after she was given medicines by the doctors, her viral load decreased and after a week she was discharged from the ICU,” said the patient’s husband. The UT administrator had asked the health department to ensure that there is adequate availability of the drug, but the supply is not meeting the demand. “We are not able to get sufficient vials that can be given to those who really need them during the emergency. Our requirement varies from 8 and 10 vials every five days or so,” said a doctor at the Covid hospital in PGI. The drug is not allowed to be sold in the open market and is supplied only to hospitals. “I have a doctor who has been pleading to me to save her mother who needs the medicine. And there is also my staff doctor who needs the medicine timely. It is becoming difficult to choose and save people,” said the doctor. Sources said many pregnant women have been saved, some discharged while others are out of ventilator after Tocilizumab was injected. “However, there is a window period of 1-2 days when the medicine has to be administered, else it is of no use,” said a senior doctor in Covid hospital at PGI. There are some substitutes including, Bevacizumab, an injection given for cancer. Even the Punjab's department of health family welfare had issued an order recently that since Tocilizumab is not manufactured in the country, Itolizumab or injection dexamethasone can be used instead. “We are not using this drug as it has not been tested so far and do not want to take this risk," said a doctor in PGI. The city along with Punjab has been allocated 400 vials of Tocilizumab and the company which has given these drugs, has asked to give a large share out of this to Punjab, informed officials in the UT health department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/life-saving-drug-still-in-short-supply/articleshow/82376586.cms||Shimona Kanwar

The probe started after the central district police arrested two people from inside Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium on May 2 during the IPL match between Rajasthan Royals and Sunrisers Hyderabad team, an official said. The two suspects, Krishan Garg from Swaroop Nagar and Manish Kansal from Jalandhar, Punjab, were found in possession of a forged pass, which allowed them access to all areas inside the stadium, sources said. They were caught while attempting to enter the VIP lounge. What made the cops suspicious was that the two could not give any satisfactory reason for their presence there. While cops remained tight-lipped on the arrests, an official said on being promised anonymity that the police headquarters had transferred the case to the Crime Branch given the in-depth investigation required in the matter. The official could not confirm if the two suspects were bookies, but said they had claimed to be part of a cricket association. Their claims have to be verified, said another official.tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/police-probe-ipl-fixing-attempt/articleshow/82395747.cms||---

It took the total number of cases to 82,689.With 1,063 people discharged, the number of active cases crossed the 8,000-mark to reach 8,188. With 73,772 people getting cured, the recovery rate stood at 89.2%.The district also recorded three deaths due to the virus, taking the toll to 729. The deaths included a 44-year-old man, who died three days after hospitalization and a 51-year-old man, who died after four days of hospitalization in Coimbatore Medical College Hospital (CMCH) on Saturday due to bilateral bronchopneumonia, despite having no comorbidities. The third victim was a 72-year-old man, who died after three days of hospitalization in CMCH.With the number of cases continuing to be on an upward trend, the dismal shortage of vaccine stocks continued to make people desperate — especially those who are due for their second dose. Vaccine stocks dropped to 2,740 on Monday, with no doses in private hospitals and 30 in the district storage unit. Smaller GHs and PHCs had 2,310 doses. At multi and single specialty hospitals in the district, including Masonic Hospital, Gem Hospital, PSG Hospitals and Kovai Medical Center and Hospital, stocks ran dry on Sunday.After the centre allowed private hospitals to procure vaccines directly from vaccine manufacturers, some hospitals in the city that contacted Serum Institute of India (SII) directly, were advised to procure from the state government. The company reportedly told the hospitals that they are finding it challenging to meet independent requirements from a large number of private hospitals. “We urge you to access the vaccine when it becomes available in the private market supply chain channels, which will take five to six months from now,” said additional director — sales at Serum Institute, Dinesh Gundi. “We will try to shorten our timelines,” he added.Another hospital on Race Course that contacted SII on telephone, was told that even a small batch of 4,000 to 5,000 doses would take more than a month to deliver on priority basis.Health department officials here were also helpless. “We are besieged by calls from private hospitals, but we honestly don’t have any information on when stocks would arrive. The situation is the same across the state,” said deputy director of public health Dr G Ramesh Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/coimbatore-faces-covid-19-vaccine-shortage-amid-surge-in-new-cases/articleshow/82377369.cms||---

The danger was flagged by activists and doctors working at the centres during video conferencing recently. The new vaccination phase, covering people in the age group of 18 to 44 years, was launched on May 1. The ZP has opened 14 vaccination sites for this age group across the district. These centres are mainly at tehsil and bazaar towns. District immunisation officer Dr Sachin Ekde told TOI on Monday, “The crowding occurs at vaccination centres mainly due to walk-in registration by citizens above the age of 45 years.”  Some tehsil administrations have chalked out crowd management plan. Dr BB Gadve, tehsil health officer, Khed, said, “We have roped in two staffers to manage the crowd and check registrations on CoWIN app.” The shortage of vaccine is one of the main reasons for this situation, said an official. Edke, said, “The ZP has already demanded more doses of vaccines, which are likely to come in the next two day.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/worry-over-long-queues-at-vax-sites/articleshow/82376588.cms||Sandip Dighe

Considering the increasing number of Covid patients in the city, the different market associations decided voluntarily to aid the efforts to curb infection in the city. The associations have asked the district administration for permits for the delivery boys so that people do not need to come out of their homes to buy groceries. “We held a meeting with the officials and expressed our concern and the decision to keep our shops closed and to provide groceries at door steps of customers,” said a member of the Nallah Bazaar Association. They will keep the markets closed even during the time they were allowed to stay open — 6am to 11am — as people gather in crowds during these hours. The samitis of different colonies also came out to apeal to the people to remain at home and to avail home delivery of groceries. “If we develop a system (for home delivery), then we can successfully curb Covid infections,” said a member of Vaishali Nagar development committee.

The number of voters who opted for NOTA is considerably higher than the votes scored by many independent candidates.A first-time voter S Vishnuprasad said, “I voted for NOTA to register my displeasure. I did not want to cast my vote for the candidates of major political parties. But at the same time, I did not want to waste my vote by casting it for independent candidates who will not win the seat due to obvious reasons.

---||Lucknow||Awaiting repair, dilapidated wall of Lucknow University’s iconic Lal Baradari collapses||LUCKNOW: A dilapidated wall of Lal Baradari – over 200-yearold historical marvel on Lucknow University campus – collapsed on Sunday. The Nawabi era building was in a bad shape and the wall of the historical monument had developed wide cracks. In 2019 and 2020, TOI had reported about the urgent need for repair of the wall to save it from collapse. The photographs of the collapsed wall went viral on social media on Monday, drawing the anger of students, teachers and alumni over university’s negligence to conserve the building. The cracks on the wall had widened in the university’s centenary year following rain in January last year further endangering the iconic building. “LU should have not waited for the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) for a small repair. The wall could have been saved had the authorities not invested a huge amount in centenary celebration and paid a little attention to the damaged wall,” Abhinav Kumar Srivastava, a BA student, said. He said last, students had formed a group to collect money since LU was not doing anything to save the monument. “However, when we went to meet the officials they said we shouldn’t intervene in the university’s matters. They said LU did not have funds to save the monument,” he claimed. President of Lucknow University Teachers’ Association (LUTA) Prof Vineet Kumar Verma said, “It’s very unfortunate that LU couldn’t save the historical building in its centenary year. The wall collapsed due to the negligence of the university.” “LU gets crores of rupees as funds for building repair but it never paid attention to a monument that is the identity of the city and of the university. For the last three years, the wall had been facing the threat of collapse, but LU had turned a blind eye to the issue,” a senior faculty member at the university said. Last year, when TOI published pictures of the dilapidated state of the building, superintendent of Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) Manoj Saxena had advised that the wall cracks need to be “stitched” (a restoration technique of weaving in stones) immediately. LU spokesperson Durgesh Srivastava said, “In 2020, a committee was formed to work for the maintenance and conservation of the monument.LU registrar Vinod Kumar Singh has written a letter to ASI for help.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/awaiting-repair-dilapidated-wall-of-lus-iconic-lal-baradari-collapses/articleshow/82378110.cms||Mohita Tewari

The IAF has started preparing a 75-bed hospital at Sagarmal Gopa Government Senior Secondary School here, which will be ready in next one or two days. District collector Ashish Modi confirming this said that the district administration is in talks with officers of defence forces deployed in Jaisalmer. They have assured the administration of all possible help. Modi said that BSF has sent a few beds to Jawahar Hospital in Jaisalmer. The district administration has marked a building for the BSF personnel to be quarantined when they come back from election duty. Last year around 500 Indian citizens were airlifted from Iran to Jaisalmer and kept at a military station in Jaisalmer for around three months. Modi said that considering the increasing cases, a new hospital is being built. He added that if needed, then doctors and nursing staff of forces will also be roped in. Apart from this, many other private hospitals are being acquired for Covid-19 patients. Buildings of different communities, societies too have have been acquired to quarantine people. A 24-hour Covid war room has been set up for the public. Flag march was taken out under collector Ashish Modi and SP Ajay Singh at the main market on Monday where public was asked to strictly follow administration’s orders and not venture out without any valid reason. Oil India had also provided three tankers of 30MT to the state government for transporting oxygen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/air-force-steps-in-to-help-jaisalmer-fight-pandemic/articleshow/82377398.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Why no arrests yet in Sunrise hosp fire, victims’ kin ask DGP||MUMBAI: It has been more than a month since the FIR was filed in the fatal Sunrise Hospital fire at Bhandup, but there have been no arrests yet, the families of the victims complained to director general of police (DGP) Sanjay Pandey on Monday. Pandey has asked the Mumbai police commissioner to carry out a thorough probe into the incident. On March 25, a major fire broke out in Dreams Mall and spread to Sunrise Hospital, a dedicated Covid facility, located on the third floor. Eleven bodies were found and over 70 patients rescued. Two days later, Bhandup police booked six people—Rakesh Wadhwan, Sarang Wadhwan and Deepak Shirke of HDIL that owns the mall, and Amitsingh Trehan, Nikhita Trehan and Sweety Jain of Privilege Healthcare Services that managed Sunrise Hospital—under IPC 304 for culpable homicide not amounting to murder. “But till date, there has been no action from the police or any other authorities. We have urged the DGP to conduct a fair and fast probe and give us justice. Even the BMC has not done any investigation,” said Ashish Das, who lost his father Govindlal Das in the fire. BJP corporators Vinod Mishra, Prabhakar Shinde, Bhalchandra Shirsat and MLA Mihir Kotecha were also part of the delegation that met the state DGP. Sunrise Hospital had started functioning as a Covid facility in October 2020 with a provisional occupation certificate (OC). “The BMC has not carried out any departmental inquiry yet,” said Mishra. “The provisional OC was given via a WhatsApp group. The civic building proposal department’s report was overlooked and the provisional OC not revoked in time. We have raised all these points before the DGP and he has asked the police commissioner to carry out a thorough probe,” he added. The civic department had raised a red flag in August last year stating that the grant of provisional OC must be reviewed and that it wasn’t proper to de-link the irregularities of Dreams Mall from Sunrise Hospital. However, despite the detailed report, the BMC had neither reviewed or revoked the provisional OC then. It was finally revoked after the fatal fire. “There must be a criminal probe against all BP department officials who handled the file. If there is no action now, we will take legal action along with the victim’s families,” Mishra warned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-why-no-arrests-yet-in-sunrise-hosp-fire-victims-kin-ask-dgp/articleshow/82378116.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: For asymptomatic patients, hospital inks deal with 2 hotels||JAIPUR: Asymptomatic patients living in small spaces, home isolation is a challenge. The agreement inked by Mahatma Gandhi Medical College and Hospital with Sitapura-located hotel Marigold and Ginger hotel on Hawa Sadak road could address the worries of such patients who are wary of transmitting the disease to other family members. As per the MoU with Marigold, asymptomatic patients have to pay a maximum Rs 5,000 per day for services like treatment, medicines, tea, breakfast, lunch dinner, low-flow oxygen, and masks. While the MoU with Marigold was under high-class category, the tie-up with Ginger was done under medium class with per day charges of Rs 4,000 entitling the same facilities. Even though the scheme was launched in last September, it did not take off because the supply of beds was higher than the number of patients reported daily at that time. Also, the virus was less virulent compared to the second wave, said hoteliers in the city. TOI had reported on Monday quoting promoters of leading hotel chains that the government should also allow tie-ups between hospitals and hotels for patients both asymptomatic and those who are in the process of recovery. Their view was that those patients who are on recovery mode and are not critical can be shifted to hotels under an arrangement with the hospitals so that the beds can be used for other needy patients. But Siddharth Mahajan, secretary (medical and health), told TOI that currently the availability of beds is not an issue. “There is no shortage of beds. We need more oxygen, not beds.” In fact, many industrial and services units are offering their spaces for creating Covid care facility. But it seems that the government does not need them now. A hotelier said that the MoU can only work if there is enough volume. “Once a hotel keeps Covid patients, it will be difficult for it to give it to other guests or guests will not prefer to stay in the hotel. That’s why, a hospital needs to commit a minimum number of rooms so that it becomes viable for the hotel to keep Covid patients,” said the hotelier.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/for-asymptomatic-patients-hosp-inks-deal-with-2-hotels/articleshow/82377406.cms||---

The civic chief Abhijit Bangar said that the injection can be procured only through the designated district officer; and hospitals cannot ask patients to get them, as it will lead to a desperate search by citizens to procure the same, leading to black-marketing. “As per ICMR’s guidelines, hospitals cannot give prescriptions to relatives of patients to purchase Remdesivir shots. A proper system has been put in place,” said a civic official. The notices ask the three hospitals to explain why the ICMRprocedure was not followed, and ask why legal action should not be initiated against them. RTI activist Anarjit Chauhan said: “Just last week, two families of patients told me they had to shell out Rs 4,000 to Rs 7,000 for these injections, which is much higher than the base price.” —Vijay Singh||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-notice-to-3-hosps-that-told-kin-to-get-covid-inj/articleshow/82378126.cms||---

One such incident came to light in Bahla village, an area within the desert where only 4x4 vehicles can ply. A villager tested positive and on getting the report, a school principal, a BLO and an ANM deployed as frontline warriors drove to the area but their vehicle got stuck in sand forcing them to walk for four hours in pitch dark conditions with the help of a torch and mobile light and reached the destination. He provided medicines and directed the patient to follow the Covid guidelines and stay in isolation. District collector Ashish Modi said there are places in the district where one has to travel for hours. Many corona warriors deployed in such remote areas are playing an important role in providing relief to patients and supporting the district administration in preventing this disease. Bahla is around 150km from the district headquarters. Principal at a government senior secondary school and PIO Ravi Kumar Meena, BLO Gyan Prakash and an ANM provided 10 kits to the patient.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/frontline-warriors-walk-for-4-hrs-to-help-covid-patient/articleshow/82377399.cms||---
---||Nagpur||IIT-B team fine-tunes nitrogen plant setup to generate oxygen||NAGPUR: The Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Bombay, may have found yet another creative solution to address the shortage of medical oxygen for the treatment of Covid-19 patients in the country. The pilot project, which has been tested successfully, relies on a simple technological hack: conversion of PSA (Pressure Swing Adsorption) Nitrogen Unit to PSA Oxygen Unit. Initial tests done at IIT-Bombay have shown promising results. Oxygen production could be achieved at 3.5 atm pressure, with a purity level of 93%-96 %. This gaseous oxygen can be utilized for Covid-related needs across existing hospitals and upcoming Covid-19 specific facilities by providing a continuous supply of oxygen. How can the nitrogen unit be converted into an oxygen unit? Professor Milind Atrey, dean (R&D), IIT-Bombay, who led the project, said, “It has been done by fine-tuning the existing nitrogen plant setup and changing the molecular sieves from carbon to zeolite. Such nitrogen plants, which take air from the atmosphere as raw material, are available in various industrial plants across India. Therefore, each of them could potentially be converted into an oxygen generator, thus helping us tide over the current public health emergency.” The pilot project is a collaborative effort between IIT-Bombay, Tata Consulting Engineers (TCE) and Spantech Engineers, Mumbai, who deal with PSA nitrogen and oxygen plant production. A PSA nitrogen plant in the refrigeration and cryogenics laboratory of IIT was identified for conversion, to validate the proof of concept. To undertake this study on an urgent basis, an MoU was signed between IIT-Bombay, Tata Consulting Engineers and Spantech Engineers to finalize a SOP that may be leveraged across the country. Spantech Engineers installed the required plant components for evaluation using the infrastructure at the nitrogen facility at the refrigeration and cryogenics lab of IIT-Bombay. This setup for the experiment was developed within three days, and the initial tests have shown promising results, as mentioned above. Amit Sharma, managing director, Tata Consulting Engineers, said, “We are delighted to partner with IIT-Bombay and Spantech Engineers, and contribute towards an innovative solution for emergency oxygen generation using existing infrastructure towards helping the country tide over the current crisis.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Police order on fuel station timing creates confusion||JAIPUR: Fuel pump owners are in a fix after DCP (East) issued an order on May 1 stating that they must sell petrol and diesel between 6am and 11am contrary to the home department guidelines. As per the home department’s order on April 30, the fuel pumps were to remain open for private vehicles between 7am and 12 noon but the DCP (East)’s order altered the time causing uncertainty among dealers. Rajasthan Petroleum Dealers Association has written to the commissioner of police Anand Kumar Srivastava to clarify the order for smooth functioning of the fuel stations. The association has also faced difficulties in turning away customers who are allowed to go to factories, banks, and other offices as permitted by the home department order. A representative of the association said that since these people are allowed to commute, they also demand petrol and diesel after the stipulated hours. As per the guidelines, only busses carrying passengers, goods vehicles and people engaged in providing essential services can buy fuel after 12 noon. “Many people who commute daily to offices, factories and banks come and demand for fuels. When denied, they say the government has allowed them to go to their work places and they need fuel,” said the representative. He said the anomaly should be rectified.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/police-order-on-fuel-station-timing-creates-confusion/articleshow/82377417.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Cylinder manufacturers gasp for liquid oxygen||Ahmedabad: The production of oxygen cylinders in Gujarat has hit a roadblock with liquid oxygen supply to seamless cylinder manufacturers being hampered by the unprecedented surge in demand for the gas from hospitals. Liquid oxygen is used in the making of seamless cylinders which are used to store medical oxygen. In industrial applications, liquid oxygen is used to create high temperatures to make the bottom and neck of cylinders. These cylinders later carry medical oxygen to hospitals. Oxygen cylinder manufacturers in the state have been forced to halt production at their plants as they are unable to procure oxygen for manufacturing, say people aware of the matter. “The production of oxygen cylinders at our plant in Kandla Special Economic Zone (SEZ) has stopped for almost a week due to the shortage of liquid oxygen,” said a manufacturer. “Procurement of liquid oxygen for cylinder manufacturers from local suppliers has come to a halt as they (suppliers) need to supply it to hospitals to save human lives first. We are trying to procure liquid oxygen for cylinder makers from other states and are weighing the option of importing it,” said Dr Amiya Chandra, zonal development commissioner, Kandla Special Economic Zone (KASEZ). Kandla SEZ houses plants of two leading seamless cylinder makers, Everest Kanto Cylinder and Rama Cylinders. There is another plant operated by Rama Cylinders at Bhimsar in Anjar. These plants have supplied 53,000 cylinders ever since the second wave of Covid hit the country. They currently have pending orders for 1 lakh oxygen cylinders, said sources. According to the people in the know, suppliers of liquid oxygen to these cylinder makers say they are providing all their liquid oxygen to hospitals given the dire requirement of oxygen to save human lives. Supply to hospitals will be lower if liquid oxygen is provided to manufacturing cylinders. Cylinder makers are struggling to procure liquid oxygen for their plants despite the Union ministry of home affairs clarifying that the use of liquid oxygen for manufacturing oxygen cylinders is allowed. “There is also some confusion among the local authorities about permitting supply of liquid oxygen to cylinder manufacturers,” added a manufacturer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cylinder-manufacturers-gasp-for-liquid-oxygen/articleshow/82377413.cms||Kalpesh Damor
---||Kolkata||Nandigram RO refused recount as he got ‘life threat’, says Mamata Banerjee||KOLKATA: Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee on Monday alleged massive electoral malpractices in Nandigram, claiming that a returning officer had alleged a threat to his life while turning down Trinamool pleas for a recount and wondering how her lead of 8,000-plus votes “suddenly became zero” after a server breakdown and a power cut. Banerjee questioned the Election Commission’s “interest” in denying even a recount and said she would “definitely move court” against the decision. “How can an 8,000-vote lead suddenly become zero? The (EC) servers were down for four hours, there was no power for 40 minutes. The EVMs were changed,” she said, adding that the counting was supervised by “two very biased (EC) observers”. “A returning officer sent an SMS at 11 pm on Sunday night. I will not say to whom this was sent,” Banerjee said, reading out the message that came to her as a forward: “Sir, it is not my purview. Sir, please save my family. My family will ruin (sic). I have no other option but to commit suicide. Life threat is coming. I may be murdered. I had nothing to do. Please forgive me, I have a little daughter.” TOI later contacted the returning officer (a DM), who declined to speak on the issue and requested that he not be named. EC officials in Kolkata refused to speak on the issue. “Can you understand what took place? The returning officer is saying it is a question of life and death. He was working at gunpoint,” Banerjee said. “What is there to fear in a recount? Why did the EC not allow this? What is their interest? All the journalists saw (what happened). The governor called me. And then everything turned upside down. I haven’t seen such mafiagiri. I want justice to prevail. Will definitely move court,” she said, Banerjee said that the BJP would not have crossed even the 50-seat mark if the EC was fair. “The rest of the 77 seats are the EC’s contribution,” Banerjee said. The EC website late on Sunday said Banerjee lost to her BJP rival, Suvendu Adhikari, by 1,956 votes. EC sources had also indicated that a result announced by a returning officer could be challenged only in a court and the EC could not do anything. Banerjee demanded that all postal ballots, EVMs and VVPATs involved in the Nandigram vote be kept separately and sealed. “There should be forensic tests if the seals are tampered with. They should be kept in safe custody,” she said. “I am happy that the Supreme Court has upheld the Madras High Court order (on the EC’s handling of the Covid situation). People depend on courts for justice,” Banerjee said, referring to the apex court’s denial of an EC plea to stop media from reporting judges’ oral observations. “People have decided that BJP is not Shahenshah. I thank Bengal’s people (all religions and linguistic groups) for showing that their spine is still very strong. Our mothers and sisters have shown us the path,” Banerjee said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/nandi-ro-refused-recount-as-he-got-life-threat-says-didi/articleshow/82378119.cms||---

Nearly 2,000 faculty members involved in Covid-19 duties are pressing for their demands, which include the regularization of salaries for ad hoc teachers. In a representation sent to chief minister Vijay Rupani, the association has stated that it has brought its problems to the government’s notice in the past. “Unlike other officials in the health department who went on strike to see that their demands were met, the medical faculty trusted the government and hence did not take any aggressive stand,” according to the letter. But the government has failed to look into its demands and hence it is now forced to give an ultimatum to the government, the association said. For regular faculty members, the association wants salaries to be regularized for the remainder of their service period. This must be done in a single order, it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/medical-teachers-warn-of-stir-over-pay/articleshow/82377419.cms||---
---||India||Assembly elections: It may soon be too late to wake up, say Congress insiders||NEW DELHI: Talking about Trinamool Congress’s meticulous preparation against BJP in West Bengal, poll manager Prashant Kishore made a telling comment about Congress’s inability to fight BJP, saying that a party cannot get up a fortnight before polls and think it can win. The barb, aimed at the Congress leadership, has takers within the party as insiders are terming the debacle in five state polls as yet another wake up call and it may soon be too late. Leaders say there is an urgent need for the leadership to put competent and credible people in key organisational positions and bring about internal cohesiveness in the dissension ridden ranks. “Mere holding of election to the post of AICC president will not be enough,” is the refrain. The gloating in Congress over the BJP’s defeat in West Bengal is riling many as it is seen to ignore the GOP’s own dismal show. Young party spokesperson Ragini Nayak said, “If we (Congress) continue to find our happiness in the defeat of Modi, how will we introspect on our defeat?” The raging concern in Congress is that the party is again slinking away from investigating the defeat in Kerala and Assam because it may point fingers at leaders who are in key positions in the organisation. That the opposition alliance secured more votes than ruling BJP combine in Assam is being cited as evidence that there is need to sharpen poll strategising, arguing that introspection is not to apportion blame but to upgrade the skillsets within.  “There has to be an honest stock taking to upgrade jaded methods. The need is to put in place competent minds and it should have been initiated immediately after the 2019 defeat,” a leader said, suggesting that members may soon raise a demand for comprehensive organisational reshuffle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/it-may-soon-be-too-late-to-wake-up-say-congress-insiders/articleshow/82379351.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Thermal units to supply oxygen to govt hospitals||MUMBAI: Energy minister Nitin Raut on Monday announced Maharashtra’s ‘Mission Oxygen’ campaign under which the state’s thermal power generators from Mahagenco will soon produce medical oxygen—through existing ozonation plants—and refill 1,454 jumbo cylinders daily to cater to the demand from government hospitals. The plants include those at Parli, Koradi, Khaparkheda and Paras, which will be instrumental in daily production of 95% pure medical oxygen. There will be no hurdle in the routine electricity generation work at the power stations, reports Somit Sen. Mahagenco is the state-owned power generation utility with several thermal power stations across Maharashtra. Officials said the thermal plants will produce oxygen through their existing ozonation plants. “The government has also imported the latest technology compressors, filters and other essentials machinery from abroad. At Koradi, we plan to produce a record 1,002 jumbo oxygen cylinders per day,” the official said. Each jumbo cylinder can hold nearly seven cubic metres of oxygen. A senior Mahagenco official said, “In the first phase, the new Parli power station has set up an oxygen plant at Swami Ramanand Tirtha rural hospital in Ambejogai with a capacity of 288 jumbo cylinders per day and 95.2% purity. With the commissioning of this plant on April 27, Covid patients in Parli-Beed and neighbouring areas have already benefited.” In the second phase, medical oxygen supply will be achieved by Khaparkheda power station at a capacity of 42 cubic metre per hour and by Paras power station at 50 cubic metre per hour. “Mahagenco has started the process to complete the construction of this oxygen plant within the next one to one and a half months,” the Mahagenco official said. “We plan to supply 1,002 jumbo cylinders per day through Koradi power station, 128 cylinders per day through Paras power station, and Parli power will produce 216 cylinders of oxygen,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/state-thermal-units-to-supply-o2-to-govt-hosps/articleshow/82378968.cms||Somit Sen
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Ambulance calls go from 64,000 to 14,000 in a week||AHMEDABAD: What has the rule by the state government – prompted after the directive by the judiciary – done for EMRI 108 ambulance services? The permission to admit Covid-19 patients in any vehicles, coupled with downward trend of daily cases in a few districts, has resulted in four and a half times drop in daily calls for the service – the number of daily calls got reduced from historic high of 64,000 a day last week to 14,000 a day on Monday. Roughly translated, the call drop per minute is from 44 to 10. Experts believe that the drastic fall – which has brought the call volume back to realistic levels, even though it’s still more than 8,500 calls average pre-Covid – will help cut the response time. “In cities like Ahmedabad, a few hospitals insisted on the patients coming to the medical setting through EMRI 108 ambulances. While the number of such hospitals was few, the overall perception was about need of the ambulance to get admitted. The purpose of the move was to sustain the serious patient still they get to the hospital. It thus resulted in delay of over four hours in response time,” said an EMRI official. The data released by EMRI 108 on Monday also give a peek into the burden on the service – in April, the ambulances ferried 48,065 Covid-19 positive patients to hospitals at the average of 1,602 patients per day and 67 patients per hour. To put the figure in perspective, the April total was higher than six months preceding it, and January and February recording monthly figures lesser or nearer to April’s daily figures! But officials said that the recent drop is also due to multiple steps such as strengthening at-home treatment and reduction in cases in some districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ambulance-calls-go-from-64k-to-14k-in-a-week/articleshow/82378131.cms||Parth Shastri

The panel will give necessary suggestions to Team-9 on the basis of which the state can draw up plans for Covid management. Experts from SGPGI, KGMU, Atal Bihari Vajpayee Institute of Medical Sciences, and RML Institute of Medical Sciences will be part of this advisory committee. The departments of medical education and health have been directed to take necessary action in this regard. During the Team-9 meeting on Monday, Yogi said the current strain of Covid-19, which is rampant in UP, is at least 30-50 times more infectious than the strain encountered during the first wave. “In some cases, it has come to light that Covid tests are not able to catch it even though the chest CT scan is revealing an infection in the lungs. Therefore, more caution is required. For effective control and necessary strategizing to control virus, a panel of health experts will be constituted at the state level. This panel will be able to provide advice to Team-9 and consultation with health experts will be useful in formulating strategies,” the CM said. The CM has further directed that districtwise committees, on the lines of the state Team-11, should be set up immediately. These teams will have fixed responsibilities and daily reports on their working and strategizing will be sent to the chief minister’s office. In addition to this, the sectoral system under which magistrates are being appointed for various areas, will be implemented more vigorously, Yogi said. The sector magistrates have been directed to continuously take rounds of their respective areas. “They should also visit the areas outside the hospitals and help people in distress. An eye should be kept on all big and small needs of people. They should provide facilities and all help to people as per government policies. This system will be helpful in public interest,” said a government spokesperson.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cm-yogi-moots-health-panel-to-rein-in-corona-spiral-help-team-9-draw-plan/articleshow/82378124.cms||Neha Lalchandani

She lost to Samajwadi Party (SP) candidate Pramod Kumar. Sandhya had contested the previous elections on a SP ticket and was elected as chairperson of Mainpuri district panchayat. However, she lost zila panchayat polls 2021 from ward 18 (Ghiror III) by less than 1,000 votes. Talking to TOI, zila panchayat member, Pramod Kumar said that in panchayat elections, candidates are important rather than the party. “Voters select candidates who work on the ground, provide help when needed and share the grief of the people. I had been doing all this and that’s why I won,” Kumar said, adding that BJP candidates can’t cash on their netas’ faces alone in these rural polls. District president of SP, Devendra Yadav, said that counting is still going on in some seats, but trends show that out of the 30 zila panchayat members, 13 candidates are from his party and five are from the BJP. Remaining 12 seats will possibly be won by Independent candidates. He added that five candidates from BJP will win "only due to some rebel SP candidates, who will cut into the party's votes". Sandhya Yadav jumped to BJP after her husband Anujesh Yadav joined the party in 2019. In 2017, a no-confidence motion was moved against Sandhya just after a week when her husband, Anujesh, who was member of the Firozabad zila panchayat and was close to Shivpal Yadav, was expelled from the party for signing a motion against the local zila panchayat president, Vijay Pratap. Pratap is a close associate of Ram Gopal Yadav. Later, the motion was withdrawn after 11 members submitted an affidavit disassociating themselves from the decision. BJP district president Pradeep Chauhan said that it is the people’s mandate and they have to accept it. He refused to comment on the reasons behind the party candidate's surprise defeat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/mulayams-nieces-flip-to-bjp-flops-in-panchayat-election-in-mainpuri/articleshow/82375892.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Shukla claims political vendetta, asks court to stay police probe||Mumbai: As interim relief from the Bombay high court, Rashmi Shukla, former commissioner of state intelligence, wants the investigation launched against her by the government stayed and the police to be restrained from taking “any coercive step” against her. Her contention is that the state is attempting to “victimise” her to “settle political vendetta” so that she “withdraws her report just as former commissioner of police Param Bir Singh was also pressured by the senior police officer to withdraw the complaint against the former home minister”. On March 26, the state had registered the FIR alleging an unknown person got hold of Shukla’s “confidential report” and handed it to opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis in an “illegal manner”, violating the Indian Telegraph Act. On April 26, cybercrime police summoned Shukla. She now apprehends arrest. Fadnavis had cited her report after API Sachin Waze’s arrest, leading to allegations from the MVA that phones were tapped sans permission. Shukla said as state intelligence chief, last year, she hadnoticed information of corrupt practices between politicians and police officers “over favourable postings and transfers” . She said “with permission of competent authority”, phones of certain politicians and police officers were kept under surveillance, and on August 20, a detailed report made. On August 25, she submitted the report to then DGP Subodh Jaiswal. Shukla said she had shown CM Uddhav Thackeray the “damaging call transcript and data” on August 11, and again on August 16, and he had “asked for certain details”. She said former home minister Anil Deshmukh “did not grant her time” when she sought to brief him, and on September 2, 2020, she was “illegally and arbitrarily transferred” to post of DG (civic defence). Shukla said the state created nine DG posts sans cabinet and home ministry nods. The transfer order was silent on character of duty assigned, showing the state’s “mala fides”, she said. When Deshmukh met her in September, he “brusquely informed” her that the transfer was “for submitting” the report. The petition has not made Deshmukh a party, but is versus the state through BKC police station, assistant police commissioner K B Irani and CBI. Shukla’s petition said instead of taking action against the “wrongdoers”, the state “arbitrarily relieved then DGP (Jaiswal)...to CISF as DG in January 2021”. Seeking urgent hearing for May 4 before the bench of Justices S S Shinde and Manish Pitale, her lawyer wrote the “approach of the state is to arm twist the petitioners by bogus and frivolous case”.  Shukla’s petition said AG Ashutosh Kumbhakoni had informed HC during the hearing of an earlier PIL by Singh that her report had been considered and the “file closed” since “nothing of substance was found”. The phone surveillance permission was “granted many times by then additional chief secretary Sitaram Kunte from July 17-29, 2020,” her petition said, adding that as the probe progressed, more numbers were added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-shukla-claims-political-vendetta-asks-court-to-stay-police-probe/articleshow/82377453.cms||---

A camp office of the Jalesar MLA has been vandalised as well. The incident took place when the supporters of the gram pradhan candidate arrived at the MLA's residence demanding the recount. The MLA had refused to recommend a recount to the district administration, though. The gram pradhan candidate Rajni Devi lost election from Samaspur village. Her supporters allegedly went on a rampage after the MLA refused to meet them. The MLA conveyed that the counting process is taking place in a "fair and transparent manner". Superintendent of police Rahul Kumar said, “The MLA is safe and is in home isolation. The supporters of the candidate who had lost the election by a margin of three votes attacked the MLA camp office. They broke chairs, tables and plant pots. Four people have been arrested. An FIR has been registered." Meanwhile, in violation of the social distancing norms, a large crowd of supporters of candidates remained outside the poll counting centres. Final results for the post of district council presidents are yet to be announced.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/mlas-etah-house-attacked-over-demand-for-poll-recount/articleshow/82375900.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Mumbai||Private hospitals start drive at Rs 850 a shot, BMC to resume free second jab for 45+||MUMBAI: The ‘privatised’ leg of the Covid-19 vaccination drive started in Mumbai on Monday as a few private facilities procured vaccines on their own and began inoculating those over 18. From Rs 250 a jab until last week, recipients had to shell out Rs 850 for Covishield at the private hospitals. For those seeking free doses, BMC announced it would restart the drive for the over-45 age group—albeit for those seeking a second jab. “We will resume free vaccinations for first shot in the 45-plus age group from Wednesday if we get adequate vaccines,” said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. He added that BMC was likely to get a stock of 1 lakh doses between Monday night and Tuesday morning. The BMC will, for the first time, also do vaccinations in a non-healthcare setting, the Kohinoor Parking lot in Dadar, from Tuesday. The BMC continued with its token drive for the 18-44 age group for the third day in a row, immunising 2,394 from the lot of 20,000 vaccines it got from the state government. Although the drive for over 45-plus was halted for four days due to a stockout, the daily update showed that 410 shots were given to senior citizens and another 375 in the 45-59 age group. “This was given in private hospitals that have started vaccination using stocks they have perhaps purchased directly from Serum Institute of India,” said BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare. H N Reliance Hospital in Girgaum and Apollo Hospital in Nerul were the private hospitals that started the drive, and Nanavati Hospital will start Tuesday onwards. A civic official said that private hospitals can vaccinate any age group with vaccines they procure. Meanwhile, as per data from the Union health ministry, Maharashtra on Monday had 23,547 doses of doses left but 10.5 lakh more were in the pipeline and would be received by the state in the next three days. It also said that percentage of wastage reported by the state was 0.2%. Maharashtra carried out a record 5.5 lakh vaccinations in a day a few days ago and the state has been demanding adequate stocks as per its performance. Public health minister Rajesh Tope said the state could scale up its capacity to vaccinate eight lakh daily, but the pace has been affected due to the shortage. A state official said the 10.5 lakh stock in the pipeline will merely last three days. “We are hoping to get some stock by Tuesday, but there is no clarity on the quantity," said the official. On Sunday, the state managed to vaccinate 47,693 people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/pvt-hosps-start-drive-at-rs-850-a-shot-bmc-to-resume-free-2nd-jab-for-45/articleshow/82378978.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Towering figure & a darling of controversies||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala Congress (B) chairman R Balakrishna Pillai passed away at a private hospital at Kottarakara on Monday. He was 87. Pillai, who played a stellar role in Kerala politics, was not keeping well for some time owing to age-related illness. Pillai is survived by son Ganesh Kumar, daughters Usha and Bindu. Former union shipping secretary K Mohandas and former additional chief secretary T Balakrishnan are his sons-in-law. Pillai entered politics at a very young age. Though he started as a communist during his school days, Pillai was soon attracted to the Congress when he chose to become a fulltime politician. Pillai was one of the founding leaders of Kerala Congress when it was formed under the chairmanship of Congress leader KM George in 1964. After the death of George in 1976, Pillai left Kerala Congress and formed the new party Kerala Congress (B). He also played a key role in the formation of UDF. He left the Kerala Congress following his rift with K M Mani. Pillai had been part of LDF from 1977 to 1982 before he deserted the front to join the UDF in 1982. He left UDF in 2015 and once again became a part of the LDF. Throughout his public life, Pillai worked closely with the NSS. Pillai was known for his administrative skills, quick decisions and fiery speeches. His nature of sticking resolutely to administrative decisions earned him both laurels and brickbats. He was expelled from the state cabinet by then CM K Karunakaran for his controversial Punjab model speech. He lost his ministership when Congress took offence to his call to the youth in state to emulate Punjab, where the Khalistan movement was rife. He was also the first MLA to be disqualified by the house under the provisions of anti-defection law when he, after a merger with Kerala Congress (J), came out to resurrect his own party. He was also the first minister to be punished by the court in the light of vigilance findings that the work order given for building a tunnel in connection with Idamalayar hydel project resulted in a loss of Rs 3 crore to the state exchequer. Though he was given a one-year rigorous imprisonment sentence, he was released from prison by the Oommen Chandy government under a remission granted by the government on the occasion of the 55th formation day of Kerala. Pillai used to term the sentence as a gift his political opponents had brought on him for serving the people. Born as the only son of Kottarakara Keezhuttu Raman Nair and Karthyayani Amma in 1934 at Valakom in Kottarakara, Pillai was elected to the state assembly at the age of 25. Pillai first became a minister in the C Achutha Menon government in 1975. He was in charge of transportation, excise and prison departments then. He got ministership in various ministries till 2004 and on most occasions his portfolios were power or transport. Pillai was elected to Lok Sabha from Mavelikkara in 1971 and successfully contested in eight assembly elections. In 2017, he was appointed as the chairman of Kerala Munnokka Vikasana Corporation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/towering-figure-a-darling-of-controversies/articleshow/82376672.cms||---
---||Agra||Uttar Pradesh: Goons damage loudspeakers in mosque, chant ‘Jai Shri Ram’||AGRA: A group of anti-social elements entered a mosque in Mathura’s Bada Bazar area in Govardhan on Monday and allegedly raised slogans of “Jai Shri Ram” apart from damaging some loudspeakers. The episode took place during the lockdown in the district. An FIR has been registered against eight people. A video of the incident has gone viral on social media. In the video, a few youths can be seen coming down the stairs of Jama Masjid. Mohammad Riyaz, mosque’s imam who was present at the time, said the youths told him that they had come to remove the loudspeakers from the mosque. However, he said, he failed to understand why they were doing so. Mohammad Qadri, who lives in the neighbourhood, said some anti-social elements entered the mosque, chanting “Jai Shri Ram”. “When I questioned them, they said they have been ‘ordered’ from the top that no ‘azaan’ be allowed from here,” he alleged. “I have been staying here for the past 65 years and have never seen such anti-religious activity. They wanted to disrupt the peaceful atmosphere of the town.” Quoting Riyaz, police said the youths allegedly threatened him before going upstairs for removing the wires of the loudspeakers. They also damaged some of the equipment. The youths were part of the same group that had allegedly recited the “Hanuman Chalisa” in Govardhan’s Eidgah in November last year, police said. Shrish Chandra, superintendent of police (rural), told TOI that the incident took place around 11 am. On the basis of a complaint lodged by the mosque’s imam, an FIR had been registered against eight people under IPC sections 295-A (deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 506 (criminal intimidation) and for violating lockdown orders. He added that they would soon be arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/goons-damage-loudspeakers-in-mosque-chant-jai-shri-ram/articleshow/82375908.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: BJP, SP neck and neck in panchayat poll counting||LUCKNOW: As counting for UP panchayat elections picks pace, there were dramatic swings in fortunes of candidates backed by BJP and SP in the panchayat elections, touted as a bellwether of the high-stakes assembly elections next year. According to the state election commission, as many as 181 zila panchayat members, 38,317 gram pradhans and 2,32,612 gram panchayat members were declared elected by Monday evening. Counting was on at 826 block headquarters of 75 districts at the time of filing the report. The spotlight, however, was on zila panchayat wards, where political parties had thrown their weight behind candidates. Of 3,050 zila panchayat wards, results and trends of 2,300 wards show that while BJP-backed candidates were leading or won in around 700 seats, SP-supported candidates had bagged or were leading in 690 wards. The Mayawati-led BSP was at a distant third position with its 270 zila panchayat wards in its kitty. The highlights of trends/results included the defeat of SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav’s niece, Sandhya Yadav, who had switched over to BJP, in Mainpuri. Sandhya, sister of former SP MP Dharmendra Yadav, lost to SP-backed Pramod Yadav in ward number 18 of the district. The loss, experts said, was significant for BJP which sought to make deeper rural inroads in the pocket borough of Yadav chieftains. Sandhya, former chairman of Mainpuri zila panchayat, had faced an open rebellion after some SP members had moved a no-confidence motion against her. Ever since she had been hobnobbing with BJP. The BJP-backed candidate from Fatehpur Chaurasi-3 ward in Unnao, Shakun Singh, however, managed to post a win. BJP had earlier fielded Sangeeta Sengar, wife of rape convict and former BJP MLA Kuldeep Senger, from this seat. The party later cancelled Sangeeta’s ticket, following dissent within in party ranks. The Sengar family also did not contest from Makhi gram sabha as well. Another key highlight of Tuesday counting process was the defeat of 2015 Miss India runner-up, Deeksha Singh, who had taken a plunge in panchayat polls and was a contestant from ward-26 under Buxa block in the Jaunpur district. BJP-backed Nagina Singh emerged winner from the ward, even as Diksha finished a distant fifth. At the same time, Independent candidates were leading in most zila panchayat wards in Gorakhpur, home turf of CM Yogi Adityanath. According to reports, of 68 zila panchayat wards, Independent candidates were leading on 25, while BJP-backed candidates had gained leads on 20 wards, while SP candidates were front-runners in 13 wards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-sp-neck-and-neck-in-panchayat-poll-counting/articleshow/82378164.cms||Pankaj Shah

Ventilators are in use and intensive care unit (ICU) beds are full. Caretakers of patients in critical condition continue to face a harrowing time making rounds of different hospitals to find a bed. Patients are being made to wait for 15 to 20 hours for admission in hospitals. The emergency ward at SN Medical College (SNMC) here was full on Monday with two patients sharing a bed even as several waited for one. Despite orders of the district administration, private hospitals did not share details about availability of beds. Sharing his ordeal, Awas Vikas resident Mahesh Pathak said, “My 58-year-old mother was being treated at a private hospital since the last four days. On Monday, her condition deteriorated, and doctors referred her for intensive care at SNMC. But no ICU bed was not available there. I had to take my mother back to the same private hospital. Now, my family members and I are making rounds of other hospitals for a bed for her.” Awadhesh Verma of Mohanpura locality said, “My father tested Covid-19 positive on Friday. Now, his oxygen level is rapidly decreasing. He needs ventilator support. I have tried SNMC and over a dozen private hospitals but a ventilator was not available. Health department officials have directed us to wait for 24 hours. Now, I am trying to arrange for an oxygen cylinder to help my father.” A senior member of IMA Agra unit said, “Following an increase in Covid-19 cases, the demand for medical oxygen continues to rise. A majority of the hospitals involved in treating of Covid-19 patients are facing shortage of oxygen supply. Machines like BiPAP, HFNC and ventilators have stopped working at several hospitals. In such a situation, ICU beds are of no use.” Chief medical officer of Agra district Dr RC Pandey said, “We have 346 ICU beds and 115 ventilators in the district. Presently, all of them are occupied. We are coordinating with the IMA to increase the number of ICU beds and ventilators. We will overcome the crisis soon. Hospitals are required to share details regarding availability of beds and charges for treatment in accordance with the government orders,” he added. Meanwhile, 644 people were tested Covid-19 positive in the district on Monday. The number of active cases increased to 4,131. The health department reported yje death of four Covid-19 patients.

I have suggested to him that we create a paediatric Covid care ward, anticipating the next wave and the demographic it may target...,” Aaditya tweeted. “...We are now focussed on creating almost 6500 O2 beds and approximately 1500 more ICU/ HDU beds in the coming few days at the new jumbos coming up,” Aaditya tweeted.

---||Pune||Diabetes-Covid-steroids mix causing increase in fungal infections: Docs||Pune: A combination of diabetes, Covid-19 and a one-size-fits-all approach to steroid use has caused an upsurge in invasive fungal infections during the pandemic. Most big hospitals in Pune said they’re treating at least one case of an invasive fungal infection called mucormycosis or aspergillosis every day.Experts said rational use of steroids in diabetic patients, use of nasal anti-germ solutions such as betadine and sensitizing those who've recovered from Covid about post-infection red flags can avoid long-drawn treatments.“Steroids can increase blood glucose levels. These levels need to be controlled to avoid secondary bacterial and fungal infections,” said infectious diseases expert Parikshit Prayag, from Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital.The hospital has had more than 75 cases of mucormycosis and over 100 cases of aspergillosis (mainly referred by other hospitals) since last March. Both are invasive fungal infections. “A stable Covid patient without hypoxia (blood oxygen dipping below 92%) should not be put on steroids. Also, it should be the lowest dose for the shortest possible duration. When oxygen levels are normal, steroids can do more harm than good,” Prayag said.The role of a maxillofacial and dental surgeon is very important in the diagnosis of mucormycosis among patients who've been discharged after prolonged hospital stay. “Most Covid patients contract this fungal infection in hospitals' ICUs because of low immunity,” said maxillofacial surgeon JB Garde.Garde said mucormycosis usually sets in when discharged Covid patients are home-isolated for a few more days. These recovered patients initially start to experience stuffiness or nose blockage. “And slowly, they start to experience pain in the upper jaw region. This is the stage when other sinuses start getting involved," Garde said.Unfortunately, patients and doctors often dismiss these signs as regular post-Covid symptoms. Besides, most recovered patients seek guidance mostly via telephone. “Patients remain unaware of the problem until the infection reaches the eye and consumes most of the upper jaw from the inside,” Garde said. Treatment of mucormycosis is also very expensive. “Antifungal medicines such as Amphotericin cost nearly Rs 25,000 per day,” Garde added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/diabetes-covid-steroids-mix-causing-increase-in-fungal-infections-docs/articleshow/82376664.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Dehradun||Salt by-poll result another jolt for Cong and Harish Rawat||Dehradun: The defeat of Congress contender Ganga Pancholi in the Salt by-poll has yet again raised questions on the leadership of former state chief minister Harish Rawat as he had pushed for the ticket for his loyalist Ganga Pancholi over Ranjeet Rawat, a former two-time Congress MLA from the constituency. The recent defeat is even more crushing as Rawat was desperately looking for a win after he lost the Nainital seat with a margin of over 3 lakh votes during the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Earlier in 2017 Uttarakhand assembly polls, Rawat had lost two constituencies — Haridwar rural and Kichha. A day ago, Bharatiya Janata Party’s candidate Mahesh Chandra Jeena — the brother of late Surendra Singh Jeena Ji who won the constituency in 2012 and 2017 — won the Salt by-election with 4,697 votes. However, the Rawat camp was quick to claim that BJP only secured the by-poll with sympathy votes. “The decision to field Pancholi from the seat was a unanimous decision of the party and not an individual one. We all worked very hard but the BJP managed to secure sympathy votes. By no measure, this was the failure of the former CM,” said Surendra Kumar, spokesperson for Rawat told TOI. He also pointed out that Rawat campaigned for Pancholi despite being ill. “Soon after being discharged from a hospital in Delhi, he spent an entire day campaigning,” added Kumar. Meanwhile, Congress vice-president Suryakant Dhasmana said, “Salt assembly election was wrongly termed as the semi-final to the 2022 assembly polls. There was a sympathy wave for the BJP but despite that, we secured over 17,000 votes. This shows that people have supported us. The by-poll was not a one-sided affair but a keenly contested election.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/salt-by-poll-result-another-jolt-for-cong-and-harish-rawat/articleshow/82376663.cms||Kautilya Singh

In Jabalpur, some youngsters have created a website providing information about all the emergency service providers, similarly a few students in Katni district have formed support groups on WhatsApp to help those who need medical aid. It all started recently when a few Jabalpur-based friends - Yash Shrivastav, Anjali Shrivastav, Ranjit Morpudi, Vishwas Moge - decided to help people in distress. Soon, they were joined by others like Arunima Mishra, Ankit Choubey, Sharmista Banerjee, most of them students. In next two days, they built a website jbpcovidhelp.in, where they have put together details of all the people who could be of help, including oxygen suppliers, hospital owners, doctors, plasma donors, medicine suppliers in Jabalpur and nearby areas. These youngsters collect these important numbers and other details from available government as well as other resources and after verifying these, they put them on their site, said sources. In yet another endeavour, a young social worker Ankit Tripathi and his 10 friends started a group named Covid Fighters on social media in Katni, said official sources from Katni district administration. Now the group has more than 100 active covid fighters; they have connected at least 19 plasma donors with the needy patients in the last 7 days, besides finding ventilators for 7 patients in critical condition, said our sources. The youngsters are now planning to launch a website to facilitate plasma donation. The group is also gearing up to participate in the vaccination awareness campaign actively and motivate people to go for vaccination against Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/covid-fighters-turn-angels-for-needy-with-medicines-emotional-support/articleshow/82378171.cms||Amarjeet Singh

Aniket Joshi, a treating physician and intensivist at 10 Covid hospitals in Pune, said, “In terms of oxygen supply, the situation has slowly started improving. But this improvement needs to be sustainable.” Pramod Kubade, secretary of the Pimpri Chinchwad Hospital Owners Association, told TOI that the private hospitals were still reeling under tremendous pressure to keep up with the steady supply of oxygen. “A few hours of stock left is something that we are living with from the past few days and it seems there is no respite from that,” he said. S Chokalingam, administrative controller of Sassoon General Hospital, said they too had another close encounter last week when only a few hours of oxygen was left in their 28-tonne facility. “We had to use our emergency backup. There was fortunately no unfortunate incident,” he said. Sagar Gaikwad, chief administrative officer, City Care hospital, Pimpri, said they had to reject quite a few patients due to oxygen unavailability.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/medicine-crisis-continues-o2-flow-slightly-improves/articleshow/82376698.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The woman succumbed to the virus during treatment.” “We have also received a complaint that the gold ornaments of the woman are missing. We are probing it.” He said, “We have been receiving information about misplacement of gold ornaments of Covid-19 patients from Covid care centres in Pimpri Chinchwad. People can contact us with proofs. We will certainly take action against the suspects involved in such practices.” Meanwhile, the Pimpri police on Monday produced the three doctors before the court, which remanded them in police custody till May 6. One of these doctors works at auto cluster DCH. The other two are from a private hospital. They are accused of taking a commission of Rs 20,000 from the DCH doctor as part of “patient transfer”. The doctors were arrested on the basis of first information report lodged by Ulhas Jagtap, additional municipal commissioner, Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/police-custody-for-3-medicos-till-may-6/articleshow/82376679.cms||---

The court had ordered the CBI to look into the justice D K Jain committee report on some of the senior state police officers who had framed Isro scientist Nambi Narayanan in the espionage case. Narayanan had taken up the matter for taking action against the erring officers to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court vide its judgment on September 14, 2018, had awarded compensation of Rs 50 lakh to Narayanan and had ordered the constitution of a committee for obtaining actual scenario, including the arrest and false implication of Narayanan in the case and to find out ways for taking steps against the erring officers. Accordingly, a committee under the chairmanship of former SC judge D K Jain was constituted by the ministry of home affairs. The committee, after conducting an inquiry, had submitted its report before the court. Based on the inquiry report, the court had directed the CBI to proceed in the matter in accordance with law. Earlier, the case was registered by the state police on October 20, 1994, at Vanchiyoor police station in the capital against a Maldivian national under the Foreigner’s Act on the allegations of over staying in the country after expiry of her visa. Subsequently, another case registered at the same police station on November 13, 1994, under sections three and four of the Official Secrets Act 1923 against two accused Maldivian nationals, on the allegations that they, in collusion with some others, had taken part in the activities against the sovereignty and integrity of the country and had indulged in other activities which would harm the cordial relations of India with its neighbours. Later, the investigation of both the cases were entrusted to a special investigation team of the state police. Four more persons, including Narayanan, were arrested on charges of espionage activities. Later, investigation of these cases was transferred to CBI. In the espionage case, the CBI had submitted a final report before the CJM, Ernakulam, which was accepted by the court, in which it was said that the allegations pertaining to espionage were found to be false.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cbi-registers-case-in-isro-espionage-case/articleshow/82376701.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: ‘Asking Centre for 200 MT a day more’||AHMEDABAD: The state government on Monday told the Gujarat high court that looking at the shortage of medical oxygen against demand, the state government has been “continuously” requesting the Centre to allocate an additional 200 MT of oxygen per day. The government cited the Centre’s allocation of 975 MT against demand of 1,190 MT for last few days and submitted that it has been trying alternatives. However, it has been demanding more allocation, “…apart from finding other alternatives for manufacturing medical oxygen, the state is also sharing the actual figures of its projected requirement with the Central government, from time to time and thereby, continuously requesting the central government to allocate an additional 200 MT of medical oxygen.” The government said that besides the judicious use of oxygen by introducing continuous audit requirements, it has been trying hard to mobilize resources such as installing air separation units (ASU), PSA plants, conversion of nitrogen PSA plants to oxygen PSA plants, and taking the support of NGOs and corporates to set up additional PSA plants at hospitals. It aims to install 32 PSA plants in 22 state-run hospitals. It also said it is striving to get molecular sieves, called “Zeolite” or “Zeochem”, imported from a few manufacturers in Germany, France, the US and China.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/asking-centre-for-200mt-a-day-more/articleshow/82378172.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Lockdown fear forces people to stock grocery, food items||BHOPAL: Fearing prolonged and complete lockdown like last year, citizens are rushing to markets to buy extra grocery and other stuff in advance. Some have learned lessons from their neighbours who did not stored essential items including grocery and could not go out to buy stuff owing infection to all members of the family. For Suneet Gurjar, the 2020 lockdown was a big lesson. “I was under the impression that the lockdown would be for a few days and I took it casually. It was a big mistake for me as the entire family had to face several problems. We had to spend days on bread and toast and help from neighbours. Even my wife had to borrow flour from the neighbour,” said Gurjar. Learning lessons, Gurjar this year is not leaving stone unturned to ensure that the grocery should be at home in ample quantity. “What to do when there is no one to help? It's not just me who has bought extra stuff this time. Almost one of my friends is doing this. I can’t put my family in any kind of trouble,” Gurjar added. Inspite of closed shops, citizens came out in large number in the evening. “What to do when lockdown is hovering around. I have come out to buy necessary grocery and vegetable stuff,” said Nitin Soni, a private firm employee in Arera Colony. In Berkhera Pathani locality it looks like a full bloom market was on. Also the market was closed but people came out in large numbers to buy vegetables. “I m told that some grocery was available here. I took a chance. However, I am going back without buying groceries,” said Aniruddh Verma. Asked about the home delivery, citizens that the supply is erratic. “When I called the grocery store the shopkeeper told me that all grocery items were not available. He even suggested that i buy it from somewhere else. When I asked about any such shop, he knew his reply was no,” said Bansi Dua, a resident of Kolar locality. Situation in several places like Katara Hills and adjacent areas was such that people came out on the street like normal days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/lockdown-fear-forces-people-to-stock-grocery-food-items/articleshow/82378160.cms||Ramendra Singh

While during the initial days, unverified numbers and old leads had been rampantly shared over social media, these individuals have formed WhatsApp groups to divide responsibilities and work in a more organized manner — updating the spreadsheet twice daily by calling the numbers so that those in need are not harassed. “There are a number of posts on social media for oxygen, hospital beds, plasma donors and stockists for medicines, like Tocilizumab and Remdesivir, and people share them without even verifying if the numbers work or if the stockists have any supplies left. We realize how frustrating it gets for a patient and his family when the numbers don’t work or the people turn them down. Hence, we thought of forming a team of volunteers who do basic calling, prepare a fresh database every day and, if needed, make the necessary connections for delivery,” said Monali Sengupta, a doctor and a moderator of the West Bengal Covid Aid Network (WBCAN), a group of 250-plus volunteers. With growing demand for oxygen, beds and medicines, many genuine suppliers are finding it difficult to meet the demand and either keep their phones switched off or do not answer calls. “We understand even the genuine stockists are running out of supplies. We help the patients till their needs are met. We have also increased screening of the numbers we share as there has been a growing number of scammers circulating lists of numbers with an aim to loot patients,” said Tanumoy Naskar, a PG student of Jadavpur University. There are also a set of volunteers who screen Facebook, Instagram and Twitter posts on the issues, either by activating their database and contacts or personally supplying anything from medicines, to food and oxygen. “I have posted my number as a Covid volunteer in the Facebook community health section. I try to deliver the stuff myself or work with a team of other volunteers to deliver the supplies or arrange hospital beds, ambulances or safe homes,” said Snehashis Banerjee, a software engineer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/volunteers-sift-social-media-posts-to-connect-those-in-need-with-genuine-covid-resources/articleshow/82376772.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

In his tweet, Abdullah requested oxygen and hospital bed for Anand Pandey, 52, a lecturer at an inter college run by the Ayodhya royal family. He is Covid positive and his oxygen level is low, said the Kashmiri politician in a forwarded tweet. Talking to TOI, Puneet Tripathi, son-in-law of the ailing teacher, said, “His oxygen level is dipping dramatically. We contacted the medical college and government hospitals, but the lifesaver is unavailable. We also send SOS to public representatives and administrative officials, but got no help. My father-in-law is a teacher and our finances are slowly drying up. As citizens of a holy city, we are not receiving medical care.” Forwarded message: Dear Sir, Please help in oxygen cylinder and bed for patient in AyodhyaPatient Name Anand Pand… https://t.co/xJpb3999gK— Omar Abdullah (@OmarAbdullah) 1620042429000When TOI contacted Faizabad BJP MP, Lallu Singh, he said, “I have spoken to the district magistrate and trying to arrange for oxygen. Here, supplies are very low.” The Ayodhya Covid Care unit at District Women's Hospital has stopped admitting patients due to acute shortage of oxygen. Dr S K Shukla, chief medical superintendent of the hospital, confirmed to TOI that the hospital was facing oxygen crunch. “Three patients have died in three days due to lack of oxygen. Currently, there are more than 2,400 patients in the district and we have adequate beds, but oxygen supply is very erratic. In such a situation, admit patients at your own risk,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/omar-tweets-sos-for-ayodhya-covid-patient/articleshow/82378179.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan
---||Vadodara||Covid-19 in Gujarat: Cases dip, but positivity rate rises||AHMEDABAD: Consider it a silver lining for the state — the daily Covid cases have been dropping for three consecutive days. The tally dropped 12.2% in three days. But a close inspection reveals that the drop in cases could be attributed to the drop in testing, which also fell by 18.1% in three days. Thus, while the daily cases are falling slightly, the state is witnessing a rise in the test positivity rate (TPR). Compared to the TPR of 9% last Monday — meaning every 1,000 tests finding 90 positive cases — on May 3, the TPR was 9.7%, finding 97 positive cases for every 1,000 tests. An analysis of the figures reveals that testing has fallen in almost all districts. Of the four most populous districts, Ahmedabad topped with a TPR of 17.4%, followed by Vadodara (10.8%), Rajkot (5.5%), and Surat (5.3%). “Testing is one of the most important and basic tools for Covid control. The faster a person is identified as a positive patient, the quicker he/she can be isolated and further multiplication of the spread can be arrested,” said a city-based epidemiologist. “Aggressive testing has proved to be an effective strategy in many states and countries.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/cases-dip-but-positivity-rate-rises/articleshow/82381904.cms||Parth Shastri

The callers would then ask them to share the one-time password (OTP). “As soon as the victims would share the OTP, the fraudster would transfer money from their bank account linked with the Aadhaar number,” said a cyber police officer.

---||Delhi||Covid-19: Daily toll at 448, highest since pandemic hit Delhi||NEW DELHI: The daily toll of Covid-19 in Delhi reached another grim milestone on Monday with 448 deaths recorded in 24 hours – the highest since the pandemic began. This is the third day in a row when the national capital has reported more than 400 deaths in a day. On Saturday and Sunday, 412 and 407 deaths were recorded respectively. The total number of deaths due to Covid-19 in the national capital has reached 17,414, which is second-highest in the country after Maharashtra where 70,851 people have succumbed to the disease since the beginning of the pandemic. The number of new cases reported on Monday was 18,043 which is lower than Sunday’s 20,394 cases. However, this may be due to a decrease in testing. In the last 24 hours, data shared by the state health department shows, 61,045 tests were conducted compared to 71,997 tests recorded on Sunday. In April second week, the city conducted over one lakh tests, of which nearly 70,000 tests were done using RTPCR. The positivity rate of Covid-19 is around 30%. On the brighter side, Delhi’s recovery rate has increased. In the last 24 hours, officials said, 20,293 people recovered from Covid-19. The total number of active cases that had touched nearly one lakh last week has reduced to 89,592. The availability of oxygen and ICU beds, however, remains scarce. Data shared by the state health department shows 56% of the active cases are recuperating under home isolation. The number of patients admitted in various hospitals is 25,170, which is 28% of the total active cases. Despite that, there are very few vacant beds and ventilator beds are not available at all. “There are no oxygen beds available either. I couldn’t find a hospital bed for my mother and finally arranged an oxygen cylinder at home for her.” Pradeep Yadav, a resident of Sadiq Nagar, said. He added that even testing isn’t readily available. “Most labs refuse to do the test citing unavailability of staff for sample collection,” Yadav said. Public health specialists say strict lockdown is needed in areas with a high positivity rate to reduce the cases. “Our health infrastructure is overstretched. Doctors are facing burnout and mental trauma handling so many cases. But they are still continuing to work to save as many lives as possible,” said a doctor at Lok Nayak hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/daily-toll-at-448-highest-since-pandemic-hit-delhi/articleshow/82377537.cms||---

There is a strict prohibitory order by the Election Commission of India (ECI) against such processions. Some of them, including newly-elected members, have been booked for flouting Covid norms, police said. In Saharanpur's Harora Mustaqam village, the newly-elected pradhan Mohd Suleman and his supporters played loud music and were sloganeering in a victory march which is prohibited by both ECI and state. According to police sources, eight persons, including the pradhan, were booked for violating Covid protocol. Similarly, 25 were booked in Jogirampuri village in Nageena area where the newly-elected pradhan took out a procession with beating drums. Bijnor SP Dharamvir Singh said, "We have booked 25 people for flouting rules." Things went a bit too far in Baghpat's Rathoda village where the winning candidate Mohd Sajid started riding a camel amid a cheering crowd, in hundreds, in a long victory march. A purported video of the celebration has gone viral in which young men as well as the pradhan can be seen without any face masks. In fact, Covid norms were flouted rampantly when counting had begun on Sunday. Cops had to use force to disperse scores of curious onlookers at the counting centres. The Covid-19 guidelines went for a toss as a stampede-like situation was witnessed outside counting centres in several districts of the state. In Baghpat and Muzaffarnagar, police had to resort to lathi-charge as a large crowd of candidates, their agents and supporters assembled outside counting centres in the morning. This was despite the fact that the apex court had asked the UP government to appoint a nodal officer for each centre to hold him accountable for scrupulous implementation of the Covid norms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/victory-processions-a-new-headache-for-cops-in-up/articleshow/82375939.cms||Sandeep Rai

The accused went absconding during trial and was caught again only in 2017.  Two others were also found guilty in the case. The currency recovered were 30 notes of Rs 500 denomination. “The prosecution has proved that the accused, in agreement with other co-accused, was found in possession of counterfeit currency notes which were intended to be used as genuine, and the accused is therefore liable to be convicted,” the court said. The court, while sentencing accused Tarifullah Mohaldar guilty, held that considering the nature of offence and that he is still young, he is not entitled to be let off on a bond of good behaviour. Pointing out that while the maximum sentence was seven years imprisonment, the court said that one of the relevant factors for awarding five years is “the quantity of the notes found” in possession of the accused. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-5-years-jail-for-man-found-with-30-fake-notes/articleshow/82377520.cms||---
---||Goa||Oxygen crisis hits GMC patients, kin forced to get O2 from outside sources||PANAJI: Three days ago, a North Goa youth Dias received a late-night call from one of his relatives at Goa Medical College. “My uncle was being treated for Covid and I got a call from my aunt. She said the nurses said if we don’t arrange oxygen immediately, my uncle would not survive,” he told TOI. Dias (last name used to protect identity) then made a few frantic calls to his friends and managed to procure an oxygen cylinder through another friend who knew a person, Saish Aroskar, offering patients oxygen cylinders. Dias is not the only one who has had to hunt for oxygen cylinders in the night. “As more and more patients get admitted, the oxygen is just not enough. Without oxygen, many of these patients cannot be sustained. These are preventable deaths,” said a doctor on Monday, a day 46 people lost their lives in the span of 24 hours. A few days earlier, Goa reported 52 deaths. In fact, so severe has been the shortage that the contact numbers of oxygen manufacturers, suppliers and oxygen helplines are being shared on social media and among patients in the wards. Against the earlier demand for 10-15 trolleys of medical oxygen, GMC currently requires 55 trolleys to meet the increased caseload. Doctors, nurses and patients said that the supply of oxygen drops at least twice a day, which sends healthcare staff scrambling. “At night, doctors stole an oxygen cylinder from one ward to save a patient in another ward. They replaced it later,” a GMC source said. While ICU and critical wards have ports next to the beds for central supply of low flow oxygen, the ad hoc beds and wards which have been added because of the increase in Covid cases have to depend on oxygen cylinders. A few days earlier, a doctor at GMC said there had been some incidents of oxygen pressure dropping at night, where even a small fluctuation in oxygen pressure on the central oxygen system could prove fatal for patients. On Sunday, the Goa Association of Resident Doctors (GARD) wrote to health minister Vishwajit Rane, stating that the oxygen supply is “not even close to sufficient”, and that when supply gets over, “patients worsen and die”. Only then did chief minister Pramod Sawant and Rane, who were in denial over the issue till last week, admit to the oxygen crunch. Sawant has made two visits in as many days to GMC’s oxygen facility to evaluate the situation and try to improve capacity. State young Congress president Varad Mardolkar said that there is an irregular supply of oxygen. “Most of the calls we have been receiving are at night,” he said. “I have received calls from a few officials at GMC too, asking us to supply oxygen to certain patients. On Monday itself, we supplied 50 cylinders to relatives of patients at GMC,” he said. With the state government’s claims of “adequate oxygen” being exposed and Sawant saying that the oxygen tank, delivery pipelines and other infrastructure are being improved “but it would take some time”, faceless volunteers, good Samaritans and quick thinking are keeping patients alive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/oxygen-crisis-hits-gmc-patients-kin-forced-to-get-o2-from-outside-sources/articleshow/82377474.cms||Newton Sequeira
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Three minors con 24 in need of oxygen, Remdesivir; 2 held||LUCKNOW: Taking advantage of shortage of Remdesivir vials and oxygen cylinders, three students of classes IX, X and XI defrauded at least 24 people to the tune of lakhs of rupees on the pretext of supplying them the vials and the cylinders. Police succeed in nabbing two of them belonging to classes IX and X, while the third one is still at large. A patient, who urgently needed an oxygen cylinder, even died while dealing with them, the police said. DCP, central zone, Somen Barma said that multiple complaints were being reported about fake sale of Remdesivir vials and oxygen cylinders. “Several people, who needed the vials and cylinders, said that they had little option but to make calls on numbers mentioned on Instagram, Telegram and Twitter. The persons on the phone used to tell customers that first they would have to deposit Rs 3,500 for the vial and Rs 8,500 for the cylinder and only then the required drug and the cylinder would be sent to the address mentioned by them,” Barma said. He added that the fraudsters never revealed their location and the needy persons usually paid the amount. Thereafter, all those making the payment were blocked from contacting the cheaters, the DCP said. A cop privy to the probe said that in one of the cases the trio agreed to supply an oxygen cylinder to a needy person. However, the same patient died in the hope of getting a cylinder. “We traced them with the help of mobile numbers’ location given on the social media,” said sub-inspector Rahul Sonkar who worked out the case.Sonkar further said that the minors had confessed that their parents were unaware of their misdeeds. When money started coming into their parents’ account they told them that it was earned while performing a show on social media which earned them several ‘likes’. The SI said that all the three minors aged 15, 16 and 17 stayed in the same colony, but studied in different schools and are also average students. “Avarice for expensive I-phones and dining in five-star hotels led them to take the crime path,” Sonkar said. They have been sent to the juvenile home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/three-minors-con-24-in-need-of-o2-remdesivir-2-held/articleshow/82378174.cms||---
---||Pune||Home chefs whip up healthy food for Covid patients, their families||PUNE: Many home chefs in the city have joined the initiative to provide free meals for Covid-19 patients in their areas. Bhavesh Utmani, an IT professional, who is a home chef during the weekends, said, “My parents and I tested positive for Covid-10 last month and were in home quarantine. It was difficult for us to prepare meals, so we hired a tiffin service. However, my parents did not like the food. So, when I recovered, I signed up on the online portal ‘Covid Meals for India’ to offer free meals for Covid patients in isolation and their families.” “We pack the same food that we cook for ourselves at home and deliver and around Yerawada and Wakad,” he added. Chef Saransh Goila, founder of the online portal, said, “At any given time, there are over 2 lakh users on Covid Meals for India, mainly built to resolve the issue of meal management during this time. What started as a spreadsheet has now grown into a website with over 3,000 volunteers across India, with over 190 from Pune.” Tanya Dingreja, a resident of Bibvewadi, joined the initiative to cope with her father’s recent death. “I had quit my job and could not focus on anything. As I enjoy cooking and feeding others, my sister gave me the idea of joining this initiative. Many people have donated small amounts of money, fruits and other raw materials and my family pitches in as well. While I cook, my children pack the meals and my husband delivers them. We manage to send out 35 meals a daily,” she said. Apurva Arora from Kharadi takes orders before 3pm and delivers dinner to Covid patients and their families, all while doing her day job as an IT professional. “I prepare wholesome and nutritious meals, which include greens, fruits, and protein for Covid patients. Eating the right type of food is important for recovery. The patients’ family, who are taking care of them, also need proper meals. One of my first deliveries was to an elderly couple, who had come to Pune because their son and daughter here were hospitalised. I could help with the meals, so at least they had one less thing to worry about,” she said. While many are paying for raw materials, packaging and deliveries from their own pockets, some are charging a nominal amount. “Since last week, from Mondays to Thursday, we have been providing healthy meals for quarantined and recovering patients and healthcare workers, who cannot prepare or arrange for their own meals. We only charge the cost of raw materials,” said Abhimanyu Sen, a home chef. There are many other home chefs doing the same independently in their vicinities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/home-chefs-whip-up-healthy-food-for-covid-patients-their-families/articleshow/82376745.cms||---

On April 1, Pune city had 469 ventilator-supported ICU beds, which increased to 776 by May 3. But no beds were available on both days, data showed. Similarly, in Pimpri Chinchwad, ICU beds went up from 156 on April 1 to 449 by May 3. But only one bed was shown as available on Monday, according to the online dashboard set up by the divisional commissioner's office. Experts said a scarcity of oxygen and key drugs has cut the number of usable beds and extended the hospitalisation period for many patients. Sanjay Patil, chairman of the IMA's Hospital Board of India, said, “Due to oxygen shortages, private hospitals in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad are unable to admit new patients even if they have beds.” “As for remdesivir, it may not save lives, but it can reduce the hospitalisation period. Both are in short supply,” Patil added. Subhash Salunke, advisor to the state government on Covid-19 and a former director general of health services (Maharashtra), said, "The vulnerable age group has been the most affected during the past one month; that has resulted in continuous occupancy. We hope the caseload starts dropping within the next two weeks. This dip could give us some respite." Rajesh Patil, the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation’s (PCMC) commissioner, said, “We have enough beds for patients from the twin towns. But at least 50% of the patients in our facilities are from the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) or Pune rural. Many are delaying admissions and that's also causing problems.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/icu-beds-increase-by-50-in-pmr-shortage-of-vacant-ones-still-reported/articleshow/82376725.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Kochi||Political parties could have avoided big gatherings: Meena||Conducting an assembly election during a pandemic was a new experience for the Election Commission of India in the state. Chief electoral officer Teeka Ram Meena spoke to TOI’s K P Sai Kiran about the meticulous planning that went in to ensure that Covid protocols were followed. Excerpts: You just concluded a challenging election. Can you list out what it took to make it successful? To begin with, the commission issued detailed guidelines for the general public, elections officials, state government departments, etc. The commission instructed us to increase the number of polling booths so that the number of voters in a booth comes down from 1,400 to 1,000 in urban areas and from 1,200 to 1,000 in rural areas. We calculated that we needed around 15,000 new rooms. We took almost a month to finalize new locations that would also ensure minimum facilities in the booths which went up from 25,000 to 40,700. In the Lok Sabha elections, we had almost 2,30,000 polling staff. This had to be enhanced by a lakh more. How were the Covid-19 protocols ensured? All polling officials were vaccinated. We gave detailed guidelines on protocols to be followed, including on how to dispose of used gloves, masks and PPE kits. We procured enough N95 masks, hand sanitizers, PPE kits, disposable gloves, thermal guns and soaps for all booths and officials. During this election 19,27,418 N95 masks, 13,20,000 sanitizers, 3,50,000 PPE kits, and over 40,800 thermal guns were used. To enforce guidelines, we appointed a state nodal officer. While DMOs acted as district nodal officers, there were also booth-level health nodal officers. But the post-election period is witnessing a huge surge in Covid cases. The political parties should have avoided what I would call a ‘Thandava Nritham’ in the name of elections. It is a democratic process, which may be the reason why the ECI, in their own wisdom, trusted and expected that the responsible political parties would restrain themselves from such gatherings, but that was not done. This resulted in the Djinn being brought out from the pot. When it went out of control, the high court commented, and then the commission put a lot of restrictions. The discipline was seen after that, but by the time, the damage was done. Coming back to the elections, the commission had to face flak from the opposition over duplicate voters. The issue was simply blown out of proportion. We neither panicked, nor were we racked by a guilty conscience. How and why it happened was not a state-specific issue. Some people may enter their names several times. Some may not delete them while migrating to another place. The software does not correct them automatically. There are some procedures to remove them. The opposition leader said that some officials did it purposefully. It is not true. While opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala said that there are almost 4.34 lakh duplicate voters, the commission could locate only approximately 38,000.  I don’t know how he got those figures. We reported the matter to the election commission, and they sent their engineers. The officer in charge of the matter was also here, and we sat together and did the rectification. But there was no such issue on election day. There was no double voting. I don’t know where the so-called duplicate voters went during the elections. There were allegations that some officials were conniving with the ruling front to create duplicate voters. In this state, officials may have political affiliations but when they are deputed for the election process, neutrality and impartiality is also maintained. The allegations were extremely unfortunate. There were reports that the CEO, Bihar was sent to the state for smooth conduct of elections? He was sent here because he was in charge of ERO-Net software that is processing the entire voters list. Being an electronic engineer himself, he was here along with the team of engineers to rectify the matter. Even on the counting day, there were issues with the ECI’s Encore software. There was delay in uploading result details in many places. The matter has been reported to the ECI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/political-parties-could-have-avoided-big-gatherings-meena/articleshow/82376802.cms||---

The NZP is spread in over 380 acres and houses over 2,000 animals and is one of the most visited parks in the country. Sources told TOI said that on April 29, the Centre for Cellular & Molecular Biology (CCMB) orally told NZP officials that the RT-PCR tests of these lions were positive. The curator and director of NZP Dr Siddhanand Kukrety neither denied nor confirmed this. “It’s true that the lions showed Covid symptoms but I’m yet to receive the RT-PCR reports from the CCMB and hence it will not be proper to comment. The lions are doing well,” said Dr Kukrety. “After Bronx Zoo in New York, where eight tigers and lions tested positive for Covid in April last year, there have been no such reported cases anywhere in wild animals. However, in Hong Kong, the virus was found in dogs and cats,” says Dr Shirish Upadhye, director of city’s Wildlife Research & Training Centre (WRTC). According to the sources, on April 24, wildlife veterinarians working in the park noticed Covid symptoms like loss of appetite, nasal discharge and coughing among the lions kept in the safari. There are 12 lions aged around 10 years in the 40-acre safari area. Four males and females each have tested positive. After veterinarians working in the park pressed the panic button, the management advised them to take samples. Field vets took oropharyngeal (part of the pharynx that lies between the soft palate and the hyoid bone) swab samples of the lions and sent them to the CCMB in Hyderabad with which the NZP has signed an MoU. It’s learnt that one of the vets involved in the process was SA Asadulla. Despite repeated calls, Asadulla did not respond. Sources said CCMB scientists will do genome sequencing to find out whether this strain of the virus has come to the animals from human beings. TOI also learns that a virtual meeting of MoEFCC, CCMB scientists, Central Zoo Authority (CZA) and NZP officials was held on April 30, in which the issue of lions testing positive was discussed. Dr Kukrety said he was also part of the meeting. “The lions' case was the trigger for the MoEFCC to issue a detailed advisory on April 30 to country’s the chief wildlife wardens asking them to shut down all national parks, sanctuaries, and tiger reserves fearing transmission of the virus from humans to animals,” the sources said. The Nehru Zoological Park has been closed to the public since two days ago. As it is situated in a densely populated area, the virus, which is also is now air-borne, might have infected the lions from people residing in zoo’s vicinity. “It is also possible it might have come from the zoo-keepers or caretakers,” sources said, adding that over 25 park staff tested positive for Covid recently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/8-asiatic-lions-in-hyderabad-zoo-test-positive-for-covid-19/articleshow/82377403.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

President of the Goa Association of Resident Doctors (GARD), Dr Pratik Sawant, said doctors have been getting infected at a very high rate, with 11 testing positive on Monday alone. “Some have already recovered, completed their quarantine period and rejoined duty. Most have been vaccinated and none of them has pneumonia or severe illness. A majority have mild symptoms that subside in two days,” he said, adding that the government has provided Miramar Residency to doctors to isolate. The association has appealed to people to act responsibly to break the Covid-19 chain and warned that a bad situation could turn worse if citizens refuse to take the pandemic seriously. “The healthcare system is stressed. Community transmission is taking place and there is an urgent need to break the chain. Otherwise, we could get to a point of no return,” he said. Everywhere, doctors are being stretched to their limits, with some working in PPE for 12 hours. Sawant said healthcare workers are on the verge of a mental and physical breakdown. Pointing out that the new superspecialty block at the GMC will require at least another 50 doctors, the GARD president said the association had raised the issue with the health minister and the GMC dean and had complained that a small pool of doctors are being pushed to Covid-19 facilities all across the state. GARD suggested that interns who are on an extension to acquire clinical skills be given their permanent registration as doctors and brought in under bond with a pay scale for bond doctors. “We need more manpower. We are creating beds and getting PPE, but if there are no doctors, what’s the point,” Sawant said. He said around 20% of the deaths over the past week have been of people aged below 40. In fact, doctors at the casualty wards of the state’s two Covid-19 hospitals are seeing around 100 people there during a 12 hour shift with no triage (assignment of degrees of urgency to illnesses) done. The South Goa district hospital has serious patients requiring oxygen along with those who just got tested with mild symptoms and others who come to collect their home isolation kits. At the GMC, the situation is worse.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/11-docs-tested-positive-in-one-day-gard/articleshow/82377513.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Reacting to his role in the violence, Yogesh said, “Two people were martyred in the violence and I pay my condolences to their families. I am only accused of instigating the riots not murders.” Villages of Chingrawati, Mahav and Nayabans were the epicentre of the violence in 2018. A mob had gone on the rampage on December 3, 2018, after a cow carcass was found in a sugarcane field near Mahav village of Syana in Bulandshahr. Inspector Subodh Kumar Singh, posted at Syana police station, was killed in the attack. A youth, Sumit Kumar, also lost his life in the violence. The Chingrawati police outpost was also set on fire. Yogesh Raj, who was once associated with Bajrang Dal and claims to have parted ways now, was one of the main accused in the violence. He was arrested after the incident and was in jail for 10 months before he walked out on bail in October 2019. “I have worked in several social organisations in the past. Some of these works, including for farmers, widow pensions and tricycles for the diabled, require political responsibility. This is why I took a plunge in politics,” Yogesh said. He defeated his nearest rival Nirdosh Chaudhary by a margin of 2,150 votes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/out-on-bail-main-accused-in-2018-bshahr-violence-that-led-to-cop-killing-wins-panchayat-polls/articleshow/82375948.cms||---

While reviewing the ‘Kill Corona campaign-2’ through video conference from his official residence, Chouhan said during the survey, patients who are found to be suffering from cold, cough, and fever should be given a medical kit immediately and their treatment should be started. He directed that a team should be formed in every village, locality to conduct the campaign, in which social workers, public representatives should be added. He instructed that under the campaign, a medical kit should be given to every patient compulsorily. To ensure that there is no shortage of medicines. The chief minister instructed that Corona Assistance Centers should also be set up in cities and villages to provide Corona counselling to the people, health check-ups, etc. Through them, patients can get medical kits easily. Giving information about the campaign, health commissioner Akash Tripathi said that a door-to-door survey is being done in all rural and urban areas of the state under the Kill Corona campaign. So far, about 40% of the survey has been completed. Later, reviewing the Corona situation in the state, Chouhan said due to the efforts being made to curb corona infection in the state, the positivity rate of corona is continuously decreasing. The state's positivity rate that was 21.12% on April 30 has come down to 20.2%. The state is getting more recoveries than positive cases every day. More than 50,000 tests are being done every day and mobile teams are also being sent to collect samples in all the districts. He said that the number of people becoming healthy and infection-free is increasing every day due to better management and increase in medical facilities in the state. The state’s recovery rate has gone up to 84.73%, he said. During the meeting, it was informed that 64,218 patients are currently in home isolation in the state and 97% of these patients have been contacted at least once over telephone. Home delivery of medical kits and health brochures are being made to 100% of patients living in home isolation in urban and rural areas. Chouhan said efforts are on to increase local arrangements in the state along with the supply of oxygen from the Central government. On May 2, a total of 446.8 metric tonnes of oxygen was supplied from external sources in the state. Today, the state is expected to get supply of 484 MT of oxygen from external sources. Apart from this, the work of setting up a large scale oxygen plant in the state is also going on a war footing. Chief minister said that 2000 oxygen concentrators have been purchased by the state government to smoothen the supply of oxygen. Besides, about 2,000 oxygen concentrators have been installed through the local arrangements. The latest VPSA technology based oxygen plants are being set up at Bhopal, Rewa, Indore, Gwalior and Shahdol district hospitals in the state at a cost of Rs 1.60 crore.The oxygen produced from these plants will be available for 50 beds. Chouhan said that so far, 2.10 lakh Remdesivir injection dosages have been received from seven different companies in the state. He said that 845 Covid hospitals are presently operational in the state. Of these, 315 are being operated in the government sector and 530 in the private sector.

Stating that the matter relates to people in the 45 years plus age group and is affecting the elderly more than anyone else, secretary general of the association Dr Abhishek Shukla said: “Over the last 60 days, scores of persons in the 45 plus age group have taken the vaccine at private hospitals. Many of them are coming back to us for their second dose, but we do not have a satisfactory answer to give as there is ambiguity on the count. There is a dire need for clarity in this regard in the public interest.” He also said that several private hospitals had created separate vaccination facilities and engaged additional staff on the call of the prime minister to make the vaccination programme a success. “The abrupt closure of vaccination for private hospitals has come as a shock for citizens and service providers. The association wants to know how, from where and at what cost can we procure the vaccines so that the common man doesn’t suffer and those with the first get their due second dose without any problems,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/chaos-as-vax-drive-stops-at-private-hosps/articleshow/82378186.cms||---

Last year, 51 PMC employees had died within nine months of the pandemic. This year, so far, the civic body has lost only one staffer. Covid infections among PMC employees has also dropped. PMC data showed that around 668 staff members were sickened by the virus over nine months last year. But this year, the number has gone down to 80. Officials said the impact of the vaccination drive is starting to show in other regions of the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR) as well. “There is hardly any officer who has reported infection after vaccination. The mortality rate after the jab is negligible in Pune circle,” said Sanjay Deskhmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle. Shivaji Daundkar, head of the PMC’s labour department, said, “Most of the civic body’s employees signed up for the shots. Only a handful of cases have been reported this year after vaccination.” The PMR has nearly 2.5 lakh health and frontline staff. Nearly 95% of them have received at least one dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/deaths-cases-drop-among-pmc-staffers/articleshow/82376801.cms||---

There have been growing incidents of families of patients resorting to violence after the death of a member and this has pushed the hospital staff across UP on the edge. On Sunday, family members of patients who died during treatment allegedly went on the rampage, attacking the staff of Nutema Hospital in Meerut and vandalizing property “People barged into the Covid ward and threatened to kill a woman resident medical officer there. They broke several medical equipment, including a defibrillator and destroyed files. We have a video of people roughing up our staff. Through Indian Medical Association, we have requested an FIR be lodged against people behind the violence,” said Sandeep Kumar Garg, one of the directors of the hospital. “Is it our fault that we have been admitting serious patients? The entire staff is demoralized by this violence. We are working so hard for patients -- risking our life and of our families,” said a senior doctor at a private hospital in Meerut. Praveen Kumar, inspector general (Meerut Range) claimed there was a shortage of police staff due to panchayat elections but now, it is over and security is being beefed up at hospitals in the region. “I had virtually spoken to doctors in Ghaziabad and assured them a committed deployment at all hospitals. A nodal officer to each of these hospitals is being appointed. The same is being streamlined for Meerut.

---||Chandigarh||Haryana took 14 months to reach 5 lakh cases, with 1 lakh in just 8 days||CHANDIGARH: As Haryana recorded around five lakh Covid-19 cases on Saturday, it took 14-months for the state to reach these figures. However, the last one lakh cases of infection were recorded in just eight days from April 23 to May 2, with an average of around 12,500 cases every day. This is perhaps the highest surge of cases in the tiny state in such a short span. The state first recorded Covid cases on March 4, 2020, when a total of 14 were reported by the state’s health department. Thereafter, the first one lakh cases in the state were recorded on September 16, 2020, after a gap of around six months from the date of the reporting of first cases of infection. As it was the first wave of the deadly virus, the second one lakh or total two lakh cases in the state were witnessed in a two months — from September 16, 2020 to November 2020. Thereafter, it took five months for the state to record a third one lakh cases or the total three lakh cases on April 23, 2021. As the second wave had started, it took only 18 days to record a fourth one lakh cases or the total four lakh cases in the state. The last one lakh, however, has been recorded in just eight days. As the deaths in the state have also crossed 4,300 figures during the second wave, Haryana has reported around 700 deaths only in the past eight days since April 23. An analysis of the fatality data revealed that, for the first time two deaths due to Covid-19 in the state were reported on April 6, first 100 on June 15, 2020. Similarly, when the state recorded the first one lakh cases in September 2020, it had registered a total of 1,045 deaths. The total figure of deaths reached 4,341 in the around 14 months, but the highest number of 1,142 deaths in the state happened in the last 27 days only, from April 5 to May 2, in which 698 deaths were in just eight days’ time from April 23 to May 2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/haryana-took-14-months-to-reach-5l-cases-with-1l-in-just-8-days/articleshow/82377523.cms||Ajay Sura
---||Meerut||Five die in Meerut hosp allegedly due to lack of oxygen, families create ruckus, attack hosp staff||MEERUT: A huge ruckus ensued at a private hospital in Meerut on Sunday night after five patients died allegedly due to lack of oxygen. After the alert, a team consisting of chief medical officer Akhilesh Mohan and a contingent of cops arrived at the scene to contain the situation. “When I reached there, the oxygen supply was there. But I think people who were severely sick and on high oxygen flow might have faced problems. A probe has been initiated and the team will look into all the aspects of the incident,” the CMO said. Meanwhile, families of the deceased claimed the hospital ran out of oxygen and did not intimate the attendants to make alternate arrangements. Atul Gupta, a city trader whose brother-in-law Ashok Goyal (57), a provision store owner, was admitted in a private hospital succumbed to the alleged lack of oxygen. “We spoke to the patient. He said the hospital ran out of oxygen around 6. There was no attendant in sight. Had my brother-in-law received oxygen on time, he could have been saved,” Gupta said. Last week, at least seven patients at two different private hospitals in the city had succumbed due to shortage of oxygen. Despite the local administration’s priority to maintain continuous institutional supply to hospitals and medical colleges, the supply has been erratic. Private hospitals allege they have been getting oxygen but almost at the eleventh hour and the supply is always less than the required. "We are getting oxygen in the nick of time. If our supply is supposed to get over by 2 in the afternoon, we start creating pressure on the administration beforehand. We are then asked to send our vehicles to the oxygen refill centres," Sandeep Kumar Garg, director at a private hospital in the city, said.

TOI on Monday found stand-alone stores selling apparel, savouries, stationary, ice-cream and paan-cigarettes in various localities were open with people going about their lives, oblivious of the virus spread, shortage of hospital beds and rising death toll. These localities included Rabindra Sarani (Chitpore), Mahatma Gandhi Road, Rajabazar, Chittaranjan Avenue, Bidhan Sarani, S N Banerjee Road, Park Street, Lindsay Street, Bhowanipore, Kidderpore, Behala, Tollygunge and Jadavpur. The government had on Friday announced the closure of malls, restaurants, pubs and cinema halls as well as regulated market timings. On Saturday, curbs on timings were extended to stand-alone shops as well. Also, invitees at social family functions like weddings were restricted to 50. Concerned over the blatant disregard to rules, KMC officials are asking cops to draw up a list of shops that are staying open beyond the regulated hours to take actions, including cancellation of trade licence. KMC has also identified the localities and high-rises that have emerged as Covid hot spots in the past two-and-a-half weeks and prepared a blueprint for action to control the runaway rise in infections. This also includes possible shutdown of markets during weekends.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/stores-flout-govt-order-stay-open-post-stipulated-hours/articleshow/82376804.cms||Saikat Ray

Also, with 46 more succumbing to Covid-19, the first three days of May have resulted in 125 deaths from the disease. Sixteen of the day’s deaths occurred within 24 hours of hospitalisation, and two were declared brought dead. The youngest was a 21-year-old with no comorbidity, who died within 13 hours at GMC. She developed severe bilateral Covid pneumonia, and died of respiratory failure. She was tested on the day she died. A 30-year-old with chronic kidney disease was also brought dead; he wasn’t tested earlier for Covid. Twenty-four of Monday’s deaths took place at GMC, 14 at South Goa district hospital, three at Sanguem primary health centre, two at North Goa district hospital, and one each at ESI, PHC Dharbandora, and a private hospital in North Goa. Meanwhile, the state’s active cases crossed the 25,000-mark. Power minister Nilesh Cabral tested positive and was admitted to GMC. “Glad to learn that he is healthy and recovering well, my best wishes for his good health,” said CM Pramod Sawant. The Union health ministry has advised people to keep their homes well-ventilated, with doors and windows open to maintain air circulation. “Infection carrying droplets and aerosols can rapidly accumulate in closed unventilated spaces, and increase the risk of transmission to others in your home,” it stated. GMC doctors and the ministry have advised people to wear double masks for extra protection, a surgical and cloth mask, or a single mask if one has an N95. It has also asked people who experience symptoms or test positive not to panic, as most Covid-19 infections are not severe and do not need hospitalisation. “Majority of Covid-19 patients recover by simply following self-care methods at home,” the ministry stated. “Do not self-medicate or use any antibiotics or supplements as a means of prevention or treatment of Covid-19. Use them only if directed by a doctor.” It has asked people who experience dry cough, fever, body ache, chills, breathing difficulty, loss of smell or taste, fatigue, headache and sore throat to immediately begin Covid-19 self-care, self-isolate and get tested. “Do not get stressed or become anxious, as these interfere with the body’s natural response to fight the infection.” People anxious and stressed can call the NIMHANS toll-free helpline, 080-46110007.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-respite-as-covid-kills-another-46-in-state-over-2-7k-fresh-cases/articleshow/82377521.cms||---

The incentive would be given not just for days on duty, but would include their isolation period as well. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath said, frontline workers had “set an exemplary example of service and compassion and the government will provide them extra emoluments as an encouragement”. The government would also seek assistance from final year medical and nursing students and those in their first year of postgraduate courses, retired health workers, experienced doctors and ex-servicemen, who would be paid honorarium as per rules, said additional chief secretary (information) Navneet Sehgal, who attributed the move to the changing pattern of the second Covid wave and increase in beds to cater to the surge.

Until now, they have cremated 25 bodies. They all belong to Saharanpur in Uttar Pradesh, and have been carrying the dead from the houses and even performing the last rites at the crematorium. Rahul Jhamb came up with this noble thought and his friends joined him. He has a tragic story that propelled him to take up this cause. "In 2017, my father suffered from renal failure and I had to take him to Haryana for treatment. I was alone with no help at all and I and my father suffered a lot. I could not save him and had to perform the last rites alone. It is said suffering ennobles you and that’s what the incident did to me," Jhamb, who runs an electrical appliances repair shop, said. "Now, with untold miseries around, Covid patients are being shunned by their own relatives and there is no one to take care of the dead. So, I discussed the issue with my friends and they agreed," he added. But, is it worth taking the risk? Jhamb's associate and friend Sanchit Arora, who runs a boutique, said, "We have a strong belief that when we go out doing a noble task, God helps and protects us. Besides, we wear PPE kits and take all the necessary precautions." Gaurav Kakkar and Soni Sharma are also part of the group. One of the families that they helped was full of praise. "My mother in-law was coughing and our relatives and neighbours thought she was suffering from Covid. So, no one came forward when she passed away. It was then that I called these four young men who came to our place and helped in the cremation," VK Sood, who's mother-in-law died recently, said. When contacted, additional CMO Vikram Singh Pundeer said, "I am in touch with Rahul Jhamb and we do assist them with PPE kits. It is indeed a noble act."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/4-young-friends-on-covid-mission-to-carry-victims-for-cremation-perform-last-rites/articleshow/82375960.cms||Sandeep Rai

Police was searching for the duo’s accomplice. Police said the trio must have cheated more cab drivers in the last few months. They got US dollars by exchanging Indian currency notes at different forex exchange centres. On April 12, a driver (60) lodged a complaint with Dattawadi police stating the trio promised him US dollars worth Rs1 lakh and cheated him of Rs99,000. He got a bag filled with newspapers instead. Another driver (39) lodged a complaint with Vishrantwadi police on May 1 saying the trio cheated him of Rs4 lakh by promising US dollars worth Rs5 lakh on March 13. One of the suspects would hire a cab and would give a US$20 or US$10 note to the driver while chatting. The suspect would tell the driver he had a bag of US dollars. The drivers would then exchange notes for Rs700 or Rs1,400. “The cab drivers would call the ‘passenger’ again and the suspects would promise a bag of US dollars against Indian currency,” an officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/woman-her-brother-held-for-cheating-cab-drivers/articleshow/82376809.cms||---

Several Amdavadis complained that they had no idea about how many people would turn up at a centre. “Vaccination itself will become a super spreader event. Information on how many people will come to a particular centre and at what time is key to arrest further spread of Covid.,” said Jay Shukla, a 25-year-old banker. Till evening, according to the CoWIN dashboard, some 22,077 Amdavadis got their jabs. Enthusiastic youngsters and those in their early forties were seen lining up. At around 11am, the drive reached its peak with 7,029 getting vaccinated. By 10.30am registrations were closed at 55 of the 210 centres Satish Chawbey from the Jodhpur area, who had gone to a local government school for vaccination, said, “Paramedics at the vaccination centre spend several minutes uploading information on to CoWIN and forget that the icebox won’t maintain the proper temperature for the vaccine for that long. This bureaucratic process should have a better way out. It could have serious implications.” AMC officials in wards like Stadium, Navrangpura and Naranpura claimed that many people had turned up for offline registration at the 32 vaccination centres and made the situation next to impossible.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/heavy-crowds-at-vaccination-centres/articleshow/82378293.cms||---
---||Goa||In note to CM, Vishwajit Rane plans slew of O2 plants||PANAJI: In a bid to overcome the shortage of oxygen, health minister Vishwajit Rane has shot off a note to chief minister Pramod Sawant recommending that Goa augments its current supply by installing more than ten new oxygen generation plants across the state. Government sources said that Rane has suggested that the state could tap the private sector for technology to rapidly ramp up Goa’s oxygen generation capacity. Sources said that the directorate of health services is already in touch with Siemens regarding assistance to setup oxygen generation plants, which can provide backup to existing plants in Goa. Rane, said sources, has moved a proposal to secretary health Ravi Dhawan in this regard. In the proposal, which has reached the CMO, Rane said that each of the new oxygen generator plants should have the capacity to fill 100 cylinders. Rane proposed three oxygen generation plants for the North Goa district hospital. He also suggested four at the South Goa district hospital, one at the Cansaulim primary health centre, two at ESI hospital, and four or five plants at Goa Medical College. The proposal also includes a recommendation for the South Goa district hospital oxygen tank capacity to be enhanced from 5,000 litres to 10,000 litres, and subsequently to 15,000 litres. Rane has reportedly already issued directions to GMC to install one more 20,000-litre oxygen tank at the super-speciality block. Sources said that the proposal includes a plan to set up a liquid oxygen tank in Goa. Rane has reportedly asked Sawant to approve the proposal on priority and to direct government officials to sanction the funds on priority to improve Goa’s health infrastructure. Goa is facing a severe shortage of oxygen and Rane said that improving the state’s oxygen storage and generation capacity will help the state prepare and become self-sufficient.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-note-to-cm-rane-plans-slew-of-o2-plants/articleshow/82377527.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Amid protests, Deonar plant gets coastal body’s nod||Mumbai: Even as activists protest the BMC’s 4 MW waste-to-energy plant at the Deonar dumping ground, the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) has approved the laying of a pipeline through mangroves to carry treated sewage water required for the running of the plant. The proposal has been forwarded to the union ministry of environment and forests for final clearance. The BMC had earlier proposed conversion of 3,000 tonnes per day of MSW to energy but has now scaled it down to 600 tonnes a day. For this, it will lay a pipeline at the Ghatkopar pumping station which will carry the secondary treated sewage to Deonar. Although the waste-to-energy plant is in the non-CRZ area, around three mangrove trees would be affected while laying the pipeline across the Thane creek. Obtaining permission from the Bombay high court for cutting mangroves and planting five times the mangroves likely to be cut/destroyed are among the conditions stipulated for laying the pipeline. In its objections to the project, NGO Let India Breathe said the project is outdated and would add to the pollution in the areas, impacting nine lakh people in its immediate vicinity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-amid-protests-deonar-plant-gets-coastal-bodys-nod/articleshow/82377541.cms||Clara Lewis
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: After treatment, leftover remdesivir sold in black||AHMEDABAD: Ramol Police arrested four persons on Monday for allegedly trying to sell remdesivir injections at exorbitant rates of Rs 40,000 each. One of the accused persons had sourced the injections from a nursing staff, and sold it to the other accused at Rs 26,000 each, police said. The others in turn, charged about Rs 40,000 each from desperate relatives of Covid-19 patients. Police said nursing staff have access to leftover injections in cases where patients die during treatment, or when they no longer require remdesivir. According to protocol, the injections rendered extra are to be handed back to hospital management, but some nurses and other staff supply the leftover injections to the black market, police said. The involvement of other medical workers in the racket is being probed. “Four vials of remdesivir were seized from them. They were selling the drug at a much higher price than its MRP,” said inspector K S Dave of Ramol police station. Acting on a tip-off, police intercepted two persons, Shashank Jaiswal and Neel Jaiswal moving on a two-wheeler with the injections on Monday, about 3am. They said they worked in a pharmaceutical store. On questioning, they told police that Vikas Ajmera, the owner of a medical store in Ramol had asked them to get the remdesivir injections from his friend Pravin Manvar of Tharad, who currently stays in Akbarnagar. Police then arrested both Ajmera and Manvar, and booked all four under Sections 420 (cheating), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 114 (abettor present when offence is committed) of the Indian Penal Code and provisions of the Essential Commodities Act and the Disaster Management Act. The complaint in the case was filed by Ramol assistant sub-inspector Harendrasinh Anoopsinh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/after-treatment-leftover-remdesivir-sold-in-black/articleshow/82376831.cms||---

---||Goa||Goa: Villages across Bardez move in with strict curbs||PANAJI: Various panchayats across Bardez taluka have decided to impose their own restrictions to curb the spread of the virus. While Assagao and Guirim panchayats have prohibited shootings for films, serials and advertisements in its jurisdiction, Verla Canca and Guirim panchayats said hotels should not check in new guests during the period when curbs are imposed. Pilerne panchayat similarly made a 17-day quarantine period mandatory for family members of Covid-19 patients. Bardez has among the highest concentration of active Covid-19 cases, with around 1,500 cases each in Mapusa and Candolim and another nearly 1,300 cases in Porvorim. Taking a cue from Calangute, Penha de Franca and Salvador do Mundo panchayats, who have already imposed lockdowns in their jurisdiction, Socorro panchayat adopted a lockdown, while Guirim and Verla Canca panchayats declared themselves ‘containment zones’. The Verla Canca panchayat has declared itself a ‘major containment zone’ and has adopted containment zone like restrictions for 15 days, from May 3 to 17. Sarpancha Amita Korgaonkar said the decision was taken at a special panchayat meeting held on May 2. The aim, she said, is to bring the rising number of cases under control and to reduce Covid-19 related deaths in the area. The panchayat has restricted public movement in its jurisdiction beyond 12pm. Stores selling essentials will be allowed to operate between 6am and 12pm, provided they ensure that customers observe social distancing, wear masks and sanitisers are provided outside the store. “Marriage ceremonies will only be allowed at religious places and this is subject to permission from the deputy collector. Not more than 20 guests will be permitted. Hotels which are having guests as of today will be allowed to stay till their booking period is over. No fresh guests should be checked in during the lockdown period,” the order by Verla Canca panchayat states. The panchayat has also ordered a halt on construction activity in the area. In Pilerne Marra panchayat jurisdiction, apart from all Covid positive patients, who have to mandatorily remain under isolation for 17 days, their family members too will have to isolate themselves for the said period, sarpancha Sandeep Bandodkar stated in his order. “Cases are on the rise in Porvorim area and our neighbouring panchayats Penha de Franca and Salvador do Mundo have declared lockdowns. This may lead to persons from those areas coming to Socorro to purchase essentials. Therefore, we have also imposed a lockdown from May 4 to 9,” Socorro sarpancha Sandeep Vazarkar said. There was a demand that as the neighbouring villages had gone under lockdown, Socorro too should follow suit. He said that all stores selling essentials will be allowed to operate only from 7am to 1pm. If anyone is found operating after the specified time, their licenses will be cancelled by the panchayat. “We will be monitoring the lockdown along with police personnel and we will see that shutters are downed on any stores that remain open beyond the specified time,” Vazarkar said. The Guirim panchayat declared itself a ‘containment red zone’ from May 4 to 12 and stores selling essentials will be allowed to operate only from 6am to 11pm. “Residents working in government or semi-government services and private industries will be allowed to exit and enter only on providing a valid employment ID along with government ID,” sarpancha Rima Gadekar said in the order. Public buses too will not be allowed inside the village. Assagao panchayat will allow stores selling essentials to operate from 6am to 1pm. Parra, Saligao and Arpora are the other village panchayats in Bardez, which have imposed some restrictions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/villages-across-bardez-move-in-with-strict-curbs/articleshow/82377536.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Liquor sales in off-shops drop by 50% after curbs in Bengal||KOLKATA: Sales at liquor off-shops have started dropping over the past two days ever since an order from the state chief secretary on May 1 restricted the hours for markets and stores selling non-essential items in a bid to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. According to the order, all liquor off-shops are supposed to remain open from 7am to 10am and then again, from 3pm to 5pm.  A leading liquor merchant, who runs a couple of shops in the city, told TOI it had already witnessed a 50% fall in sales in two days. The timing was a problem, he said, adding they faced difficulty opening the shop at 7am. “Most of our employees come from faraway places and so, we face difficulty opening before 8am-8.30pm,” he said, adding the best timing for liquor trade would have been 10am to noon and then again, from 4pm to 6pm. A retailer in central Kolkata said that from a daily average sale of Rs 1.5 lakh-Rs 2 lakh at most establishments, it had come down to Rs 50,000-Rs 75,000 a day. “We are also facing problems with home delivery as we have to register business within the restricted hours,” he added. Another retailer, who has shops in north Kolkata, said they had to arrange for a lot of employees’ accommodation to open the shop by even 8am. “I know some shops that cannot open before 9am,” he said. Kolkata has 350 bars and more than 1,500 off-shops and country spirit shops; country spirit shops are allowed to sell IMFL. The total figure in Bengal is more than 7,000, taking bars and off-shops together. In Bengal, 33.6 crore 750ml bottles of spirits, including whisky, rum, gin and vodka, and 11.2 crore 650ml bottles of beer are sold annually.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/liquor-sales-in-off-shops-drop-by-50-after-curbs/articleshow/82376824.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh government extends weekend curfew till Thursday 7am||LUCKNOW: At a time when official data shows a dip in fresh and active cases in UP, particularly urban areas, the state government on Monday decided to extend the three-day weekend curfew by two more days. The curfew which kicks off at 8pm on Friday will now end at 7am on Thursday, instead of 7am Tuesday. Though the government remains opposed to a prolonged curfew, having appealed against an Allahabad High Court directive to implement a seven-day curfew in five districts, officials said the present decision was taken to further break the infection chain. The government will review the situation over the next few days and decide on extending the closure or continuing with just a weekend curfew , sources said. “The government will closely monitor the situation to see if the five-day closure further reduces Covid cases. It was discussed that when cases were dipping, a limited curfew might help bring down the positivity rate faster,” said an official. Initially, the government imposed a graded night curfew in the state, depending on number of active cases in each district. Subsequently, a Sunday closure was announced, which was converted to a weekend curfew. Last week, the government decided to extend this to Monday as well. During this period, the government will allow industrial activity, weddings, examinations and essential services. Chemists and groceries will also remain open in this period. Continuous process industries and those involved in manufacture of sanitisers, medical equipment and masks will be allowed to function. Movement of workers will also be facilitated. The government also permitted marriages, subject to restrictions. A ceremony in the open can be attended by a maximum of 100 persons while a maximum of 50 persons will be allowed in closed enclosures on the condition that all Covid-19 protocols are followed. For funeral services, the government has allowed a maximum of 20 persons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-govt-extends-weekend-curfew-till-thursday-7am/articleshow/82378199.cms||Neha Lalchandani

It was worthwhile to have these canisters to help maintain their oxygen level at all times. I am taking precautions to avoid hospitalization,” Shaikh told TOI. According to the shopkeepers, a surge in sales began after the shortage of oxygen was perceived in the city. “In the past 10 days or so, I have sold at least 20-25 units of oxygen canisters. Every day, two to three customers are buying it and over 10 are enquiring about it. Most purchases are for their old parents at home” a pharmacy store representative in Kondhwa, told TOI. More than precaution, fear has gripped customers. “Last week, a customer bought seven oxygen canisters. They contain around 8ltrs of oxygen and cost around Rs 600 each,” another pharmacy representative from Hadapsar told TOI. One can catch a virus no matter what precautions and norms are followed, said Mahendra Dage, a small-time businessman from Kothrud.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/fear-shortage-preference-for-home-care-drive-up-sales-of-o2-canisters-nebulizers/articleshow/82376815.cms||Joy Sengupta

---||Lucknow||No pressure on BJP in Uttar Pradesh despite Bengal debacle: State party chief||LUCKNOW: The BJP brass in Uttar Pradesh said it’s not under any pressure about key assembly elections due next year, a day after the saffron party failed to wrest West Bengal despite heavy deployment of a political machinery led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah. UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh said, Uttar Pradesh is a different political turf and can’t be compared to Bengal. “We have a robust presence in the state with stalwarts like chief minister Yogi Adityanath in the vanguard. The party has been in power multiple times in the past too,” he said, while speaking to TOI on Monday. Singh’s assertion came amidst Bharatiya Janata Paty’s failure to cash in on the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, when the party won 18 of 42 parliamentary seats in West Bengal. “I think the party did not possess an organisational strength to take on the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) in West Bengal. Also, BJP did not have a local face in the state to get the desired results,” the UP BJP chief said. While chief minister Yogi Adityanath was one of the star campaigners in Bengal, the UP unit of BJP too deployed its organisational leaders, including deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya, state general secretary (organisation), Sunil Bansal and state general secretary JPS Rathore in Bengal. Singh, however, maintained the party attained organisational strength to raise its tally from three in 2016 to 77 this year. Experts said, BJP managed to replace Congress and Left, which were routed. The vote share of BJP too rose from 10% five years ago to over 38% this time. Experts said, trends of UP panchayat elections were also a cause of worry for the saffron party, which faces a stiff challenge from Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party. While Singh said, he hoped for good results in rural local bodies’ polls, a senior BJP leader said, rural poll trends are an eye-opener for the party, which has been trying to expand its rural outreach. The UP BJP had fielded functionaries in panchayat elections to feel the grassroots pulse before the high-stakes assembly polls next year. “Regional parties like SP and BSP have reasonable presence in rural areas, where we need to work more,” said a senior BJP leader. Another BJP leader said, panchayat elections were more about local influential candidates, who happen to dictate terms in villages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/no-pressure-on-bjp-in-up-despite-bengal-debacle-state-party-chief/articleshow/82378213.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Chandigarh||Punjab CM seeks more oxygen tankers from Centre to meet growing demand||CHANDIGARH: Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Monday appealed to the Centre for more oxygen tankers to be made available to the state as it did not have enough tankers to transport the lifesaving gas. The chief minister, in a Covid review meeting, said the state urgently needed more tankers, as it had only 15 at its disposal at the moment, with two more likely to come in by Tuesday. These, he said, were not enough to handle the requirement for transporting oxygen supplies coming in from other states. Punjab has a 195 MT allocation from various plants in other states, but the actual supply received over the past 7 days has been 110-120 MT daily, which has also been erratic, the CM noted. In this period, the number of patients on oxygen support has gone up from 4,000 to around 9,000. He added though the state government’s steps to monitor and streamline supplies through its control rooms has helped in keeping things stable, the situation remained fluid and a matter of concern, he added. The current consumption of oxygen in the state is more than 225MT daily, while the average increase in demand every day is 15-20%. Punjab chief secretary Vini Mahajan said in the meeting that in addition to the shortage of trucks available with transporters in the state, the fact that a tanker took 4-5 days to bring 90MT quota allocation from Bokaro plant made things worse. Unless the state gets more tankers, the situation could aggravate, she added. In addition to 90 MT from Bokaro, the state’s current allocation is 60MT from a plant in Baddi, 20MT from a plant in Panipat, 15MT from a plant in Roorkee and 10MT from a plant in Dehradun. Around 80 MT is generated daily from the state and steps are being taken to increase production on a continuous basis, she said, adding that this was not sufficient to meet the increasing demand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-cm-seeks-more-oxygen-tankers-from-centre-to-meet-growing-demand/articleshow/82377539.cms||---

A bench of justices Manmohan and Asha Menon was of the opinion that “in view of the magnitude of the pandemic, a structured response by the administration is required so that the voiceless and the marginalised sections of the society can be given proper and adequate relief”. The observation came while hearing a plea by lawyer Abhijeet Pandey seeking registration of all migrant workers in Delhi under the Unorganised Workers’ Social Security Act, 2008 and to provide free medicines and medical facilities to them. The plea, filed through advocate Varun Singh, has also sought a direction to the Centre and Delhi government to pay money to all migrant workers.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Panel to probe Devarayamjal temple land encroachment||HYDERABAD: Days after launching a probe into alleged encroachment of assigned land by Jamuna Hatcheries, the government on Monday ordered a fresh probe into encroachments and illegal transactions of Sri Sita Rama Swamy temple land at Devarayamjal village in Shamirpet. The endowments department is claiming that 1,521 acres in the village worth Rs 1,000 crore (as per the market value) has either been encroached upon or illegal structures raised. The probe will be conducted by a four-member committee headed by panchayat raj secretary M Raghunandan Rao. Nalgonda district collector Prashant Jeevan Patil, Mancherial district collector Bharati Hollikari and Medchal-Malkajgiri collector Swetha Mohanty are members of the committee. Chief secretary Somesh Kumar, in a GO issued on Monday, asked the committee to submit a report on the land encroachment issue at the earliest. The GO said there were complaints that the temple land in Devarayamjal was encroached upon by former minister Eatala Rajender and a few individuals under benami names. Within a few hours after the GO was issued, the committee got down to business by getting all the files pertaining to the land. “The committee will conduct a detailed enquiry on encroachers, the land encroached upon, the nature of encroachment and present usage, documents possessed by the alleged encroachers, details of permissions, if any, issued by any government body, violations of existing government regulations, present extent of vacant land, extent under encroachment by benamis and influential persons behind these benamis and extent of revenue loss to the temple,” the CS said in the GO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/panel-to-probe-devarayamjal-temple-land-encroachment/articleshow/82377550.cms||Koride Mahesh

This has been the party’s second-lowest vote share in the three assembly polls it had won since 1996. While the lowest has been 26.5% it got in 2006, which gave the party 96 seats and a ‘minority government’ tag, its highest was in 1996 when it got 42.1% — a wave election against the incumbent AIADMK. The other Dravidian major, AIADMK, had polled 40.8% popular votes in 2016 to retain power for a second term after it came to power in 2011 with a vote share of 38.4%. AIADMK’s lowest was in 2001 when it won a majority of its own (132 seats) by securing just 31.4% of the total votes polled. “DMK’s vote share in 2021 has improved by 5% compared to the 32% it got in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. In 2016, DMK’s vote share was around 31%,” a poll strategist said. “The increase is partly due to the party’s move to restrict seats allotted to ally Congress at 25. This brought down the Congress’s vote share by around 5% from the 12.5% it got in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. By contesting from 173 seats, DMK managed to transfer a part of the Congress’s vote share to itself the strategist said. In the case of AIADMK, the party managed to improve its vote share to 34.2% in 2021 as against the 18% it got in 2019 LS polls. Though this is almost 7% lower than what it achieved in 2016, the party has managed to improve its 2021 vote share tally at the cost of PMK which was restricted to a mere 23 seats. “This way AIADMK managed to transfer 2% of PMK’s vote share to its kitty,” the strategist pointed out. One cannot compare apples with oranges, says Manuraj Shanmugasundaram, spokesperson of DMK. “In 2016, AIADMK contested on all 234 seats including its smaller allies, who contested on its symbol, while DMK had contested only 173 seats in 2021. Contesting a certain number of seats and setting aside the rest for allies is a strategy of a political party. With DMK getting a majority of its own, it gets the right to form the government,” Manuraj said. Both DMK and AIADMK has felt the heat in the past when they exhibited their large-heartedness in distributing seats to allies. In 2006, DMK was liberal in giving away seats to Congress, PMK and Communists. As a result, it was left with just 130 seats and won 96. Having to endure the ‘minority government’ tagline, the party vowed never to indulge in the largescale distribution of seats. “Fortunately, the DMK’s allies pulled in an additional 10% votes and the alliance benefitted. In 2001, AIADMK too gave away 94 seats to its allies including Congress, TMC (M), PMK, and Communists, and could contest only from just 140 seats,” said political analyst Ravindran Duraisamy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/giving-congress-just-25-seats-upped-dmk-vote-share/articleshow/82379608.cms||D Govardan

Laboratory officials said the QR codes aimed at checking forged RT-PCR test reports. “The passenger was carrying a soft copy of the report, which was found to be doctored. The matter was immediately brought to the attention of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). The flyer was also tested for Covid-19 at the airport and was found to be negative,” an official from the private laboratory said. According to rules, air passengers arriving from Delhi, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Goa and Kerala need to produce a negative report not older than 72 hours at any airport located in Maharashtra. Medical experts said that it was high time that the state government approved more laboratories for conducting tests for Covid-19. “At present, just three government laboratories and around 12-15 private ones are conducting these tests and they are overstretched,” Avinash Bhondwe, former state president of IMA, told TOI.  “All Covid reports are fed into ICMR database system. Our software picks up from there and prints negative certificates with QR code. As it is also blockchained, the reports cannot be manipulated now,” Aseem Gupta, state relief and rehabilitation secretary, told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/lab-opts-for-qr-code-after-flyers-forgery/articleshow/82376843.cms||Joy Sengupta

The victim was identified as E Bhavani, daughter of a farmer, Siddiramulu from Gollagudem in Tekmal mandal. On Sunday night, Siddiramulu along with his wife went to their agricultural field to shift the harvested paddy to an open place near their house. Initially, Bhavani and her 18-year-old brother slept in the open place near their house, but after a while Bhavani returned to the house to sleep, alone. Around 12.30 am, due to gales, a short circuit occurred in the main switch of the house. Due to sparks, the thatched roof of the house caught fire, Tekmal assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Chukkaiah said. The fire quickly engulfed the house and the girl, who was in deep sleep, could not get out in time. Siddiramulu rushed back from the fields and tried in vain to enter the house. He suffered burns on the hands and legs. The girl was burnt alive, the ASI said. Alerted by the locals, police rushed to the spot and shifted the charred body for a post-mortem examination. Based on the complaint of the family, a case was registered under Section 174 of the CrPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/10-yr-old-girl-dies-as-house-catches-fire-in-medak-district/articleshow/82377551.cms||---

In a statement, the crime branch said Ghaytadak — posted with a battalion in Guwahati — had not reported for duty since February. During questioning, Ghaytadak said he was given the bag with the notes by an acquaintance. The Khadki police have lodged an FIR relating under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Specified Bank Notes Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/sepoy-held-with-rs-27l-cache-of-illegal-cash/articleshow/82376838.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Bhopal: Damoh bypoll win injects new hope in state Congress||BHOPAL: For the state Congress, Damoh victory is being seen as a message from the electorate – first, that they do not approve of turn-coats and opportunist MLAs and second, the people are angry with the government’s mismanagement of the Corona crisis. The constituency rejected Rahul Lodhi, who they had elected on Congress in the 2018 elections with a margin of 700 votes against former finance minister Jayant Malaiya. Rahul Lodhi resigned from the state assembly and left Congress in November last year to join ruling BJP. He was rewarded by the BJP government with the position of chairman MP Warehousing and Logistics in January this year. In the April 17 by-poll necessitated by Lodhi’s resignation, he was now candidate for the BJP. Top party leaders like Uma Bharati, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Union minister Prahlad Singh Patel, state BJP chief VD Sharma campaigned for him. Two senior ministers Gopal Bhargava and Bhupendra Singh were in-charge of the poll management. On the contrary, Congress gave its ticket to a senior and elderly former district party president Ajay Tandon who had never won an election before. He was given candidature by the Congress thrice against Jayant Malaiya, but lost each time. On Sunday, Ajay Tandon won Damoh bypoll with an impressive margin of 17,089 votes. Former chief minister Kamal Nath tweeted, “At last, truth has won. With the result of Damoh bypoll, the countdown of the BJP has started in the state. People have learnt a tough lesson from the BJP’s policy and thought of prioritizing elections more than human beings.” State Congress media cell vice-president Bhupendra Gupta explained, “For the party, victory in Damoh is a big boost. This result is directly associated with the Corona crisis in the state and the BJP’s strategy of purchasing and poaching of MLAs from rival parties. This is the first election conducted during the second wave of Corona. Congress party lost two of its prominent leaders to the virus infection, Mahila Congress president Mandvi Chouhan and former minister Brijendra Singh Rathod, who were campaigning for the party and working for the bypoll to Corona.” Gupta claimed that Damoh is a message from the people of the state. “The people have understood that for BJP nothing is bigger than winning elections and being in power at any cost, even if it means the lives of the people. People are not ready to accept misgovernance any longer and neither will they elect opportunist legislators who do not respect their mandate. Damoh is a message for the Congress as well. We have to prepare ourselves for the next elections.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/damoh-bypoll-win-injects-new-hope-in-state-congress/articleshow/82378227.cms||Suchandana Gupta

According to Gaush Alam, Eturunagaram assistant superintendent of police (ASP), a landmine blast occurred in an open land near Palem Vagu irrigation project at Venkatapur mandal, in the early hours of Monday morning, which caused a small crater to be formed. “The landmine blast was probably triggered due to lightning and thunder last night. It appears that Maoists plated the landmine in an open land near the Palem Vagu project to cause harm to police personnel involved in combing operations. Luckily, no one was injured in the blast,” the ASP said. Palem Vagu is a tributary of Godavari river.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Not enough flyers, T2 may go off radar||NEW DELHI: Operations from Indira Gandhi International Airport’s terminal 2 (T2) may be suspended from next Monday (May 10) as passenger numbers have nosedived during the uncontrolled Covid surge. With almost 20 countries imposing travel restrictions from India in the past few days, some even stopping flights here, the current amount of domestic-cum-international traffic is down to a level that can be handled by T3 alone — like last year. People in the know say Delhi International Airport Ltd (DIAL) will hold consultations with airlines in the next two-three days. “Most probably we will suspend T2 operations from next Monday onwards. T3 is more than sufficient for the current traffic,” said sources. No comments were received from DIAL yet. Mumbai airport is also handling all passenger flights from one terminal for the same reason. Delhi Airport’s T2 was reopened for domestic flights last October when domestic air travel had started picking up after being allowed to resume in May-end. T1 is yet to reopen since last March. The airport was seeing an average of about 1.15-1.2 lakh passengers (domestic and international, both arriving and departing) in past couple of months, before the current surge. Now its footfall have also fallen. The reason: domestic travel has witnessed a sharp drop due to testing requirements by various states. And in the last 10 days, about 20 countries have imposed travel restrictions on India, including suspending flights from here. The ongoing surge has led to a strong sense of déjà vu among both airlines and airport operators. It hit just when things were looking up. Delhi Airport, for instance, was handling almost 1.1 lakh domestic and 20,000 international passengers (arrivals plus departures) on a daily basis this February, say sources. This was the highest figure since last March. DIAL was now hoping to reopen T1 for operations. Scheduled domestic flights restarted on May 25, 2020, with about 30,000 passengers travelling (across the country) on Day 1. This number kept growing as things improved. March 27, 2021, for instance, saw 2.8 lakh domestic passengers on 2,336 flights. This number fell to 1.3 lakh domestic passengers on April 30, according to aviation ministry’s tweets. The second surge has seen passenger numbers crash. “A majority of Indian carriers are cash-strapped and are struggling to survive. If this ongoing torrid Covid wave does not end soon, we may see more casualties in the aviation space. Airlines can cut costs by reducing fleet. Airports don’t have that kind of adaptability with the infra that has been created,” said an aviation insider.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/not-enough-flyers-t2-may-go-off-radar/articleshow/82377615.cms||Saurabh Sinha
---||Pune||Pune: Teachers want insurance for deceased colleagues||PUNE: The Maharashtra State Primary Teachers Association has written to the education officers and chief executive officers of all zilla parishads demanding that the teachers who died due to Covid-19 while on Covid duty be identified and insurance money promised by the state be given to their dependents. The association said no data is available about the number of such deaths. Teachers have been appointed for various Covid-19 related duties such as manning the check posts, Covid-19 quarantine centres, ration shops, home-to-home surveys among others. The association claims that many have contracted the virus while on duty and succumbed. Vijay Kombe, general secretary of the association, said, “There is hardly any data on the number of teachers who have died till now and the number of teachers who have received the insurance. When proposals are sent, they are returned with queries. All this needs to be taken care of and the money should be transferred to the dependents as soon as possible.” Son of a headmaster of a Zilla Parishad school from Nagpur who died due to Covid-19 said, “My father would have turned 56 this June. He was on Covid duty since the pandemic began. He contracted the virus while doing his duty, and succumbed to it later in the hospital. We have yet to receive any money,” the son who is in college said. Pune Zilla Parishad’s chief executive officer Ayush Prasad said he had received seven proposals from the families of teachers who succumbed to the illness in his jurisdiction which he had sent to the government. “However, it had to be routed through the education commissioner and hence we again sent it to the education commissioner who must have forwarded it to the government. Till now, we have got an insurance amount of up to Rs 5.5 crore for 11 people which includes gram sevaks, peons among others but none of the teachers has got it,” Prasad said. Education commissioner Vishal Solanki said, “We have sent their demands to the government for consideration. It is under process at Mantralaya.” He did not comment on how many proposals have been sent till now and how many of them have received the money.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/teachers-want-insurance-for-deceased-colleagues/articleshow/82376853.cms||Ardhra Nair

The inquiry was commissioned to find the causes of fire incidents in Ahmedabad’s Shrey Hospital and Rajkot’s Uday Shivanand Hospital last year. For quick submission of the report, the high court had even fought a legal battle in the high court against kin of victims of Shrey Hospital fire tragedy victims. However, it has not been tabled in the assembly since then, sources said.The HC is likely to hear this application on Tuesday along with the PIL demanding action against those responsible in Shrey Hospital fire case and for proper implementation of fire safety norms in state hospitals. Advocate Amit Panchal had filed the PIL last year and on basis of a slew of directions issued by the high court, the state government claimed to have initiated various processes for strengthening fire safety norms.Citing the HC orders, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) had in the past initiated a sealing drive against hospitals which reportedly did not have proper BU permission or fire NOC. The civic body had issued notices to nearly 3,00 hospitals and clinics and sealed a couple of them. The Ahmedabad Medical Association (AMC) has challenged the action. The civic body has assured that it would not take action against these hospitals in the present circumstances when there is a surge in Covid-19 cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/plea-in-hc-seeks-action-in-bharuch-hospital-fire-case/articleshow/82376857.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Abysmal show in polls raises questions on BJP’s momentum||HYDERABAD: BJP Telangana’s losing spree continued with civic polls except Greater Warangal. The saffron party’s abysmal performance in the civic polls has left a question mark on the momentum gained by it after Dubbak and Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation ( GHMC) polls. BJP won 10 wards in Warangal, where it performed better than Congress, which won just four wards. Though an insignificant number, BJP also won a ward for the first time in Khammam civic polls. Ironically, several BJP leaders, who had campaigned in Khammam, appealed to voters, saying they never won a seat in Khamama and BJP should be given a chance. BJP state chief Bandi Sanjay and Union minister of state for home affairs G Kishan Reddy had even gone on record saying that the TRS regime did not develop Khammam as it never gave poll results for the party and it was the Union government giving funds for Khammam Corporation. All parties, including the saffron party, did not bag more than 20 wards. It would a tough road ahead for BJP. “This time we are no better than Congress. Though we have emerged much stronger than Congress as the main rival for TRS, we will have to rethink our plan,” a top leader said. With reports of internal fights among seniors coming to the fore, especially between those who have joined recently and the old guard, BJP had much to work on from now on. “There was lack of coordination too in the party. The hunger to win, which was evident in GHMC and Dubbak by-poll, was missing and no nationall leader too campaigned for the party,” another leader said. “We don’t have strong cadre in areas like Khammam, but this was an opportunity for us to capitalise and become strong, but we squandered it,” another senior leader said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/abysmal-show-in-polls-raises-questions-on-bjps-momentum/articleshow/82377564.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

He added that BJP’s performance in West Bengal was a “miracle” and part’s comeback in Assam was spectacular. Chouhan congratulated Congress candidate Ajay Tandon, who won Damoh bypoll, adding that Covid was his priority as of now.  "Our party lost the Damoh byelection due to local equations and circumstances. My attention was towards controlling Covid crisis. We will review the party’s defeat in Damoh bypoll,” said Chouhan. "BJP won 77 seats in West Bengal. It is a miracle to have 77 seats from three seats. All the party workers worked hard under the leadership of national president J P Nadda, guidance of home minister Amit Shah. Due to hard work put in by the state in-charges, we achieved a grand success," said Chouhan on Monday. "In these elections, the public trust, love and reverence for our Prime Minister Narendra Modi-ji and the BJP have increased and the party has strengthened further,” said the CM. "We have made a spectacular comeback in Assam. Apart from this, the NDA government is being formed for the first time in Puducherry," said Chouhan.  "I congratulate the parties and their leaders that have won in Assam, West Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. I am confident that they will serve the people of their state in a better way in collaboration with the Center and will leave no stone unturned to get the people relieved from the Covid-19 crisis,” added Chouhan.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Khar teen murder accused says he too was attacked||Mumbai: Shree Jogdhankar, arrested for the New Year’s murder of his friend, Jhanvi Kukreja, submitted a bail plea on Monday claiming that that he too was attacked on the staircase where he was sitting with the victim, and had subsequently left to save his life. In the plea submitted through advocate Mahesh Vaswani, the 22-year-old said that he could not, however, remember who attacked him as he was under the influence of alcohol. “There is a strong possibility there was a third person or persons who may have tried to assault the deceased, and in the process the applicant (Jogdhankar) got injured while trying to save her (Kukreja). Police have no answers to the circumstances as to how the applicant got injured,” the plea said. It questioned the absence of eye-witnesses to the alleged incident despite the party. Jogdhankar and co-accused Diya Padalkar (18), close friends of Kukreja (19), are accused of assaulting her on the staircase and murdering her after they attended a party on the terrace of a Khar building. Kukreja’s final post-mortem report showed she had suffered 48 injuries, many of them grave. Both bail pleas will come up for hearing on Tuesday. Jogdhankar said he suffered severe injuries to his head and spine, and this information was suppressed by police. The plea said that since police failed and misdirected investigations by filing a charge sheet without investigating the role of the party organiser and his guests in assaulting Jogdhankar, his mother gave written complaints last month to lodge an FIR “for murderous assault on her son”. The plea said the complaints were made with medical documents and pictures clicked by Jogdhankar’s friend immediately after he was assaulted. Jogdhankar had left the party and later went to Sion hospital to receive treatment for his injuries. Comparing CCTV footage recovered from the hospital and building, the plea cited “discrepancies in timings”. “Chargesheet, which itself is contradictory to CCTV footage details stated by police in their panchnama of lobby of building Bhagwati Heights (party venue), the spot when applicant is supposedly seen going out of society at 2.16am and in Sion Hospital CCTV footage, he was seen between 2am and 2.51am and 3.55am... how one person can be at two place at the same time. Apparently, there is some tampering already done by someone at Bhagwati Heights, by extraneous factors,” the plea alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-khar-teen-murder-accused-says-he-too-was-attacked/articleshow/82377575.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Chandigarh||Not in favour of total lockdown: Captain Amarinder Singh||CHANDIGARH: Even as he continues to refrain from ordering complete and harsh lockdown, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Monday warned people against laxity in adherence to the curbs imposed in the state and said if the situation did not improve, he would be forced to consider a total lockdown. The CM said he had so far refrained from ordering a sweeping lockdown in the state because it would hurt the poor the most and lead to exodus of migrant labourers, plunging industries into chaos again. “However, if the people do not stringently comply with the restrictions in place, harsher steps might have to be taken,” he added. The state is currently in a soft lockdown situation, with strong curbs in place and with additional restrictions imposed by the government on Sunday. DGP Dinkar Gupta told the meeting that all measures were being taken to enforce the current curbs strictly. The chief minister also ordered a stop on all take-away deliveries from restaurants, which was being used by youngsters as a pretext to move out of their homes. Only home deliveries of food should be allowed, he directed the officials. He, however, gave permission for shops selling fertilisers to be open. Asserting that he would not allow Punjab to go the way of some other states where patients could be seen lying out on the roads, the chief minister said industry should be encouraged to use their CSR funds for vaccination and treatment of their labour suffering from mild or moderate illness, so that they could stay at home, reducing pressure on hospitals. Underlining the need to step up preparedness amid projections of a peak in the coming days, the chief minister ordered 20% increase in bed capacity in the next 10 days. He directed the health and medical education departments to get stadiums, gymnasiums and other such places ready to house patients. Tented camps should be set up, and gyms/halls should be converted into L2 and L3 facilities, he said, adding that “We have to be prepared for the worst.” He also directed use of staff from rural development and other departments to augment the workforce for tracing of Covid contacts in rural areas. The directives came as health minister Balbir Sidhu said the situation was grim with only 300 beds now available at L3 level in the state. Hospitals were getting overwhelmed, he added. Dr KK Talwar, head of the state’s Covid expert committee, stressed the need to prioritise monitoring of home isolation cases to identify serious patients fast, especially in rural areas. With no clarity still on whether mutation was responsible for the current spread, he also underlined the importance of increasing L3 bed capacity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/not-in-favour-of-total-lockdown-capt/articleshow/82377571.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Ventilators switched off, non-MBBS docs didn’t know how to use them’||MUMBAI: The day-to-day experience of a young doctor at a Covid care centre on the outskirts of Mumbai shows rapid upgradations in facilities have been a far from smooth process. “I would see patients brought with 70% oxygen saturation and, even though I was trained to help them, there was nothing I could do,” the doctor told TOI on condition of anonymity. The doctor’s centre had 25 ventilators donated by the central government and an equal number of high flow nasal cannulas, but none were put to use. “They had been rusting for months” because none of the medical personnel at the doctor’s centre knew how to use them. “I had some basic training in critical care and knew how to intubate a patient and provide ventilator care,’’ he said. “But many of my senior colleagues trained in alternative therapies asked who would take care of the patient after my shift ended in eight hours,” he said. The practical solution thus was to keep the machines away. In public hospitals of repute, the task of monitoring ventilator care is assigned to the seniormost nurses or resident doctors. But when Covid-19 struck, additional doctors were recruited to such facilities with barely five days of training. “Many had been through training that literally only told them how to switch on a ventilator,” he said. “Critical care is a specialty that a doctor learns for two to three years,” he said. While, on paper, senior consultants from the private sector were earmarked to help and monitor critical care, the arrangement rarely worked. The elation that the Mumbai-based doctor felt initially at being assigned a facility closer to home than in the rural parts of the state soon turned into frustration. “Putting up beds and providing oxygen supply doesn’t make for an ICU,” he said. While lakhs were spent on buying ventilators and high flow nasal cannulas, nothing was done to set up a 24x7 laboratory, which is at the heart of most ICU setups. “An arterial blood gas analyzer helps doctors monitor the blood gases at regular intervals. It is perhaps a fifth of the cost of a ventilator, but this centre didn't have it. Our laboratory did only simple tests and too for two hours in the morning,” he said. Thousands of medical students have been assigned Covid duty at such centres across the state as a part of their bond for availing of subsidised government education. Students who managed to get duty in Mumbai's centres consider themselves lucky as there is a system in place. “Many of my friends are happy… but I am frustrated and upset at how little I could do to really help patients. And this barely a few kilometres away from Mumbai,” said the doctor. The BMC spends over Rs 4,000 crore on public healthcare every year, but most corporations around it spend a fraction of the sum. “It is unfair if a person’s geographic location dictates the level of healthcare he gets,” said the young doctor. One of the biggest problems in the planning of Covid care is that the rapid upgradation of smaller facilities has taken place without commensurate training for medical staff. “Overnight, a primary healthcare is designated as a referral centre for Covid. Now, it cannot refer a patient outside except for super specialty needs such as heart attacks. So, a patient brought in cannot be sent out even if he cannot be intubated here... one cannot admit that the centre is lacking on trained manpower,” said the doctor, who is now looking for assignments in Mumbai region to avoid the same degree of disillusionment. “I have come across ambulances working without even pulse oximeters. The focus is on oxygen production but what about the plumbing system to supply it. There are so many issues of maintaining pressure that the patient doesn’t get continuous oxygen flow,’’ he said. While medical personnel, be it an ayurveda doctor or nurse, worked hard, the atmosphere was tinged with a fear of reprisal. “They couldn't use sophisticated equipment out of fear following fires in a few hospitals.” The blame game over mortality often sets off defensive practice. “Ill-equipped ICUs are filled with stable patients so that it can be said that there is no bed available for any new critical patient,” said the doctor. “One cannot claim that all doctors are warriors. That is the bitter truth.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ventilators-switched-off-non-mbbs-docs-didnt-know-how-to-use-them/articleshow/82377580.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Hyderabad||University of Hyderabad start-up develops stem cell treatment||HYDERABAD: Joining the fight against Covid-19, a city startup has now developed a stem cell-based technology that they claim can offer medical practitioners an alternative to treat infected patients. While the technology built by Transcell Oncologics — a biotech startup incubated at the University of Hyderabad (UoH) — is yet to be approved by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR), the team said that it is currently under trial by a renowned chain of hospitals in Hyderabad. The research has also been published in the peer-reviewed journal, Stem Cells Translational Medicine. Explaining the technology — using Hemato human umbilical cord (UC) tissue — the team said that it involves harvesting and processing adult Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) from the UC that have anti-inflammatory and repairing properties. “The tissues are retrieved from donated UCs. From that we harvest and clinically process MSCs which, upon infusion into a patient’s body, can reduce cytokine storm (sudden increase in production of inflammatory cytokines or proteins that can eventually lead to organ failure) caused by the virus. They decrease the inflammation in the patient’s body triggered by the virus,” said Subadra Dravida, founder and chief executive officer of Transcell . As part of this, two intravenous infusions — each dose comprising 100 million cells — are given to a Covid-19 patient, 72 hours apart. Upon infusion the MSCs first reach the lungs and support the regeneration of the damaged lungs. According to Dravida, the Hemato UC-MSCs “do not cause any adverse effects, are easy to administer and have been proven to be safe for human application”. “Also, there is no damage caused to any other organ,” the CEO said. The effectiveness of this MSC-based technology, the startup team maintained, has been confirmed by the Cell Transplant Centre, at Miami Miller School of Medicine under the Department of Public Health Sciences in the US.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/uoh-start-up-develops-stem-cell-treatment/articleshow/82377107.cms||---

The other accused was a nurse at SVP Hospital, Vidhi Vaza. She was allegedly nabbed red-handed by crime branch while delivering nine injections to a decoy customer.The public prosecutor opposed the bail applications of both the accused persons. In both cases, additional sessions judge V V Parmar observed, “The court is well aware of the fact that remdesivir injections are given to patients whose condition is extremely critical and due to shortage of these injections, proper medication of patients is not done resulting in high death toll in the pandemic.”While refusing bail to these accused, the court said this was a very serious offence and the investigators should go to the root of the conspiracies for black-marketing of such an essential drug at this critical time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bail-denied-to-hospital-staff-involved-in-remdesivir-racket/articleshow/82376876.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Registration on CoWin compulsory for Ist, 2nd dose vaccination||Hyderabad: Health authorities on Monday announced that they will continue vaccination drive for those aged 45 and above, but have made registration compulsory on the CoWin portal for both the first and second doses. Stressing that administration of second doses will be given priority, health department director Dr Srinivas Rao said that in view of the shortage of doses, vaccination will continue only in government-run centres. He added that the inoculation drive for 18-44-year-olds will be launched later. “Now, the vaccination will not be given on a walk-in basis but by registering the centre and date on the CoWin portal. We are preparing guidelines for the vaccination drive of people aged 18-44 years and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao will soon take a decision on this,” Dr Srinivas Rao said. But Twitter and other social media platforms were abuzz with complaints over the difficulty in finding a slot. “I tried to register myself for my second shot but no slots were available until May 8. This may complicate matters for those who are due for their second dose,” said KV Chandra, a resident of Ameerpet. Another person wrote how he could not find any centre for vaccination across the state. The health director said vaccinations for persons aged 45 began in the state on April 1 and that second doses to such persons will be given starting May 10 and will continue for six to eight weeks. “Priority will be given for second dose and if any doses are available then first doses will be given to each centre,” he said and added that depending on the need, special days will be allotted for giving complete doses. “We hope people understand the situation and if you cannot register on your own, please go to an e-Seva centre or internet centre in your area, but registration is compulsory,” Dr Rao said. The vaccination drive was put on hold for the third consecutive day on Monday due to shortage of vaccines. The health department told local authorities to open 200 slots at centres under Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) and 100 slots per centre in non-GHMC areas. Authorities said there are over 1,000 government vaccination centres in the state, and it would consider vaccinating around 1.2 lakh persons on a daily basis. Altogether, 128 government vaccination centres fall under GHMC’s jurisdiction. However, a senior government official mentioned that Centre had indicated allocation of 8.8 lakh doses to Telangana this month. Now, a lot depends on the Centre’s decision over the state government’s request for more doses. If the available quota is taken into consideration, the state government may not be able to vaccinate more than 24,000 people per day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/registration-on-cowin-compulsory-for-ist-2nd-dose-vaccination/articleshow/82376947.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The Hyderabad-based drug maker has received the emergency use nod for 1mg, 2mg and 4mg strengths of Baricitinib tablets from the drug regulator. The company said it will now be seeking a compulsory license for the drug, which is sold under the brand name Olumiant by Eli Lilly & Co. The compulsory licence will be sought based on the urgent need for emergency use of the drug “in light of the grave and serious public health emergency across India due to the Covid-19 pandemic”, it said. Baricitinib is a rheumatoid arthritis drug that is being used in combination with Remdesivir for the treatment of Covid-19 positive patients in some countries. The rheumatoid arthritis drug acts as an inhibitor of Janus Kinase, which is part of the intracellular, non-receptor tyrosine kinases (enzymes) that send signals to cells via the JAK-STAT (Janus Kinase-Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription) pathway to make more cytokines. JAK inhibitors like Baricitinib prevent this process by blocking this messaging pathway, thereby preventing a cytokine storm and calming down the immune system. Natco said it is ready to launch the product this week to make it available to Covid-19 patients across India. The EUA to Baricitinib comes eve as the country is reeling from a shortage of various Covid-19 treatment regimens including Remdesivir. The news of the EUA approval sent Natco scrip shooting up by over 4% to an intra-day high of Rs 934 a share before settling down at Rs 924 a share on Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) as compared to the previous closing of Rs 896 a share.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/natco-gets-cdsco-nod-for-emergency-use-of-baricitinib/articleshow/82377057.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

Previously, in 2016 the highest maximum temperature recorded in May was off 36.1 degrees on May 31. Weathermen said that the drop in humidity levels in the city resulted in rising temperatures. Last year, the highest maximum temperature recorded for May stood at 35.7 degrees on May 31. The all-time highest maximum temperature for the month was 41 degrees recorded on May 12, 1979. The maximum temperature recorded on Monday by the IMD’s Santacruz observatory was 2.8 degrees above normal. The Colaba observatory recorded maximum temperature of 35 degrees which was 1.8 degrees above normal. The IMD has forecast cloudy skies for Tuesday and said that maximum temperature will continue to stay on the higher side. “Wind direction was generally westerly over Mumbai as compared to past few days and humidity levels dropped, resulting in increased temperatures,” said Nitha T, scientist, IMD Mumbai. On Sunday, the maximum temperature recorded by the Colaba and Santacruz observatories was 33.8 degrees and 34.5 degrees respectively. Minimum temperature in the city was also on the higher side.

Officials of Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) and hospital staff are jointly speeding up efforts and planning to start Covid-19 treatment in the third week of May. Dr T Rama Krishna, medical superintendent of Bolarum General Hospital, told TOI, “At present, we have 30 beds in the hospital and we are looking adding another 20 beds. Apart from this, there is a proposal to set up a permanent oxygen plant on the premises of the hospital, which is spread over four acres.” Regarding medical staff and paramedical staff, he said they can manage the services with the present available staff. As Covid-19 cases are rising in Cantonment, a plan to convert government schools and community halls to provide Covid-19 treatment is also on the cards. “We will take all measures to avoid inconvenience to residents while treating the patients in these schools and halls,” the superintendent said. Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) officials handed over 50 oxygen cylinders to the SCB officials recently for Covid-19 treatment. Meanwhile, two residential welfare associations (RWAs) of Tirumala Colony and Surya Nagar in Cantonment distributed 2,000 masks and 2,000 sanitisers to SCB health and sanitation workers. Ten more SCB employees have tested positive for coronavirus and with this the total number of employees who have tested positive has gone up to 20. The entire SCB main office is sanitised twice during the working hours, while the employees have been told to follow Covid-19 norms strictly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-19-treatment-in-cantt-hospital-from-may-3rd-week/articleshow/82377083.cms||---

As many as 6,206 patients recovered on Monday taking the cumulative recoveries in the state so far too 3,73,933. The state now has a total of 199 containment zones of which 25 are currently within the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) limits. As many as 5,187 Covid-19 care centres are being operated across the state to tackle the second wave of infections. The case fatality rate (CFR) is 0.52 per cent, having slightly increased over the last couple of days, while the recovery rate of 81.91 per cent, having come down 16 per cent over the last one month alone. The number of active cases currently stand at 80,135. A total of 58,742 samples were tested on Monday. Telangana has so far completed 1.31 crore tests and has reached 3.52 lakh sample testing per million population.

In other words, 18% of the 81,135 active cases are being monitored, but the positive side of the situation is that most people on oxygen support are recovering well. Ever since the first case was reported in the state in March last year, percentage of patients needing serious treatment reached current peak level. ICU beds are mostly occupied in private hospitals, 5,648 people have been admitted, whereas private hospitals offer 6,547 ICU beds. In all, 6,747 patients are in ICU, including just 200 in government facilities. Number of people on oxygen support is also high, 11,600 (7919 in private, 3681 in government) Though the government had announced that 3,000 more oxygen beds would be available soon, they are yet to become operational. Doctors said that those on oxygen beds were recovering better than those patients admitted in intensive care units (ICU). “Those on oxygen are taking about a week to 10 days to recover with some exceptions, while a few patients receiving oxygen become serious. With right and timely dosage of steroids, they recover. There is no need to panic, generally,” Dr Paramjyothy, professor and head of department of pulmonary medicine at the Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS) said. The latest guidelines say that even before proceeding to oxygen support, steroids could be given to those having high-grade fever. With the oxygen supply turning critical, the state committee of higher officials on oxygen availability in the state has instructed all district officials to update information on oxygen usage in the hospitals twice a day. Instructions have been relayed to use oxygen only for patients in need.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/over-18k-covid-affected-need-hosp-treatment-in-t/articleshow/82377043.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Nagpur||With mucormycosis rampant, key drug for it goes short||NAGPUR: The aggressive use of steroids and immunosuppressants seems to be adding to the woes of the Covid patients as many of them are developing serious health complications including abrupt fatalities due to unwelcome side-effects. The treatment and surgeries of the recovered Covid patients for the fungal infections, especially mucormycosis, have increased to such extent that the key drug to treat it, Liposomal Amphotericin B, has become scarce now. Though a cheaper version Amphotericin B Deoxycholate is available, Liposomal Amphotericin B is considered safer. Dr Nandu Kolwadkar, leading ear, nose and throat (ENT) surgeon and also incharge of Covid section of Orange City Hospital, said he had operated more than a dozen mycormucosis cases that were mostly recovered Covid patients. “After around 10-15 days of recovery, the fungal complications start manifesting. Liposome Amphotericin B is now in short supply as the cases have increased so much,” he said. Dr Kamal Bhutada, director of ICU of Care Hospital and also the president of Nagpur chapter of Indian Society for Critical Care Medicine, explained steroid use suppresses the immunity of Covid patients that makes them vulnerable to the air-borne fungal diseases. “The use of steroids in the Covid patients also triggers high blood sugar, especially in diabetic patients. This condition paves way to fungal infections like mucormycosis and others. Though there are other reasons, use of steroids beyond stipulated time is the most common trigger,” he said. Experienced doctors said they were forced to rely on Amphotericin B Deoxycholate now. However, that has more toxic effect on patient’s kidneys though it is an approved drug. “I am using Amphotericin B as not every patient can afford the more expensive one. There is definitely the toxicity issue involved but every care is being taken,” said Dr Bhutada. Dr Meraj Shaikh, physician, Care Hospital, said the unbridled use of steroids (like Dexamethasone) and immunosuppressants like Tocilizumab paves way for the ‘opportunistic infections’ like fungus. “Apart from steroids and immunomodulators, unindicated use of broad spectrum of antibiotics is also doing the damage in Covid patients,” he said. Dr Nitin Wadaskar of the Alexis Hospital too said there were increased cases of fungal infection and shortage of drugs for them. Pharmacist Murlidhar Kewalramani and stockist Jay Tekchandani too said the demand of Amphotericin B had increased manifold it is largely unavailable now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/with-mucormycosis-rampant-key-drug-for-it-goes-short/articleshow/82375992.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Hyderabad||Docs relying on more tests as several Covid-19 patients get false -ve reports||Hyderabad: The second wave of Covid-19 infections has seen a large number of false negatives with nearly 25 to 30 per cent cases which have all other prognosis of the disease, showing negative on RT-PCR report. In most of these cases, secondary tests like HRCT scans show classic signs of viral pneumonia, suggesting Covid-19 infection, according to experts. While RT-PCR was the benchmark to detect Covid-19 cases up to three months back, the second wave has disrupted this practice. Now, doctors are not relying only on rapid antigen tests (RAT) or RT-PCR tests but are increasingly banking on D-dimer, HRCT tests among others. While some doctors suspect newer variants may be contributing to a rise in false negatives, this view was ruled out by Centre of Cellular & Molecular Biology director Dr Rakesh Mishra. “It is more likely due to mistakes during collection of samples, the swab may not be good or the huge backlog could be a reason. Also, sensitivity of the test is not absolute and we all know it,” said Dr Mishra. Despite the limitations of the test, better understanding of the virus has also pushed doctors to look for other markers to detect patients who might be showing a false negative. “Nearly 30 per cent of patients who have all indications of Covid-19 are not showing as positive in RT-PCR test. Sensitivity of RT-PCR is around 60 tp 65 per cent, which means that out of every 100 positives, 35 to 40 cases may not be detected. We are using CT scan which has higher sensitivity, serology and antibody tests as well,” said head of department for general medicine at Care Hospitals, Dr Guru Prasad. While patients are running for tests and other investigations all at once, timing also plays a key role, say experts. “If the RT-PCR test or CT scans are done too early, they may give a false negative, since Covid-19 is a spectrum of diseases which changes from asymptomatic to mild and then severe symptomatic. Doing the test too early or too late is a problem,” said Dr Shivaraj, general physician KIMS Hospitals Secunderabad, adding that 25 per cent of patients seen are showing a false negative. Doctors are treating such patients with medications currently being used for Covid-19 treatment. “For those who are at risk and have Covid-like symptoms, it is wise to follow the same treatment protocol as for those with a positive test,” said Dr Rahul Agarwal, senior consultant of internal medicine at Medicover group of hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/docs-relying-on-more-tests-as-several-covid-19-patients-get-false-ve-reports/articleshow/82376992.cms||Amrita Didyala

Scores of goldsmiths have returned to their respective hometowns in just a couple of weeks from Charminar surroundings, due to the increasing Covid-19 cases and slowdown of the business, which has hit them hard. “Many are returning to their homes as the business has taken a huge hit and they are unable to bear the daily expenses and house rents,” Abdul Razzaq Malik, owner of a jeweller shop at Gulzar Houz told TOI. “Our business has been badly affected amid and so far, more than 70 per cent business has been hit,” he added. Daily wage workers from different parts of the country, including Bihar, Uttar Pradesh , Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and West Bengal are seen regularly returning to their native places. The current situation has seen goldsmiths, vendors, construction labourers, security guards, salesmen and helpers move out of the city. “We have no other option but to leave the place as early as possible with our family because there is always a fear of lockdown lurking apart from our financial distress,” one carpenter S Ramesh told, who left the city with his family said. Ramesh had left the city for his hometown in Bihar during the first wave and had returned with hopes that things would be better. “Unfortunately, the situation is going from bad to worse again and we do not want to put our loved ones in danger by staying here any longer,” said Ashish Konar, a goldsmith before leaving.“These workers are leaving in droves daily. Private vehicles are mostly hired by them to reach to their places safely. Apparently, they are scared of a lockdown and dipping income,” said TDP GHMC minority cell vic-president, Mohammed Ahmed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/daily-wagers-from-old-city-heading-back-to-their-states/articleshow/82377132.cms||---

Already the demand to replace KPCC chief Mullappally Ramachandran and opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala has gained momentum in the party. However, there are speculations that Ramesh will not take up the post of the opposition leader, following Oommen Chandy’s example in 2016. “A radical change is required in the party. I am not saying that it is going to become smooth by changing one or two leaders from their posts. But, there has to be a sea change in the party,” said senior leader PT Thomas. Apart from KPCC leadership, there is also demand that there should be a thorough revamp of the district Congress committees (DCC). The leaders are of the view that the entire party machinery at the grassroots are defunct. “The party needs some kind of rejuvenation for which we need leaders who have mass support both at the district and state levels. Even after a dismal performance in several districts in local body elections, the party leadership was not ready to rectify mistakes,” said asenior leader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/clamour-in-kerala-congress-to-change-leadership/articleshow/82379656.cms||---

The apex court had said that state police and DGPs would be pulled up for contempt of court for any clampdown on citizens for airing grievances on deficiencies in healthcare during the pandemic. A senior officers said that these were cases in April and they were not seeking help or drawing attention of the government.The DGP office has said that so far registered 30 cases of black-marketing of remdesivir injections and in these cases 92 people have been arrested so far.

---||Mumbai||Covid-19 vaccination: Maharashtra to get 10.5 lakh more doses over next 3 days, says Centre||MUMBAI: Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said on Monday that the BMC was likely to get a stock of 1 lakh doses between by Tuesday morning. The BMC will, for the first time, also do vaccinations in a non-healthcare setting, the Kohinoor Parking lot in Dadar, from Tuesday. The BMC continued with its token drive for the 18-44 age group for the third day in a row, immunising 2,394 from the lot of 20,000 vaccines it got from the state government. Although the drive for over 45-plus was halted for four days due to a stockout, the daily update showed that 410 shots were given to senior citizens and another 375 in the 45-59 age group. “This was given in private hospitals that have started vaccination using stocks they have perhaps purchased directly from Serum Institute of India,” said BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare. HN Reliance Hospital in Girgaum and Apollo Hospital in Nerul were the private hospitals that started the drive, and Nanavati Hospital will start Tuesday onwards. A civic official said that private hospitals can vaccinate any age group with vaccines they procure. Meanwhile, as per data from the Union health ministry, Maharashtra on Monday had 23,547 doses of doses left but 10.5 lakh more were in the pipeline and would be received by the state in the next three days. It also said that percentage of wastage reported by the state was 0.2%. Maharashtra carried out a record 5.5 lakh vaccinations in a day a few days ago and the state has been demanding adequate stocks as per its performance. Public health minister Rajesh Tope said the state could scale up its capacity to vaccinate eight lakh daily, but the pace has been affected due to the shortage. A state official said the 10.5 lakh stock in the pipeline will merely last three days. “We are hoping to get some stock by Tuesday, but there is no clarity on the quantity," said the official. On Sunday, the state managed to vaccinate 47,693 people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-to-get-10-5l-more-doses-over-next-3-days-says-centre/articleshow/82377586.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Chandigarh||Remdesivir black marketing: Kingpin nabbed from Panipat||CHANDIGARH: Haryana Police on Monday arrested the kingpin of a racket in connection with black-marketing of Remdesivir drug, which is in high demand for the treatment of Covid-19 patients, from Panipat district. The arrested accused has been identified as Pardeep, a resident of Sector-13/17 in Panipat. A Haryana Police spokesperson said the primary probe had revealed that the arrested accused used to buy injection from an Uttarakhand resident for Rs 12,000 per vial and then sold the same between Rs 15,000 and Rs 30 000. Pardeep had already black marketed 650 injections out of 750 vials brought so far. Of these, he reportedly gave 100 injections to his nephew Sumit, 150 to one Saksham and 40 injections to another accused Keshav for selling in the black market. It may be mentioned here that acting on a tip-off, the police on April 27 had nabbed three youths from Panipat on the charges of black-marketing of Remdesivir injection and recovered 19 vials from their possession. They were taken on police remand and during the course of the remand period, the accused had revealed that they had purchased the seized vials from Pardeep, who runs a medical store at a hospital located on Sanoli Road in the district. Soon after getting this information, a police team immediately nabbed Pradeep and when interrogated, the accused confessed to have been involved in black-marketing of the vials. On completion of the police remand of accused Sumit, Saksham and Keshav, they were produced in local court that sent them to judicial custody. Accused Pradeep is on four-day police remand for intensive interrogation. During investigation, it also came to light that the wrapper of the seized vials was quite different from company’s injection and seemed that these were not original. The cops have requested the public to beware of such gangs involved in black-marketing and immediately inform the authorities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/remdesivir-black-marketing-kingpin-nabbed-from-panipat/articleshow/82377578.cms||---
---||Kochi||Political parties could have avoided big gatherings: Chief electoral officer Teeka Ram Meena||Conducting an assembly election during a pandemic was a new experience for the Election Commission of India in the state. Chief electoral officer Teeka Ram Meena spoke to TOI’s K P Sai Kiran about the meticulous planning that went in to ensure that Covid protocols were followed. Excerpts: You just concluded a challenging election. Can you list out what it took to make it successful? To begin with, the commission issued detailed guidelines for the general public, elections officials, state government departments, etc. The commission instructed us to increase the number of polling booths so that the number of voters in a booth comes down from 1,400 to 1,000 in urban areas and from 1,200 to 1,000 in rural areas. We calculated that we needed around 15,000 new rooms. We took almost a month to finalize new locations that would also ensure minimum facilities in the booths which went up from 25,000 to 40,700. In the Lok Sabha elections, we had almost 2,30,000 polling staff. This had to be enhanced by a lakh more. How were the Covid-19 protocols ensured? All polling officials were vaccinated. We gave detailed guidelines on protocols to be followed, including on how to dispose of used gloves, masks and PPE kits. We procured enough N95 masks, hand sanitizers, PPE kits, disposable gloves, thermal guns and soaps for all booths and officials. During this election 19,27,418 N95 masks, 13,20,000 sanitizers, 3,50,000 PPE kits, and over 40,800 thermal guns were used. To enforce guidelines, we appointed a state nodal officer. While DMOs acted as district nodal officers, there were also booth-level health nodal officers. But the post-election period is witnessing a huge surge in Covid cases. The political parties should have avoided what I would call a ‘Thandava Nritham’ in the name of elections. It is a democratic process, which may be the reason why the ECI, in their own wisdom, trusted and expected that the responsible political parties would restrain themselves from such gatherings, but that was not done. This resulted in the Djinn being brought out from the pot. When it went out of control, the high court commented, and then the commission put a lot of restrictions. The discipline was seen after that, but by the time, the damage was done. Coming back to the elections, the commission had to face flak from the opposition over duplicate voters. The issue was simply blown out of proportion. We neither panicked, nor were we racked by a guilty conscience. How and why it happened was not a state-specific issue. Some people may enter their names several times. Some may not delete them while migrating to another place. The software does not correct them automatically. There are some procedures to remove them. The opposition leader said that some officials did it purposefully. It is not true. While opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala said that there are almost 4.34 lakh duplicate voters, the commission could locate only approximately 38,000.  I don’t know how he got those figures. We reported the matter to the election commission, and they sent their engineers. The officer in charge of the matter was also here, and we sat together and did the rectification. But there was no such issue on election day. There was no double voting. I don’t know where the so-called duplicate voters went during the elections. There were allegations that some officials were conniving with the ruling front to create duplicate voters. In this state, officials may have political affiliations but when they are deputed for the election process, neutrality and impartiality is also maintained. The allegations were extremely unfortunate. There were reports that the CEO, Bihar was sent to the state for smooth conduct of elections? He was sent here because he was in charge of ERO-Net software that is processing the entire voters list. Being an electronic engineer himself, he was here along with the team of engineers to rectify the matter. Even on the counting day, there were issues with the ECI’s Encore software. There was delay in uploading result details in many places. The matter has been reported to the ECI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/political-parties-could-have-avoided-big-gatherings-meena/articleshow/82376878.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: City’s 1st drive-in vax centre opens today; seniors, differently abled can get jab in car||Mumbai: In a first for the city, the multi-storey Kohinoor parking lot in Dadar has been turned into a civic vaccination centre with a drive-in facility. It will open its doors on Tuesday. Senior citizens and the differently abled can get their jabs while seated in their parked vehicles. After getting their shots, they can spend the mandatory 30-minute observation period inside their vehicles as well. The drive-in vaccination centre has been set up following demands for home vaccination of those who cannot queue up outside centres and considering that the inoculation drive is still to take off in housing societies. The centre, located opposite the BMC’s G-North Ward, has the capacity to vaccinate up to 5,000 persons in a day, 200 of whom would get their jabs through the drive-in facility. Shiv Sena corporator Preeti Patankar and Vishakha Raut, corporator of the neighbouring ward and party leader in the BMC, said they had jointly pitched for a major vaccination centre to cater to citizens of both their wards—Dadar and Shivaji Park. “While a centre is being set up in each corporator ward, we decided to go for one major centre for both wards due to the large space available within the parking lot. This will ensure physical distancing as well. The drive-in facility is specially for those persons who are not very mobile. In such cases, generally, the BMC arranges for wheelchairs at the vaccination centres. But we thought of setting up a facility in such a way that they would not need to be inconvenienced at all. As it is a parking lot, we plan to place blowers and large fans as well to ensure there is adequate ventilation too,” said Raut, adding the BMC was “very prompt” in making the arrangements. Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner, G-North Ward, said last year, the same facility was used for RT-PCR tests. “We received a very good response for swab testing as well. In case of the vaccination centre, we have already tied up with a nearby hospital that will address post-vaccination issues, if any. An ambulance will be stationed at the facility too. Citizens bringing their vehicles would need to pay parking charges,” he said. Parking charges are Rs 60 an hour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-citys-1st-drive-in-vax-centre-opens-today-seniors-differently-abled-can-get-jab-in-car/articleshow/82376895.cms||Richa Pinto

---||Chandigarh||As cases mount, it’s a struggle to find ICU, oxygenated beds in Punjab||CHANDIGARH: As Punjab is reeling under a mounting caseload, the health facilities treating Covid patients in the state are fast running out of beds, especially the Level III beds meant for treating critically ill patients. With a steep rise in the number of patients getting critically ill, finding an intensive care unit (ICU) and oxygenated beds in the state has become a struggle. Punjab is among seven states in the country having more than 50,000 active cases. As many as 7,525 patients were on oxygen and 229 in critical condition required ventilator support as on May 2. Health experts fear that the situation will further deteriorate if the government fails to ramp up the existing bed capacity as the state is projected to continue reporting more than 6,000 cases a day in the coming days. In most of the districts, ICU beds in government and private health facilities are either full to the brim or on the verge of getting overwhelmed. Punjab has 8,645 oxygen beds of which 3,586 were available, while only 285 ICU beds out of 1,964 were vacant as on 5 pm on May 3. The hospital occupancy report of the health department reveals that no ICU beds were available in Tarn Taran while only one was available in Ferozepur, two each in Hoshiarpur and Moga, four in Nawanshahr, and five in Bathinda. Patiala, the home district of chief minister Amarinder Singh, had 10 ICU beds, Pathankot 17 and Mohali 20. The state government has so far failed to set up ICU beds in as many as eight districts namely Barnala, Fazilka, Gurdaspur, Kapurthala, Mansa, Ropar, Sangrur and Muktsar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/as-cases-mount-its-a-struggle-to-find-icu-oxygenated-beds-in-punjab/articleshow/82377590.cms||Vinod Kumar

---||Nagpur||Early chest CT scan may give false sense of security, deadly for some Covid patients||NAGPUR: Getting chest CT scan done on first or second day after testing positive has resulted in false sense of security, which proved deadly for some Covid-19 positive patients, say doctors. Seeing the trend of frequent CT scans by patients in second wave, doctors have cautioned about its adverse impact on patients. Pulmonologist Dr Rajesh Swarnakar told TOI, “Some patients are doing chest CT scan on their own as soon as they test positive. CT score doesn’t dictate the treatment, and oxygen saturation level (SpO2) is the single most important factor to decide on hospital admission. After low CT score in initial days, some patients land up with high infection in a week or more, of which some died. It happened as the first low CT score gave them false sense of security.” Radiologist Dr Vinay Borkar said, “Relatives of a 59-yr-old woman from Yavatmal insisted on her CT scan on the day she tested positive. Score was 1, which is not at all serious. Therefore, the relatives decided to facilitate oxygen and other facilities to the patient at home. Her condition deteriorated after six days. Then, the doctors advised CT scan and score was 15. The woman was shifted to ICU of a super specialty hospital, but could not survive.” Dr Swarnakar, also national secretary of Indian Chest Society, added, “We advise CT scan in initial stage only if patient has all symptoms of Covid-19 but RT-PCR results are negative. It should not be done on asymptomatic and mild symptomatic patients in early days. CT scan should be done days 5-6, when inflammation really begins to show. Imaging can also be used as a diagnostic modality in situations when there is concern about progression of the disease or worsening respiratory status. Some patients question us how score increased after hospitalization. Some patients even did three CT scan 10 days to chase the score, which is really unnecessary and risky.” Head of radiology department of GMCH Dr Ramesh Parate said, “CT scan is not healthy for patients. One CT scan is equivalent to radio-exposure of more than 100 chest X-rays,” he said. AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria too said in a tweet on Monday, “One scan is equivalent to 300 chest X-rays and very harmful. CT scan and biomarkers are being misused. There is no advantage in doing it if you have mild symptoms.” Dr Swarnakar said, “Patients also come to us with reports on their mobile and don’t have films, which are actually required to see the type of lesion.” The doctor said, “Some patients request us to advice CT scan after recovery to see whether score dropped or not. Radiological clearance takes time and lags behind the clinical improvement, and may take upto 1-3 months to completely clear.” Some patients are even getting chest CT scan done before Covid testing to check whether they have contracted the disease or not. It is also likely to give false sense of security if CT score is zero or less. Dr Swarnakar said, “Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not recommend CT scan or X-ray to diagnose Covid-19 and emphasizes that the only specific method to diagnose the disease is viral testing. Some people are doing CT scan as it gives quick diagnosis of Covid while RT-PCR results take 1-2 or more days. It is totally wrong procedure.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/early-chest-ct-scan-may-give-false-sense-of-security-deadly-for-some-covid-patients/articleshow/82376025.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Hyderabad||Covid-19 claims 5 members of Andhra Pradesh family in a span of 20 days||GUNTUR: Five members of a retired school teacher’s family in Guntur district have succumbed to Covid-19 in a span of 20 days. What was more tragic was all victims died in different hospitals, with the surviving members unaware that their family members were no more in this world. Shaik Fareed (62), a retired headmaster of a zilla parishad high school in Rajupalem mandal of Guntur district, and four of his family members passed away one after another in different hospitals of the state. Fareed’s daughter Jani Begum (35) was the first to succumb to the virus on April 5. Over the course of the next few days, the virus claimed Fareed’s 78-year old mother too. When the retired teacher, a popular figure in the area for his helping nature, his wife Karimunnisa and son Subhani developed Covid complications, they initially got treatment from a local registered medical practitioner (RMP), but were rushed to a nearby hospital only after they started facing breathing issues. Social activist Kamal Saida from Atchampet said Fareed was on oxygen support at the hospital for over 10 days and succumbed to the virus on April 20. The relatives did not share the information with his wife and 32-year old son, as they too were in a critical condition in the same hospital. Last Friday, 10 days after Fareed’s death, his wife Karimunnisa and son Subhani also breathed their last in different wards of the same private hospital within a span of few hours. The other members of the family are still in a state of shock over the tragic death of their dear ones. State municipal teachers federation president S Ramakrishna said the entire teaching community still can’t believe that the affable Fareed sir is no more. “He was known to be a good teacher. After his retirement, he used to help anyone who approached him. We are all in a state of shock,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-19-claims-5-members-of-ap-family-in-a-span-of-20-days/articleshow/82378395.cms||Samdani MN

As per the local health department officials, the number of active cases in Begusarai stood at 5641 as on Sunday compared to 4675 on April 28. As per official figures, as many as 95 persons have lost their lives in the district so far due to the pandemic. However, officials claimed there is no dearth of medical oxygen in the district. According to Begusarai DM Arvind Kumar Verma, the district has not only the capability of meeting the requirements of Covid patients here but also helping some neighbouring districts to meet the supply of medical oxygen demand there. Though all private hospitals designated to treat Covid patients are reported to be running out of beds, a large number of beds with oxygen facility are lying vacant in the Begusarai Sadar hospital and a few other institutional Covid dedicated hospitals, officials claim. As per information provided by the local health department, there are altogether 447 oxygen-equipped beds in various private and government hospitals in the district. However, only 15 patients were admitted against the total capacity of 50 oxygen-equipped at the Sadar hospital as on Sunday. Similarly, only 29 patients were admitted at the R S D Engineering College dedicated Covid hospital against the total capacity of 50 oxygen-equipped beds. Union minister Giriraj Singh inaugurated a new intensive care unit (ICU) at the Sadar hospital with ventilator facility a few days ago. District immunization officer Dr Gopal Mishra on Monday said Covid vaccination programme for people over 45 years of age has been smooth in the district and so far over 2.58 lakh people have got the first dose of the vaccine. He said the vaccination programme is currently going on at 40 centres and the district faces no shortage of vaccines. “Begusarai currently stands at fifth position in the overall list of districts carrying out vaccination programme across the state,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rise-in-active-covid-cases-in-begusarai/articleshow/82376022.cms||Rajiv Kumar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai records 2,624 Covid-19 cases, down from 11,000-plus in early April||MUMBAI: Almost a month after Mumbai logged its worst single-day tally of 11,206 Covid-19 cases, the graph dipped sharply on Monday, with 2,624 cases detected in a 24-hour period. While the 23,542 tests done to detect these cases were lower than the city's daily average of 44,000 (in April), officials said the worst appears to be over as far as the second wave is concerned. However, the daily toll remains high with 78 deaths recorded on Monday, showing a daily case fatality rate (CFR) of 2.9%, almost twice the daily CFR reported last week. Officials have maintained that the daily toll will plateau this week and start dropping thereafter. The city's tally so far is 6.58 lakh cases and 13,372 deaths. Similarly, Maharashtra had a 15% dip in daily detection and fatalities on Monday, the second consecutive day of a decline in cases. The state had 48,621 cases and 567 deaths, taking total cases to 47.7 lakh while the toll touched 70,851.   Officials said daily detections were down owing to fewer tests over the weekend and fatalities had dipped due to delay in updating data. The state conducted 2.1 lakh tests in the last 24 hours, a dip from the 2.5-2.7 lakh tests it conducts during the weekdays. “Mumbai's daily positivity rate is low (11.3%) though we did fewer tests over the weekend,” said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. In contrast, positivity rate on April 4 was 30%, meaning every third person tested was positive. BMC commissioner I S Chahal, in a statement on Monday, said “our aggressive testing policy has resulted in reduction of positivity rate.” However, he noted that there has been a reduction in demand for tests in the last few days. Since the World Health Organisation recommends that positivity rate should be below 5% before policies to unlock a city/country are taken, BMC may have to increase the daily number of tests. In a positive sign, the Union health ministry said Delhi, Gujarat Maharashtra, are showing early signs of plateauing or decrease in daily cases of Covid-19. However, the ministry cautioned that these are very early signs. It said 12 districts in Maharashtra have reported a decline in the last 15 days—Mumbai, Aurangabad, Bhandara, Dhule, Gondia, Latur, Jalgaon, Nanded, Nandurbar, Thane among them. Officials said this is a sign that lockdown like restrictions have worked. Cases in Mumbai Metropolitan Region have also dropped to 6,680 from the average 10,000. However, the region reported 195 deaths. Kalyan-Dombivli had 498 new patients in the last 24 hours, but deaths were at nine. Dr Pratibha Panpatil, health officer of Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation, said, “Situation in the twin cities is under some control as now we have oxygen and ICU beds in many hospitals while there is still shortage of ventilator beds as many old patients are still undergoing treatment.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-records-2624-cases-down-from-11000-plus-in-early-april/articleshow/82377600.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Nagpur||Rise in Covid patients with low HRCT score||NAGPUR: In another sign of respite for citizens, diagnostic centres in the city have observed that the HRCT score among Covid patients who reported in the last one week has gone down substantially. Most of them are having a CT score of 0 to 5 as compared to 10 and above that was being reported until recently. The workload at scanning centres has also reduced by half. The trend has baffled doctors and radiologists as the number of new cases hasn’t gone down in the same proportion. But the pressure on resources is gradually easing, they said. A low HRCT score indicates less lung involvement due to Covid infection. Consultant radiologist Dr MA Biviji said, “Our workload has declined by half in about a week. Also, earlier most cases had a very high CT score while we are reporting normal and low CT score now. Yet, some patients are showing a high score,” he said. Asked if it was due to more number of centres, Dr Biviji said, “I agree the city has many centres, but they didn’t open in the last 15 days or a month but were there before the second wave,” he said. Metroscan director Dr Atul Dakhole said, “Patients don’t have to wait now as rush is over. Many of them are normal while others have a score of up to 5. Around 20 to 25% patients have score of above 5 or 10. Severity and number of patients has dipped as compared to last week,” he said. Medical microbiologist Dr Sarfaraz Ahmed differed with observation of scan centres. “Low score is because people may be going early for scan,” he said. Dr Ahmed, who runs a Covid testing centre, agreed that number of serious patients has somewhat declined. “Contact tracing and awareness among people has worked. If one member in family turns positive, all go for testing. Most of them are seen to be asymptomatic. I feel positivity would further go down in the next one week. Number of tests too are dipping,” he said. Critical care expert Dr Imran Noor Mohammad said that CT scan doesn’t have much significance in prognosis or diagnosis of Covid. “Its basic aim is to ascertain characteristic feature of Covid in the absence of RT-PCR test. It may give a false sense of security. Many patients had high score of 18 to 19 and improved while those with 5 deteriorated,” he warned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rise-in-covid-patients-with-low-hrct-score/articleshow/82376039.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Another major development for the district is that recoveries are more than new cases for last four consecutive days. Recoveries were 6,601 as against 4,987 new cases on Monday. On Sunday, there were 5,007 cases and 6,376 recoveries while 7,575 patients recovered on May 1 and there were 6,576 cases. On April 30, there were 6,461 cases and 7,294 recoveries. The active cases also declined to 72,437 on Monday. It resulted in further increase in vacant beds in the district. As per data of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), 450 beds with oxygen supply and 38 in ICU were vacant in the district on Monday morning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-19-cases-drop-below-5k-after-27-days-in-district/articleshow/82376047.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Apart from night curfew from 8pm to 6am, the government had announced a slew of restrictions in 29 cities and towns from April 28 to May 5. A formal decision on the likely continuation of night curfew and restrictions is expected to be taken at the cabinet meeting on May 5. Key sources in the government indicated that the daily number of Covid-19 positive cases are still hovering around the 14,000 mark and any relaxation in the restrictions could again cause a spike in cases. “A lot of efforts are still required to ensure that the health facilities are able to match up to the number of new daily cases. After getting feedback from various quarters, officials have advised the government to continue with night curfew and restrictions in 29 cities and towns,” a source in the government said. Sources further said that after May 5, restrictions are likely to remain in force for one to two weeks. “It has been learnt that some commercial and service establishments remained open although a majority were closed. From May 6 there could be some additional restrictions on commercial and service establishments. Some non-essential industries could also be asked to restrict operations,” sources said. Sources however stated that a total lockdown across the state is an option only if the central government gives directions to this effect. “The state government will consider a state-wide lockdown only if the Union government directs it to do so,” a source said. Following a Covid control advisory by the central government last month, the Gujarat government had announced a series of restrictions and increased the number of cities and towns under night curfew.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/night-curfew-likely-to-continue-in-cities-in-gujarat/articleshow/82376918.cms||Kapil Dave

---||Goa||‘Adopt four-pronged strategy against Covid’||Panaji: The state government needs to immediately adopt a four-pronged strategy that hinges on a state-wide 15-day lockdown, vaccination, data transparency, and a central command and control centre to manage the ongoing Covid-19 crisis, said GFP president Vijai Sardesai on Monday. Sardesai has urged the government to implement the recommendations of health authorities and legislative opposition members without attaching political motives to the recommendations. “Goa’s current load of 25,839 active cases along with Goa’s mortality rate and positivity rate are far too high for its small population, and this is extremely alarming. This callous response is more than just a national embarrassment, these are people’s lives that Goa is losing everyday,” Sardesai said. Sardesai said that a 15-day lockdown will stop the spread of the novel coronavirus and also give necessary breathing space for Goa’s medical staff. He said Goa needs to seal its borders and make Covid negative certificates mandatory for visitors entering the state. The Fatorda MLA also urged the state government to “innoculate as many Goans as soon as possible” and if required to urgently deploy the Rs300 crore Liberation anniversary fund to source the necessary vaccines. He called for greater transparency from the government particularly regarding the availability of vaccines, beds, oxygen and other requirements. “This is why we need a command centre with a dedicated team to help and assist all Goans in real time,” Sardesai said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/adopt-four-pronged-strategy-against-covid/articleshow/82377631.cms||---
---||Mumbai||As nos. dip, Chahal urges Mumbaikars to get tested||Mumbai: Amid a drop in the number of Covid -19 tests, BMC commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal on Monday appealed to citizens to come forward and get themselves tested in case of symptoms. Chahal said while it has been the BMC’s policy to conduct maximum tests to flush out the novel coronavirus from Mumbai, testing figures have fallen in the last few days, from 50,000 plus to 38,000 plus on Saturday and 28,636 on Sunday. Prior to this, BMC’s highest single-day testing from March 2020 till February 10, 2021 (when the second wave hit Mumbai) was 24,500. Chahal said immediately thereafter testing was doubled and touched 56,000 tests on a single day in April 2021. “Our average daily testing in April was nearly 44,000 per day. It has been observed that testing figures have fallen in the past few days, and it is likely to fall further during weekends. Our aggressive testing policy has resulted in reduction of positivity rate. This might have reduced the natural demand for home collection of swabs in the last few days. We need to increase the testing to 40,000 per day at least, if not more,” said Chahal. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/as-nos-dip-chahal-urges-mumbaikars-to-get-tested/articleshow/82377623.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Fewer beds in city, demand for air ambulance skyrockets||NAGPUR: If people have driven hundreds of kilometres in ambulances in search of a bed for Covid patients, those having the money have flown out. As beds and medicines were short, many a rich have taken an air ambulance to reach a hospital. The most preferred destination is Hyderabad, the capital of Telangana, said the flight operators providing air ambulance services from Nagpur. This is because hospital beds were available in the city due to comparatively less cases there. In April, nearly 10 air ambulances took off from Nagpur, said airport sources. This means two in a week. Seven were domestic flights. The international flight included the plane which took the French citizen employed at Mihan back to his country after he had contracted Covid. Among the international flights, a couple of air ambulances had landed in Nagpur for refuelling, said a source. Operators said this has been a tough time. The demand is high and there are limited aircraft that can be operated as air ambulances. Fares have gone up by almost 50% of the normal times, said sources. “It’s not Nagpur alone, patients are being flown from much smaller towns also. A day ago a patient was taken from Akola. Flights are taking off from places like Nanded, Gaya, Ranchi and Guwahati. The patients are being taken to bigger places like Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad or Chennai,” said Rajesh Sahu from Aurea Aviation Private Limited, one of players offering the service. Sahu said his company handled more than eight air ambulances from Nagpur during the last month. According to Sahu, in the normal course it may take around Rs10 lakh for an air ambulance to be flown to Hyderabad or any destination at a similar distance. “These days it’s up to Rs14 to 15 lakh,” he said. “A specific permission is needed to operate a plane as an air ambulance. Under the current circumstances, 8 to 9 are available, leading to a tight position. There are also risks involved in taking the patient till the aircraft. For a Covid patient, no relative is allowed. The cost of other inputs has also gone up,” he said. Sahu feels considering the emergency situation the government should allow using other aircraft as air ambulances also. “The authorities need to ease the rules in such a situation,” he said. Onboard, Covid patients are kept in a pod which is a protective cover with oxygen arrangement. The pods are not made in India and have to be imported from Germany. “This leads to a cost of Rs18 to Rs20 lakh. There should be attempts for local production also,” he said. Some of the handling agencies are wary of catering to Covid patients due to the tough conditions laid by aircraft operators. “We are avoiding Covid cases because of the high costs involved, but it has been learnt that some of the patients have also flown abroad in an air ambulance,” said a represative of a handling firm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fewer-beds-in-city-demand-for-air-ambulance-skyrockets/articleshow/82376057.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Nagpur||Remdesivir ingredient testing kicks off at Wardha lab||NAGPUR: The process of manufacturing investigational anti-viral drug Remdesivir in Maharashtra kicked off on Monday when Genetek Lifesciences Private Limited began testing theactive ingredients at it’s Wardha laboratory. Around 20 scientists are engaged in the process, which is likely to end on April 14, when the first batch of 25,000 vials would be ready for the market, if there are no inadvertent delays. Genetek Lifesciences had got the crucial loan licenses from Hetero Labs Limited, which in turn has got non-exclusive voluntary licensing agreement with US-based Gilead Sciences to manufacture Ebola repurposed drug Remdesivir in India. It was Union minister Nitin Gadkari whose efforts ensured Genetek got the approval from the Drug Controller General of India and also Food and Drugs Administration promptly. Mahendra Kshirsagar, managing director of the pharmaceutical company, said the testing of the ingredients would be over by Tuesday and the actual manufacturing would take place on Thursday. “The manufacturing is a day-long process, which we intend to wrap up by Thursday evening. On Friday, our quality assurance and control teams would take over the testing of the product. The sterility test would take seven days,” he said. As per Kshirsagar, the product would most likely be ready by May 14, and will be handed over to Hetero Labs Limited, from whom it has procured the loan-license to manufacture the anti-viral injection. “Hetero Labs would give the manufactured drugs to the government, which would decide on distribution and allocations,” he said. Kshirsagar said during the seven-day testing of the drug his company would utilize the time to complete multiple layers of packaging, labelling and shifting the drugs to the cold storage. “A strength of around 100 workers is engaged in the entire process,” he said. Kshirsagar also sounded hopeful that their ‘form, fill and seal’ technology would receive approval after successful sustainability, suitability and stability tests, in which medical-grade plastics can be used to replace traditional glass vials. “If we get the approval, our production would be up to 2.5 lakh vials per day,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/remdesivir-ingredient-testing-kicks-off-at-wardha-lab/articleshow/82376052.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Chennai||Rumblings in AIADMK over party’s choice for oppn leader||CHENNAI/SALEM: A day after the Tamil Nadu assembly poll results, divisions within the vanquished AIADMK came to the fore on Monday. There were hectic parleys and some muscle flexing over who would be the leader of the opposition — outgoing chief minister and AIADMK co-coordinator Edappadi K Palaniswami or party coordinator O Panneerselvam. The DMK alliance including the Congress, the MDMK, the VCK, the CPI and the CPM had won 159 seats, while the party on its own won 133 seats. The AIADMK won 66 seats. Its alliance, which included the BJP and the PMK, won 75 seats. On Monday, hours after EPS resigned as CM following his party’s defeat, the AIADMK issued a statement convening a meeting of its elected representatives on May 7. DMK president and CM-designate M K Stalin is scheduled to be assume office on the same day. The AIADMK’s release, signed by OPS and EPS, did not, however, mention a reason for the meeting, except to say that all MLAs should be present. But another joint statement said the party would function as a responsible opposition in the legislative assembly. Meanwhile, in the evening, several ministers arrived at Palaniswami’s residence in Salem, ostensibly to seek his blessings. They included K A Sengottaiyan, P Thangamani, K C Karuppannan, K P Anbalagan, Sevoor Ramachandran, Dindigul C Sreenivasan and Rajya Sabha MP K P Munusamy, who also won the Veppanahalli constituency in Krishnagiri district. Sources said the newly elected MLAs discussed with EPS for more than an hour the ‘agenda’ for the Friday meeting wherein the issue of who would be leader of the house was taken up. “The dynamics of the dual leadership is proving to be a stumbling block,” said a close OPS associate. Both leaders want to be opposition leaders. While those close to OPS argue that as AIADMK coordinator, he should be chosen the leader of the opposition, EPS supporters say that as a CM candidate and having helped the party record an impressive victory in the western belt, by winning 38 of the 54 seats, he should be the leader of the opposition. The AIADMK’s victories in 15 of the 84 seats in the northern region is being attributed to EPS and his decision to concede to ally PMK’s demand for 10.5% vanniayar quota. EPS won with a thumping margin of close to 94,000 votes in his Edappadi constituency whereas Panneerselvam’s victory margin was around 11,000. Moreover, the AIADMK won only 18 of the 60 seats in the south. “Only a handful of OPS supporters won in the south. The credit for winning most of the 66 seats goes to EPS. We are firm he should be made the leader of the opposition,” said an associate. While the tug of war could cause further divisions within the AIADMK, the party is likely to thrash out a compromise formula to keep “bigger enemies” at bay.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/rumblings-in-aiadmk-over-partys-choice-for-oppn-leader/articleshow/82377605.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Samples of those vaxed but still critical sent for genome sequencing||NAGPUR: Taking note of the variant B.1.617, the ministry of health has asked laboratories in the region to send samples of patients who have got Covid-19 infection despite being partially or fully vaccinated, and have developed moderate to severe kind of illness. The variant is supposed to have originated from Vidarbha, and responsible for the present second wave of Covid-19 in the country. Sources in the laboratories at Nagpur told TOI that labs in Vidarbha are sending samples of patients who get Covid-19 despite one or two doses of vaccine, if their disease turns moderate to severe level despite vaccination. “Such patients are very few in number. But the directives show that authorities are seriously behind the Vidarbha variant of Covid-19. We are sending samples to ICMR, New Delhi,” said a senior official in charge of one of the leading government labs in Nagpur. TOI had reported on April 21 that the variant B.1.617 is significantly more infectious. The authorities are now checking whether this variant defies the antibodies developed by the vaccine. This is why the samples of vaccinated yet severe patients are sought for genome sequencing. The present genome study of the variants show that L452R mutation, which is shared by B.1.617 (India) variant, is about 20% more infectious, with higher viral loads, and shows some immune evasion. But scientists were not expecting it to reduce vaccine efficacy. The present genome study of the samples from Vidarbha will throw light on this part of the variant. Doctors working in Covid-19 hospitals told TOI that those who complete both doses of vaccine are quite protected after two weeks of final vaccination. Even if they get infected, they don’t need hospitalization and recover at home. But, some of those who have taken first dose of vaccine may need hospitalization and could succumb to the infection. Such cases need to be studied.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/samples-of-those-vaxed-but-still-critical-sent-for-genome-sequencing/articleshow/82376064.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Delhi||Funeral count in Delhi dips a bit, but it may not be an ‘encouraging’ trend yet||NEW DELHI: After continuous growth for over last month, there is now a downward trend in the number of Covid protocol funerals over the last few days, senior officials from the public health department confirm. Data from civic bodies shows that after having crossed the 700 funerals per day-mark last week, the 28 Covid-designated funeral facilities in the city saw 620 funerals on Sunday. A senior public health official said that they were seeing a decrease in the daily numbers since April 30. “After having peaked at 717 Covid protocol funerals on April 29, we are witnessing a downward trend with 711 such funerals registered on April 30, 697 such funerals on May 1 and 620 funerals on May 2,” the official said citing the daily Covid funeral reports from the city’s three corporations. Officials say that while this is a brief respite and Covid-designated capacity is not being augmented for now, they will be closely observing the trend in coming days to gauge the need to increase space for Covid funeral sites. Another civic official said that it was likely that many people dying in homes and outside hospitals were being cremated as “non-Covid normal” funerals, which could also be impacting the real count. Moreover, all funerals do not take place on same day of death. “It is too soon to say anything, but reduction in numbers in the past four days is an encouraging sign,” the official added. The dead bodies, which are marked as Covid or Covid-suspected, are laid to rest following a set of protocols issued by the health ministry and they are classified as Covid protocol funerals. The three municipal bodies have so far increased the daily Covid cremation capacity to 1,060. As many as 28 sites across the city have been operating as Covid-designated crematoriums and burial grounds. On May 2, a total of 620 Covid funerals took place till 6pm — 603 cremations and 17 burials. Out of these 620 funerals, 280 took place in 14 centres under the north corporation, 267 in nine centres of the south corporation and 73 in east corporation funeral centres. On April 24, the daily count was 585 Covid funerals, which rose to 666 a day after and to 696 on April 27. It crossed the 700-mark on April 28, when 702 such funerals took place. An official from South Delhi Municipal Corporation, who is overseeing the space allocation for Covid funerals, said that a total of 436 platforms and pyres had been reserved for Covid victims. “Additionally, 50 platforms/pyres at Sarai Kale Khan cremation centre and 13 platforms/pyres at Green Park cremation centre have been made available,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/funeral-count-dips-a-bit-but-it-may-not-be-an-encouraging-trend-yet/articleshow/82377672.cms||Paras Singh
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: TRS steamrolls opposition, sweeps civic elections with 7-0 win||HYDERABAD: The TRS juggernaut steamrolled its way to yet another electoral win on Monday by bagging both the municipal corporations of Warangal and Khammam and the five municipalities of Siddipet, Nakrekal, Jadcherla, Atchampet and Kothur. It also won three of the four wards which went for by-polls, making it a complete sweep. The ruling party not only retained power in the seven urban local bodies but also won enough seats to easily win the posts of mayor and deputy mayor in the two municipal corporations and chairperson and deputy chairperson in the five municipalities. The date for indirect election to these posts would be announced soon. It is most likely to be conducted on the day of the swearing-in of the newly elected members. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao thanked the people for giving TRS nearly 74% of the total wards in the seven urban local bodies. “Of the 248 wards that went to the polls, TRS won 181 seats, and another two were won by its ally CPI in Khammam town, taking the total to 183 wards. People have once again proved through their mandate that there is no alternative to the TRS in the state,” KCR said. “People wanted to send a message to KCR during the Dubbak and Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation polls, which they did it. The discontent this time around was not strong enough to defeat the ruling party. Also, BJP and Congress did not have an effective narrative against TRS in the ULB polls,” said political analyst Prof K Nageshwar. TRS carpet-bombed the poll-bound urban bodies with municipal minister K T Rama Rao leading the charge, assisted by ministers Errabelli Dayakar Rao, Puvvada Ajay Kumar, T Harish Rao, V Srinivas Goud among others. On the other hand, Congress and BJP were nowhere close to giving a scare to TRS. BJP could not repeat its Dubbak and GHMC magic in the ULB elections. The ruling party on Sunday won the Nagarjunasagar bypoll. Earlier, it won two graduate constituency legislative council seats. Forward Bloc second in Nakrekal Taking many by surprise, the All India Forward Bloc finished second in Nakrekal municipality by winning six wards. The BJP drew a blank in Kothur and Nakrekal municipalities and Congress scored a duck in Siddipet. Pawan Kalyan’s Jana Sena too drew a blank in Khammam town. The CPI, CPM too won a few seats. The AIMIM managed to win one ward in Siddipet. Independents may join TRS Although independents won from several wards in urban local bodies, the talk in political circles is that they will soon join TRS ranks. On their part, Congress, BJP and CPM are ensuring that their winning candidates are not poached by TRS. However, TRS leaders said they did not need to woo anyone as they had enough majority in all the ULBs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-steamrolls-opp-sweeps-civic-elections-with-7-0-win/articleshow/82378474.cms||Roushan Ali

---||Dehradun||27-year-old Covid-positive woman on oxygen support makes video saying there is drinking water scarcity at hospital, appeals to people to provide water, dies a day later||Dehradun: The video of a 27-year-old woman, admitted in the critical care unit of the government-run Susheela Tiwari Hospital (STH) in Haldwani, in which she can be heard saying that the hospital has no drinking water since the previous night and urging people to donate water to the hospital, went viral last week on Wednesday. A day later, on Thursday, the woman breathed her last. The hospital authorities meanwhile claimed that there was no scarcity of drinking water at the hospital and the patient died as she was very critical. In the 20-second video, the woman, who is on oxygen support, can be heard saying, “I am a Covid survivor admitted in the Susheela Tiwari Hospital. There is no drinking water in the hospital since last night. I appeal to people to donate water to us as early as possible as many people here are facing difficulties." Refuting the allegations of water crisis in the hospital, Dr Arun Joshi from the hospital administration told TOI that the woman was a critically-ill Covid patient. “She was having bilateral extensive pneumonitis, respiratory failure and hypoxia. She was being regularly attended to by the team of treating doctors, nursing staff and other paramedical staff. The senior doctors were seeing her and she was periodically also being seen by the in-house residents in the ICU. All standard treatment as per the stipulated norms and protocols was being given to her. She was on high flow oxygen therapy at 15 litres per minute. All meals were being provided to her and adequate quantity of water was also being given to her,” he said. According to the hospital authorities, the woman was a resident of Devalchaur locality in Haldwani and was admitted at the hospital for almost a fortnight. The hospital administration further said that four large bottles of mineral water are being provided to all patients every day. “On account of the constant high-flow oxygen therapy, the patient used to have dryness of tongue and subsequent craving for water. As such, there was no shortage in the supply of drinking water to any of the patients and she was attended to adequately at all times and appropriate nursing care was provided to her. We have also communicated the same to the concerned department in the state government,” added Dr Joshi. The woman’s husband when contacted by TOI said, “I am also quarantined at home along with other members of my family. I will go to the hospital to find out what has happened once I complete my isolation.” Meanwhile, after the video went viral, Congress leader from Haldwani Sumit Hridayesh started a drive to donate water to the hospital and said that he has donated 200 cartons of water bottles to the hospital twice in the last five days and has also motivated many of his friends to do so. STH is the biggest government Covid healthcare facility in Kumaon and is witnessing an influx of patients from various nearby areas like Bageshwar, Champawat, Pithoragarh and even from UP’s Pilibhit. The hospital has witnessed over 120 Covid deaths in the last five days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/27-year-old-covid-positive-woman-on-oxygen-support-makes-video-saying-there-is-drinking-water-scarcity-at-hospital-appeals-to-people-to-provide-water-dies-a-day-later/articleshow/82393338.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Resident doctors get upset as NEET-PG put off by 4 months||Mumbai: The decision to postpone NEET-PG by four months has not gone down well with resident doctors in the state. Not conducting it before August 31 will delay admissions to first year postgraduate courses by at least six months, changing the academic cycle for many. It will also mean that final year resident doctors, whose residency terms were to get over on April 30, may have to continue till the fresh batch joins. Dr Dnyaneshwar Dhobale-Patil, president, central Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) committee, said it was the most illogical decision taken by the Centre. “If NEET-PG is conducted earlier, more manpower will be available. Asking NEET aspirants (who completed MBBS) to work on Covid duty will be counterproductive. No one will leave preparations in between and work on Covid, unless compelled to. It is also putting pressure on final year resident doctors who are working on Covid for over a year,” he said. Another doctor said it will be unfortunate if the government decides to postpone final year exams till August. “If we are not relieved early, the entire cycle will get disturbed,” he said. “Since the Centre’s directive says our services ‘may’ be utilised till the fresh batch joins, we will request the state to relieve us sooner,” said the doctor. A NEET aspirant said the government should have conducted NEET-PG in January or February, when Covid was under control. Now the entire cycle is disturbed, he said, adding that their term will now start around October/November, instead of May. The Centre has also recommended deploying medical interns in Covid management duties. In Maharashtra, medical interns already started working on Covid, said director, Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER), Dr T P Lahane. He said doctors who completed MBBS are being roped in for bond service. Of 2,490 doctors eligible for bond, 1,048 have been allotted postings in rural areas and are working in Covid wards, said Lahane. For the other doctors, the portal will be opened again. Sudha Shenoy, a parent representative, asked why MBBS interns should alone be roped in for Covid duty, when government can also get interns from AYUSH hospitals to work. This will ease stress on healthcare professionals, she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-resident-doctors-get-upset-as-neet-pg-put-off-by-4-months/articleshow/82377655.cms||Yogita Rao
---||Pune||Caregiver, 5 aides arrested for robbing elderly couples in Pune||PUNE: Six people, including a 25-year-old caregiver, were arrested on Saturday on the charge of robbing senior citizens at Sindh Housing Society in Aundh and Panchavati in Pashan, leading to the recovery of gold and diamond ornaments worth Rs 15.50 lakh and three motorcycles from them. Deputy commissioner of police (Zone IV) Pankaj Deshmukh said the caregiver, Sandeep Bhagwan Hande, of Aurangabad was affiliated to 15 nursing bureaux and claimed that he specialised in catering to the needs of the elderly. However, after working with the couples for three to four months, he would leave the job only to rob them of valuables. While Hande was arrested from Pune, his accomplices — Mangesh Bandu Gunde (20), Rahul Kailas Bawane (22), Vikram Deepak Thapa (19), Kishor Kalyan Changhate (21) and Bholesh Kisan Chavan (25) — were arrested from Aurangabad, Jalna and Nashik. They have been remanded in police custody till May 10. Police obtained CCTV footage from the crime spots, analysed the technical data and zeroed in on Hande and his accomplices. “All of them are criminals on police records,” senior inspector Rajkumar Waghchaure said. “Hande used to work with the elderly couple in Sindh housing society in Aundh. The husband is a former land developer. On the night of April 25, Hande, Gunde and Bawane entered the bungalow of the land developer and robbed the couple and robbed diamond and gold ornaments worth Rs 15.80 lakh,” the police said. Hande had targeted the couple for the first time in November after leaving the job. The elderly couple had then failed to recognise him as he was wearing a mask, Waghchaure said. “About two years ago, he was employed as a caregiver with a former teacher (83) and his 80-year-old wife at Panchavati in Pashan. On March 3, he and his aides robbed them of valuables worth Rs 4.25 lakh,” Waghchaure said. Hande was previously arrested by the Kothrud, Sangvi, Chatushrungi, Nigdi and other police stations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/caregiver-5-aides-arrested-for-robbing-elderly-couples/articleshow/82376075.cms||---

Supported by Shiromani Akali Dal, these shopkeepers have announced to open the shops till 2pm from Tuesday. The shopkeepers on Monday held a dharna in the main sadar bazaar of the town and raised slogans against the state and the central governments. They insisted that instead of harassing small shopkeepers, the governments should make arrangements of oxygen, vaccines and other essentials in hospitals. The state government had ordered the closure of non-essential item shops from May 3 to 15. Beopar mandal president Anil Kumar Nana, beopar mahasangh president Neeraj Jindal, Shiromani Akali Dal halqa incharge Kulwant Singh Keetu, SAD’ former district president Sanjeev Shorey, and representatives of some trade unions asked the government to take back the order of closure of shops. They said the small shopkeepers were feeling the pinch for over a year now and they are feeling it tough to run the households with no income.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/backed-by-sad-barnala-traders-say-will-defy-lockdown/articleshow/82377633.cms||---

Estimates by Federation of Chemists and Druggists Association (FGSCDA) suggest that sales of steroids particularly dexamethasone and methyl prednisolone, have gone up by a good 10-fold in April.“Rise in cases have surely caused an increase in the sale of steroids. However, steroids are life-saving medicines and are not typically prescribed to all patients. But in the ongoing second wave of Covid-19 infections, at least seven in ten patients are prescribed these two steroids very frequently. This is against an estimated two in ten patients who were prescribed steroids and that too at a later stage,” said Alpesh Patel, president, FGSCDA. Patel also explained that most patients were given steroids after at least a week of getting infected and that too usually at the hospital, during the first wave. However, the treatment approach has now changed drastically. Ankur Aggarwal, founder, Medkart, said, “The sale of steroids are booming because patients are often prescribed these medicines at a much early stage. We’ve come across patients who have just contracted Covid and are prescribed steroids, to avert further complications. This was not the case in the earlier wave of Covid infections.” Industry players said that in the first wave, there was no shortage of critical medicines or access to hospitals and healthcare facilities, or even oxygen and thus, complications, if any, were handled at hospitals. “Such is not the case now. Therefore, the prescription of steroids has gone up,” said a city-based chemist. A senior city-based physician told TOI that steroids are being used indiscriminately for Covid-19 treatment. “Steroids like dexamethasone are life-saving when used at the right time. They generally come to play at the end of first week or start of the second week of the onset of symptoms. But nowadays many practitioners are prescribing it from the first day, hoping that the lung involvement gets under control,” said the physician. “But unchecked use can cause other side effects which can impact the patient even after getting cured of Covid-19.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/steroid-sales-rise-10-fold-in-covid-second-wave/articleshow/82376979.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||India||‘Giant killer’ Suvendu leads race for Bengal leader of opposition||KOLKATA: Pressure has been building on Suvendu Adhikari, who is among the frontrunners in the race for leader of the opposition post in the West Bengal assembly. He holds the credit of winning the prestigious Nandigram seat, the epicentre of the battle for Bengal. Bengal BJP leaders believe that CM Mamata Banerjee has targeted Suvendu by demanding recount of votes in Nandigram after the Election Commission announced him the winner. The EC website shows Suvendu defeated Banerjee by a margin of 1,956 votes. “The CM is free to move court. The fact is people of Nandigram have given the verdict,” said Bengal BJP chief Dilip Ghosh. The stiffening of stance by either camp is an indicator of how things are going to pan out in the assembly in the days to come. The situation on ground zero in Nandigram has fuelled communal tension in the area, accentuating the battle of nerves at the party level. According to BJP insiders, Suvendu deserves leader of the opposition post because he has emerged as “giant killer” in the poll. “Leader of the opposition enjoys ministerial post,” a BJP leader said, pointing out that LoP status might protect Suvendu from “unnecessary harassment”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/giant-killer-suvendu-leads-race-for-bengal-leader-of-opposition/articleshow/82379719.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Cremations: Profit for city firm and gain to environment||NAGPUR: Amid a grave pandemic, helping cremate the dead, in an eco-friendly manner, has emerged as a serious business proposition for M/s Vin Vin Enterprises, a firm floated by city environmentalist Vijay Limaye. He began with a campaign to save trees by reducing dependence on firewood for cremations. In the first wave of the pandemic, the firm notched up a turnover of over Rs1 crore by selling briquettes made of farm waste, which is eco-friendly substitute of firewood. In the second wave, in April alone, there were sales worth Rs27 lakh. Limaye, who started by championing use of cow dung instead of wood, had won a tender for supplying briquettes to six crematoria of NMC in August 2019. These include Ambazari, Sahakar Nagar, Mokshadham, Mankapur and Gangabai Ghat. Till briquettes were introduced by Limaye’s firm, free firewood was available at the ghats. NMC started levying a charge of over Rs2,500 per body on firewood in order to promote the eco-friendly options like briquettes. As deaths increased during Covid, there were complaints from the poor about charges for firewood. On the other hand, briquettes were free, which kept its demand high. Late in April, NMC stopped charging for firewood too. This led to a huge dip in the use of briquettes as people started preferring firewood. More than his company’s loss, Limaye is worried this is a major loss to the environment, as more trees will be cut to supply this higher demand for firewood. Earlier, Limaye had drawn praise from Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his Mann Ki Baat series for his efforts to save trees. The firms supplying both firewood and briquettes are paid Rs2,000 per cremation. “I don’t want people to die but it’s true that the turnover had increased during Covid times. In last financial year, we cremated 5,040 bodies. Later, this April alone our firm cremated 1,350 bodies. We got Rs2,000 each. There is a profit margin of 25%,” Limaye told TOI. He plans to expand to other cities too and has lately got a contract of 25 tonnes to be supplied at Delhi. “We are charging Rs8,000 per tonne,” he said. “I got the NMC contract through a tender. There was a separate bidding process for firewood supply,” he said. Limaye said he had earlier advocated use of cow dung but the idea had to be dropped due to lack of availability. The briquettes are made at his factory at Kuhi. On wood suppliers not getting a level playing field when only briquettes were free of charge, Limaye said still people were using wood due to traditional beliefs. Limaye says the briquette business has saved 10 lakh trees during 2021 alone. Here is how he puts up the calculations: One tonne of wood generates 3.7 tonne carbon dioxide. If all 5,040 bodies would have been cremated using wood, 1,350 tonnes of wood would have been needed, which means 4,995 tonnes of carbon dioxide would have gone into the atmosphere, thus massively adding to the air pollution. “The money spent on planting a seed and seeing it grow up to 18 years is Rs2,000. Hence, by saving 10,000 full-grown trees, our drive saved Rs2 crore,” says Limaye. This has given employment to 50 unskilled workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cremations-profit-for-city-firm-and-gain-to-environment/articleshow/82376996.cms||Shishir Arya

Police said the duo forged documents pertaining to the man’s assets and siphoned off Rs2.5 lakh from his account. The incident occurred between September last and April 7 this year, police said. The man had died on March 10 this year. The involvement of other bank staffers is also suspected. The police are also trying to ascertain if the duo withdrew money from the deceased man’s fixed deposits and mutual fund accounts.The two were produced before the court on Monday and remanded in police custody till May 6. A case of cheating and forgery has been filed against them.According to the police, the duo changed the phone number associated with the man’s accounts with the bank. However, the number associated with the mutual fund — offered by a third-party distributor — remained the same. The incident came to light after the man’s 53-year-old son, a resident of Vimannagar, noticed an SMS from the mutual fund operator on his late father’s cellphone on March 22, stating that an application for mutual fund redemption was rejected due a discrepancy in signature. After making some enquiries with the bank, he lodged a complaint with the police on Sunday.As per a preliminary investigation by the police, it was found that the duo withdrew Rs 2.5 lakh from the complainant’s father’s account. According to the first information report, the two arrested bank employees had visited the complainant on March 23 to discuss the bank account, insurance policies and mutual funds, but did not disclose the amounts held in each. The fraud was discovered after the complainant checked with the bank, the insurance company, and the mutual fund company.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/officials-of-pvt-bank-land-in-police-net-over-rs-2-5l-fraud/articleshow/82376086.cms||---
---||Chennai||DMK’s 37.7% vote share, second lowest since 1996, brings 133 seats||CHENNAI: Data for the intensely fought TN assembly elections show that the DMK has won 133 seats and a majority on its own by polling 37.7% of the popular valid votes. This is the party’s second lowest vote share in the three assembly polls it has won since 1996. While the lowest has been 26.5% it got in 2006, which gave the party 96 seats and a ‘minority government’ tag, its highest was in 1996 when it got 42.1% — a wave election against the incumbent AIADMK. The other Dravidian major, AIADMK, had polled 40.8% popular votes in 2016 to retain power for a second term after it came to power in 2011 with a vote share of 38.4%. The AIADMK’s lowest was in 2001 when it won a majority of its own (132 seats) by securing just 31.4% of the total votes polled. DMK’s vote share in 2021 has improved by 5% compared to the 32% it got in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. In 2016, DMK’s vote share was around 31%. The increase may be partly due to the party’s move to restrict the seats allotted to ally Congress to 25. This has brought down the Congress’s vote share by around 5% from the 12.5% it got in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. By contesting in 173 seats, DMK managed to transfer a part of the Congress’s vote share to itself. In the case of AIADMK, the party managed to improve its vote share to 34.24% in 2021 as against the 18% it got in 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Though this is almost 7% lower than what it achieved in 2016, the party has managed to improve its 2021 vote share tally at the cost of PMK which was restricted to a mere 23 seats. “This way AIADMK managed to transfer 2% of PMK’s vote share to its kitty,” the strategist pointed out. One cannot compare apples with oranges, says Manuraj Shanmugasundaram, spokesperson of the DMK. “In 2016, AIADMK contested on all 234 seats including its smaller allies, who contested on its symbol, while DMK had contested only 173 seats in 2021. Contesting a certain number of seats and setting aside the rest for allies is a strategy of a political party. With the DMK getting a majority of its own, it gets the right to form the government,” Manuraj said. Both the DMK and the AIADMK has felt the heat in the past when they exhibited their large-heartedness in distributing seats to allies. In 2006, DMK was liberal in giving away seats to the Congress, the PMK and the Communists. As a result, it was left with just 130 seats and won 96. Having to endure the ‘minority government’ tagline, the party vowed never to indulge in the largescale distribution of seats. “Fortunately, the DMK’s allies pulled in an additional 10% votes and the alliance benefitted. In 2001, the AIADMK too gave away 94 seats to its allies including the Congress, the TMC (M), the PMK, and the Communists, and could contest only from just 140 seats,” said political analyst Ravindran Duraisamy. But since DMK had cobbled up a weak alliance in 2001, the AIADMK managed to win 132 of the 140 seats it contested and captured power on its own might.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/dmks-37-7-vote-share-second-lowest-since-96-brings-133-seats/articleshow/82377641.cms||D Govardan
---||Ahmedabad||Bapu created civil defence force to tackle pandemic in 1921||AHMEDABAD: In 1921, when Gujarat had barely emerged from a combined plague and pandemic onslaught, Mahatma Gandhi had set the foundation of the state’s first civil defence force, called the Gujarat Seva Samiti. This voluntary force was trained to raise funds, set up relief camps for those infected, anticipate resource crunch well in advance and direct attention of the government health and disaster relief machinery. Training given to deal with influenza, plague and cholera, which were repeatedly claiming lives back then. These involved setting up makeshift camps from available resources, identifying key requirements much before an epidemic is to strike and then spread awareness on its prevention. In it’s charter Bapu writes that law and order and maintaining calm were two objectives of the voluntary army and that serving people to help them navigate a pandemic or any disaster was the key motive. Joining this voluntary army was not easy too. Those aspiring for the service were made to go through a six-month capsule course before being called a “volunteer”. There was a small fee for the training as well — it was 50 paise. Bapu wrote its charter and even its constitution and detailed its hierarchy. In the February 1921 edition of the Navajivan, Bapu wrote that the key purpose of the civil defence voluntary army was to ensure calm, reduce panic and help people in their dire need and to work objectively and without partisanship while dealing with an adversity. The volunteer army had volunteers, led by a ‘Nayak’. Several Nayaks within a region were commanded by a ‘Captain’. The number of captains in each regional committee had to elect a general secretary for each of the regions in Gujarat. City-based historian Rizwan Kadri says, “Bapu knew the distress that pandemic caused. He felt fear, confusion and law and order issues had to be tackled early to help people navigate the pandemic with calm.” “The volunteers are required to meet every fortnight for learning to raise resources during disasters like a pandemic, comfort people and ensure complete law and order,” wrote Bapu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bapu-created-civil-defence-force-to-tackle-pandemic-in-1921/articleshow/82376984.cms||---

Archbishop Filipe Neri Ferrao said the centre would come to the aid of the people who don’t have a place to quarantine and isolate. He, however, clarified that it will not be able to offer specialised care. He said the quarantine facility, which will be offered free of charge, would start small by providing basic facilities of the room and food and would gradually expand. “Everything is for our people. If people are not alive, why do we need institutions?” he said while speaking recently at the final procession of Sisters of the Franciscan Missionaries of Christ the King at Old Goa. Doctors are already on board he said, and appealed to nurses, nuns and anyone with a nursing background and with no health problems to come forward.  “If we have six nurses we can start,” he said, appealing to the congregations of nuns. The Church has already started readying the place and is awaiting permission and cleaning staff to throw open their doors. It plans on starting with one floor, which has 20 rooms with two beds each. While space and rooms are not a problem, getting adequate manpower is a challenge, Ferrao said.

---||Hyderabad||Jolt to BJP as Rajasekhar of Congress wins in Lingojiguda||Hyderabad: In a jolt to BJP in Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation limits, Congress wrested the Lingojiguda seat from the saffron party in the by-poll held to the ward on April 30. The result was announced on Monday. D Rajasekhar Reddy of Congress defeated M Akhil Goud of BJP with a margin of 1,272 votes in the by-poll. The sympathy factor failed to work in favour of Akhil, son of corporator-elect Akula Ramesh Goud whose death necessitated the by-election. Also, the ruling TRS did not contest the by-poll due to which the secular vote was not divided between TRS and Congress. With this victory, the number of Congress corporators in GHMC council has gone up from two to three, and that of BJP came down from 48 to 47. Just five months ago, BJP had surprised everyone by winning 48 of 150 wards in GHMC elections. Political analysts attributed the victory of Congress over BJP to several factors, important among them being that BJP could not incite religious passion. Its campaign was devoid of the steam it generated in GHMC polls last year. Political analyst professor K Nageshwar said BJP’s much hyped campaign in Dubbak followed by the model of communally surcharged campaign in GHMC elections cannot be replicated everywhere. The image of the Congress candidate’s compared to that of BJP candidate influenced the voters. TPCC president N Uttam Kumar Reddy congratulated Rajashekar and called upon the party cadre to the Lingojiguda victory as an inspiration to work hard to bring Congress to power in 2023-Assembly polls. Also, Rajashekar had a couple of elections previously from this ward and gained sympathy among the voters. There are allegations that a section of TRS cadre in Lingojiguda indirectly worked for the Congress candidate. The ward falls under Malkajgiri parliamentary constituency represented by TPCC working president A Revanth Reddy. Interestingly, all three seats won by Congress is from this Lok Sabha constituency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/jolt-to-bjp-as-rajasekhar-of-congress-wins-in-lingojiguda/articleshow/82376988.cms||Roushan Ali

---||Hyderabad||Insiders blame the loss on infighting and poor planning||Hyderabad: After a stupendous show in December when it stunned the ruling establishment by winning 48 wards in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) elections, the BJP suffered a minor jolt as it lost to the Congress in the byelection to the Lingojiguda ward. This, in fact, is an embarrassment for the Saffron party, which is boasting of giving a tough time to the TRS. The party’s candidate Akhil Goud lost to Rajasekhar Reddy of the Congress. The bypoll was conducted as Akula Ramesh Goud, the corporator-elect from the BJP had died. The BJP gave the seat to Ramesh’s son and requested other parties to make it a unanimous affair. The TRS too did not field a candidate and instead supported Akhil Goud. However, much to the disappointment of the BJP, Congress wrested the seat. With this win, Congress increased its tally to three in the GHMC. Quite upset with the result, the BJP is keen to gain the lost ground. “A three member committee inquired those involved in the Lingojiguda episode. A report was also sent to the high command on the internal squabbles in this segment,” a source said. Insiders said that the party leaders did not focus much on the Lingojiguda election. “There was not much focus on this ward as our leaders thought we can easily win this election. As the TRS also was not in fray we believed it would be a cakewalk for our candidate. Moreover, we thought the sympathy factor will work in our favour. No top leader campaigned here and many did not like approaching the TRS,” a source said. “A section of our party leaders feels that had TRS contested things would have worked in our favour. But it was too late now,” the source said. It is learnt that state BJP chief Bandi Sanjay Kumar was upset with the loss and also on the issue of seeking the support of the TRS. He reportedly alerted the BJP top brass on Lingojiguda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/insiders-blame-the-loss-on-infighting-and-poor-planning/articleshow/82377017.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Already the demand to replace KPCC chief Mullappally Ramachandran and opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala has gained momentum in the party. However, there are speculations that Ramesh will not take up the post of the opposition leader, following Oommen Chandy’s example in 2016. “A radical change is required in the party. I am not saying that it is going to become smooth by changing one or two leaders from their posts. But, there has to be a sea change in the party,” said senior leader PT Thomas. Apart from KPCC leadership, there is also demand that there should be a thorough revamp of the district Congress committees (DCC). The leaders are of the view that the entire party machinery at the grassroots are defunct. “The party needs some kind of rejuvenation for which we need leaders who have mass support both at the district and state levels. Even after a dismal performance in several districts in local body elections, the party leadership was not ready to rectify mistakes,” said a senior leader. Already DCC president of Alappuzha has resigned. Kannur and Idukki district presidents have expressed their willingness to quit citing the dismal performance of the party in their districts. The party’s worst defeat came in Thiruvananthapuram where they even lost sitting seats. There is a demand that all the present committees should be dissolved and a new committee should be formed both at KPCC and the DCC levels. However there is also a section of leaders who says the AICC also cannot run away from its responsibility since it was dictating terms during the selection of candidates for assembly elections. “There will be a thorough introspection and there will be a rectification process too. The party will sit and discuss the reasons behind the defeat. Whatever rectification process has to be taken, it will be done,” said senior leader Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/demand-for-gen-next-in-congress-leadership-grows/articleshow/82377046.cms||---

Temporary funeral pyre platforms are being constructed on the site, which is meant for development of a municipal dog crematorium. The villagers have threatened to start a dharna on the site if Covid patients’ dead bodies are brought for cremation. They suggest that another crematorium at Sector-24 has 10 acres of empty space, which can be utilised for Covid protocol funerals. A senior official from the public health department confirmed the developments. This is the third such incident of resistance to Covid funerals in Delhi after people objected to cremations of Covid bodies in Dakshinpuri and Madanpur Khadar. Rajpal Godara, a resident of Dhul Siras, said that villagers were completely against the use of the site for Covid cremations. “If the location has been sanctioned for facilities related to dogs, it should be used for the same purpose. Moreover, the crematorium in Sector-24, which is being used for Covid funerals, has ample open space for expansion,” he added. Another resident Rakesh Godara said that DDA had transferred the land to the south corporation for a specific use and it cannot be abruptly changed like this. “Villagers keep visiting the site and also, talk to our labourers to express their displeasure. We have assured them that the site will be used only when all other sites are exhausted,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/villagers-resist-cremations-at-dwarka-29-site/articleshow/82377687.cms||Paras Singh

They are planning to hold interactions between patients currently undergoing treatment at the SU facilities with those who have recovered from Covid. These interactions with someone who had defeated the deadly disease will generate positive thoughts among the patients, SU groups feel. SU syndicate member Mehhu Rupani feels that words of reassurance, coming from those who have defeated Covid, will help create positive energy in the patients currently undergoing treatment. “I had put forward this idea in the SU circle and it received good response from all the members. “A patient who is on oxygen will get a big mental boost if he hears reassuring words from someone has been through that phase himself. We have asked recovered patients to share their experiences and give courage to those being currently treated that they will be cured and go home soon,” Rupani said. The SU leaders, who are managing the Covid facilities at the university campus, circulated a message in few whatsapp groups asking help form those recovered patients who were put on ventilators or BiPAP. The recovered patients have been asked to fill a form with their details and willingness to talk with existing patients. A team of 20 members from the SU will connect those who have recovered with existing patients. Around 182 people have registered themselves in last two days for the initiative. The SU has converted its convention hall into a Covid hospital with a capacity of 400 oxygen beds, out of which 100 beds have been made functional.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/to-boost-morale-su-to-connect-patients-with-virus-slayers/articleshow/82377050.cms||---

The victim from Begumpet uploaded her profile on a matrimonial website a few months ago and the fraudster posing as a US-based NRI from Gujarat showed interest in her profile. “The complainant had separated from her husband and she has a six-year-old son. The fraudster, who introduced himself as, Mehul Kumar, a US-based engineer, sent her his photos, and the photos of his daughter and his mother. He made her talk to a woman, who introduced herself as Mehul’s mother and soon they showed the house in the US and also their property in Gujarat,” assitant commissioner of police (ACP), Cyber Crime, KVM Prasad said. The accused initially asked the victim for Rs 1.5 lakh to renovate the house in Gujarat and later made her transfer over Rs 1 lakh to a man posing as a visa agent. “Mehul sent her photos of jewellery, footwear, wrist watches and cash of $50,000 saying that he was coming to India with gifts for her. In mid April, he called her saying that customs sleuths had seized the items and detained him for not paying tax. The victim deposited over Rs 6 lakh in the bank accounts mentioned by him. As the accused kept asking for money, she realised about the fraud and lodged a complaint with us,” the ACP said. Police found out that the bank accounts used by the accused were from branches in Delhi and North East states and the vitim lost over Rs 10 lakh. A case was registered under Sections 66-D of the IT Act, 419 and 420 of the IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/matrimony-fraud-techie-loses-rs-10-lakh/articleshow/82377044.cms||---

---||Amritsar||In Jalandhar & Bathinda, influx of bodies at crematoria||JALANDHAR/BATHINDA: Two crematoria in Jalandhar have reported a two-to three-fold rise in cremations, while the biggest cremation ground of Bathinda did not have enough space to cremate the dead two days ago. Bathinda’s Grain Market crematorium, on Saturday, had to carry out the last rites of six bodies on the ground, instead of the usual cemented platform. While the crematorium has 24 cemented platforms for lighting pyres, it got 30 bodies. In Jalandhar, Harnamdas Pura crematorium recorded 314 cremations in April — a three-time rise over the usual 100 cremations in a month. The situation was not as bad at the city’s Kishanpura crematorium, where nearly 200 cremations took place in April against the usual 100 in a month, but it was still alarming. "Earlier, two to three cremations would take place in a day and the total number would hover around 100 cremations per month. Of these, around 50 to 60 would be of Covid victims," said Sandeep Kumar Mishra, manager at Harnamdas Pura crematorium. Anil Kumar Divedi, manager at Kishanpura crematorium, said even if one excluded Covid deaths, the number was higher than usual. Vijay Kumar, a priest at the Model Town crematorium of Jalandhar, said there has been no increase in the number of cremations. "There are some cases in which patients had come from outside, but died here in a local hospital. Their families cremated them here," he said. According to the health department, in April, 167 Covid patients died in Jalandhar. They included patients from rural areas too, who were cremated in their respective villages. In Bathinda, NGO Naujawan Welfare Society president Sonu Maheshwari said crematoriums were turning out to be too small to handle fatalities arising out of coronavirus. "A reason behind this is also that a lot of people who bring their loved ones for treatment in Bathinda, prefer to cremate the dead in the town only, instead of taking body with them," Maheshwari said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/in-jalandhar-bathinda-influx-of-bodies-at-crematoria/articleshow/82377688.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||T HC notice to Centre, Maha on IPS officer’s plea||Hyderabad: The Telangana high court has issued notices to the Centre, Maharashtra government, Mumbai police and others on a petition filed by senior IPS officer Rashmi Shukla. She has moved the high court against the phone tapping case registered by Mumbai police in connection with an ongoing probe into former home minister Anil Deshmukh’s alleged corruption case. Justice B Vijaysen Reddy also issued notices to Maharashtra DGP, Mumbai police commissioner and investigation officer (IO), asking them to explain their stand on Shukla’s petition. The court will hear her plea on May 6. Urging the court to declare as ‘illegal’ summons issued to her by the Mumbai police, Shukla sought a direction to police not to take any coercive action against her. Shukla has also approached the Bombay high court. Shukla, a 1988 batch IPS officer from Maharashtra cadre, is currently working in Hyderabad on deputation. She is posted as additional director general of police, south zone, CRPF, Hyderabad. The Mumbai police issued the summons, asking Shukla to depose as a witness in the phone tapping case registered under the provisions of the Indian Telegraph Act, IT Act and the Official Secrets Act. Mumbai Crime Branch ACP, who is investigating the case, asked her to come to Mumbai to depose as a witness. Petitioner’s counsel on record SN Veerender Singh said they were apprehensive about the intentions of the IO. “They (police) may issue a notice under section 41A of Cr PC and may even arrest her,” he said. “This is what we read from their repeated summons. They are not willing to send us a questionnaire to which we will send replies.” Appearing for Shukla, senior counsel C Nageswara Rao told the court that this was part of a political war that is unfolding in Mumbai which led to the resignation of the home minister. The case pertains to collection of huge bribes and the strange practice of some unidentified middlemen deciding the postings of police officers for a price. Shukla, who was then commissioner of Maharashtra state intelligence department, tapped the phones of certain individuals after obtaining permission from the higher-ups and followed the due process of law, the counsel said. When Shukla was transferred to another department, she duly handed over the charge to her successor along with material pertaining to the case, the senior counsel said. “Now, police are refusing to conduct the procedure virtually,” he said. The report submitted by Shukla has been handed over to the chief secretary and DGP. “It is no more an official secret,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-hc-notice-to-centre-maha-on-ips-officers-plea/articleshow/82377055.cms||---

In the absence of TM Thomas Isaac, G Sudhakaran, C Raveendranath and E P Jayarajan, the party may retain K K Shailaja, M M Mani, A C Moideen, T P Ramakrishnan and Kadakampally Surendran. Being a close confidant of Vijayan, K T Jaleel, who had to step down following Lokayukta finding him guilty in a nepotism case from the Pinarayi cabinet a month ago, is almost sure to get a cabinet berth. It is learnt that the LDF government this time will have more women ministers. CPM may give Veena George a portfolio in the second Pinarayi government. There are also chances for considering her for the speaker’s post. There are chances for a woman minister from CPI too. CPM central committee member M V Govindan and state secretariat members K N Balagopal and P Rajeev and Vasavan may also be accommodated in the new cabinet. M B Rajesh from Thrithala and P P Chitharanjan, who won from Alappuzha, may also figure in the list of ministers. Rajeev or K N Balagopal may be given finance portfolio while Rajesh may be considered as education minister. While Chitharanjan may get fisheries, Moideen may be given industries. Govindan may be the minister for local self-government. Former revenue minister E Chandrasekharan, J Chinchu Rani, P S Supal and Prasad may represent CPI in the cabinet. Kadannappally Ramachandran of Congress (S), Mathew T Thomas or K Krishnankutty from Janata Dal (S), Roshy Augustine or N Jayaraj of Kerala Congress (M) may also make it to the list of ministers. The CPM state secretariat will meet on Tuesday to discuss the government formation. The party politburo will also meet in a couple of days.

Khachar, a resident Aandapur village in Jasdan taluka of Rajkot had tested positive for Covid-19 last month. According to doctors, her condition was critical as her CRP score was 272 against 5 in a normal case. Her D-dimer reading had shot up to 4,200, which under normal circumstances should have been 500. CRP and D-dimer are inflammation and blood clot markers respectively.Since she did not get a bed in Rajkot, she was taken to a private hospital in Surendrangar where doctors told the family that there was little hope of her survival. The family members lost all hope and decided to treat her in their village. She was admitted to Virnagar covid care centre near her village. Dr. Dhaval Gosai, nodal officer at the centre said, “Her condition was critical and we could not administer her IV due to fear of blood clotting. We continued our efforts, however, because her positive attitude towards life and strong desire to live, she started recovering.” She was discharged on May 1 after 12 days of hospitalization. The doctors who treated her include Dr Vidhi Vaghela, Dr Shital Menia, Dr Nilesh Bambhaniya and Dr Hetal Nakum.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/50-year-old-woman-with-80-lung-infection-beats-covid/articleshow/82377067.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Enforcement agencies propose GST on human hair, industry opposes||Hyderabad: Despite human hair export market having a turnover of around Rs 6,000 to Rs 8,000 crore per annum, it has been exempted from Goods and Services Tax (GST). Central enforcement agencies such as customs have now proposed GST to be imposed on raw and processed human hair to curb illegal market and smuggling to China via Myanmar. Smugglers are escaping the lens of agencies as there is no GST mechanism to track the sales. Human hair was exempted during the term of former Union finance minister Arun Jaitley based on the representation made by human hair exporters from West Bengal as lakhs of unskilled and ground-level workers depend on the industry. A customs official said, “GST has to be imposed on both raw and processed human hair. This will help control the illegal smuggling.” However, Human Hair Exporters Association and industry have opposed the imposition of GST on raw human hair. Human Hair Exporters Association, in a statement, said “The human hair industry employs lakhs of people who are from arid regions in India and who would otherwise be unemployed. Most of these people are uneducated and will not be able to adhere to the GST norms. Currently, any shipment over Rs 50,000 should be accompanied by a GST invoice. Smuggling is taking place despite this. Imposing GST will further increase smuggling.” The association added that Indian exporters are facing difficulties in competing with the Chinese, who enjoy an 8% export incentive due to the removal of Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS). Domestic consumption of human hair is almost non-existent. It is mostly exported and most exports are exempt from taxes. Considering these factors, the GST council has approved the exemption of GST on human hair.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/enforcement-agencies-propose-gst-on-human-hair-industry-opposes/articleshow/82377065.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Kolkata||Business community reposes trust in TMC as BJP fails to tick the right boxes in Bengal||KOLKATA: The business community has yet again reposed its faith in the Trinamool Congress. The party’s candidates have not only swept all the seats in Kolkata and Howrah but won in pockets around the city and in the districts with a sizeable population of the business community. In January this year, chief minister-elect Mamata Banerjee had met the representatives of business communities from Rajasthan, Gujarat, Punjab, UP and Bihar and urged them to support the Trinamool Congress in the assembly elections. Sunday’s results indicate TMC’s candidates have won from the seats which have sizable population of the business community. “Once a thriving business hub, Kolkata has attracted a number of trading communities such as Gujaratis, Punjabis and Marwaris and a strong labour force from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. Most of them have been staying in Bengal for generations and consider themselves natives of this place. They have overwhelmingly supported Mamata Banerjee on the basis of her government’s development work,” said Sujit Bose, senior TMC leader who has been re-elected from Bidhanangar for the third time with almost 45 per cent of business community staying there. Many businessmen TOI spoke to said the BJP could not offer a sustainable plan about attracting investment and promoting entrepreneurship. “The BJP has not been able to bring huge investments where they are already in power. They conducted a negative campaign on failures of TMC but never shared their own vision for the state. If they won Bengal they would have shifted their focus on other states due for elections next year leaving Bengal in a limbo. Mamata Banerjee, on the other hand, works for the state throughout the year,” said Ravi Gourisaria, a resident of Mayfair Road in Ballygunge. Last year, Banerjee announced that a Hindi language university would be set up by the TMC government. She has also revamped the party’s Hindi cell which is now headed by Vivek Gupta who has won from Jorasanko. In 2019 Jorasanko was the only assembly segment from where BJP had led with a huge margin. The party was hoping to wrest it from TMC and fielded Meena Devi Purohit instead of Rahul Sinha. But TMC won with a huge margin of almost 13,000 votes. “In 2019 we voted for the Prime Minister of the country but this time we voted for the chief minister. Business condition is not good anywhere in the country including states ruled by BJP. So the argument that if BJP comes to power conditions will improve doesn’t hold much water,” Ramsaran Sureka, a trader in Posta in Jorasanko. Anecdotal evidence suggests women have voted in large numbers for Banerjee. It also includes those from the business community. “I feel safe and positive as a young businesswoman in Kolkata. The TMC government has been able to instil that positivity in young business people like us,” said Arushi Saria, a resident of Manicktala assembly segment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/biz-community-reposes-trust-in-tmc-as-bjp-fails-to-tick-the-right-boxes/articleshow/82377060.cms||Zeeshan Javed

He added that 2 lakh vaccine doses are for the inoculation of those aged over 45 and were on their way to Uttarakhand. “We are also expecting 1.2 lakh more shots after some time. In this way, our vaccination programme will continue uninterrupted.” he said, adding that 90 % of Covid patients were in home isolation in Uttarakhand and were recovering well. Secretary Pankaj Pandeywho was also at the briefing said that steroids prevent oxygen from suddenly depleting. “Keeping this in mind, we are also starting to give steroids. The central health ministry earlier last week has prescribed the use of dexamethasone which is already used in treating lung infections as an alternative choice to methylprednisolone in all types of Covid cases.” Negi said that duration of 'Covid curfew' has been increased in the state as “we need to break the transmission chain of the virus". “Our strategy to defeat Covid is to first test, trace, isolate, treat and vaccinate.” “The state is witnessing over 5,000 cases every day. Recoveries are also increasing. Around 90 percent of patients are recovering by staying in isolation,” he said, adding that the '104' control rooms are receiving over 1,500 to 2,000 calls which are being addressed and solved. “People can also seek medical advice from anywhere through e-Sanjeevani. This will greatly benefit the people living in remote areas and no one will have to step out unnecessarily,” Negi said. He further added that steps are being taken to properly monitor the migrants coming back to the villages. “Pradhans have been asked to keep a record of the returnees.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-to-get-over-3l-vaccine-shots-soon-govt/articleshow/82376169.cms||Ishita Mishra

Relatives of the dead are being asked to collect the remains of their loved ones on the second or third day instead of the fourth day so that cement platforms meant for burning of corpses could be made available for others. Ramesh Chande Sharma, president of Sri Durgiana Mandir Committee (SDMC), which runs Shiv Puri cremation ground, said they were receiving over 40 bodies for cremation every day. “ With increase in the arrival of dead bodies for last rites, we have begun conveying to relatives of the deceased to perform their ‘chautha’ on the third day so that we get vacant platform for the next cremation,” he said. Krishan Gopal of Shamshan Sewa Samiti (SSS) said, “We ask relatives of the deceased to collect remains of their relatives on the second day and keep them in an urn to perform their last rites as per tradition.” Krishan said they had around 42 cement platforms and for the past three to four days, they had been receiving around 30 to 32 bodies every day, including three to six Covid deaths. Ramesh said, “Yesterday, we received 42 bodies, of which 11 were of Covid victims whereas today we received 35 bodies till now, including 10 of Covid victims,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/advance-chautha-to-pave-way-for-more-pyres-crematoria-officials/articleshow/82377715.cms||Yudhvir Rana
---||Patna||Enforce lockdown or we will order it: Patna HC to state||PATNA: The Patna high court on Monday orally observed that the state government has failed in controlling the Covid situation in Bihar. The division bench of Justices Chakradhari Sharan Singh and Mohit Kumar Shah asked advocate general Lalit Kishore to talk to CM as complete lockdown is needed in the state with rising number of Covid cases. The bench observed that either the state government declares lockdown or it will have to pass appropriate order. The court directed Kishore to inform them about the government’s decision on Tuesday. “There is no action plan with you. Whatever plan you have submitted, it’s not up to the mark and no effective steps have been taken since April 15 when we started hearing the PILs on the pandemic,” the bench observed. “Everything is an eyewash. You said two pressure-swing absorption plants for oxygen generation are working, but report says they are not. Despite repeated orders, you are not doing anything,” the court commented, observing that there is no advisory committee of experts with the state government yet even after it ordered to form the one earlier. “You are handicapped and banking just on the health department authorities who are submitting farce reports,” the court observed orally. The advocate general submitted names of AIIMS-Patna director Dr Prabhat Kumar Singh, former RMRI director Dr Pradeep Das, Dr Vijay Prakash, Dr AA Hai and one representative of UNICEF for forming a committee of experts. But, the bench observed that a dynamic administrator is required and the state may call Bihar cadre IAS officer Sandeep Poundrik for at least three months from central deputation to sternly monitor the situation with the help of experts. The bench later also observed that the state government has failed in increasing RT-PCR tests, mentioning Ct value, increasing beds at IGIMS and EISC along with maintaining regular oxygen supply at these two places, signing MoU with ESIC for establishing laboratories and supplying medicines despite the court’s directions in the past. When the court asked IGIMS director why the institution could not be made a Covid hospital even after the state government’s decision on April 25, he submitted that mere order won’t turn the hospital into a Covid-19 dedicated facility as there is shortage of oxygen. “Oxygen supply is erratic. We can’t admit patients in such situation. Simply making announcements in the air won’t work,” he submitted. The state government had earlier submitted that IGIMS would be a complete Covid-19 hospital with 1070 beds. The court got infuriated to know that only 10 ICU beds could be increased at IGIMS in the last 10 days. “It seems we are wasting our time by hearing the PILs. Our intervention is of no use despite repeated orders,” the bench observed. Meanwhile, a squadron leader-rank armed forces doctor deputed at the ESIC hospital in Bihta submitted that due to non-supply of manpower, a body remained unattended at the hospital for six hours. He also submitted that the state government has not even supplied medicines even after writing letters due. He said the defence paramedics are virtually sitting idle after arriving at Bihta on April 23. The court asked the Centre’s additional solicitor general KN Singh about the ESIC situation to which he submitted that the matter was communicated to the defence ministry, which has written to the state government for making the arrangements of medicines and other necessary things as the state has to look after the affairs. “Everything is happening on papers. Letters are being written. They are being replied and nothing is happening on the ground,” the bench fumed. When amicus curiae Mrigank Mauli, in his report, said the PMCH does not make logbook entry of oxygen supply and consumption, the court observed that oxygen was being sold on black market there. The three-member committee of Dr Umesh Kumar Bhadani of AIIMS-Patna, formed on the high court’s direction, had raised suspicion over more consumption of oxygen at PMCH with less Covid-19 beds compared to NMCH where more beds are there. The court was also miffed after AAG Anjani Kumar submitted that 160 metric tonnes of oxygen was procured by the state government on Sunday against the daily quota of 194 metric tonnes fixed by the central government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/enforce-lockdown-or-we-will-order-it-hc-to-state/articleshow/82376214.cms||Debashish Karmakar

---||Delhi||Cap CT scan charges for Covid: PIL in HC||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Monday issued a notice to Delhi government on a public interest litigation urging it to order capping of the rate of high-resolution computerised tomography (HRCT) test in the national capital for people with Covid-19 symptoms. The PIL filed by Shivleen Pasricha, 25, through advocate Amresh Anand pointed out that currently the cost of a HRCT test in Delhi was unregulated and ranged somewhere between Rs 5,000 and Rs 6,500. “If a common man has to get the test conducted for his average family of four, it would cost him somewhere between Rs 20,000 and Rs 24,000,” the PIL argues. According to the petitioner, many states such as Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Punjab have already capped its price. Delhi government should also cap the test rate till the pandemic prevails, the plea urged. The petitioner highlighted that apart from the commonly done RT-PCR test, many doctors were advising people to undergo the HRCT test in order to detect the new Covid-19 variant. “Several suspected/probable patients, bearing symptoms of Covid-19, have tested negative in their RT-PCR reports. A large number of doctors today are recommending HRCT test/scan to suspected/ probable Covid-19 patients for detecting the presence/specificity and severity of Covid-19 infection in them,” it was stressed. The PIL also relied on media reports to underscore how the alternative HRCT test was being strongly recommended by medical experts. It said that in the present Covid-19 wave, there were many cases where RT-PCR test reports were false negative as the patients, when subjected to the HRCT test later, were being diagnosed with Covid-19. “Hence, HRCT has become very relevant and important for the diagnosis, management and treatment of Covid-19 patients,” the petition emphasised. The petitioner also underlined that the current strain of coronavirus that had spread in Delhi was severely affecting the lungs of infected persons leading to serious medical complications. “No one in such circumstances would like to take risks with their health and their family’s health. Moreover, the virus is quite contagious. Every time a person comes to know that they have come into contact with a person who has later been detected with Covid-19, they, for safekeeping, would like to get themselves tested time and again for the disease as in many cases, the virus is asymptomatic,” it argued.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cap-ct-scan-charges-for-covid-pil-in-hc/articleshow/82377723.cms||Aamir Khan

The toll of the virus reached 2,802 in the hill state after 128 more deaths were recorded in the state in the last 24 hours. The state also recorded 5,403 fresh coronavirus infections. With this, the cumulative case tally rose to 1,97,023. Among those found infected on the day was Badrinath MLA Mahendra Prasad Bhatt. The number of containment zones in the state has now increased to 282. Among new cases found on Monday, a maximum of 2,026 infections was recorded in Dehradun, followed by 676 in Haridwar, 458 in Nainital, 656 in Udham Singh Nagar, 139 in Pauri, 415 in Tehri, 35 in Rudraprayag, 150 in Pithoragarh, 192 in Uttarkashi, 167 in Almora, 169 in Chamoli, 105 in Bageshwar and 125 in Champawat. Meanwhile, DG (health) Dr Tripti Bahuguna said that if a person displays Covid-like symptoms despite testing negative for the virus, he/she must be admitted to a medical facility. This comes after several people complained of severe illness despite testing negative for Covid-19. In fact, the doctors, in many cases, have confirmed the patient was Covid-19 positive after inspecting the CT scan. Medical experts say that the new mutant of the virus often dodges the RT-PCR test.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/highest-1-day-jump-in-covid-death-toll-recorded-in-ukhand/articleshow/82376178.cms||Ishita Mishra

LDF-backed independent candidate KP M Musthafa said that 347 postal votes cast by persons aged over 80 years were set aside and not counted by election authorities on Monday saying that their register numbers were absent. “It is not the fault of the voters that polling officials failed to provide serial number in the ballots. It was the duty of the polling officials to do that,” Musthafa said. “Setting aside such a large number of postal votes in a single constituency is suspicious. We suspect a bid to scuttle the outcome of the polls using poll officials. If serial numbers were missing in just a handful of ballots then we could have considered it as a mistake on the part of polling officials, but it is suspicious to have such a large number of ballots with missing serial numbers in a constituency,” he added. Musthafa alleged that the IUML had used all methods to defeat him. They had fielded many namesakes and these candidates together secured 2,000 votes. He said he would file a petition in the high court and was hopeful that the court would order counting of the ballots as it is improper to deny the votes for the fault of officials. “If the votes which are kept aside are counted then I am sure that LDF will win its 100th seat in state,” Musthafa said. CPM had been able to wrest the seat, which had been held by IUML since 1977, through Sasi Kumar in 2006. Though Manjalamkuzhi Ali managed to wrest the seat back in 2011, the victory margin fell to just 579 votes in 2016.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/postal-votes-ldf-candidate-to-file-case-in-court/articleshow/82377086.cms||---

CCP mayor Rohit Monserrate also said that many CCP workers are infected with the virus and with reduced manpower, there will be an “irreversible impact on waste collection” in Panaji if non-essential economic activity continues. “We appeal to all non-essential commodity traders, retail shops, business establishments and restaurants in the city of Panaji for voluntary closure till May 9. We are also requesting all restaurateurs to please offer only parcel service or delivery and do not entertain sit-ins,” said the joint statement issued on Monday. The appeal goes well beyond the restrictions imposed by the state government. “The Covid 19 situation in the state capital is deteriorating day by day as the numbers are surging and the healthcare facilities are almost on the verge of break down,” said GCCI president Manoj Caculo. Caculo said that it is “unfortunate that some people have let down their guard”. “To add to this, CCP staff are also getting infected with the virus, which has further stressed even the civic administration and with reduced manpower it will have irreversible impact on the waste collection with possibilities of coming to standstill,” Monserrate said. Goa Hotel and Restaurant Association president Gaurish Dhond has appealed to restaurants to stop dine-in services even though the state has permitted them to continue to serve food with 50% capacity.  CCP, GCCI and other organisations have also begun working on ways to organise vaccination drives for Panaji locals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ccp-industry-bodies-call-for-voluntary-lockdown-in-panaji/articleshow/82377784.cms||---

In a letter to KCR on Monday, AICC spokesperson Dasoju Sravan demanded that health emergency should be declared in the state and the government should set up 24x7 Covid-19 war room at state and districts level, constitute a task force with health experts and set up thousands of vaccine centres as the next 90 days are crucial. He said Covid-19 treatment should be incorporated under Arogyasri scheme for the benefit of the poor and adequate funds should be allotted to all government hospitals. Stating that people are unable to get Remdesivir injections unless they write to minister KT Rama Rao on Twitter, he suggested to the state government to buy the life-saving drugs by investing Rs 100 crore and distribute it through Army canteens to avoid black marketing. Despite being a global pharma hub and the home to indigenous Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin, people of Hyderabad and Telangana do not have access to vaccines and life-saving drugs in adequate quantities reflecting the poor governance in Telangana, he alleged. Sravan demanded to convert the under-construction new secretariat site into the state-of-the-art super-specialty hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/declare-health-emergency-in-telangana-congress/articleshow/82377085.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Supreme Court: Rajasthan private schools can charge 85% fees of ’19-20 for ’20-21||Jaipur: Quashing the Rajasthan High Court order on school fees issued on October 28 last year, the Supreme Court on Monday directed the private unaided schools to charge 85% the annual school fees of 2019-20 for the 2020-21 academic year. It ordered reduction of 15% fees in lieu of unutilised facilities by students. The apex court also upheld the Rajasthan Schools (Regulation) Act 2016. The bench of Justice A M Khanwilkar and Justice Dinesh Maheshwari gave the order while disposing of special leave petitions filed by private unaided schools. The court said the 15% reduction of annual school fees is being given in lieu of unutilised facilities/activities. “We have chosen to do so with a view to obviate avoidable litigation and to give finality to the issue of determination and collection of school fees for the academic year 2020-21, as a one time measure,” the court said. Parents could deposit the fees in six instalments before August 5 this year as per the interim order. Schools could individually give more concessions based on specific requests by parents. No one should be debarred from online classesThe school management should not debar any student from attending either online classes or physical classes on account of nonpayment of fees, arrears/outstanding fees, including instalments, referred to above, and should not withhold the results of examinations of any student on that account. The school management should not withhold the name of any student/candidate for the ensuing board examinations for classes X and XII on the ground of non-payment of fees/arrears for the academic year 2020-21, if any, on obtaining undertaking from concerned parents/students. This arrangement however would not affect collection of fees for the academic year 2021-22. The apex court said the director, secondary education, had no authority whatsoever to issue direction in respect of fee structure determined under the Act of 2016, including reducing the same for the academic year 2020-21 in respect of private unaided schools. "It would have been a different matter if the director, secondary education had used his good offices to impress upon the school management(s) of the concerned school(s) to explore the mitigating measures/options in the form of scholarship to deserving students," the court observed. The school management also cannot collect fees in respect of activities and facilities which are, in fact, not provided to students due to circumstances beyond their control. Demanding fees even in respect of overheads on such activities would be nothing short of indulging in profiteering and commercialisation," said the court. The court asked the state government to complete the process of calculation and disbursal of the outstanding amount (RTE) payable to unaided schools in the state before the end of July 2021, said Prateek Kasliwal, counsel for Vidhyashram School.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sc-raj-pvt-schools-can-charge-85-fees-of-19-20-for-20-21/articleshow/82377736.cms||Joychen Joseph

Those arrested have confessed of their involvement in 14 offences that they carried out in the city since February. The gang, infamous for carrying out violent heists, had recently attacked a man Jahangirpur area after he spotted the dacoits breaking in a house. The man has luckily escaped the deadly assault. Police nabbed 10 members of the gang and recovered gold jewellery worth Rs 1.48 lakh, Rs 36,000 cash, eight wrist watches worth Rs 1.48 lakh and tools used to break into residences. The gang had carried out dacoities in different cities of Gujarat as well as other states. “It is a big catch by police. The interstate gang is violent and has committed crime in different states,” city police commissioner Ajay Tomar told TOI. Police informed that the gang, after choosing the city to be targeted, used to visit its different areas in auto rickshaws. In daytime, the gang members did a recce of the target houses on the pretext of selling balloons. After finalising the target, the gang reached the area during daytime and mingled in the surrounding crowd. At night they used to target the bungalow after 1.30 am and make escape before 4 am, police source informed. The gang also used to eat food in the home if they found any. They had formed multiple teams to do the recce, to open the window grill, a team to keep watch outside the bungalow and one to keep watch on the connecting roads. “The team on the road kept slingshots and stones with them to shoo away dogs. If they were noticed by someone they attacked them with stones to escape,” said police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/interstate-gang-of-dacoits-nabbed/articleshow/82377084.cms||---

---||Business||Foreign aid: Track, allot plan firmed up||NEW DELHI: The government has put together an elaborate strategy to distribute the foreign aid pouring in from countries, multinational corporations and individuals and has taken measures to scrap duties on relief material for faster rollout on ground. On Monday, the government did away with Integrated GST (IGST) on Covid-related relief material such as some medicines, oxygen and related equipment, ventilators and test kits donated or received free of cost from overseas and meant for free distribution. The move follows a series of requests since last week as the IGST on some of the products was as high as 28% and imposed a significant burden although the government had announced a customs duty waiver for a limited period earlier. In fact, there were several consignments lying at customs ports as the recipient was not paying the levy. The exemption would also cover goods already imported but lying uncleared at the customs ports. For an equipment such as a concentrator that costs, say Rs 1 lakh, the freight and IGST of 28% often added up to Rs 40,000-45,000, government officials acknowledged. The finance ministry said that representations had been received from charitable organisations, corporate entities, and other associations and entities resulting in the exemption being made available till June 30. The Centre was earlier waiting for a meeting of the GST Council, chaired by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, but decided to expedite the exemption. Following the government decision, revenue secretary Tarun Bajaj, Central Board of Indirect Tax and Customs chairman Ajit Kumar and NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant urged states to use the facility quickly. All government-to-government aid is being handled by the External Affairs Ministry. The allocation to various entities is being handled by the Health Ministry. The NITI Aayog has set up a digital dashboard and a control room for tracking all allocation from the private sector, multinationals, associations, industries Indian diaspora, and professionals. Nodal officers have been set up in NITI Aayog, MEA, Health Ministry to deal with the situation. The Indian Red Cross society has also been roped in. “End to end tracking is being done by a team of young officers for transparency and to ensure that the relief material is reaching the end beneficiaries,” said Kant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/foreign-aid-track-allot-plan-firmed-up/articleshow/82377742.cms||Surojit Gupta

The 84 reserved seats – 68 for SC and 16 for ST – saw a much closer contest between the two rivals in terms of seats won as well as vote shares than the general seats. TMC won 45 of the reserved seats, BJP 39. Thus, TMC had just 15% more reserved seats than BJP. In general seats, TMC’s tally of 169 was four and a half times as much as BJP’s 38. The gap in vote share between the two in general seats was 13 percentage points – 49.2% against 36.2%. In the seats reserved for SC, that narrowed to under four percentage points with TMC getting 46.2% and BJP 42.8%. In ST seats, the gap was narrower, TMC’s share being 45.2% and BJP’s 44%. The good news for TMC is in both SC and ST seats, its performance improved upon the 2019 showing, when the BJP had led in 46 segments and the TMC in just 37.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bengal-bjp-did-far-better-in-sc/st-seats-than-general/articleshow/82379922.cms||---

The police and disaster personnel have cremated more than 120 bodies so far. The SDRF personnel, who have been recently pressed into the service as their training equips them for handling the contagion, have performed the last rites of almost 23 bodies in the last one week. In Haldwani alone, on April 30, SDRF cremated seven bodies that were decomposing in morgues as families hadn’t claimed them. Recounting an experience, SDRF inspector Jagdamba Prasad Bijalwan, who is the nodal officer of Dehradun district for cremating unclaimed bodies, told TOI, “On May 1, I received a call from Dalanwala Police station that an unclaimed body is lying in the mortuary of Coronation Hospital and needs to be disposed of. My team picked up the body and took it to the Covid-19 cremation ground in Raipur for cremation.” In the last 20 days, Uttarakhand Police across the state have cremated over 100 bodies of people who either lived alone or whose family stayed away for fear of infection. Dehradun Police said it had performed the last rites of 25 bodies in the last 15 days. The state capital has been the worst affected in terms of infections and fatalities. A total of 1,666 people died of Covid-19 so far in Dehradun district, according to the health department data. Director general of police (DGP) Uttarakhand Ashok Kumar said, “A nodal officer has been appointed in each district for the purpose (of cremating unclaimed bodies). Proper safety gear, including PPE kits, have been provided to personnel tasked with fetching bodies from homes or hospitals and carrying them to cremation grounds.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/disaster-personnel-police-chip-in-to-cremate-over-120-unclaimed-covid-bodies-across-ukhand/articleshow/82376254.cms||Gaurav Talwar

Nisith Pramanik — the MP from Cooch Behar, who contested from the Dinhata constituency — won by 57 votes against Udayan Guha of the TMC. After the photo finish, Pramanik said that in politics, emerging victorious is all that matters. “It is a contest where we fought the game well. Particularly in the border areas where the booths were set up, several of the voters were restricted from exercising their franchise by the opposition. This has resulted in decreasing my winning margin,” Pramanik said. Pramanik added that had the voters been able to vote, the margin could have been “30000 to 40000 votes.” First-time MLA Baneswar Mahato of BJP — who had beaten Bengal cabinet minister Shantiram Mahato at Balarampur in Purulia by a wafer-thin margin of only 423 votes — said he was still happy with the verdict. “A win is a win. Balarampur is the place from where BJP’s rise in Bengal had started and I am glad I could beat a Bengal minister contesting for the first time from this seat. I will strive to work harder for the people as well as the party,” said Mahato. Two-time MLA Bikram Chandra Pradhan from Dantan in West Midnapore also had a scare across several rounds of counting where he trailed from his BJP opponent Saktipada Nayek but pulled it back at the right moment winning the election by 623 votes. In 2016, he had a victory margin of 29260 votes from his nearest CPI competitor. “My margin has gone down due to a factional feud in our party. Our party workers at Dantan block II have worked against me which has resulted in more votes for the opponent. But I am glad that people have still blessed me with enough votes that I can continue serving them one more time and I won’t fail them,” said Pradhan. Another winner, Ajay Poddar of BJP, who narrowly pulled it off from Kulti, said that he accepted the public verdict. “The assembly elections were like a football game where every minute there will be moments of excitement. But, I knew that my defenders were strong and I was confident that the final verdict would be announced in my favour,” Poddar added. His winning margin was 679 votes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/in-landslide-tmc-win-bjps-n-bengal-candidate-leads-list-of-photo-finishes/articleshow/82377090.cms||Somdatta Basu

This method is easier than the current procedures and can ramp up testing three fold, using the current infrastructure in the testing labs. It needs no viral transport medium for sending samples from sample collection centres to testing centres and requires much lesser sample packing and eliminates contamination between samples. Scientists say using this method, the RNA isolation steps are replaced by a single-step addition of an easily available reagent. Extract from this step can be directly used for RT-PCR without compromising on the quality of results. “These make the tests faster, cheaper and safer for the healthcare workers and increase throughout with existing resources and set-up,” a release said. “India is struggling with a steep surge in Covid-19 cases. The testing centres are overwhelmed with the number of samples that they have to test. It is an absolute need to increase our testing capacity within the existing set-up. We are positive that the dry swab-based direct RT-PCR method will help in the cause immensely,” said Dr Rakesh Mishra, advisor, CCMB. The CCMB has offered to train ICMR-approved government as well as private Covid-19 testing centres to help them adopt this method. Most of these sessions will be online to reach out to centres out of Hyderabad. The centres can book their slots on: http://e-portal.ccmb.res.in/dst_slotbooking/. Those in and around Hyderabad can also avail physical training sessions by reaching out to the director at CCMB.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ccmb-to-train-lab-personnel-in-500-centres-across-india-on-dry-swab-rt-pcr-test/articleshow/82377092.cms||---

The centre has been set up at a girls’ hostel with the help of Surat-based Seva group, which has 52 trusts and organisations under its umbrella. The centre will provide isolation facility with oxygen supply to the patients from nearby villages who were earlier forced to travel all the way to Surat for Covid-19 treatment. “The patients who have been advised home isolation but don’t have facilities to follow the same at their home will be admitted here. We are providing uninterrupted oxygen supply besides free meals, medicines, round the clock doctors, energy drinks and mineral water free of charge. “We decided to set up isolation centres in Saurashtra region so that the people who live here don’t have to travel a long distance to get Covid-19 treatment. We are taking help of local trusts, NGOs and institutions,” Mahesh Savani of P P Savani Group, a member unit of Seva Group, told TOI. “We are now setting up similar isolation centres in a hospital in Timbi village in Umrala taluka of Bhavnagar, Gariyadhar town of Bhavnagar and Dhari-Bagasara of Amreli district within the next two days. Each centre will have 100 beds with oxygen supply facility. Our plan is to provide such facilities to rural patients within 50kms of their village. If needed, we will set up more isolation centres,” Savani added.In Surat, the Seva group has set up 14 isolation centres with 650 beds. “We can increase the bed capacity from 650 to 1000 if need arises and we are prepared to add another 1000 beds in Surat,” he added.

---||Kochi||Debacle exposes fault lines within Thrissur Congress||THRISSUR: Congress leaders in Thrissur are demanding a serious introspection into the circumstances that led to the party’s debacle in the district which was once its stronghold. Padmaja Venugopal, who was defeated for the second time in Thrissur, made an open demand that the party must introspect and identify where its poll strategy went awry. Some members launched social media campaigns against the party leadership in the district — particularly against DCC president MP Vincent and AICC general secretary KC Venugopal (who they say elevated Vincent to his post). Congress could win just one seat in the assembly in 2016 and 2021, and suffered serious setbacks in local body elections. The only relief was the win in Thrissur, Chalakudy and Ottappalam parliament seats during the UDF wave in 2019. Congress in Thrissur had produced prominent leaders like P Govinda Menon, K Karunakaran, and recently VM Sudheeran. Subsequently, CN Balakrishnan was managing the party in a reasonable manner for over 20 years, though he lacked oratorical or organizational skills of others. However, Congress is in an almost-rudderless predicament in the district with no national or state leaders in recent years. According to Congress insiders, Oommen Chandy, Ramesh Chennithala and Venugopal cannot wash their hands of this predicament. The group managers were cynically indulging in mere political gamble by patronizing their own loyalists and stifling those who possessed genuine leadership potential in the district, they added. The passive silence of veteran leader AK Antony, despite his close knowledge of ground realities in the district, aggravated the situation further, said a senior leader on condition of anonymity. He added that such public statements, at this stage, would demoralise the cadre. The organizational machinery of Congress is in a disarray and this becomes visible when programmes become mere rituals with younger leaders desperately vying to hog the limelight. Lack of continuity in activities have practically affected organizational machinery, added leaders. Christian community was a major support base for Congress in Thrissur. But a serious trust deficit has developed between the party and the community in recent years. Interestingly, their complaint is that Congress keeps mum when Muslim League leaders make anti-Christian statements and are pocketing benefits of the minority communities. On the other hand, Church leaders and laity are pleased that LDF government has accepted their demands like reservation for economically-backward sections and ration cards for priests and nuns. Ironically, a section of the Muslim community feels Congress leadership is under the control of Christians and Nairs, whereas a large section of Hindus complain that Congress is indulging in mere minority pampering. Congress leadership is either insensitive to these challenges to retain their community support base or are not able to tackle them effectively, said party sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/debacle-exposes-fault-lines-within-thrissur-congress/articleshow/82377093.cms||T Ramavarman

Based on a complaint by the victim’s wife, Asif Nagar police registered a murder for gain case on Sunday. On Sunday, Cognizant employee T Dhan Ramesh Kumar’s widow, A Sri Lakshmi, 28, lodged a complaint with Asif Nagar police alleging that her husband succumbed to injuries caused by the assault of robbers at an ATM centre in Mehdipatnam. Lakshmi alleged that the robbers assaulted Ramesh Kumar on April 21 night near ICICI Bank ATM in Mehdipatnam when he went there to withdraw cash. “The offenders forcibly took Rs 1200 cash, two debit cards, PAN card, Aadhar card, two gold rings, a panchaloha ring and cell phone after punching him and slamming him against a shutter,” Lakshmi alleged. After the assault, according to police, Ramesh, who was suffering from hypertension, returned to Ambedkar Nagar in Mehdipatnam and collapsed in front of his house. On April 22, Lakshmi admitted him to a private hospital in Mehdipatnam and on April 27, as per Ramesh’s wish, hospital staff discharged him, police said. After reaching home, Ramesh again complained of health issues and Lakshmi shifted him to the same hospital. However, this time , as per doctor’s advice, Ramesh was shifted to a private hospital in Kukatpally, where while undergoing treatment, he succumbed on May 1 night, Asif Nagar inspector N Ravinder said. Ramesh had married Lakshmi eight months ago after divorcing his first wife. Police said there were no external injuries on the body and they were waiting for post-mortem examination to identify the cause of death. “CCTV footage at the ATM centre and surrounding places indicate Ramesh walked out alone after withdrawing cash and no one assaulted him. Since the complainant alleged that it was a murder, a case was registered under Sections 302 (Murder) and 394 (Voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery).of the IPC. We are investigating from all angles,” a police source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/assaulted-techie-succumbs-police-book-murder-case/articleshow/82377097.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Housing societies make a beeline to bring jab to doorstep||MUMBAI: Soon, Covid-19 vaccination drives will come to your doorstep. The BMC is permitting housing societies to tie up with private hospitals to hold these drives within their premises, subject to availability of stocks. Hospitals will have to ensure all protocols are followed during the drive. These vaccines will come at a cost fixed by the government for private hospitals. While some housing societies are already in talks with the BMC, a few others are trying to set up their infrastructure. Additional municipal commissioner (health), Suresh Kakani told TOI housing societies, industrial complexes, banks and corporates can tie up with any private hospital for doorstep vaccination. “We have notified 75 private hospitals for vaccination and we can add more as and when they apply. Hospitals will have to take care of the holding area, vaccination and observation area post vaccination and follow all protocols,” Kakani said. “Those who want free vaccination can come to the 227 new centres that the BMC will be setting up. These centres will provide free vaccination and they will be operational once we get enough stock,” he added. In a mail to residents from across their projects, the Lodha Group stated they are working with the authorities to organise vaccination. A spokesperson said they were getting permissions from the municipal corporations. “We have tied up with local hospitals to procure vaccines,” said the spokesperson. Mulund’s Atmosphere Housing Society has also reached out to the BMC and BJP MP Manoj Kotak seeking vaccination in their complex. “We have over 700 flats and over 1,500 residents in the society. We can help the BMC set up the vaccination centre in our society and provide manpower for the drive too. This way people won’t have to go out and everyone can get vaccinated,” said Raj Kulkarni, a resident. Kotak said they had asked the BMC to allow NGOs to carry out vaccination drives in housing societies through tie-ups with hospitals. “This will expedite the pace of vaccination and reduce crowds at vaccination centres,” he said. On behalf of the 11 societies in Dosti Acres, Wadala, NGO Friends of Wadala East, has requested the developers to make the community hall available for the vaccination drive. “We are also in talks with the BMC. The BMC’s vaccination centres will be overburdened and carrying out these drives at micro level is the only way forward,” said Rahul Daga, chairman of Dosti Lily CHS and secretary of the NGO. They are ready to bear the cost of setting up the infrastructure. Rajeev Saxena from the Maharashtra Societies Welfare Association said many societies are keen on holding the vaccination drives and are awaiting government orders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-housing-socs-make-a-beeline-to-bring-jab-to-doorstep/articleshow/82377783.cms||Yogita Rao

Raghunath, who is a KPCC member, said that the continuation of Ramachandran in the post after an electoral rout was a disgrace. He said that KPCC working president K Sudhakaran should instead be made the KPCC president. “He should have resigned from the post yesterday itself if he had self-dignity. The KPCC president did not care to come for campaigning in the constituency and despite KPCC having a jumbo committee, only a handful of leaders turned up for campaign here,” he added. Meanwhile, Satheeshan Pacheni, Kannur DCC president and candidate in Kannur, said that he was willing to resign from his post for a total organizational revamp in the party in state. Pacheni said that he was ready to own up the moral responsibility of the poor show of the party in the polls in the district. “The party needs a thorough total organizational revamp from the state-level to the grassroots-level to overcome the weaknesses and match the organizational machinery of the LDF and the BJP,” he said. He said that personally he was planning not to contest again in the polls in the backdrop of the series of defeats he had to face.

I am saying this after many people approached us for help through our call centre at BJP. The situation is serious in the state, it is being underplayed,” he said. We request CM to go in disguise and observe the condition of hospitals. He should have tasked four or five IAS officers to handle the situation,” he added.

Recently, the administration had sought immediate intervention of the ministry for apt utilisation of the infrastructure at PGI. Sources said there are nearly 2,300 beds and 1,000 doctors and other staff at PGI. The hospital is giving the administration only 357 beds for Covid. UT’s own government hospitals have given 500 beds. In the previous letter to Rajesh Bhushan, secretary, ministry of health and family welfare, UT adviser Manoj Parida had submitted “While we are trying to tackle the crisis by enhancing the capacity of Government Multi-specialty Hospital, Sector 16, and Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, help of PGI is urgently required,” he said. Parida had requested the secretary to direct PGI authorities to enhance their Covid beds to at least 500, as they have nearly 2,000 beds, and to maintain at least 100 ICU beds dedicated for Covid treatment. Although PGI was initially made Covid dedicated hospital for Chandigarh at the start of the pandemic, the hospital shares the burden of Covid patients from other states as well. As of now, PGI has 283 Covid beds, 230 non-ICU oxygen beds and 53 ICU beds (including ventilators).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/raise-covid-beds-to-700-at-pgi-admn-to-centre/articleshow/82373148.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti
---||Delhi||18+ drive: Mixed start, but most slots taken for 2 days||New Delhi: The third phase of Covid-19 vaccination for those in the 18-44 age group started on Monday with an enthusiastic response from youngsters, but also with some teething troubles and long queues at some centres. “Delhi government has received 4.5 lakh vaccination doses until now, on the basis of which 301 vaccination centres have been made in 77 schools across Delhi, vaccinating 45,100 citizens. We want to ensure that all citizens between the ages of 18-44 are vaccinated, and are committed to scale vaccination centres in Delhi in a way that each school has 10 vaccination centres,” deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said. A Delhi government official said that almost all the slots are booked for Tuesday and Wednesday. There are about 92 lakh people in Delhi in this age group. Many people said that they had to wait for two to three hours to get inoculated despite arriving at the time slot given to them, complaining that the drive started late at many centres. Sisodia said 250 people have been called per centre, with 100% turnout. “I met several people who informed me that while they faced no hindrances in getting vaccinated at the centres, there were challenges while booking appointments,” he said. “This is so because we only have 4.5 lakh vaccines at the moment with limited centres, but we will resolve these issues as we continue to expand our centres,” Sisodia said, adding that the government is in constant touch with vaccine manufacturers. “The aim of the government in the near future is to have centres in all 272 municipal wards of Delhi,” environment minister Gopal Rai said. Out of a total of 89,236 people vaccinated till 9pm on Monday, 37,562 people were in the 18-44 age group. There was “chaos” at the IIT-Delhi Hospital Covid Vaccination Centre on Monday, said Nirmala Ganapathy, who was there for her second shot of Covaxin. She said she was in the queue at 10.10am but got her vaccine dose at approximately 3.40pm. “There were about 45-50 people in front of us but they told us at about 12.30pm that they had vaccinated over 100 people, and then broke for lunch till 1.30 pm,” she said “There needs to be better management to minimise the risk for vaccine recipients,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/18-drive-mixed-start-but-most-slots-taken-for-2-days/articleshow/82377790.cms||Sidharatha Roy

His four party workers also courted arrest,” said senior inspector Deepak Lagad, adding that the Pune cantonment court on Monday remanded Babar and others in magisterial custody for 14 days. “They were later sent to the temporary jail in Yerawada,” he said. Babar was elected as MNS corporator from Kondhwa in the last PMC elections. He and his party workers had dumped garbage in the ward office over no action on the garbage menace faced by the local residents despite repeated complaints. After assistant municipal commissioner Kishori Shinde registered an FIR against Babar for preventing her and the civic officials from discharging their duty under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code, he had filed an anticipatory bail plea before the district and sessions court in Pune. After the court rejected his bail plea, Babar moved the high court but failed to get any relief.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/corporator-others-held-on-charge-of-dumping-garbage-at-wanowrie-civic-ward-office/articleshow/82377119.cms||---

In addition, they have been slapped with sections of the Essential Commodities Act.The complaint states that of all remdesivir vials sent to the Meltron facility, 48 were illegally taken and replaced with 75 methylprednisolone injections sometime between April 20 and 23. The civic body had supplied 26 boxes (with 48 vials of remdesivir each) to the Meltron covid facility on April 20. In addition, there were 14 loose vials in another box. On April 23, the pharmacist deployed at Meltron found that one of the boxes had vials of some other medicine instead of remdesivir. He alerted the Covid control room. Following a preliminary inquiry by a medical officer, five people were issued show-cause notices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/aurangabad-remdesivir-theft-3-civic-body-employees-booked/articleshow/82375042.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala assembly elections: BJP shocked by Nemom defeat, dip in vote share||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: BJP camp is yet to come to terms with the serious drubbing the party received in the assembly elections. The defeat in Nemom and the significant dip in NDA’s vote share has taken the leadership off guard, leaving no room for justifications. The BJP camp and its allies have no clue yet on what led to the severe setback. Also, there is no agreement among leaders over NDA’s vote share this time. When chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that NDA’s vote share came down by 2.5% in the assembly elections, the leaders in the saffron camp have no figures at hand to counter or corroborate it. “There is a dip in the vote share. But that cannot be as big as what the political opponents claim”, is what most BJP leaders say. According to the statistics published by the election commission, BJP has got only 11.3% votes. The NDA had a vote share of 14.96% in 2016 assembly elections. BJP leaders consider the performance and involvement of BDJS as poor. “But, BJP cannot accuse BDJS for its abysmal performance. If there was disinterest in BDJS, it was total chaos and lack of planning that ruled BJP. What the party needs is a shock treatment, not pain balm,” said a senior BJP leader. Disgruntled leaders in the BJP state unit, at loggerheads with president K Surendran, would soon start pitching for a leadership change. BJP central leadership’s usual practice of addressing organizational failure by changing the state president is prompting them to make such a move. But many in the party believe that a mere leadership change won’t do any good for the party. “BJP has no party machinery in the grassroot level. It still depends on RSS cadres to meet that gap. This is in fact not a strategy that central leadership recommends. RSS being a non-political organization that works with long-term goals often finds no prick of consciousness in asking its cadres to vote for CPM or Congress for reasons best known to them. In fact, in one of the meetings in Ernakulam, Amit Shah had expressed his disgust over BJP filling up its leadership positions with RSS functionaries only,” said a BJP candidate, who believes that RSS deserted him in the last hour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/bjp-surprised-by-drubbing-clamour-for-change-in-brass/articleshow/82377139.cms||B S Anilkumar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: CA duped of Rs 48,000 in e-KYC fraud||MUMBAI: A chartered accountant from Powai was duped of Rs 48,000 by a cyber fraudster under the pretext of getting an online KYC done for his home wi-fi broadband service. The accountant told Powai police that the accused asked him to download an app, which gave him remote access to his phone, and he transferred Rs 24,000 through two transactions. The CA’s son holds a savings account with a Ghatkopar bank and the family usually uses his debit/credit cards to make all online payments. On April 7, the family installed a home wi-fi service from a broadband service provider. A couple of weeks later, the router stopped functioning. But the family did not register a complaint with the service provider. On April 26, around 4.30pm, the CA received a call on his cellphone when he was at home. The caller introduced himself as an employee of the broadband internet service provider and told the CA that the e-KYC process for the service had not been completed and failure to do it would result in termination of the wi-fi connection. “I was required to pay Rs 10 online for the e-KYC. The caller asked me to download an app, Quick Support, on my phone, which I did,” the CA said in his statement to the police. The app provided the fraudster with remote access to the complainant’s phone. “Using my son’s credit card, I paid Rs 10 in the bill payment option of the internet service provider’s app. While the caller was still talking to me, my son received two text alerts on his phone. A sum of Rs 24000 had been debited twice from his bank account. My son immediately alerted me and I questioned the caller about it,” said the CA in his statement. Realising he had been duped, the complainant hung up angrily. On April 27, the CA approached the Powai police station and lodged a complaint of cheating.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ca-duped-of-rs-48000-in-e-kyc-fraud/articleshow/82377801.cms||---
---||Nagpur||19% brought dead, 10% died in casualty awaiting beds at GMCH in April||NAGPUR: April has been the worst month for Vidarbha during the Covid-19 pandemic so far. The month has seen highest-ever 5,500+ deaths due to the novel coronavirus in 30 days. The death analysis of 1,225 deceased reported in the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Nagpur, which is central India’s biggest and advanced tertiary care centre, brings many new facts to fore about the second wave of the infection in the region. Of the 1,225 fatalities reported from April 1 to 28 at GMCH, 238 patients were brought dead, which means near 19% deaths had happened before coming to the hospital. Secondly, 128 patients died in casualty while awaiting bed in wards. Which means, near 10.45% patients reached hospital in critical condition and could not get bed/ward and succumbed to the infection. The highest 485 (39.5%) patients died in ICU under critical care specialists. This indicates the severity of disease in those patients. Remarkably, of the 1,225 deceased, 560 (45.71%) had received Remdesivir which indicates that the so called ‘life-saver’ injection has no role in reducing mortality but only reduces the viral load in case it is administered in early phase. Gender-wise, more men have died than women. Of the 1,225 deceased, 761 (62.17%) were men. This once again underlines the fact that men are worst-affected by Covid-19. Age-wise death distribution shows that highest 26% deceased were between 50-60 years. A significant 20% deceased were from 40-50 age group. Near 14.5% deceased were below 40, which was not the case in the first wave of Covid-19. Late reporting to hospital is killing more patients, shows the data about time interval of death and admission. Out of 1,225 deceased, 249 died within 24 hours of admission and 292 between 1 and 3 days of admission. When it comes to SPO2 level, highest deaths were of patients who reported/admitted with SPO2 less than 80%. “The GMCH death analysis can be a representation of Covid-19 second wave across Vidarbha, because the medical college receives patients from across Central India. Also, besides high number of deaths, there were more fatalities in the younger population. Secondly, the patients who were brought dead and died within hours after coming to hospital account for near 40% of total fatalities. This is a major cause of concern,” said epidemiologist Dr Anand Thatte.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/19-brought-dead-10-died-in-casualty-awaiting-beds-at-gmch-in-april/articleshow/82377124.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Sangeeta was admitted and her treatment started after we deposited Rs 1.50 lakh on April 25,” she said.“We were told we can see Sangeeta on the screen installed at reception but when we came we were told there was some fault in the TV screen and we were not allowed to see her,” Dr Aarti added.“My mother died on April 26 following which the PM called my father to offer condolences. My father requested the PM to help in seeing the face of Sangeeta, after which the DM ensured a video call on April 28 and Sangeeta was seen sitting on her bed while doctors said she was 95% cured and would return home very soon,” she said.“On April 29 night, we received a call from the hospital and were asked to reach immediately. On reaching, we were told Sangeeta’s condition is very serious. We stayed outside from 11pm to 2.30am and were informed that two doctors were coming from BHU. But, later, we were told that she suffered a heart attack and died,” said Aarti.The hospital then asked us to pay Rs 4 lakh saying some injections worth Rs 35,000 and Rs 40,000 were administered to her, but refused to provide prescription, diagnostic reports and details of treatment and medicines given to her,” alleged Dr Aarti.Inspector Kotwali Brijesh Singh said police have started investigating the matter and further action would be initiated as per the report of initial investigation. District magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma said the matter has been referred to a three-member committee of senior doctors that will conduct a probe and file report at the earliest.Pt Mishra was one of the proposers of Prime Minister Narendra Modi when he had filed nomination for contesting the Lok Sabha election from Varanasi in 2014.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/pt-chhannulal-mishras-daughter-blames-pvt-hosp-for-sisters-death/articleshow/82377786.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||8 lions in Hyderabad zoo test positive for Covid, 1st such case in India||HYDERABAD: In perhaps the first such case in the country, eight Asiatic lions at the Nehru Zoological Park (NZP) in Hyderabad have tested positive for Covid-19. Sources told TOI said that on April 29, the Centre for Cellular & Molecular Biology (CCMB) orally told NZP officials that the RT-PCR tests of these lions were positive. The curator and director of NZP Dr Siddhanand Kukrety neither denied nor confirmed this. “It’s true that the lions showed Covid symptoms but I’m yet to receive the RT-PCR reports from the CCMB and hence it will not be proper to comment. The lions are doing well,” said Dr Kukrety. “After Bronx Zoo in New York, where eight tigers and lions tested positive for Covid in April last year, there have been no such reported cases anywhere in wild animals. However, in Hong Kong, the virus was found in dogs and cats,” says Dr Shirish Upadhye, director of city’s Wildlife Research & Training Centre (WRTC). According to the sources, on April 24, wildlife veterinarians working in the park noticed Covid symptoms like loss of appetite, nasal discharge and coughing among the lions kept in the safari. There are 12 lions aged around 10 years in the 40-acre safari area. Four males and females each have tested positive. After veterinarians working in the park pressed the panic button, the management advised them to take samples. Field vets took oropharyngeal (part of the pharynx that lies between the soft palate and the hyoid bone) swab samples of the lions and sent them to the CCMB in Hyderabad with which the NZP has signed an MoU. It’s learnt that one of the vets involved in the process was SA Asadulla. Despite repeated calls, Asadulla did not respond. Sources said CCMB scientists will do genome sequencing to find out whether this strain of the virus has come to the animals from human beings. TOI also learns that a virtual meeting of MoEFCC, CCMB scientists, Central Zoo Authority (CZA) and NZP officials was held on April 30, in which the issue of lions testing positive was discussed. Dr Kukrety said he was also part of the meeting. “The lions' case was the trigger for the MoEFCC to issue a detailed advisory on April 30 to country’s the chief wildlife wardens asking them to shut down all national parks, sanctuaries, and tiger reserves fearing transmission of the virus from humans to animals,” the sources said. The Nehru Zoological Park was closed to the public two days ago. As it is situated in a densely populated area, the virus, which is also is now air-borne, might have infected the lions from people residing in zoo’s vicinity. “It is also possible it might have come from the zoo-keepers or caretakers,” sources said, adding that over 25 park staff tested positive for Covid recently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/8-lions-in-city-zoo-test-ve-for-covid-1st-such-case-in-india/articleshow/82377122.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Pune||India and Europe ‘Go Green’ as part of an international collaboration between schools||pic in p common file name eumind, logo in comyan Pune: Classes VIII and IX at Pawar Public School, Nanded City, participated in EUMIND — also known as Europe Meets India Programme — during the academic year 2020-21 and the theme was ‘Go Green’. The programme is designed as an exchange between students of both countries to enable international exchange of ideas and expand the scope of learning. The highlight of the programme is website building, that students take up with their peers, based on a given scenario. Students took to a website building platform to put in collaborative efforts — taking interviews and researching on topics such as ‘Green Trips, Green Meals, Ecological Companies, Ecological Creativity, Waste Management and Saving Energy’. An exhibition of eco-friendly and creative items made from recycled materials was set up at school by students of the Ecological Creativity Group. This also gave them an opportunity to interact virtually with their international peers from Baken Park Lyceum in the Netherlands. The video conferences with the partner school made them aware of how ‘going green’ is an international need and sustainability is a matter of global concern. Most of the groups were awarded an excellence certificate. Big Q at World Peace Summit: Live in peace vs rest in peace ‘The World Peace Summit’ was organised by the Beacon High School, Pune, in association with 3H Companion on April 26, on the topic ‘Live in peace vs Rest in peace’. The World Peace Summit 2021 was started by 3H Companion in collaboration with 18 national and international organizations in April-May 2021. The event was inaugurated by Anurag Tripathi, CBSE secretary, and JK Gangal, director of CCHRD. All the speakers emphasised on the need to slow down and enjoy the basics like family time, time with friends, pursuing a hobby and more. Vishakha Gupta ended the session saying, “Set the theme for success and positive action that is certain to echo through our entire day. This will help us live in peace rather than draw ourselves into pain, misery, tension, nervousness and anxiety.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/india-and-europe-go-green-as-part-of-an-international-collaboration-between-schools/articleshow/82377147.cms||---

Last month, the UT had put up 109 flats on auction. Yashpal Garg, chief executive officer, CHB, said considering there was total secrecy about number of bids and the bid amount, the Chandigarh Housing Board could better competitive prices. For many of the dwelling units, though single bid was received, it was considerably higher than the reserve price. The e-tender resulted in better revenue for the Chandigarh Housing Board. This is the first time that such a good response has been received, he added. Giving example, he said many of units got single bid, but the highest bid, which was Rs 8 lakh to 11 lakh, higher than the reserve price. Similarly, many of the units got highest bids, which was Rs 12 lakh to 15 lakh higher than the reserve price. The maximum difference between reserve price and highest bid was Rs 18.88 lakh for a three bed room flat in Sector 63. The minimum difference between reserve price and highest bid was Rs 74,160 for a two bedroom flat in Sector 51. The highest bid for a 3BHK in Sector 63 was Rs 1.05 crore and the highest bid for two BHK in Sector 51 went for Rs 99.01 lakh and a EWS flat in Sector 63 for Rs 30 lakhs||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/chb-auctions-36-freehold-dwelling-units/articleshow/82376273.cms||---

Taking a serious view, the judges said: “If we allow such parks to be shrunk indiscriminately, then we will all collapse.” They judges made it clear that the state government has a major role in deciding the extent of eco-sensitive zone pertaining to KBR park. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy was hearing the PIL filed by Kaajal Maheshwari and two others, who challenged the re-notification of the zone saying it led to reduction of the extent of the zone. The judges said that KBR park is in the centre of the city and functioning as a major lung space. Referring to the pandemic which destroys lungs before killing people, the judges said such parks should not be shrunk in size. Environmentalists said the extent of the zone has indeed been reduced. They are also aggrieved because there was an announcement that the public hearing was over. The judges adjourned the case to June 24.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-notice-to-t-over-shrinking-kbr-park/articleshow/82377143.cms||---

According to Rudraprayag police, as the landslide hit the pickup vehicle, it slid off the road. However, with the help of local residents, its four occupants including the driver, managed to get out before the vehicle fell off into a gorge. Excavating machines were pressed into service to remove debris from the highway to restore the movement of vehicles. According to sources, heavy rainfall caused water and debris to enter houses and damaged farms in isolated areas of Rudraprayag. In Uttarkashi, a flash flood on Monday killed two cattle and damaged 10 hectares of agricultural land in Kumrada village of the district’s Chinyalisuaur region. No humans were injured. Teams of SDRF were pressed into service. The revenue department also reached the spot to take stock of the damages. Sources said a mountain stream near Kumrada village swelled due to excessive rains on Monday evening and this led to a flash flood like situation in the village and ruined crops planted across 10 hectares of land. Debris entered several houses and killed two buffalos. Villagers managed to flee to safe locations in the nick of time. Rescue operations are underway. District disaster management officer of Uttarkashi Devendra Patwal said, “Excessive rains caused much damage to Kumrada village.

In her written plea, a 65-year old patient from Jalan Nagar has requested the civic administration to keep a check on such wastage. “Other patients and I were not able to eat all the food supplied daily and the leftover food was thrown away. I am grateful to the health authorities for helping me defeat Covid, but I humbly request them to address the issue of food wastage,” said the patient, who was admitted to a private hospital but in a government reserved bed. A septuagenarian, who recovered from Covid, in his feedback-cum-complaint said the food was distributed to Covid care facilities based on the number of patients admitted without checking whether they are arranging for food on their own or not. “I saw some of the admitted patients were getting homemade food, but they were still being served breakfast and meals by the hospital. All this food was being wasted. Also, the quantity of food served was not as per age groups. Senior citizens like me have lower intake of food, especially during the period of infection,” he said. Anant Motale from an NGO named Save Food Committee said patients at Covid care facilities should get food as per age groups to avoid wastage. “It is an irony that a large amount of food is getting wasted when many underprivileged groups from the society struggle to make both ends meet during the current lockdown-like situation,” he said. As per official guidelines, CCCs and other Covid care facilities offer breakfast to patients at around 8 am, followed by lunch at noon, then tea by 4 pm and dinner at around 7.30 pm. While poha, upma or khichadi are served for breakfast, four Chapatis, daal, two sabjis and rice make up the meals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/food-being-wasted-at-covid-facilities/articleshow/82375050.cms||---

But residents still dread going out for vaccination due to the prevailing Covid condition. That’s why we have urged the LG in a joint petition to help us in organising such camps in residential areas after sufficient vaccine doses arrive,” said Ruby Makhija, secretary of Navjiwan Vihar RWA. The RWAs are ready to provide all necessary support, including space, vaccine storage facility and crowd management. “Residents are ready to pay for the vaccines and won’t mind paying a little extra if the facility is made available in our colonies. Many of them are even willing to sponsor the paid vaccination for their staff like guards, helps, drivers, garbage collectors, etc. While free vaccination camps are being held in government schools, paid camps can be held in residential colonies,” suggested Hardeep Bhalla, president of Sainik Farms RWA. “We are ready to provide details of interested residents in advance, and depending on the size of the colony, the camp can be organised for 2-3 days. We will even ensure full utilisation of vaccines,” said Vani Aggrawal, general secretary, New RWA, Chattarpur Enclave Phase-II. The RWAs are willing to generate funds for the vaccination camps too. “We will be happy to generate funds to sponsor the services of doctors and nurses, and for a fully equipped ambulance.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: CBI probes call by ‘ex-home min’s relative’ in tapping case||Mumbai: CBI is currently examining a telephone conversation allegedly involving a close relative of former state home minister Anil Deshmukh, which forms part of the conversations tapped by former state intelligence chief Rashmi Shukla in the police postings scam. CBI has registered an FIR against Deshmukh for allegedly asking some police officers to raise Rs 100 crore every month from bars and restaurants. Sources stated it is suspected that one of the voices in the recordings was of a close relative of Deshmukh. Some of the witnesses who recorded their statements with CBI reportedly said they were asked to identify a voice in the audio recording and whether it was of Deshmukh’s relative. Details of the conversation were not available. TOI approached CBI to confirm the information but it declined to comment. Deshmukh was unavailable for comment. Recently, CBI has recorded the statement of Rashmi Shukla, special director general of Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), in the case as she headed Maharashtra’s State Intelligence Department (SID) when the phones were tapped. Last year, Shukla had reportedly received complaints that some influential people had promised desired postings to police officers, including IPS officers, in exchange for money. Thereafter, Shukla said she tapped their phones. After going through the recordings, she submitted a report to the then director general of police (DGP Maharashtra) Subodh Jaiswal. She attached the recordings with it, requesting that these be brought to the notice of the chief minister for further action. Jaiswal forwarded the report to the CM suggesting an immediate comprehensive inquiry to identify the concerned individuals for necessary legal action. The state government did not take action on the report. Subsequently, Jaiswal and Shukla, who reportedly were not on good terms with the state government, opted for central government deputation. Chief secretary Sitaram Kunte, who was the then additional chief secretary (home), had alleged in a report that Shukla had misled the government to obtain permission for tapping the calls and had later apologised for her action. Shukla’s report and phone recordings were leaked to opposition leader and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis recently, following former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh’s allegations of corruption against Deshmukh. Fadnavis had submitted the report and recordings to the union home secretary’s office, requesting an inquiry into its contents. A senior Maharashtra police officer stated CBI had not asked the state police for records of the conversation and indicated the agency may have collected these from other sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cbi-probes-call-by-ex-home-mins-relative-in-tapping-case/articleshow/82377165.cms||Vijay V Singh

The shining victory of the LDF shows that this attempt had miserably failed, he added. The conspiracy against LDF by some community leaders was defeated by the people in this election.

The youngsters, mostly from the Indian Institute of Forensic Science (IIFS), collected Rs1.80 lakh by campaigning on social media and purchased three oxygen concentrators. Under the guidance of IIFS lecturer Malojirao Bhonsale, the BSc students donated one machine to a poor family at Bamni village in Balharshah of Chandrapur district. “The idea came up after one of our students, Sushrut Chacharkar who was just 22 years old, succumbed to the deadly virus. He contracted it while serving his ailing mother. Mother of one of our students needed a ventilator in Latur, but she was shifted to Nanded, as she failed to get one. So, we decided to do something for such patients,” Bhonsale told TOI. After their teacher’s call, Nayan Nakhade, Purvaja Gawande, Gaurav Nikam, Moksh Reddy, Durga Vinod, Rupesh Lokhande, Apurva Shinde and others started collecting funds from their friends and relatives and also made a video that went viral. Each of them managed to collect Rs10,000 to Rs15,000 from various resources. “We donated one concentrator to a patient in my village, where the number of patients is very high. After he recovered, we provided it to another patient. The situation is very precarious in our village where daily 50-60 patients are being detected. So, I’ve decided to collect more funds for setting up 10 beds at Zilla Parishad school for them,” Nakhade, a second year BSc student, said. Gawande, a final year BSc student, said she was proud to be a part of NSS and team. “Other 4,000 units in Maharashtra and 36,000 in India should take a cue and help the poor and needy patients. We will continue our noble initiative till colleges are closed,” she said. Bhonsale said they would be donating one concentrator machine to a public health centre in Bhandara from where Chacharkar hailed. Another one would be gifted to the Search Foundation of Dr Abhay and Rani Bang that had started a Covid hospital on their premises. Each machine cost them over Rs50,000. “We have also realized that people have oxygen cylinders, but lack flow meters. We would be purchasing these meters costing Rs3,600 each immediately with the remaining funds and would donate them to poor and needy in Chandrapur district. We are also planning to provide self-employment to the girls from Bhandara and Gondia villages. We would provide them sanitary pads with help of former NSS director Keshav Walke,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nus-nss-students-collect-rs1-8l-online-donate-o2-concentrator/articleshow/82376283.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Delhi||Oxygen crisis still haunts Delhi hospitals, SOS response with stocks almost over||NEW DELHI: Hospital administrators haven’t been able to breathe easy these past few days and it is unlikely they will do so soon. Oxygen supply is erratic and uncertain. On Monday, the Institute of Brain and Spine in Lajpat Nagar had only an hour’s oxygen supply and around 11am asked the patients to shift somewhere else. At least six other small hospitals sent out distress calls either online or through the media. Doctors said either there should be designated refilling stations for hospitals or they would have to halt admissions. “We are supposed to save lives, not be engaged forever in searching for oxygen. Who will care for the patients when our focus is on finding oxygen?” said a doctor from one of the seven hospitals who flirted with disaster on Monday. Irene Hospital in Kalkaji had an hour of oxygen for its 40 patients at 1.40pm. The hospital somehow managed to get 30 cylinders, but this is enough only to last the night. At around 8.40pm, Kukreja Hospital in Mayur Vihar found itself with oxygen for just three hours for its 22 critical Covid patients. Jeewan Anmol hospital in Mayur Vihar was another facility pleading for help with depleted stocks. On Sunday too, the hospital had a desperate 10 minutes of the gas left when they managed replenishments. “We have 60 patients and 10 are in the ICU. There was a crisis yesterday and all the oxygen cylinders were exhausted,” groaned Anmol Sondhi, deputy medical superintendent. “We called our supplier who claimed to have given us our allocated supply. Our requirement is 1.3 metric tonnes, but we get only 0.6 MT. We are in a helpless situation and have informed our patients.” A crisis hit Dharamveer Solanki Hospital in Rohini on Monday morning. The last gas stocks the hospital got was at 1.30pm on Sunday. Dr Pankaj Solanki, owner of the hospital, told TOI, “For 36 hours I haven’t received supplies. I have myself gone out looking for cylinders. We always inform the authorities about the situation but to little avail. We had now told our patients to arrange cylinders themselves or shift to another facility.” Later, the 50-bedded hospital, which has 15 covid patients, received some cylinders that will see it through till Tuesday afternoon. The Institute of Brain and Spine also started telling the patients to consider other alternative healthcare facilities. Family members of several patients later took to Twitter and posted a video of the hospital administration informing them about the miserable scenario. An official from the hospital’s administrative department said, “We were struggling in the morning and looking for cylinders. We have 37 patients, 13 of them in the intensive care unit. The lives of the patient are all at stake. The hospital managed to get some cylinders by the afternoon and somehow staved off a crisis, but we need to have a consistent supply of oxygen. Our patients are on high flow oxygen.” Among other hospitals that faced terrifying moments on Monday were Gandhi Hospital of Uttam Nagar, which was at the point of disaster just post-midnight, but somehow managed things till stocks could be replenished. Devine Hospital in Wazirabad, looking after 32 patients, too had a heart-stopping hour, but somehow managed to get its hands on 20 cylinders. Like Irene Hospital in Kalkaji, Sonia Hospital in Nangloi too was on a tipping point, but it managed to save the day for its 70 patients, but only just. Bhagwan Mahavir Hospital in Pitampura was forced to send an SOS alert at 8.30pm on Monday when its stocks had run down to about a half hour’s supply. HAHC Hospital also raised an alarm, but received supplies, even if it came a little later than the usual time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/oxygen-crisis-still-haunts-hospitals-sos-response-with-stocks-almost-over/articleshow/82377809.cms||---

With this, the cumulative count of the cases has gone up to 2,02,82,833. The daily spike had reached its peak of over four“If as planned, 40% of the population would be vaccinated by October. Besides, a huge percentage of people would already be infected by then. So even if the third wave comes, it won’t be like what we have been experiencing now,” said Agrawal. Besides Agrawal, two other scientists - Madhuri Kanitkar, deputy chief, Integrated Defence Staff, and M Vidyasagar of IIT-Hyderabad – have been working on the SUTRA model. They have been working closely with the government.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); “While we could not predict the exact nature of the second wave earlier, we continue our efforts to better estimate its future trajectory,” they said in a joint statement while explaining why their initial prediction that the second wave will peak by the third week of April and log around 1 lakh daily cases went wrong. Citing reasons, they said, “We have been working on a mathematical model to predict the spread of the virus. It is important to note that a mathematical model can only predict the future with some certainty so long as virus dynamics and its transmissibility don’t change substantially over time. “Mathematical models can also provide a mechanism to predict alternate scenarios corresponding to various policy decisions such as non-pharmaceutical interventions. In the case of Covid-19, it is clear that the nature of the virus has been changing very rapidly. In such a context, any prediction for Covid-19 must be continually readjusted, sometimes almost daily.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/new-covid-cases-may-peak-today-say-experts/articleshow/82379986.cms||Vishwa Mohan

In Surat, an unidentified woman was seen trying to jump off Savji Korat bridge into in Tapi river. The woman had even crossed the high iron grills installed on the bridge’s parapet by the Surat Municipal Corporation. It was then that the commuters passing from the bridge noticed her and rushed to save her. While a group of commuters tried to pull the woman down, she kept shouting to let her die and she did not want to live. A few minutes later, she was pulled over the iron grill. Police said that the incident took place on Sunday afternoon. “We had received information on Sunday afternoon but by the time our staff reached the spot, nobody was found. It is possible that the woman’s family members may have turned up and taken her back home,” said a police official. Similarly, in Ankleshwar, a man tried to jump off a flyover bridge on national highway 48 on Monday morning. He stood on the parapet of the bridge and was throwing off cash in the air. When passengers of a car noticed him, they stopped and pulled back the man. Local sources said that the man wanted to end his life due to the pandemic, but police could not confirm this claim.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/man-woman-saved-from-jumping-off-bridges-videos-go-viral/articleshow/82377182.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: C Laxma Reddy could be health minister again||HYDERABAD: After showing the door to Eatala Rajender from his council of ministers, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao is all set to reshuffle his cabinet soon. The buzz in political circles is that former health minister C Laxma Reddy may get a chance again to head the health department. The CM may also go for a full-scale rejig of his team, sources said. After removing Eatala from the health ministry, the CM has kept the portfolio with him and asked the chief secretary and his secretary to monitor the Covid-19 situation in the state. Official sources said the CM is likely to hand over the ministry as there is a need to monitor the situation on a day-to-day basis with the pandemic at its peak. Also, there are allegations that a senior official in the CMO is not accessible to health department officials, who are finding it hard to convey any important message to the CM. “KCR may go for the reshuffle by inducting a new minister to fill the vacancy. Since there has been plans to remove some ‘non-performing’ ministers in the past couple of months, the CM may opt for full-scale reshuffle and even change some ministers’ portfolios also,” party sources said. In that case, Laxma Reddy, who represents Jadcherla assembly constituency in Mahbubnagar district, may get a chance. He had worked as ss health minister between 2014 and 2018. He was not taken into the cabinet in KCR’s second term in 2018 as V Srinivas Goud and S Niranjan Reddy were inducted into the cabinet from the erstwhile Mahbubnagar district. Party sources said Laxma Reddy is close to TRS working president KT Rama Rao and could get a call. Another former minister and Khairatabad MLA Danam Nagender had also worked as a health minister during Congress regime, but handled only some departments of health ministry. Meanwhile, Eatala is the second health minister to have been removed from the cabinet. In the first term, Station Ghanpur MLA T Rajaiah served as deputy chief minister and health minister. But, he was sacked from the cabinet in 2015 barely after serving for few months following corruption charges againat him in purchase of ambulances.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/laxma-could-be-health-min-again/articleshow/82377175.cms||Koride Mahesh

He said that the Twenty20 presence affected UDF’s performance in Kochi, Vypeen and Kunnathunad, which led to its defeat. “Fielding Twenty20 as Pinarayi Vijayan’s B-Team shows the degraded values of Communist party. Twenty20 has fielded candidates in only eight spots where UDF had an upper hand. This is part of a secret agenda to defeat Congress in its strongholds. UDF could have easily won Kochi, Vypeen and Kunnathunad seats. In their stronghold Kunnathunad, Twenty20 traded its votes to LDF to ensure the defeat of VP Sajeendran,” Thomas alleged. Before assembly polls, Thomas had alleged that Vijayan and Sabu M Jacob, coordinator of Twenty20, had reached a mutual understanding and their aim was to defeat UDF in Ernakulam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/twenty20-is-b-team-of-ldf/articleshow/82377192.cms||---

The counting of votes for panchayat polls started from Sunday morning but the announcement of the results of all seats could not be announced till Monday night. The chief revenue officer and returning officer for panchayat polls Rajkumar Dwivedi said that counting for 83 seats of zila panchayat members had reached the verge of completion but formal announcement would be done after uploading the seat wise complete data online. So far, the data and result of only four seats has been uploaded, he told TOI on Monday evening. Meanwhile, jubilation prevailed among the Dhanajay supporters after his wife Shrikala Singh started moving towrads the margin of lead over rival Rajkumari Yadav- the wife of sitting zila panchayat chief Rajbahadur Yadav- since the beginning of counting. With the completion of counting on Monday, Shrikala’s counting agents claimed that she has defeated Rajkumari by a margin of over 11,000 votes by securing over 14,800 votes. The officials said that final figures would become clear only with the uploading of the results. This victory of his wife in zila panchayat election has proved to be booster for Dhananjay, who is on the radar of the state police for his alleged involvement in Ajit Singh murder case. On the other hand, despite proving his dominance in politics, especially in Jaunpur, for over a decade after winning first assembly election from Rari in 2002, he had been struggling for success after his ouster from Bahujan Samaj Party in 2012. Not only Samajwadi Party stalwart late Parasnath Yadav but even his son Lucky Yadav defeated him in 2012, 2017 assembly elections and 2020 assembly by-poll from Malhani seat. Another post, the result of which were being awaited by many was of zila panchayat member from ward-26 being contested by 2015 Femina Miss India contender and model Diksha Singh. Singh could impress only over 2,000 voters and was at fifth position. Daughter of Jitendra Singh, who hails from Chitauri village of Baksha block and settled his business in Goa, Diksha’s supporters started quitting the counting venue when Nagina Singh took decisive lead to win this seat and three more candidates bagged votes in greater numbers than her. People were also keen to know the result of zila panchayat member election from ward-71 due as a candidate of name Amitabh Bachchan was contedsting from there. However, Bachchan lost against Brijesh Yadav alias Janata. Many winners not alive to celebrate win Varanasi: While there were celebration following the announcement of the results of panchayat election, the jubilation was replaced by a pall of gloom at many places following death of some candidates soon after the result announcements and even before that. In Varanasi, Sunra devi, who had contested election for gram pradhan seat from Nandapur village of Pindra block, was admitted to ICU following deterioration in her health condition. She won the election by a narrow margin of three votes. But, immediately after she was got the news of her victory she breathed her last. Her son Ajay Yadav received her victory certificate. Similarly, Shailesh Singh (45) of Rampur village in Maniyar block of Ballia district, who had contested gram Pradhan election, died after a few minutes of sharp deterioration in his health condition. In Azamgarh, Laldeyi, who had won block development council election from Selharapatti seat of Atraulia block, died following sharp deterioration in her health condition after a few hours of the announcement of the results. Awadhlal Agrahari (40) of Sagra village in Hallia block of Mirzapur district died on Sunday before the announcement of the result of Kshetra panchayat election in which he was declared as victorious on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/wifes-victory-a-booster-for-dhananjays-career/articleshow/82377840.cms||---

A Delhi government official, however, said that the process for vaccination had just started for people above 18 years. “We will eventually add more centres as supply of vaccines increases,” he added. East Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Nimal Jain said that they were making preparations at their proposed sites for the past 15 days. “We had shared a list of 20 new sites at polyclinics, dispensaries and other centres to the district administration and even had many meetings with the authorities. However, till the last moment, we were not informed whether these places would be selected as vaccination centres or not. We only came to know about this on Sunday evening and we are really disappointed.” EDMC has vaccinated over one lakh beneficiaries at its existing 20 centres. “We are putting efforts because we also want the people to get relief. And more centres will help in checking crowding and minimising chances of infection,” said Jain. North Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Jai Prakash said that many of their existing 54 centres where people above 45 years were allowed to take jabs were not getting enough footfall now. “That’s because either people have been covered or are suspicious of going out. The government could have utilised the same facilities for vaccination of people above 18 years and saved the resources. But it seems they are not keen to help a large number of people through speedy vaccination,” he added. Jai Prakash said that dispensaries and polyclinics would have been better choices for vaccination than schools. “Providing primary medical facilities in case of adverse effects would have been easier at dispensaries and polyclinics,” he explained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mayors-unhappy-over-refusal-of-sites/articleshow/82377817.cms||Vibha Sharma

Except for essential item shops selling milk, bread, vegetables, fruits, dairy products, eggs, meat and conducting mobile repairs, all others will be closed. Daily night curfew from 6pm to 5 am and weekend lockdown will continue. In a review meeting chaired by UT administrator V P Singh Badnore, the restrictions imposed by Punjab and Haryana were discussed. “As Chandigarh is the joint capital of Punjab and Haryana, total sealing of borders will not be possible. It was felt a total lockdown for a long period will adversely affect the economy and may lead to migration of labourers, causing massive disruption. A considered decision was taken to have limited restrictive measures,” said UT adviser Manoj Parida. Badnore appealed to residents to strictly follow the Covid protocols, like wearing of masks and maintaining social distancing. Keeping in view the nature of work being done by journalists, Badnore decided that all accredited journalists will be included in the official list of frontline workers in Chandigarh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-like-curbs-in-city-for-week-from-today/articleshow/82376301.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

In their letter, a government teachers’ union said, “We have been forced to attend online meetings on Sundays as well, which is our weekly off. Besides, we are working overtime in enrolment drives in this pandemic. With Covid-19 on the rise, our own lives and those of the family members are at stake. Therefore,teachers should be excused from attending schools when Covid is at its peak. The situation is such that the government has imposed a lockdown or stricter curbs in several areas. However, teachers are supposed to come. Most of them travel via buses and other public transport, making them an easy target to catch the virus and spread it further.” Union president Jagjeet Singh Mann said, “Many teachers visit government schools for non-academic work. Considering that the government has restricted gatherings in marriages and cremation grounds, the education department can work out on a number of staff which should be present in the premises at one point of time.” Deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma said, “All educational institutions, schools and colleges to remain closed, but the teaching and non teaching staff of government schools will have to report to duty. Violations should be reported to commissioner of police and government staff can be assigned Covid-19 duty.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/govt-teachers-say-reporting-to-duty-amid-covid-surge-unfair/articleshow/82377849.cms||Mehak Jain

Only patients who are improving or having relatively mild symptoms are currently being sent to the facility by Delhi government, said railway officials. On Monday, just five beds were in use. The facility at Shakurbasti railway station has a tie-up with hospitals nearby and officials say if a patient’s condition deteriorates, he/she can be shifted to any of those hospitals. “Two oxygen cylinders are available per patient. However, the facility is largely to take care of patients with mild symptoms. If they are at a hospital and their condition improves, they may be shifted here. If a patient’s condition suddenly deteriorates, we can use the oxygen cylinders to stabilise them until they are shifted to a hospital,” said a railway official. SC Jain, divisional railway manager, asserts the beds cannot be treated as oxygen beds and the cylinders will be put to use only in emergency cases.

May 2 was her wedding as well as the day of counting votes in the recently concluded panchayat elections in UP. Poonam Sharma, a resident of Mohammadpur Jadid village in Milak area of the district, was about to exchange flower garlands with her groom when she received the news of her win. She rushed to the counting centre which was 20km from the wedding venue to receive the certificate at 9.30pm on Sunday. Remaining rituals were completed later after she returned from the centre. Sharma, a graduate, said, “This is the best wedding gift for me as I am a BDC member now. I can never forget this moment as all the rituals were completed and just before the ‘varmala’ I was told that I had won the election by 31 votes. My in-laws allowed me to leave the marriage hall to collect the certificate. Everyone in my village is happy with my win.” At the counting centre, she cut a striking figure in her bridal finery, and all eyes were on her. Sharma confessed that she was not expecting to win this election but it was a surprising gift. During this year’s panchayat elections, the BDC seat was reserved for women candidates so her father, Gangasaran, encouraged her to contest for the same. Sharma was actively involved in campaigning for her seat in the run up to the panchayat polls. In fact, at a time when she should have been shopping for her trousseau, she was canvassing door to door to garner support for herself. Sharma received 601 votes while the nearest candidate, Shukuntala Devi, secured 570 votes. Sharma's wedding had already been fixed with a youth from the neighbouring Bareilly district when she decided to fight panchayat elections. Sharma said she is confident that she will be able to juggle her personal and political life well as her husband and in-laws support her.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/a-bride-leaves-her-wedding-to-get-her-winners-certificate-after-clinching-the-bdc-seat/articleshow/82375079.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Some of the relaxations include extensions of due dates, waiver of the late fee and reduction in the interest rates and charges. The relaxations have been given according to the turnover of the assesse and subject to fulfilment of some conditions. N K Thaman, a tax expert, said, “The due date for furnishing GST ITC-04 for the quarter from January 1 to March 31 has been extended from April 25, to May 31 and the due date for filing monthly GSTR-1 for April has been extended from May 11 to May 26. In addition to this, with effect from January 1, in case of invoices which are not reflected in GSTR-2B, the tax payers were made eligible to claim additional ITC only 5% of the tax invoices, which are reflected in GSTR-2B on the date of filing of GSTR3B return, but in a relief for the tax payers, this condition has now been relaxed. Now, the taxpayer has to fulfill this condition cumulatively for April and May. They have to show ITC (input tax credit) in GSTR-3B to be filed for May after cumulatively adjusting ITC for April.” Thaman also added, “Now, the assessees having turnover up to Rs 5 crore in the preceding financial year and filling quarterly GSTR-3B with monthly payment (popularly known as QRMP scheme) can now file details of invoices issued in April through invoice furnishing facility (IFF) from May 1 to May 28, which means these assessees can furnish invoices of April through IFF by May 28. Also, the time period for various compliances, last date of which falls between April 15 and May 30 has also been extended. However, certain actions have been excluded from this extension.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/gst-reliefs-to-assessees-due-to-covid-restrictions/articleshow/82377859.cms||Mohit Behl

The police have seized Rs 4.9 lakh in cash and two cars as well. The cops busted the gang after receiving a tip-off. When a decoy customer was sent to the men, they tried to sell him a concentrator for Rs 1.1 lakh.

The association ,has decided to close the Mapusa market till May 10. The state concluded a four-day lock down on Monday morning, however, Mapusa MLA Joshua D’Souza said that there was need to extend the lockdown by at least another seven days. “There is a lot of pressure on both, government and private hospitals due to the spike in the cases,” he said. “All want to do business for their livelihood and to pay their employees, but Sometimes one also needs to think about the lives of other people and not put them at risk. A lockdown is necessary to bring down the spike and flatten the curve,” D’Souza said. Co-ordinator of the All Goa United Merchant’s forum, Asish Shirodkar, said that the merchants, in spite of the deputy collector granting them permission to keep their shops open during the four-day lockdown, they showed their concern towards by shutting their shops. “The lockdown must be extended. Only then will we be able to run our future economic activities safely,” said co-ordinator of the All Goa United Merchant’s forum, Asish Shirodkar. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mapusa-market-to-be-shut-till-may-10/articleshow/82377964.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Coping up with quarantine: some guidelines for Covid patients||With a linear fall of Covid-19 cases, not only in our country but around the globe, a complacency had developed about the preventive measures. Life cannot come to a standstill but when the situation is not conducive, some changes in the lifestyle need to be made. As there is a surge in the cases of Covid again, the whole discussion about prevention of the disease has started again. With new variant strains coming in, we find some people getting infected for the second time. With the coming of vaccine there is a renewed hope among the population, even though there is controversy over the efficacy and the time period for which immunity will be provided by the vaccine. The experts give us hope that vaccine may not give complete protection, but if someone is taken ill after the vaccination, then the severity of diseases is minimised and life is saved. This has given some confidence among the population after an initial hesitancy in getting vaccinated. Much has been said about the preventive measures like keeping physical distance, washing and sanitising hands, using masks and staying away from the crowded places. But not much attention has been paid to the stress that the patient and the family pass through. Even though percentage of death rate is less than 2%, the tension and stress in the family suddenly escalates. Since even the doctors cannot predict the course of disease, uncertainty adds to the problem. We, however, know that the elderly and those with co-morbid conditions are more vulnerable to become serious. The uncertainty of the course of the disease is a cause for mental stress the patient as well as the family pass through. Therefore, it is important that this issue is discussed more and the fears are allayed. The family has to be explained that the number of people getting serious is very little. Therefore, if the person is not having any co-morbid condition and is not in highly vulnerable age group the chances of his coming out of the disease are very bright. This gives lot of confidence to the whole family and the patient. Even those in the vulnerable age group and with co morbid conditions are to be given confidence and hope that if they take care they would remain alright. When the reports come positive the patient is advised to go into quarantine for 17 days. This adds to the already stressful mental state of affairs of the person. Beside the illness, the person gets worried of the long duration to stay alone. This is a crucial period but a meticulous scientific planning soon reduces the stress and one learns to manage these 17 days. Best is to design your own day as you are the best person who knows your interests and daily requirements. But it helps if you take one day at a time. After the report comes, gather your essential items and other things like mobile phone, laptop, pen, notebook and books. These will help in planning the period and keep you connected with the outside world. During the quarantine, it is important to keep regular oxygen check before and after a six-minute walk minimum of four times a day. This gives us clue of the lung functions at that particular moment. It is advisable to sleep on your belly. This helps in clearing lungs. Sleeping on one side also helps. The patient should undertake breathing exercises in the morning hours. This helps in giving strength to the lungs. Video conferencing helps in reducing loneliness. Light exercise is important, too. As the condition improves and if fever goes down, then one can do exercise more strenuously. Maintain good hydration by taking sufficient amount of liquids and healthy diet as advised by the doctor. It is always good to share daily experience with someone whom you trust. Read about those who have lived in isolation, in solitary cells in jails, for several years but never lost hope.

---||Surat||Young step in to give lifesaving info, kits to needy||Surat: On April 10, Akash Deshmukh, 20-year-old, and his younger brother Ajay tested positive for Covid-19. Soon, the ‘red home quarantine poster’ was put up outside their home in Althan and the Surat Municipal Corporation staffers gave them some medicines. Apart from the medicine doses, to be had over five days, the two brothers had nothing to fight the virus. They were clueless about the disease, were unable to consult a doctor and did not have a thermometer or an oximeter. The two were helpless and had no clue what to do. That’s when Pathshala, the NGO which had funded their education, came to duo’s help again. After learning about the brothers’ testing positive, they not only donated an oximeter and a thermometer, but also took them for CT-scan and gave vitamin tablets. Akash and Ajay, both students of BCom at a college in New Citylight area, are not the only ones who have benefited from Pathshala’s new initiative. The NGO, which was started by a group of teens and college students to educate underprivileged children, is now helping in providing basic Covid care kits to the needy. The NGO has donated 400 kits in just two weeks.  “Father of one of the kid, whom our NGO had helped in the past, was infected with Covid. We got him admitted to a hospital. But the delay in getting tested proved fatal for him,” said Sagar Papneja, a member of the NGO. After the unfortunate incident, the volunteers of the NGO decide to raise funds to donate the Covid kits to the needy. “Families of most of these kids do not have basic facilities to prevent themselves from getting infected. If they get infected, they don’t have equipment to check their parameters,” Papneja added. “After consulting a doctor, we have come up with a basic kit which has zinc and vitamin D3 tablets, hand sanitizers, N95 mask and a digital thermometer. Since an oximeter is expensive, we donate it to only those who have tested positive,” Papneja said. After donating kits to 100 families in Azadnagar slums in Althan, the NGO donated 300 kits to coolies working at Surat railway station. Next week they plan to donate 400 more kits to the members of LGBTQI community and sex workers in Surat. “We will be donating the kits to the people who are most vulnerable and cannot afford it,” Papneja told TOI. Gorelal Dayal, a coolie who lives in Kosad, lauded the NGO’s initiative. “We could never think of buying such things as they are expensive. For buying a gadget like an oximeter, we would be forced to sell some of our belongings,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/young-step-in-to-give-lifesaving-info-kits-to-needy/articleshow/82377208.cms||Jay Pachchigar
---||Delhi||DU students demand suspension of academic calendar for a few weeks||NEW DELHI: First-year students of different Delhi University colleges are asking for a break in their academic calendar with many of them and their families being affected by Covid-19. On April 26, over 250 students of St Stephen’s College had written to the college principal, John Varghese, requesting the same. Due to the pandemic, admissions of the first-year students had been delayed last year. Their second semester classes are still going on. Falit Sijariya, first-year BA programme student at St Stephen’s, said, “The principal told us that he supports our demand and the request has been forwarded to the university. Now, we have prepared a draft, which has been shared with student representatives of over 45 colleges. In each of the colleges, more than half of the first-year students have signed it in support of the demand.” The emails being sent to principals of different colleges read, “Several students and teachers have been severely affected—either as infected individuals or caregivers to those suffering from it. This has put a huge mental pressure on the academic community where gaining education has become impossible in the current scenario. The stress of not being able to attend classes and keep up with academic rigour has made the environment highly unconducive for academic activities.” The students are demanding a break of at least two weeks. Only some doubt-clearing or revision classes may be allowed in the period, they suggest. “Extend the academic calendar to allow flexibility and reduce pressure on the academic community so that interests of students as well as teachers can be taken care of. After the break, prescribe a limit of maximum classes per week, till the situation normalises, to ensure that students are not burdened,” the students have urged. Another major reason behind the demand for the postponement of classes is the need felt to volunteer for different relief work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/du-students-demand-suspension-of-academic-calendar-for-a-few-weeks/articleshow/82377864.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra State Cong asks Poonawalla to disclose who threatened him||Mumbai: State Congress president Nana Patole on Monday asked Serum Institute of India (SII) chief executive officer Adar Poonawalla to reveal names of persons who allegedly made threat calls to him. While NCP blamed him for the situation he finds himself in, Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta said he had never asked for security. The Centre has provided him ‘Y’ category security. In an interview to a magazine, Poonawalla had said in the recent past he had received umpteen calls from leading politicians, chief ministers as well as industrial houses demanding additional quota of SSI-produced Covishield vaccines. “This is a very serious matter. None other than Poonawalla himself has disclosed this information in an interview to a foreign magazine. It will be most appropriate if he discloses the names of the persons who are threatening him. The state government will provide him adequate security and ensure his complete safety,” Patole said. Patole said he was surprised when told the NDA government had provided Poonawalla Y category security, even though he had made no such request. “I am told the central government has provided Y category security to Poonawalla who never asked for a specialised security cover. My information is that such a special security cover is provided to a person only after examining the threat perception. There appears to be politics behind providing the security cover to Poonawala. The NDA government must explain if Poonawalla is under surveillance,” Patole said. The Congress leader also appealed to Poonawalla, who is in the UK, to return as soon as possible in the larger interest of the country. “We are passing through a critical period due to the pandemic. Poonawalla must return to India and expedite production of the vaccines at his Pune plant,’’ he said. Patole said the NDA government had failed to ensure adequate supply of the vaccines as well as remdesivir injections. “While it had agreed to provide 4.38 lakh remdesivir injections till April 30, it provided just 2.5 lakh,” Patole said. NCP spokesperson and skill development minister Nawab Malik blamed Poonawalla for the current situation. “We feel there was lack of consistency in the vaccine rates and there was confusion over the supply too. First, Poonawalla declared Rs 150 per dose for the central government, Rs 400 for states and Rs 700 for private hospitals. Later, he quietly reduced the prices. This has created suspicion and now several questions are being raised,” Malik said. On threats to him, Malik said though the NDA government has provided him security, if the need arises, the state will not hesitate to provide him the highest security cover too.  BJP leader and former cabinet member Ashish Shelar said his party was gathering information on the threats. “This is serious. If an industrialist involved in the manufacture of life-saving drugs receives threats, it is a matter of concern for all of us. We are not indulging in politics over the threats but at an appropriate time, we will expose all those involved,” Shelar said. Shiv Sena leader and industries minister Subhash Desai said no party worker was involved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-cong-asks-poonawalla-to-disclose-who-threatened-him/articleshow/82377214.cms||---
---||Delhi||Covid adoption: Cops told to be cautious||New Delhi: With messages on social media floating of people having adopted and willing to adopt children who have lost parents to Covid-19, chairman of Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) Anurag Kundu has asked Delhi Police to intervene in these matters and increase their vigilance on social media. This red flag from Kundu follows the fear that some may use this opportunity for trafficking or selling children. In a letter to Delhi Police commissioner SN Srivastava, Kundu said, “I want to bring to your attention my concern about social media being currently filled with adoption information of acceptance and offer of children who have turned orphan during the pandemic. The child rights commission has come across many instances on social media where people who have information about orphans are encouraging others to adopt them.” “In some cases the post update informs the children have been adopted. I am sure some of these are out of ignorance of the law governing adoption, however, they may also be cases of trafficking and sale/purchase of the children. These need to probed to get to the depth of the matter,” the letter added. Kundu said he will also be writing to the DCP, cyber crime, with specific instances requesting inquiry. “I request through this letter your intervention so that Delhi Police becomes more vigilant on social media of any such instances and starts taking cognizance of these cases. I am concerned about the future of children who have lost their parents and ensuring that they don’t fall prey to trafficking is the minimum we can do,” said Kundu. The commission has also launched a helpline 9311551393 asking people to report of such cases and even if any child is in need of essential supplies, or are experiencing stress, anxiety.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-adoption-cops-told-to-be-cautious/articleshow/82377887.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The meeting was held at Nashik collectorate under the chairmanship of district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal and was attended by various elected representatives including deputy speaker Narhari Zhirwal, MP Bharti Pawar, collector Suraj Mandhare and joint director (agriculture) Sanjeev Padwal via video-conference facility. Discussing the plans for the kharif season, Bhuse said it is important to ensure that farmers have adequate money in hand at the start of the season. “The government wants the farmers to take institutional loans and repay them on time. Farmers who have been repaying loans promptly would be given loans at 0% rate of interest from the banks. We are also having a word with the banks to identify such farmers and discuss the modalities of the scheme,” said Bhuse. The agriculture department is also planning to promote 10% of crop cultivation through innovative schemes, the minister said. The concept of “cultivating produce in demand”, as suggested by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, is getting good response. It is helping the farmers fetch better market price for their produce as well, Bhuse said.  Bhujbal, meanwhile, asked the agriculture department, the revenue department and the bankers to ensure that farmers are given loan on demand without delay. “All the departments must ensure that the farmers get things on time. Agricultural activities are not restricted under the ‘Break the Chain’ mission. No excuse would be tolerated in case of delay in providing services to farmers,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/planning-farm-loan-at-0-interest-says-agri-minister/articleshow/82376336.cms||Abhilash Botekar

---||Kochi||Kerala assembly election 2021: NDA’s voteshare dips, BJP gains||KOCHI: The NDA’s vote share in the state assembly election-2021 slid to pre-2016 levels, shows the data released by the Election Commission of India. According to the data, BJP garnered 2354,468 votes, which is 11.3% of the total votes of 115 constituencies where the party fielded its own candidates. This figure is 0.77% higher than BJP’s vote share of 10.53% in 2016 state assembly elections. However, the overall vote share of NDA has come down by 1.95% in 2021 state assembly elections. What shook down the otherwise growing vote share pattern of BJP was the pathetic performance of BDJS candidates. Between the 21 BDJS candidates, they received a total of 2,29,931 votes, which is only 1% of the total votes polled in the state. Compare it with the 3.93% votes attracted by the then newly-floated BDJS in 2016 elections. Together, BJP and BDJS had 14.46% vote share during 2016 elections, but this has come down to 12.4% in 2021. With the votes of other members and independent candidates added, the figure is only 12.51%, compared to the overall 14.46% of the 2016 elections — a decline of 1.95% in 2021. CK Janu of Janadhipathya Rashtriya Sabha and Vishnupuram Chandrasekharan of Kerala Kamaraj Congress had contested as BJP candidates at Sulthan Bathery and Kovalam, respectively. Further, BJP had supported independents or candidates from parties like AIADMK or Democratic Social Justice Party at constituencies like Mannarkkad, Guruvayoor, Thalassery and Devikulam. Thus, NDA had made its presence in all the 140 constituencies of the state. Among the BJP’s own candidates, the maximum vote share were garnered by K Surendran at Manjeshwar (37.7%), Kummanam Rajasekharan at Nemom (35.54%), E Sreedharan at Palakkad (35.34%), K Shreekanth at Kasaragod (34.88%), Suresh Gopi at Thrissur (31.3%), C Krishnakumar at Malampuzha (30.68%), BB Gopakumar at Chathannur (30.61%), Sobha Surendran at Kazhakkoottam (29.06%), VV Rajesh at Vattiyoorkavu (28.77%) and G Krishnakumar at Thiruvananthapuram (27.29%). The BJP candidates with least vote shares were Areekkad Sethumadhavan at Malappuram (3.64%), Sajesh Elayil at Mankada (3.95%), PC Vijayan at Wandoor (4.15%), Preman Master at Vengara (4.54%) and Renu Suresh at Kunnathunad (4.66%).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ndas-voteshare-dips-bjp-gains/articleshow/82377211.cms||Shenoy Karun
---||Kolhapur||First O2 self-sufficient hospital grapples with shortage as patient count increases||Kolhapur: The sub-district hospital (SDH) of Gadhinglaj town in Kolhapur district, owing to the surety about the avilability of oxygen, is overburdened with patients. The hospital has its own pressure swing adsorption (PSA) based oxygen generation plant that has a capacity of producing around 80 to 100 cylinders. The hospital has capacity of 70 patients but it is now catering to 130 due to which the oxygen from the plant is now proving insufficient. The hospital was recently hailed as the state’s first oxygen self-sufficient hospital. The plant was set earlier this year. During the first wave of the pandemic, Gadhinglaj tehsil and nearby localities were one of the most ravaged parts of the district. DS Ambole, dean of the hospital, said, “Currently, we have to buy oxygen from outside. After knowing that our hospital is self-sufficient in oxygen supply, many patients are rushing here to get admitted. We have increased the beds from 70 to 130 and now all beds are full.” The state government is planning to install simila oxygen generator plants at several places across Maharashtra. Recently, in his video address to the state, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had said there are limitations to transport oxygen in gaseous form to far away places unlike the liquid oxygen which can be easily transported in large tankers. The chief minister had suggested the government will set up Covid Care Centres adjacent to such PSA plants to avoid technical complications. “We have sought permission to increase the capacity of the plant so as to cope up with increasing number of patients. Also, we are setting up refiller system which can be used to carry the gaseous oxygen to nearby places in small cylinders,” said Ambole. The plant takes in atmospheric air following which oxygen is separated, purified and supplied at required pressure for the patients. Ambole said that the plant has helped save many lives. “However, in case of the critical patients, who needs to be put on high flow nasal oxygen and ventilators, the oxygen stored ends fast and in such cases the other patients who need minimal oxygen suffer,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/first-o2-self-sufficient-hospital-grapples-with-shortage-as-patient-count-increases/articleshow/82376349.cms||---
---||Kanpur||Rescued Jalandhar woman to arrive in Delhi on May 6||Kanpur: With the initiative of Kanpur commissionerate police, one more woman, hailing from Jalandhar is all set to return to India from Oman on May 6 after being rescued from the clutches of human traffickers. To recall, police commissioner Kanpur, Asim Kumar Arun, had approached the higher-ups in Delhi in this regard who pursued the matter with the Indian embassy in Muscat. He also wrote to the Indian embassy in Muscat, and police were in constant touch with officials of the Government of Oman. DCP (crime) Salman Taj Patil said, “The woman's daughter had approached the commissionerate police and requested them to rescue her mother from the clutches of human traffickers. Subsequently, the police got in touch with our counterparts in Jalandhar and explained to them the rescue process following which they (Jalandhar police) immediately swung into action and contacted the Indian embassy in Muscat.” “The authorities at Indian embassy in Muscat approached Oman's higher-ups and finally got the woman released from there. All the formalities in this regard were fulfilled. The woman is likely to reach Delhi on May 6. Once, she reaches her native place, the police will contact her and try to collect more clues with regard to other countrymen who have been held captive there,” the DCP further said. In April, police had arrested Atiq and Muzammil, two members of a human trafficking gang, from the city following a complaint filed by a Unnao resident at the Colonelganj police station accusing the duo of cheating. The duo had sent the complainant’s 40-year-old wife to Oman with a promise of a well-paid job. The complainant said his wife instead landed at the house of a ‘kafeel’ (guarantor), who forced her to do household work for very less salary. Since then, she had been calling her husband to get her back to India. During interrogation, the accused confessed that they were part of a well-organised international human trafficking racket and had sent nearly 18 persons, especially women, from across the country, to foreign countries against a hefty commission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/rescued-jalandhar-woman-to-arrive-in-delhi-on-may-6/articleshow/82377884.cms||---
---||Delhi||Only 44% of O2 demand met: Chadha||New Delhi: Releasing the first ‘oxygen bulletin’ for May 3 on Tuesday, Aam Aadmi Party spokesperson and MLA Raghav Chadha recalled the passionate plea of a woman. “A mother of a 10-year-old Covid-infected boy on high-flow-oxygen support, told us that the oxygen supply in that hospital was enough to last only the next two hours. She pleaded with us to do something,” disclosed Chadha. “So, we diverted an oxygen truck that was scheduled to supply oxygen to another facility to that hospital. In the hospital from where we diverted the truck, there was reserve gas and an urgent situation hadn’t arisen there.” This is how Delhi government was able to respond to and address all the 41 distress calls for oxygen sent by hospitals with a cumulative 7,142 beds on Monday. Chadha also reiterated that against Delhi’s daily demand of 976 metric tonnes of oxygen, only 433 MT was being supplied, a shortfall of 56%. The oxygen bulletin data showed that the average oxygen supply over the last seven days was 393 MT per day. Chadha described the oxygen bulletin as an attempt to put all information related to the gas in front of Delhi’s citizens. He claimed Delhi government was working round the clock to overcome the shortage of oxygen through better management. “All our officials, employees and ministers are working day and night,” Chadha said. “On Monday, we received 41 SOS calls through various mediums, including social media, phone calls, and helplines. We addressed all of these and ensured that oxygen was supplied to them by hook or by crook. There exists a gap of 56% between demand and supply of oxygen, and the faster we overcome the gap the faster the SOS calls will decrease.” Of the 41 distress calls, 25 were resolved through supply of oxygen cylinders, 11 by sending liquid oxygen tankers and five cases by streamlining the supply lines. A total of 21.3 MT of oxygen was provided from the government reserves to resolve these SOS calls. Chadha said that the distress calls were received mostly from small hospitals, including Kukreja Hospital, Triton Hospital and Rainbow Hospital. Chadha added, “Our officials are tracking hospitals and the amount of oxygen left with them, designating them as red zones or safe zones. They then work accordingly. If a supplier was supposed to deliver the oxygen and wasn’t able to due to some reasons, the government team supplies the oxygen through its own means to that specific hospital. To supply oxygen in this manner to hospitals on the verge of exhaustion, we have made arrangements for oxygen reserves.” Liquid medical oxygen is ferried to the major hospitals in gas tankers, while for the smaller hospitals with fewer than 50 beds, the gas is supplied in oxygen cylinders and the big D-type cylinder. “This enables the healthcare facilities to comfortably overcome the crisis and emergency situations and ensure that the incoming supply is made regular,” said Chadha. The AAP spokesperson said there were 21,000 hospital beds in Delhi that needed to be equipped with oxygen supply. “The government is rapidly raising the number of Covid beds and we need 976 MT of oxygen. But we received only 433 MT yesterday, just 44% of what we need,” he maintained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/only-44-of-o2-demand-met-chadha/articleshow/82395450.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Brought only 1,200 remdesivir vials, not 10k, says Vikhe Patil||Mumbai: BJP MP Sujay Vikhe Patil on Monday filed an intervention application before the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court and stated that he had purchased only 1,200 Remdesivir vials, not 10,000. Through his counsel Shirish Gupte, he submitted that these 1,200 vials were brought on a chartered flight in 15 boxes from Chandigarh to Shirdi, and 500 were sent from Pharma Deal in Sadashiv Peth, Pune, directly to the Civil Surgeon. The HC was hearing a petition filed by agriculturist Arun Kadu (70) and others alleging “illegal” procurement and distribution of 10,000 Remdesivir vials from pharma companies of Ahmednagar MP Vikhe Patil. Last week, the HC had sought a report to “trace out boxes” claimed by the MP to have been unloaded at Shirdi airport and distributed in his constituency, and also a reply from the district collector for holding a ‘press conference’ in his office premises to say the vials had come from Pune. Ahmednagar collector Rajendra Bhosale, in an affidavit, “strongly” denied holding any press conference, much less with the MP, and said he was doing his duty in these testing Covid times with “utmost devotion” and “with all bonafides”. He said the petition is based on a news report and trying to attribute to him the knowledge of how the vials were procured. Bhosale said he had placed an order for the vials on April 15, and his role was over. But if some reporter “casually” asked him a question, he may have “expressed knowledge of such procurement by Dr Vikhe Patil Memorial Hospital”. The Ahmednagar superintendent of police submitted a report which said only 1,700 injections were delivered to the Civil Surgeon with 1,200 brought by the MP by air. Vikhe Patil’s advocate Abhay Ostwal said that the MP had “never claimed that 10,000 injections were brought by air” and he had not made any specific statement about the number of vials brought by him even in his videos that have been circulated. But advocate Pradnya Talekar for Kadu submitted an affidavit indicating that “backdated records are now being prepared by government authorities to cover up the whole incident”. She said it was now being shown before the HC that there are no irregularities in the Remdesivir purchase. Talekar said the MP has no right to be heard and cannot implead in the petition as a party. A bench of Justices Ravindra Ghughe and B U Debadwar posted the matter for further hearing to May 5, saying it would consider the MP’s plea to intervene as well as Kadu’s plea to amend his petition and seek action against other elected representatives as well. The chief public prosecutor said the principal secretary (Home) has conveyed that CCTV footage at the airport will be preserved as directed by the HC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-brought-only-1200-remdesivir-vials-not-10k-says-vikhe-patil/articleshow/82377931.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: UDH relaxes norms for setting up oxygen plants||JAIPUR: The urban development and housing (UDH) department on Monday announced several measures for speedy setting up of oxygen plants in the state. The decision was aimed at pushing medical oxygen generation amid soaring Covid cases in the state. The department has decided not to levy building plan approval fee on establishment of oxygen plants. The order reads, “Complete 100% exemption in building map fee will be provided under the Building Regulations 2020 for setting up of oxygen gas plants for medical supplies.” To encourage investors to set up oxygen plants instantly, the department has reduced the time duration in the land conversion process. The process will start immediately after taking an affidavit from the applicant. However, there should be no dispute or litigation on the land. “The approval will be automatically canceled in case the facts mentioned in the affidavit are found to be false,” the order stated. Local bodies have been also empowered to issue lease deeds at its level to landowners coming forward to establish the plants. Earlier, for big plots, the local bodies did not have rights to issue lease deeds and nod from state government was necessary. However, the department simplified the time-taking process. UDH minister Shanti Dhariwal said land conversion for setting up oxygen gas plants for medical supply will be allowed on all agriculture and non-agricultural land earmarked in the master plan 2025. However, land uses of green belt, parks and playgrounds will not be allowed. The department may soon issue a separate notification regarding 100% exemption in premium payable under Rule 10 of the Rajasthan Urban Area (Permission and Allotment of Agricultural Land for Non-Agricultural Purpose) Rules, 2012 and relaxation in lease amount under Rule 20. Earlier on April 29, chief minister Ashok Gehlot also announced a special package with various incentives and facilities on setting up medical oxygen plants in Rajasthan. To get the advantage of the package, investment of Rs 1 crore will be required and the plant will have to generate oxygen by September 30. Under the package, the project will be exempted from regulatory approvals and inspections for three years as per the provisions of the MSME Act, 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/udh-provides-relaxation-for-setting-up-oxygen-plants/articleshow/82377233.cms||---

A jeep belonging to Ajni police station was damaged in the incident. A mob of around 300-400 persons, mostly women and minors, resorted to stone pelting on the police vehicle when cops were rounding up bootleggers and gamblers. City police chief Amitesh Kumar, who rushed to the spot along with a substantial force from different units, said that no cop was injured as the slum-dwellers basically vented their ire on only one of the police vehicles for unspecified reason. “Around 18-20 people were rounded up following the incident. We are verifying the role of women too,” said the CP. Senior inspector Vinod Choudhury of Ajni police station said that he had entered the criminal-infested locality with a substantial manpower from different police stations. “Police do not enter this locality in small numbers due to possibility of retaliation from the locals. We walked in after parking our vehicles outside the locality. We were attacked while arresting the bootleggers and gamblers,” he said. “We sent the arrested goons to the police stations, thereby failing the attempt of their people to wrench them away,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/stones-hurled-at-cops-during-action-against-bootleggers/articleshow/82377250.cms||---

While the 23,542 tests done to detect these cases were lower than the city's daily average of 44,000 (in April), officials said the worst appears to be over as far as the second wave is concerned. However, the daily toll continued to be high with 78 deaths recorded on Monday, showing a daily case fatality rate (CFR) of 2.9%, almost twice the daily CFR reported last week. BMC officials have maintained that the daily toll will plateau this week and start dropping thereafter. The city's tally so far is 6.58 lakh cases and 13,372 deaths. Similarly, Maharashtra reported a 15% dip in daily detection and fatalities on Monday, the second consecutive day of a decline in cases. The state reported 48,621 cases and 567 deaths, taking total cases to 47.7 lakh while the toll touched 70,851.  Officials said daily detections were down owing to fewer tests over the weekend and fatalities had dipped due to delay in updating data. The state conducted 2.1 lakh tests in the last 24 hours, a dip from the 2.5-2.7 lakh tests it conducts during the weekdays. “Mumbai's daily positivity rate is low (11.3%) though we did fewer tests over the weekend,” said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. In contrast, positivity rate on April 4 was 30%. BMC commissioner I S Chahal, in a statement on Monday, said “our aggressive testing policy has resulted in reduction of positivity rate.”  However, he noted that there has been a reduction in demand for tests in the last few days. “It has been the consistent policy of MCGM to do maximum testing to flush out coronavirus from Mumbai’s environment” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/covid-19-big-dip-in-mumbai-cases-the-worst-may-be-over/articleshow/82379993.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Nagpur||Fire engulfs coal handling plant of Chanda power station||CHANDRAPUR: A massive fire engulfed the Coal Handling Plant (CHP) of Chandrapur Super Thermal Power Station (CSTPS) late on Sunday night. Efforts by the maintenance team and the firefighting department of the plant kept the damage to minimum and brought the blaze under control within 45 minutes. The fire had no impact on the power generation at the plant, said Pankaj Sapate, chief engineer at CSTPS. CSTPS has a power generation capacity of 2,920 MW and caters to around 25% power need of the state. Employees working at CHP-D in the plant saw that the conveyor belt that carries to coal started burning at around 11pm and immediately alerted the firefighting department. The fire team of the plant arrived at the spot and sprayed the water over the burning conveyor belt. The fire was so massive that it could be seen from several kilometers away. “Heavy wind blowing in the night further stoked the fire. When the maintenance crew saw that the fire could further spread along the belt, they cropped around 150m0long 104 AB section,” said Sapate. He claimed that timely decision to cut down the belt saved further damage. The chopped burning section of belt was then doused within 45 minutes. The plant officials have estimated a primary damage of around Rs50 lakh. Sapate said the damaged section of the conveyor belt will be replaced within two days. However, the exact reason behind the fire is still uncertain. Sapate claimed that they have ordered inquiry into the matter through chief fire officer Shashikant Papade, who will investigate into the reasons of the fire and submit a report soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fire-engulfs-coal-handling-plant-of-chanda-power-station/articleshow/82377262.cms||Mazhar Ali

The deceased have been identified as Subhadra Domaji Mandavkar (80) and her daughter Surekha Harishchandra Pachkhande (45). Both had isolated themselves from the family after being tested Covid positive. It is learnt that Surekha was not keeping well and had visited a hospital at Hinganghat a few days ago. After returning from the hospital, both the women were not seen outside their house, said village deputy sarpanch Ajay Kude. The incident came to light when the deceased’s daughter-in-law Jijabai visited the house after foul smell started emanating. Jijabai was shocked to see Subhadra and Surekha’s bodies in decomposed state. She informed her family and villagers about it, who reported the matter to police patil Sameer Dhote. Dhote informed the police who sent the bodies for autopsy. The report is awaited. Further investigation is being conducted under the guidance of PI Hemant Chandewar of Samudrapur police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/decomposed-bodies-of-2-covid-ve-women-found-in-house/articleshow/82377303.cms||Balwant Dhage
---||Nagpur||Collect CSR funds from Vidarbha industries for Covid management: HC||NAGPUR: With the district administration facing cash crunch to fight the Covid-19 pandemic, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court (HC) directed the Nagpur and Amravati commissioners to submit names of industries working under their jurisdictions with their budgetary allocation for corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds in Vidarbha. A division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Avinash Gharote asked collector Ravindra Thakare to make a request to NTPC plant at Mouda and Mahagenco unit at Koradi to make their funds available for Covid-19 under CSR. The bench also told Amravati collector to request India Bulls Power company at Nandgaon Peth for allocating CSR funds for Amravati, Akola, Yavatmal, Washim and Buldhana districts. “There is a further need to garner funds from the heads of CSR of different industries operating in different districts of Vidarbha. So, it’s necessary to have detailed information about funds available with each of them. The details shall be placed by Nagpur and Amravati divisional commissioners on record with companies’ names and budgetary allocation under CSR,” the bench said. During hearing of suo motu PIL based on TOI report, the judges requested amicus curiae Shreerang Bhandarkar and other lawyers, including Bhanudas Kulkarni, Sudhir Puranik, Tushar Mandlekar, M Anil Kumar, Nidhi Dayani and others to inform about industrial units in the region who’s CSR could be utilized for Covid-19 management. “If CSR funds have been received by the collector, those could be spent for setting up oxygen plants at hospitals of registered societies/trusts which are providing treatment to the patients free of cost,” the bench said. Collector told to grant funds for oxy plants The HC directed the collector to sanction and allocate substantial money from the funds of District Planning Committee (DPC) and District Mining Resource for setting up oxygen plants at government hospitals in Nagpur district. The judges reminded the collector of statements made by senior counsel MG Bhangde and additional pleader Deepak Thakare regarding Maharashtra chief secretary conducting a meeting on April 15 on setting up oxygen plants across the state. “We’ve not been apprised of the outcome of this meeting. We also don’t know whether any such meeting was held. We direct the collector to place on record all the information about this meeting,” the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/collect-csr-funds-from-vid-industries-for-covid-mgmt-hc/articleshow/82377310.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Pune||Diabetes-Covid-steroids mix causing increase in fungal infections: Doctors||PUNE: A combination of diabetes, Covid-19 and a one-size-fits-all approach to steroid use has caused an upsurge in deadly fungal infections among patients. Most big hospitals in the region said they’re treating at least one case of an invasive fungal infection called mucormycosis or aspergillosis every day. There are about 60 big hospitals in the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR). Experts said rational use of steroids in diabetic patients, use of nasal anti-germ solutions such as betadine and sensitizing those who’ve recovered from Covid about post-infection red flags can avoid long-drawn, mutilating and expensive treatments. “A steroid is certainly a life-saving drug in Covid-19. But it’s a double-edged sword. Steroids can increase blood glucose levels. These levels need to be tightly controlled to help Covid recovery and avoid secondary bacterial and fungal infections,” said infectious diseases expert Parikshit Prayag, from the Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital (DMH) — one of the biggest Covid hospitals in Pune.  The hospital has had more than 75 cases of mucormycosis and over 100 cases of aspergillosis (mainly referred by other hospitals) since the start of the pandemic last March. Both are invasive fungal infections. Experts said the rise in these fungal infections now warrants a rethink of the one-size-fits-all blanket protocol for steroid administration in Covid patients.  “A stable Covid patient without hypoxia (blood oxygen dipping below 92%) should not be put on steroids. Also, it should be the lowest dose for the shortest possible duration; there is no role for high-dose steroids. When oxygen levels are normal, steroids can do more harm than good,” Prayag said. Sujata Rege, infectious disease specialist at Bharati Hospital, said, “Mucor organisms have an enzyme (ketone reductase) which allows them to thrive in high blood glucose and acidic conditions.” Also, the role of oral and maxillofacial and dental surgeon is very important in the diagnosis of mucormycosis among patients. Maxillofacial surgeon JB Garde said mucormycosis usually sets in when discharged Covid patients are home isolated for a few more days. These recovered patients initially start to experience some stuffiness or nose blockage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/medicine-combo-causing-rise-in-deadly-fungal-infections-doctors/articleshow/82379998.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Kochi||6% of Ernakulam population infected till May 1: Report||KOCHI: Six per cent of the total population in Ernakulam have been infected with Covid so far, shows the district analysis report of April prepared by the district surveillance unit. Of the 32,82,388 population, 1,94,641 people (5.92%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 till Saturday. The number has been documented by the health department and the doctors warn there would be more num- ber of cases undiagnosed in the society. The report further shows that test positivity rate (TPR) of many local bodies is above 50%. Making matters worse, cases per million touched more than 10,000 in some local bodies in the district. “Actual number of cases must be five to six times higher than the documented cases and these must be undiagnosed ones. One in every three persons are infected. But with the current restrictions, we expect the curve will be flatted by the end of May. We have to speed up vaccination. Maharashtra government has already placed order for vaccine. Kerala has not placed order. States are given vaccine based on the order of placing order,” said Dr D Padmanabha Shenoy, who follows the progress of the Covid infection. Health officials in Ernakulam said when the TPR is above 50%, chances of missing cases are also very high. “73 per cent of the total local bodies in Ernakulam have 30% or more TPR now. Even if the TPR is above 5%, pandemic is out of control. When it rises above 50%, number of missing cases will be very high. Compared to the first wave, our hospitalization rate has become 50% now,” said a health official. In view of this situation, the health department has demanded implementation of strict containment measures in Ernakulam. Showing Ernakulam’s grim situation, the report shows that 100 people, who are in the age group of 30-60, were confirmed to have died of Covid in the district and three below 30 years of age. As the cases are increasing, there is delay in getting test results. This further hampers containment measures and patient management. IMA, Kerala chapter, secretary Dr Gopakumar said with the virus becoming more virulent, the infection spreads to other members in the family if one member gets infected. “10 per cent of the population have already been infected with the Covid in Ernakulam. This is because, when a person tests positive, there would be around 20 people undiagnosed outside. Unlike in the first wave where an infected person spreads the infection to one or two persons in an office, it has increased to four or five in the second wave. The virus has become more virulent. 20 to 30 per cent of people who attend weddings are getting infected now,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/6-of-ernakulam-population-infected-till-may-1-report/articleshow/82380018.cms||T C Sreemol

A 15-month-old child passed away after battling Covid-19 for about a week in Visakhapatnam a few days ago. A 27-year-old MBA graduate, who was on a job hunt, died of a severe infection of the disease in Srikakulam. A 23-year-old youth lost his life to the pandemic while waiting for hospital admission in Visakhapatnam about a week ago. In another case, a 27-year-old man died of the disease in Visakhapatnam on Sunday. These are among several young people without comorbidities who are succumbing to Covid-19 in the second wave in Andhra Pradesh. Severe infection and hospitalisation among the younger populace is a recent trend being observed across the state. Even though the conventional wisdom says that the vulnerability to severe illness from the pandemic in the younger cohort is somewhat less compared to other age groups, the pandemic has cut short the lives of many in the 20–40 age-group in both first and second waves of the pandemic. The number of young people requiring intensive care has risen sharply in the last two months. In the first wave, the disease predominantly affected the middle-aged and the elderly. But now the youth account for a major proportion of new cases reported in Andhra Pradesh. Some theories point to the mutations of the virus and increased transmittability. Speaking to TOI, Dr Deep Chand, president of Andhra Pradesh Junior Doctors Association, said that the trend could be partly attributed to young people trying to manage the disease on their own. “A majority of the youth are resorting to self-medication before things become worse. They are only turning up to hospitals after the oxygen saturation dropped to as low as 80%. Any Covid-19 patient should seek proper medical guidance and be under medical observation. They can call government call centres for any assistance,” said Dr Deep Chand. Dr Ramana Rao, who is involved in the Covid-19 medical services at a private hospital, said that several youth in their 20s and early 30s are getting hospitalised with a severe infection of the virus in the recent times. “The relaxed attitude and wait-and-watch approach might be making the disease worse. The mutants might have also been fuelling the surge in the infections. Youth should not feel that they are immune to the disease. They should seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms identical to Covid-19,” said Dr Ramana Rao.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/in-second-wave-youths-fall-victim-to-virus/articleshow/82375970.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Following the apology by the high commission for seeking support from Indian Youth Congress, Arden said she recognised that help had been sought for a local staff who had been very unwell. “They should have been using those normal channels and protocols,” she said in a television interview. “The high commission themselves have removed that tweet (seeking assistance) and acknowledged that wasn’t the process that should have been used. They’ve done that, they’ve corrected that,” she added. Ardern said a local mission staff had been very unwell. She added though that the New Zealand mission had been very well supported by the Indian government through the pandemic. Despite assurances from the MEA that it was in continuous touch with all embassies and was responding to their medical demands, foreign missions continued to seek medical assistance through social media. Afghan ambassador Farid Mamundzay tweeted on Monday that Afghan refugees living in New Delhi were among the groups worst affected by the recent Covid surge in India. He didn’t tag any political party though. “Any assistance, particularly medical help with this community would be greatly appreciated. I thank all those agencies & individuals for their assistance, mostly medical over the past week.

In a private hospital in Kollegal, another man died due to the same problem. The situation started unravelling at the district hospital around 8pm Sunday when oxygen stocks started to wear thin and supplies did not reach the town from Mysuru. Breathless patients called their relatives who scrambled to assist them, but with little success. When Chamarajanagar deputy commissioner MR Ravi rushed to the hospital by 10.30pm, their oxygen saturation levels had plummeted to dangerous levels. Though the supply was restored by 2.30am, it had claimed many lives. “The stock is expected to last for the next two days,’’ a source said. A pall of gloom descended on the hospital as grieving kin of the dead between 25 and 50 years gathered near the hospital and protested, alleging negligence by hospital authorities. While one of the victims is a treasury official, the rest are farmers and most had been admitted to the hospital a few days ago. State education minister Suresh Kumar and health minister K Sudhakar rushed to the town to take stock of the situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/karnataka-23-covid-patients-die-due-to-lack-of-oxygen-in-chamarajanagar-district-hospital/articleshow/82380032.cms||HM Aravind

The shortage of ICU beds is being felt acutely in cities such as Visakhapatnam, Vijayawada and Guntur. Families of patients, and sometimes patients themselves, are running pillar to post to get admitted into intensive care facilities. The state health department has roped in nearly 600 hospitals for the second wave of the pandemic, a major increase from 261 hospitals during the first wave. Additionally, 41,295 beds have been made available at 82 Covid care centres to treat mild cases of the novel coronavirus disease. Nearly one lakh patients are in home isolation. Anil Kumar Singhal, principal secretary (health and family welfare), said that triaging and testing facilities have been set up at 68 Covid care centres. “The number of patients availing services at Covid care centres is increasing gradually. About 11,700 patients have been admitted to various care centres across the state as of Monday. Things will improve at hospitals in the next few days as discharges have started,” Singhal said. Around 4,700 patients are receiving intensive care and 16,000 patients are on oxygen support at various hospitals across the state as of Monday evening. Consumption of medical oxygen has shot up two-fold in the second wave. The state health department is currently drawing nearly 440 metric tonnes of medical oxygen from its allocation of 470 metric tonnes a day. State officials recently requested the Union government to increase its daily oxygen quota in tandem with rising case numbers. Additionally, the state health department is making efforts to procure more cryogenic tankers, increase oxygen storage capacity and establish PSA (pressure swing adsorption) plants in every teaching hospital to strengthen the infrastructure for movement of oxygen. Andhra Pradesh has constituted a procurement committee to procure goods and items of Covid-19 services through short duration tenders. The committee, which conducted its first meeting on Monday, took various decisions aimed at improving oxygen availability, transportation and storage in the state. The department will go for tenders for the same in the next few days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/as-hospital-beds-fill-up-covid-care-centres-shoulder-burden/articleshow/82375982.cms||---

The decision has been taken to cover the shortfall in supply of medical oxygen for Covid-19 affected patients. APPCB chairman AK Parida said Aurobindo Pharma Limited, Deccan Fine Chemicals, MetrochemAPI Private Limited and Mylan Laboratories Limited have been granted permission. The companies have been permitted to use pressure swing adsorption (PSA) technology for the conversion process. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) will be identifying vendors and providing technical support along with APPCB to undertake the task on a war footing. Covid-19 hospitals identified by the state government will be getting the supply directly from these companies. Meanwhile, APPCB has directed all 240 hospitals providing emergency treatment to Covid-19 patients in the state to hand over Covid-19 biomedical waste to the Common Bio Medical Waste Treatment Facility (CBMWTF) located in their respective districts. Parida said hospitals have also been directed to register themselves using the CPCB mobile application and hand over the waste for disposal in a scientific manner to the CBMWTF. He said instructions have been issued to identify one nodal person in each hospital who will hand over the waste and update the information on the app. Municipal commissioners have been directed not to allow municipal workers to collect Covid-19 waste as poses a health hazard and may aid in spreading the virus, Parida said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/nitrogen-plants-allowed-to-produce-o2/articleshow/82375993.cms||Samdani MN

They met APPSC secretary PSR Anjaneyulu and lodged their complaints. The APPSC secretary in a statement said the PSC has received complaints regarding the Group-I mains results and it would respond to the individual complaints via email. Speaking to the media at the commission office, the candidates alleged the PSC secretary told them that they were unable to digest the success of other candidates and hence filing frivolous complaints. “We are aware only 400 of 6,500 will candidates qualify for interviews and only 160 will get jobs. We are only requesting the PSC to probe the issues we have raised,” said the candidates. “Something went wrong in the evaluation as it was done online by a third party agency. We request the commission to do justice to the candidates,” said a candidate. The candidates also questioned the way APPSC closed the issue of accepting grievances by giving only a day’s time. “APPSC asked the candidates to file their complaints in person with a short notice.

The candidate asked how could people from Srikakulam or Anantapur reach Vijayawada in the given health crisis. They said many candidates were ready to file complaints by submitting their hall-ticket number, marks in prelims and requested the commission to probe the genuine complaints.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/gr-1-results-aggrieved-candidates-meet-appsc-secy-file-complaints/articleshow/82376012.cms||Samdani MN

---||Goa||‘Goa govt’s myopic vision behind oxygen crisis’||PANAJI: A day after the Goa Association of Resident Doctors (GARD) exposed the severe oxygen shortage at Goa Medical College (GMC), patients and industry representatives said that the crisis is a direct result of the state government’s short-sightedness and failure to prepare for the second wave. Representatives from Goa’s oxygen manufacturers said that the directorate of health services’ (DHS) decision to award a 10-year contract for oxygen supply to a single supplier has directly contributed to the oxygen crunch. The government’s sole dependence on Scoop Industries Pvt Ltd (Scoop Oxygen) prompted other players to shut their manufacturing units in Goa and commence operations in other states. “This has finished all other players in the market. And now they are reluctant to (provide) support,” said Goa state industries association president Damodar Kochkar. In 2010, DHS issued a long-term contract to Scoop to supply medical oxygen and other medical gases to GMC. In 2018, DHS again issued a 10-year contract to Scoop, but this time to supply medical oxygen to all major government-run hospitals. Vishwajit Rane was health minister in both 2010 and 2018. On Monday, Sawant was asked why the government chose to go with a single supplier, and whether the decision has led to today’s crisis. “Let’s not look at the past,” he said. “It is an internal process and I can’t speak about it right now. There are four suppliers right now.” However, the oxygen producers said that ramping up production is not an overnight process, and requires raw material and spares to be brought in from neighbouring states. “It takes at least one month to set up an oxygen plant,” said one of Goa’s major oxygen suppliers. “It can be faster (within 15 days) if you have the manpower and spares. Maharashtra manufactures all spares, regulators and cylinders, while bulk production of liquid oxygen also comes from neighbouring states.” To meet the shortage, the state has begun to obtain liquid oxygen from JSW, Vedanta and other large industries that use oxygen for their manufacturing processes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govts-myopic-vision-behind-oxygen-crisis/articleshow/82377612.cms||Newton Sequeira
---||Goa||To beat shortage, Goa govt ropes in four O2 manufacturers||PANAJI: To ensure uninterrupted oxygen to Covid patients in hospitals, all manufacturers operating in the state have been roped in, chief minister Pramod Sawant, who visited the Goa Medical College (GMC) to check on the availability of the supply of the gas, said. “We have activated four oxygen manufacturers, and equally divided them to supply oxygen to hospitals,” he said. The CM, on Sunday, had visited various oxygen plants across the state and taken stock of the production and distribution of the gas. His visit had come on the heels of a letter written by Goa Association of Resident Doctors to the GMC dean highlighting the problems faced by them in managing patients owing to inadequate oxygen supply . He told reporters that a huge tank has been installed at the super-specialty, which has an altogether different system to supply oxygen to patients. Asked why the old system was still being used at other government hospitals, Sawant said that tanks and oxygen supply systems are installed and put in place at the time of construction of the hospital itself. “It should have been changed, but at the time there was not much requirement for, so it remained the same.” Earlier, GMC’s entire oxygen requirement was 10 trolleys, which has now gone up to 55, the chief minister said. “We will upgrade the oxygen supply system at the GMC,” he said, adding that a new oxygen tank will be installed. The process has been delayed because the state has not got the tank as yet, Sawant said. Additionally, the state government has taken up the installation of two new oxygen plants under the PM cares fund, and these will soon become functional, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/to-beat-shortage-govt-ropes-in-four-o2-manufacturers/articleshow/82377609.cms||---
---||Goa||Docs: Fine line between O2 demand, supply right now||Panaji: The oxygen situation in Goa could get worse if the chain of Covid-19 transmission is not broken, president of the Goa Association of Resident Doctors (GARD), Dr Pratik Sawant told TOI. “The government gave us an assurance and it is sorting out the (oxygen) issue, but if we break the chain of Covid-19 transmission, these problems will sort themselves out. There’s a very fine line between demand and supply at the moment, and it can go either way. If cases drop, the oxygen will be more than adequate. If cases continue to rise, oxygen supply could never be enough to meet the demand,” Sawant said. The GARD raised the problem of insufficient oxygen supply and bed shortages not with the intention of “exposing” or “creating panic”, but because doctors face hardships when many patients turn bad at the same time due to fluctuations in oxygen, he said. “If a doctor is tending to 30 beds of which 25-27 are on central oxygen, and if supply starts to fluctuate even a little, patients start to desaturate. Twenty-five patients turning bad at the same time and needing the attention of one doctor puts the doctor in a very difficult position,” Sawant said.  Not only the doctors, but it also causes aggression among relatives, he said. “Our doctors have seen this happen at very close quarters. The technical glitches in oxygen supply at a time when wards are short-staffed is bad. It only adds to the mental stress of doctors. Every morning, we wake up knowing that we will not be able to save enough patients and that things could have been better if there were more facilities and more doctors,” he said.

The rate fixed by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is Rs 4,500, the plea said. Through an order issued on April 8th last year, the Supreme Court has allowed laboratories to conduct their affairs as per ICMR guidelines and has not restricted their rates, except to those patients coming under Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yogana. Any free or subsidized treatment is to be reimbursed by the government according to rules, the petitioners have contended in the petition filed through advocate Paul Jacob. While so, on February 8th last year, the state government issued an order fixing the rate of RT-PCR at Rs 1,700. On April 30th this year, the government issued another order fixing the rate at Rs 500. The government has no power to issue such orders, the petitioners argued. The laboratories that have approached the high court are Thiruvananthapuram-based Devi Scan Pvt Ltd, Thrissurbased Jeeva Specialty Laboratory, Kochi-based Medivision Scan and Diagnostic Research Centre Pvt Ltd, Kozhikode-based R-Cell Diagnostics and Research Centre, Kozhikode-based Saroj Diagnostic Laboratory, Kozhikode-based AZA Diagnostic Centre, Kozhikode-based Aswini Diagnostic Service, Malappuram-based Janatha Diagnostics, Palakkad-based Dane Diagnostics Pvt Ltd, and Thrissur-based Central Laboratories.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/labs-move-kerala-hc-challenging-rt-pcr-rate-fixed-by-state/articleshow/82380076.cms||---

Space in some government as well as aided institutions will be taken up for the drive. “The concerned head of office/department shall relieve the officials and direct them to report to the office of the mamlatdar of the respective taluka with immediate effect without fail,” the collectors have said in their order. Mamlatdars have been asked to ensure that the deployed persons report at their allotted vaccination centres. “Ensure that possession of the premises is taken over by them and necessary arrangement are done for starting and maintaining the vaccination centres and submit setting up of vaccination report,” mamlatdars have been told. Clerical staff from government departments, Goa University, Goa Board, and state-aided bodies like Goa Konkani Academy and municipal councils have also been roped in. Chief minister Pramod Sawant had announced that separate centres will be set up away from primary health centres. Accordingly, rooms in Don Bosco High School in Panaji, Santa Cruz High School, Peddem Sports Complex, St Thomas High School in Aldona, Sanjay School in Porvorim, Shantadurga High School in Bicholim, Government College in Sakhali will be among some to be taken over as vaccination centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-staff-and-teachers-roped-in-for-vax-drive/articleshow/82377648.cms||---
---||Goa||As cases zoom, flights continue to show descent||Panaji: Covid-19 continues to wreck havoc across the country, including Goa, with the second wave setting the aviation sector a year back to when Unlock 1.0 was announced. Goa International airport has noticed a near 90% drop in passenger footfalls since April 1. Speaking to TOI, Goa Airport director Gagan Malik said recovery in the aviation sector depends on the course taken by the pandemic. “On Sunday we had just 19 flights, 800 passengers arrived and 1,500 left. So if you look at it, just 40-50 passengers have come per flight,” said Malik. “The aviation sector has gone back to the levels of last May when the domestic sector was opened up as part of unlock 1.0. This is a loss for airlines.” In the month of February, Goa International Airport handled 3,700 flights while in March the terminal handled 4,300 flights. The data for April is expected shortly, but the figures are expected to show a drastic decline. “We expect this situation to continue for a month or so. It all depends on how the pandemic crisis continues to unfold in other parts of the country and if Goa improves. Only when things improve will people want to travel again,” said Malik. Despite the surge in cases, the state government has yet to start testing at the entry points, including at the airport.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/as-cases-zoom-flights-continue-to-show-descent/articleshow/82377675.cms||Newton Sequeira
---||Bengaluru||Replenish oxygen stocks, Bengaluru private hospitals urge govt||BENGALURU: The wide gap between demand and supply of medical oxygen has threatened to snowball into a massive public-health emergency as SOS calls poured in from several desperate Bengaluru private hospitals seeking the life-saving element. Medax Hospital in RT Nagar wrote to a patient’s relative, asking her to look for a bed in any other hospital. The letter said the hospital had informed the attendant about the dwindling stock on May 1 and it pressed the alarm again on Monday saying that the oxygen stock was emptying by 5pm. Bengaluru Rural MP DK Suresh released a video in which he informed the government that 200 patients admitted in Rajarajeswari Medical College Hospital were in need of oxygen and appealed to chief secretary P Ravi Kumar to save their lives. Suresh said the hospital needed 3 tonnes of medical oxygen, but the government could not supply it immediately. The MP sourced about 0.6 tonnes of oxygen in the evening, while the hospital on its own arranged for one tonne. “While this is sufficient for 8 hours, the chief secretary promised us to ensure 3 more tonnes by Tuesday morning,” Suresh said after meeting Ravi Kumar. HM Prasanna, president of Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association, confirmed that his association is flooded with SOS calls but support from the government is not forthcoming. ‘Oxy supply must for infra upgrade’ Amid spiralling Covid-19 cases, chief secretary P Ravi Kumar has asked district deputy commissioners not to ramp up medical facilities and infrastructure without ensuring the availability of oxygen supply. Officials said the step was taken to avoid a possible mismatch of bed strength and oxygen supply in hospitals. Oxygen units directed to divert their entire production to medical purposes He said 500 of 600 private hospitals with a cumulative capacity of 10,000 beds are treating Covid patients in the city and the dearth of drugs and oxygen has thrown medical care out of gear. The government has estimated that the state requires 1,700 metric tonnes of oxygen daily. Though the Centre is allotting 850 tonnes of oxygen to Karnataka, the available stock as on Monday was 665 tonnes. Officials said estimates put the city’s daily oxygen need at 1,200 tonnes and the available stock is only 30% of the demand. “We cannot accurately calculate the demand and supply since the situation is dynamic,” said Bengaluru Urban deputy commissioner J Manjunath. Chief minister Yediyurappa on Monday sent a reminder to the Centre about its pending share of contribution and the Centre has allowed Karnataka to procure about 110 tonnes from other states in addition to its allotment of 655 tonnes. “Accordingly, we are procuring oxygen from other states and we got 30 tonnes from Odisha on Monday and another 30 tonnes will reach on Tuesday,” said Ravikumar. The CM convened a meeting of oxygen producers and instructed them to divert their entire production to medical purposes. “We have agreed to optimise the production and supply,” said Satish Chandra Kesari, director of Bharuka Gasses, which produces 65 tonnes of oxygen a day of which 10 tonnes was going to Maharashtra. “Now, we are stopping supply to Maharashtra,” he added. The government issued an order mandating the oxygen producers to report daily on the production and stock position and a senior official said the step was taken to ensure perpetual supply to as many as hospitals is possible. Chaitanya Medical Centre, Yelahanka New Town, on Monday took to social media and asked all its patients to relocate to another hospital citing lack of oxygen. It required 20-30 cylinders of 33 litres each for its patients, many of who were critical and unconscious. However, hospital authorities later in the night said the issue has been resolved after they got oxygen from a private agency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/replenish-oxygen-stocks-bengaluru-private-hospitals-urge-govt/articleshow/82380072.cms||B V Shiva Shankar

It is high time that a task force is constituted to handle Covid management and the government takes a back seat.” Kamat warned that once monsoon starts, things could become more challenging. “We need to anticipate frequent power cuts, road bloackades, floodings which will seriously affect Covid management. Steps need to be taken on top priority for initiating preventive measures right now,” he said, adding that the task force must be empowered with financial powers to take decisions in the best interest of the people. The Margao MLA urged the government to procure vaccines on a war-footing and conduct vaccination drives with a target to complete the first dose by mid-July. He also suggested that the upper two floors of the South Goa District Hospital, as well as some private hospitals, be put to use as Covid facilities. The Margao MLA also pointed out that even after two days of announcing that Covid treatment will be given in private hospitals under the government’s mediclaim scheme, private hospitals were yet to receive any such order. “This is adding to the patients’ woes,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/form-task-force-for-covid-mgmt/articleshow/82361340.cms||---
---||India||23 patients die in Karnataka district hospital as oxygen supply plunges||MYSURU: As many as 23 patients died early Monday morning in the Chamarajanagar district hospital, about 175km from Bengaluru, after the oxygen supply dipped dramatically. In Kollegal taluk of the same district, another man died due to the same problem in a private hospital. The situation started unravelling at the district hospital around 8pm Sunday when oxygen stocks started to wear thin and supplies did not reach the town from Mysuru. Breathless patients called their relatives who scrambled to assist them, but with little success. When district deputy commissioner MR Ravi rushed to the hospital by 10.30pm, their oxygen saturation levels had plummeted to dangerous levels. Though by 2.30am, the supply was restored, it had claimed many lives. “The stock is expected to last for the next two days,’’ official sources said. Kin of the dead between 25 and 50 years gathered near the hospital and protested, alleging negligence by the hospital. Not all deaths due to lack of oxygen , say Karnataka ministersWhile one of the victims is a treasury department official, the rest are farmers and most had been admitted to the hospital a few days ago. Education minister Suresh Kumar and health minister K Sudhakar rushed to the town to take stock of the situation. “The cylinders were supposed to come from Mysuru but there was some glitch,” Kumar said. He added that he got complaints that the supply got delayed due to the intervention of Mysuru deputy commissioner Rohini Sindhuri and would take up the issue once he got a report. He admitted there was lack of coordination between the two district administrations on sharing of oxygen cylinders. Sindhuri issued a press release denying the charge and clarified she had sent cylinders to Chamarajanagar on humanitarian grounds following a request. Suresh Kumar and Sudhakar claimed that all those who died in Chamarajanagar may not have died due to oxygen shortage. Chief minister BS Yediyurappa ordered a probe into the deaths and asked senior IAS officer Shivayogi Kalasad to submit the report within three days. He called an emergency cabinet meeting on Tuesday evening to discuss the issue. Chamarajanagar district incharge minister Suresh Kumar sought the audit of 24 deaths.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/23-patients-die-in-karnataka-district-hospital-as-oxygen-supply-plunges/articleshow/82380073.cms||HM Aravind

---||Lucknow||Lucknow records 3,000 plus cases for the 23rd day on a trot||LUCKNOW: If the first Covid-19 wave was a flood, the second is turning out to be a torrent. The number of new Covid infections continued to be over 3,000 for the 23rd day in a row, and deaths over two dozen for the fifth consecutive day on Monday. With this, the total case count in 14 months since the outbreak reached 2.1 lakh and toll to 1,883. However, of these, 62% (1.3 lakh) infections (1.3 lakh) and 37% (700) fatalities took place in just 48 days of the second wave so far. “The novel coronavirus variant in the second wave seems to be highly transmissible, almost 20 times of the fist wave, resulting in the entire families and apartment buildings getting infected rapidly if anyone of the member or resident acquires infection from outside,” said an expert. “However, a good sign was that daily cases and deaths were less on Monday as compared to Sunday. In fact, a slow decline in the daily infections and deaths has been witnessed in the past four days, he added. Another encouraging sign was that the daily recoveries were more than new infections for the 12th consecutive day. While the number of cases in 24 hours were 3,058 and deaths 26, about 5,686 patients also recovered in the same period. Overall, 95,426 patients who contracted infection during the second wave have recovered. This also led to a drop in the number of patients with active cases to 3,6384 from Sunday's 3,9039. However, this has not reduced pressure from the hospitals because most of the recoveries are of asymptomatic or mild symptomatic patients recuperating in home isolation. Since the recovery rate of hospitalised patients is low, the exponential surge has overwhelmed critical care services in the covid hospitals. People are struggling to get an oxygen supported bed or an ICU for their critically ill family members in the hospitals, despite gradual increase in the number of beds by the district administration. Many families have made arrangements of oxygen for their patients at home. Health officers said that at present, there are about 4,500 patients in the hospitals, of whom around 3,000 are serious or critical.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lucknow-records-3000-plus-cases-for-the-23rd-day-on-a-trot/articleshow/82380105.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bribe-for-bed claims: Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike orders probe||BENGALURU: Amid rising instances of Covid-19 patients unable to get hospital beds and breathing their last, allegations have surfaced that Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) officials are blocking general beds for around Rs 40,000 per head. Following a query from TOI, BBMP chief Gaurav Gupta initiated an internal inquiry by a three-member team. He said it’s totally unacceptable and criminal cases will be filed. “I’ve asked city police commissioner Kamal Pant to look into the matter,” he added. TOI has access to an audio clip of a conversation recorded by Bengalurean Ramesh who was looking for hospital beds. “I called the BBMP helpline. The representative collected all details, including BU number and SRF ID. After a few minutes, a person called and demanded Rs 40,000 to block a bed in KIMS,” he said. Blocking of bed will cost ₹40,000: Caller The caller says, “There are no beds available in Bengaluru. However, we will get it blocked for you but you will have to pay Rs 40,000 which is a one-time payment. Treatment, food and everything will be provided from the government’s fund. As we must pay BBMP officials also to get you the bed, it will cost Rs 40,000. We have got beds in private hospitals but as of now they’re only available in KIMS.” While the patient’s relative sought oxygenated beds, the middleman said they could book only a general bed at that point. An employee in the control room of a BBMP zone admitted to the corruption and said middlemen are working for civic officials. “Once a person approaches a BBMP helpline, some collect details like SRF ID, BU number and contact number and share them with middlemen, based on urgency of the patient approaching the helpline. The middlemen then call patients and make offers.” There are posts on WhatsApp and other social media platforms claiming they will get beds in private hospitals. When TOI with the help of a volunteer connected with the man who had posted one such offer, he said he could get a bed for Rs 20,000 and it would be blocked by Palike officials. Asked whether anyone had got a bed via such means, a source in the war room said beds even for money give rise to a lot of goodwill and beneficiaries just don’t speak up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bribe-for-bed-claims-bruhat-bengaluru-mahanagara-palike-orders-probe/articleshow/82380114.cms||Kiran Parashar
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan alleges largescale vote trading between BJP, UDF||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday alleged that the BJP had traded its votes to UDF candidates even in those seats won by the UDF in the assembly election and said the UDF’s optimism in coming back to power till the last moment was owing to this assurance from the BJP. Back in the capital after the emphatic win by the LDF, the chief minister said the UDF had won at least 10 seats with the votes of BJP cadres, and the fall of the UDF would have been worse without this vote trade. In as many as 90 constituencies, the BJP has lost its votes when compared to the 2016 elections, and the winning margin of the UDF candidates in some seats matches the loss of votes for the BJP in them, which is a clear indicator that BJP votes have gone to the UDF, he said. The chief minister said the BJP lost a total of 4,28,531 votes compared to the 2016 elections in two constituencies in Kasaragod, five in Kannur, two in Wayanad, nine in Kozhikode, nine in Malappuram, five in Palakkad, six in Thrissur,12 in Ernakulam, five in Idukki, six in Alappuzha, nine in Kottayam, five in Pathanamthitta, five in Kollam and10 in Thiruvananthapuram. The UDF candidates in constituencies like Sulthan Bathery, Perumbavoor and Kundara won with the help of these lost BJP votes, he said. Vijayan said such trading of votes could also reduce the winning margin of LDF candidates in some constituencies like Thavanur, Kuttiyadi, Koyilandy and Nemom. He said it is clear that such a vote trading agreement between the UDF and BJP was with the clear knowledge of the state leadership of both parties and fronts. He said the BJP should introspect and ensure that it retains the character of a political party instead of a vote trading system. He also criticised NSS general secretary Sukumaran Nair for his statement not to vote for the LDF on the election day and said people however voted after considering their life experiences. He said he had complete faith in people, which is why he showed optimism from the very beginning. The people of the state, whether it be the majority community or the minority, wanted to protect secularism, which is why they decided to support the LDF, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cm-pinarayi-vijayan-alleges-largescale-vote-trading-between-bjp-udf/articleshow/82380110.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Nandigram winner Suvendu leads the race for Bengal leader of oppn||Kolkata: Pressure has been building on Suvendu Adhikari, who is among the frontrunners in the race for Leader of the Opposition post in the West Bengal assembly. He holds the credit of winning the prestigious Nandigram seat, the epicentre of the political battle for Bengal. Bengal BJP leaders believe that chief minister Mamata Banerjee has targeted Suvendu by demanding recount of votes in Nandigram after the Election Commission announced him the winner. The EC website shows Suvendu defeated Banerjee by a margin of 1,956 votes. “The CM is free to move court. The fact is people of Nandigram have given the verdict,” said Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh. The stiffening of stance by either camp is an indicator of how things are going to pan out in the assembly in the days to come. The situation on ground zero in Nandigram has fuelled communal tension in the area, accentuating the battle of nerves at the party level. According to a section of BJP insiders, Suvendu deserves Leader of the Opposition post because he has emerged as “giant killer” in the poll battle. “Leader of the Opposition enjoys ministerial post and is more equal than MLAs,” a BJP leader said, pointing out that LoP status might protect Suvendu from “unnecessary harassment”. The other man in the race is BJP national vice-president Mukul Roy. Ghosh, however, was non-committal. “We will discuss the matter and announce our decision,” he said. The BJP brass in Delhi is likely to take a call. BJP seniors in Delhi are back to the strategy room for a post-mortem of Bengal polls. They have sought the list of ‘dal badlus’ (turncoats) who got BJP tickets and how they have performed. A host of them — former minister Rajib Banerjee, former Howrah mayor Rathin Chakraborty, TMC-turned-BJP leaders Prabir Ghoshal, Baishali Dalmiya, Rudraneel Ghosh — who were flown to Delhi by a chartered flight to join BJP and were later given tickets, lost. So did ex-minister Rabindranath Bhattacharya from Singur and Jitendra Tiwari from Pandabeswar. Bengal BJP leaders would like to leave it to the party brass to decide how to utilize these people. “We don’t want to take the blame if some among them choose to leave the party,” a BJP leader said. A few of them such as CPM-turned-BJP candidates Bankim Ghosh (Chakdah) and Tapasi Mondal (Haldia) and Trinamool-turned-BJP leader Mihir Goswami (Natabari) won the polls. Two of four BJP MPs who joined the poll fray — junior Union minister Babul Supriyo and Locket Chatterjee — and former Rajya Sabha member Swapan Dasgupta lost the polls. Two others, Jagannath Sarkar and Nisith Pramanik, won though the latter’s winning margin was the lowest at 57. The two winners have to decide which House they want to represent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/nandigram-winner-suvendu-leads-the-race-for-bengal-leader-of-oppn/articleshow/82377858.cms||---
