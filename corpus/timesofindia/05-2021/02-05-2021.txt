A comparison with April 2020 is redundant as the nationwide lockdown, the world’s harshest, had erased 70% of demand. But a month-on-month comparison of data shows April diesel sales down nearly 2% from March, when consumption had jumped 10% from February to 95% of the pre-pandemic level. Petrol consumption saw a sharper fall at 6% in April from a month ago, when sales had posted 11% monthly jump to top the pre-pandemic level by 5%. An early recovery in demand appears challenging at this point as major cities across states are being locked down or put under weekend curfew to check the virulent spread of the virus. This has impacted the movement of people and goods as work-from-home stages a major comeback and people prefer to stay put. The drop in diesel demand, a proxy for economic activities, particularly reflects the impact of Covid curbs on manufacturing and project activities as well as interstate passenger movement. All have a bearing on diesel demand. Jet fuel sales have tanked 39% in April from the same month of 2019 and more than 11% from March, when sales had posted some gains to reach 35% short of the pre-pandemic level. This means the woes of airlines are not going away anytime soon. Anticipating further loss of demand, major state-run refiners are looking at exporting fuels to the US and Europe, where consumption is seen bouncing back on the strength of mass vaccinations. Demand for LPG, or household cooking gas that is largely imported, also dipped by almost 4% from a month ago, while coming down a fraction from April 2019. In March too, LPG consumption had shown marginal growth over the same period of 2019 and edged only 1.3% up from the same month of 2020. This is in sharp contrast to the lockdown period of 2020 when LPG was the only fuel to have posted sustained growth as families remained confined within their homes, leading to more cooking. The government’s offer of free LPG cylinders offered to poor households under the Ujjwala scheme also contributed to the growth.

"The lieutenant governor is satisfied under sub-clause (c) of the proviso to clause (2) of Article 311 of the Constitution of India that, in the interest of the security of the state, it is not expedient to hold an enquiry in the case of naib tehsildar Nazir Wani, assistant professor Dr Abdul Bari Naik and teacher Idrees Jan," the commissioner and secretary of the general administration department said in an official statement. The committee that recommended the dismissals is headed by the additional director general of CID and includes the inspector general of J&K Police. Its brief is to identify government employees who might be working against the state. Bari had been detained under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act while teaching at Kulgam Degree College. He was transferred to a college at Udhampur in Jammu division after being released. Naib tehshildar Wani remains in detention for his alleged anti-national activities. The third employee to be dismissed, schoolteacher Jan, was posted at Kralpora Government Middle School in south Kashmir's Kupwara. According to the dismissal order, lieutenant governor Sinha was convinced – "after considering the facts and circumstances of the case and on the basis of the information available" – that the activities of all three employees were "detrimental to the security and sovereignty of the country". Meanwhile, terrorists attacked a police party at Lazibal in south Kashmir's Anantnag on Saturday evening, leaving a cop injured. The attackers fled after the police team retaliated. A cordon-and-search operation was underway in the area till late in the night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jk-lieutenant-governor-axes-2-teachers-revenue-official-for-anti-national-acts/articleshow/82347544.cms||M Saleem Pandit

According to the official, the Union territory had exhausted its earlier vaccine quota from the Centre earlier in the week. “The UT received at least 1.5 lakh Covishield and Covaxin vaccines on Saturday only and, therefore, it started inoculation of the residents in the 18 years to 45 years age group,” a senior UT official said. The official said vaccination will be in full swing from Monday at the block-level in rural areas. Recipients must first register on the CoWIN app and only then would they be vaccinated, the official added. The J&K government tweeted: “Covaxin will be administered to this age group (18 years to 45 years) free of cost. It will be by prior registration and prior appointment only. Please do not crowd the vaccination centres without appointment.” “Those who have taken Covishield as first dose must take 2nd dose of Covishield only,” the official added. Forty-seven fresh Covid-19 related deaths were reported in the UT since Friday night, taking the total number of coronavirus deaths to 2,330.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jk-commences-with-vaccination-for-covid-19-at-srinagar-jammu/articleshow/82347559.cms||M Saleem Pandit

In last hearing of a suo motu PIL on April 27, based on TOI report where Shreerang Bhandarkar was appointed as amicus curiae, the HC had asked centre to grant permission for importing the lifesaving drug to the Maharashtra government based on a letter by its health department chief secretary. The judges had requested assistant solicitor general (ASGI) Ulhas Aurangabadkar to seek instructions in this regard. In last hearing of a suo motu PIL on April 27, based on TOI report where Shreerang Bhandarkar was appointed as amicus curiae, the HC had asked centre to grant permission for importing the lifesaving drug to the Maharashtra government based on a letter by its health department chief secretary. The judges had requested assistant solicitor general (ASGI) Ulhas Aurangabadkar to seek instructions in this regard.On Saturday, the ASGI furnished a copy of April 22 communication from Rajesh Bhushan working with the Union Ministry for Health and Family Welfare to the chief secretary. He informed that for importing any drug three compliances are needed -- (i) Import marketing permission, (ii) Registration certificate and (iii) Import license. “It’s now clear that once these compliances are obtained, the Remdesivir’s import would become possible instantly and no further documents/permissions would be required,” the judges said. While flaying the chief secretary, they added that though he had received Bhushan’s letter before April 27, he failed to convey to HC adequately and appropriately. “We must mention this with regret. We had stated about the fundamental duty of the officials, the institutions and citizens of India under Article 21 of Constitution to save Covid patients’ lives. We had also clarified that the state through its officers must rise to the occasion. We direct the secretary to obtain all compliances as per April 22 communication from the union ministry,” the bench said. CIL told to donate Rs 11.88 cr for Covid hospitalsThe HC directed Coal India Limited (CIL), to hold its emergency meeting and approve Western Coalfields Limited's (WCL) proposal to provide Rs 11.88 crore under corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds by May 4 for installing oxygen generation plants at various Covid hospitals like GMCH, IGGMCH and AIIMS. Earlier, as per HC directives, WCL informed that it had handed over the cheque of Rs 2.05 crore to collector Ravindra Thakare for the same purpose. “We direct the collector to take immediate steps for utilizing WCL funds for setting up oxygen plants at the Covid hospitals providing free treatment at his discretion. We must make an endeavour to see that these plants are made functional as far as possible within 20 to 25 days,” the justices said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/expedite-procedures-to-import-remdesivir-hc-to-maharashtra-govt/articleshow/82347553.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Delhi||12 patients, including senior doctor, die as Batra hospital runs out of oxygen||NEW DELHI: Just a week after 20 critically ill Covid-19 patients died at Jaipur Golden Hospital in the Capital because of lack of oxygen, at least 12 Covid-19 patients, including a senior doctor, died due to the same reason at Batra Hospital in New Delhi on Saturday. Confirming this to TOI, Dr S C L Gupta, medical director of the hospital, said: “They could have been saved.” The city has been gasping for oxygen for a week now and the crisis seems to have only deepened. The 500-bed hospital had around 326 Covid-19 patients. Of these, according to the medical director, 220 were on high-flow nasal oxygen while 48 were in the ICU requiring bi-pap and ventilator support when the supply was disrupted around 12.30pm. “Six patients in the ICU, including one of our own doctors — gastroenterologist Dr R K Himthani — died while we were struggling to get the oxygen supply restored. Two other patients admitted in the wards also died. There were at least four others whom we managed to resuscitate at that point but they died of the complications caused by oxygen shortage minutes later,” said Dr Gupta. Dr Himthani, one of the 12 who died, had been diagnosed with Covid-19 about two weeks ago, hospital sources said. “He was shifted to the ICU recently and put on a bi-pap machine. He could have survived if not for this disruption in oxygen supply,” said a source. Dr Himthani’s wife, who is a gynaecologist, is also suffering from Covid-19 and admitted in the same hospital. “It is shocking to know that Dr Himthani is no more. I spoke to his son on Saturday morning and he was doing fine. His death due to disruption in oxygen supply is beyond belief. It’s criminal,” one of the doctor’s friends said. He added that the doctor’s wife is stable and recuperating well. Batra Hospital’s doctors, nurses and other staff were equally in shock over the sudden demise of their colleague and the other patients and many of them broke down while narrating how the incident unfolded. “This oxygen crisis has been going on in our hospital for over a week. It has always been a touch-and-go situation with oxygen tankers arriving just when the reserves are about to end. On Saturday, the tankers didn’t arrive, leading to the death of 12 patients. If the government cannot ensure uninterrupted supply of oxygen, they should ask us to shut down and not put the lives of patients at risk,” said a senior doctor. Earlier, on April 23, 20 Covid-19 patients had died within 24 hours at Jaipur Golden Hospital in north-west Delhi and the hospital had linked it to oxygen shortage. Covid-19 primarily infects the lungs and patients suffering from a severe disease require oxygen support to maintain oxygenation as their lungs cannot function optimally. Critical care specialists say a person on ventilator support can die within minutes if oxygen supply is disrupted. Even those on normal oxygen support — up to 15 litres per minute — can die in a few minutes to hour because of such a disruption. Even those who survive the incident are at risk of organ damage due to inadequate oxygen supply at the tissue level. The medical director of Batra Hospital said they require 7,000 litres of oxygen daily. “We received 5,000 litres around 4.30-5 pm on Friday. At 7 am on Saturday, after 14 hours, we were left with only 2,000 litres. Immediately, an SOS was sent to all the authorities concerned but to no avail. We even approached Delhi High Court and apprised it of the crisis around 10.30 am, when the oxygen tank had nearly dried up. But the tanker took longer to arrive, leading to the crisis,” Dr Gupta said. Many other top private hospitals and even public hospitals like Lok Nayak are facing a similar crisis. “I was awake all night on Friday to oversee the shifting of cylinders to needy patients since the oxygen tanker didn’t arrive in time,” one of the doctors at the hospital said, even as he wiped his tears over the stress caused by it to both the patient’s families and doctors attending to patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/12-patients-including-senior-doctor-die-as-batra-hospital-runs-out-of-oxygen/articleshow/82347972.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha
---||Delhi||Enough is enough, water is above head: Delhi HC to Centre||NEW DELHI: "Water has gone above the head. Enough is enough… We can't shut our eyes to people dying in Delhi," the Delhi high court told the Centre on Saturday, directing it to supply the capital its allocated daily quota of oxygen. It added that if its order was not complied with, it would consider initiating contempt proceedings. Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli took note of the eight deaths in Batra Hospital on Saturday due to delay in supply of medical oxygen. "You (Centre) have made an allocation, you fulfil… We can't have people dying. Eight patients have died at Batra due to lack of oxygen...Therefore, does it mean we will shut our eyes to people dying in Delhi?" the court remarked. The court later passed an order directing the central government to ensure that Delhi received its allocated supply of "490 MT positively today by whatever means". "Considering the fact that Delhi is not an industrial state and does not have availability of cryogenic tankers of its own which could be requisitioned under the Disaster Management Act — like other states have done — it falls upon the central government to arrange the tankers as well, so that the allocation made to Delhi could be fulfilled, lest it remains only a paper allocation. The central government shall ensure availability of cryogenic tankers as well for the said supply," the court said. "Pertinently, the allocation to Delhi, which was earlier 480 MT (since April 20, 2021) and is now 490 MT, has not been fulfilled even for a single day. In case this order is not implemented, the concerned officers of the central government, viz. Mr Piyush Goyal and Ms Sunita Dawra, shall remain present during the hearing on May 3, 2021. Looking at the situation, we make it clear that we may even consider initiating contempt proceedings in case of non-compliance," the court said. During the hearing, Dr S Bankata, executive director, Batra Hospital, informed the court that there had been a delay in oxygen supply due to which the supply at the hospital was interrupted for about an hour and a half, leading to the loss of eight lives, including a doctor. Delhi government’s counsel, senior advocate Rahul Mehra, said they had received an SOS from an officer tasked with the job of ensuring supply to hospitals around 3pm. The officer had told him that the reserves of the Delhi government had been exhausted and there was either no supply or minimal supply from the two dedicated oxygen plants — Linde and Air Liquide — on Saturday. The court then took note of Mehra’s "serious concerns" as to how the capital would tide over the shortage as a lot of hospitals and nursing homes had either run out of oxygen or were on the verge of exhausting their stock in the next few hours. Dr Bankata had earlier in the hearing pleaded with the court that the hospital had run out of oxygen for its critical patients, who were on ventilator support. The bench as a result asked the Delhi government to take "immediate, emergent" steps. "Please rush immediately," it had said. By the time the supply reached the hospital around 1.35pm, there had been a gap of one hour, 20 minutes. The court then asked Dr Bankata, "Hope we haven’t lost anyone." The doctor responded by saying, "We have lost… eight patients, including one doctor." The high court, meanwhile, pointed out that big medical facilities in the city should learn from the pandemic and install their own plants. Additional solicitor general Chetan Sharma urged the bench to consider the multiple factors surrounding the supply of medical oxygen to Delhi and said it was a process that was changing from time to time. The court, however, told him: "Mr Sharma, who is asking for a gram more than what is allocated?" The court also wanted the Centre to address the concern raised by Mehra over four oxygen tankers of supplier Inox. The tankers, carrying liquid medical oxygen, and registered with the road transport authority of Haryana, had been detained in Rajasthan while being brought to Delhi. "We had noted these submissions made on behalf of Inox… Mr Tushar Mehta, solicitor general, had given an assurance to the court that strict action will be taken and ensured that the tankers are free for the purpose of supply… We had hoped that Rajasthan would honour the statement of the Centre and the order passed by this court. Mr Mehra submits the stand taken by Rajasthan in the virtual central control room that the said tankers are meant for use in Rajasthan and that they have communicated in this regard to the central government and the Centre has consented to the same… Let this aspect be addressed by the central government when the hearing resumes on Monday," the court said. The court had previously directed the Delhi government to update the information on its portal about patients’ admissions and discharges made every day at hospitals. "This information shall be updated every day without fail," the court said on Saturday. On real-time data on availability of ICU beds on the website, the court directed the Delhi government to bifurcate the category into oxygenated and non-oxygenated beds so that patients were aware of their availability in hospitals and nursing homes. Looking at the current wave, deaths, shortage of hospital beds and allegations of malpractices, like patients not being discharged after having recovered from the disease, the court directed the medical superintendents or directors of all hospitals of both government and private hospitals and nursing homes to provide daily details of admissions of Covid patients from April 1, 2021 onwards. It further directed them to provide information on the number of patients discharged each day from April 1; the number of patients who were hospitalised for 10 days or more; and the type of beds occupied by such patients. The information should be sent by Tuesday. This aspect shall be considered on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/enough-is-enough-water-is-above-head-delhi-hc-to-centre/articleshow/82348005.cms||Aamir Khan

While Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and J&K among a few other states and Union territories launched the vaccination drive, Karnataka and Odisha made only a symbolic start. Blaming organisations authorised by the Centre for not making vaccines available, the Jharkhand government said it will announce fresh dates for the jabs once supplies reach the state. Around 84,599 beneficiaries in the 18-44 age group received their first dose on Saturday. Coronavirus live updatesCentral government officials said it was important to get the programme rolling even if in a symbolic manner and said the numbers will rise steadily in the coming weeks. Although some hospital chains such as Max Healthcare and Apollo opened vaccinations for this category as well as the priority population segment of above 45 years, the slots got booked out early. On several of the next few days, no sessions are available. Overall, 16.48 lakh doses were given till 8pm on Saturday under all categories with most of it administered in government centres from the stocks procured and distributed by the Centre so far, an official said. While Max Healthcare administered doses to 18-plus category at select hospitals, Apollo administered around 100 doses in Delhi, while majority of the doses were given at its Hyderabad and Kolkata centres. In Odisha, only 96 people in the 18-44 age group were administered vaccines in Bhubaneswar. The rest will have to wait as the state has got 1.5 lakh doses of Covaxin which is being used only in Bhubaneswar. The state is yet to get Covishield supplies for the 18+ category. In Chhattisgarh, 1,693 people in this age group were vaccinated. The drive will start in 12 districts on Sunday. The drive was launched in three districts of Rajasthan which received 3 lakh doses from Serum Institute late on Friday for distribution in Jaipur, Jodhpur and Ajmer. Though a limited number of people could manage to book a slot online as it was open only from 5 to 6 am on Saturday, long queues were witnessed outside the centres. The drive is likely to be extended to 11 districts on Sunday. Gujarat administered 55,235 doses in the 18-44 age group till 7pm on Saturday, which was also its foundation day. It started the drive in 10 most-affected districts. The UP government launched the drive in seven cities by airlifting vaccine doses from Hyderabad. Officials said as many as 84 sessions were held to vaccinate 19,000 persons in the new category till 8pm. The drive saw 11,492 in the new group getting the jabs in 26 districts of Maharashtra. The “token” round for the category was held to coincide with Maharashtra Divas. Of the total 56,966 vaccination sessions conducted on Saturday, 53,720 were in the public sector, whereas 3,246 were in private hospitals. While senior executives in major hospitals said they are making efforts to procure stocks and ensure that the drive picks up at the earliest, mid and small-sized hospitals expressed concern over inadequate supplies and the procurement mechanism. “It is very difficult for us to procure stocks like this. There are so many large-scale players apart from government. Why do you think any manufacturer in current circumstances would entertain us? We do not even have supplies to cater to 45-plus groups at present,” a senior executive of a mid-size hospital said. The Centre expects the coverage to expand with an increase in vaccine availability and production. Many players are also looking at importing vaccines though pricing is a major concern in such cases. Overall, 15.36 crore doses of Covid-19 vaccine have been given so far. Of this, 2.72 crore were second doses, indicating as many people have been fully vaccinated. The health ministry said it has provided 16.37 crore doses to states and UTs so far, whereas more than 79 lakh Covid-19 vaccine doses are still available with the states/UTs. Besides, over 17.31 lakh doses will be received in addition by the states/UTs within the next three days.

The day's case count dropped marginally from Friday's record tally of over 4 lakh to 3.92 lakh. As many as 3,728 fatalities were reported on Saturday. The previous highest toll was 3,596 recorded on Wednesday. This was the third time this week that daily fatalities had crossed 3,500 in India. As many as 14 states recorded 100-plus deaths on Saturday, the highest so far. These included two smaller states battling very high mortalities. Uttarakhand recorded 107 deaths, a day after reporting 122 fatalities. In Jharkhand, the toll on Saturday was 159, close to the state's all-time high count of 160 earlier in the week. Coronavirus live updatesMeanwhile, Bengal recorded over 100 deaths for the first time. The toll in the state was 103 on Saturday. Maharashtra again reported the highest deaths at 802, followed by 412 in Delhi. This was the national capital's highest single-day toll. Uttar Pradesh reported 303 deaths, a slight drop from Friday's count (332), followed by Karnataka (271), Chhattisgarh (282) and Gujarat (172). After daily cases hit an unprecedented 4.02 lakh on Friday, there was a slight drop in numbers on Saturday as several states reported plateauing of cases, at least for now. Despite that, eight states and UTs reported their highest single-day spurt in infections, led by Tamil Nadu, which reported 19,588 new cases. Infections also surged to all-time highs in Andhra Pradesh (19,412), Rajasthan (17,652), Bengal (17,512), Odisha (10,413), Punjab (7,041), J&K (3,832) and Puducherry (1,379). In Maharashtra, daily Covid detections have stabilised at around 63,000 cases although fatalities continued to remain high. The state reported 63,282 fresh cases on Saturday, with Mumbai recording 3,897 infections and 90 deaths. Mumbai civic bodyy officials said an analysis of deaths during the second Covid wave has revealed that although the prevalence of cases is not the highest in the under-40 age- group, there is an increased mortality in this age group. Karnataka continued to record the second highest count of new cases, with 40,990 on Saturday. However, Bengaluru's numbers dropped to 19,353 from over 26,000 reported on the previous day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-daily-death-toll-tops-3-7k-for-first-time-uttarakhand-bengal-see-high-mortality/articleshow/82348225.cms||---

This mutant appears to be fuelling the second wave of Covid-19 in certain pockets. The Covid-mutant N440K, first found in Andhra Pradesh’s Kurnoolcity, is spreading fast in some parts of the country. Already, one-third of infections in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have been found to be caused by this variant and in the second wave, its presence is rapidly increasing. In the past two months, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana and Chhattisgarh together contributed about 50% of samples with the mutant strain, indicating its geographically-localised spread. The research study involving scientists from Hyderabad-based Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology and the Academy for Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad, reveals that the N440K variant produced 10 times higher infectious viral titres (viral load) than a prevalent A2a strain and over 1,000-fold higher titres than a much less prevalent A3i strain prototype in Caco2 (epithelial) cells. As many as 1,555 entries with N440K substitution could be identified from across the world. Interestingly, India contributed the largest proportion of N440K variants at 33%, followed by the US and Germany, the researchers said.

This ruling was handed down by a bench of CJI N V Ramana and Justices Surya Kant and A S Bopanna directing the Uttar Pradesh government to shift arrested journalist Siddique Kappan to a government hospital in Delhi. The UP government had opposed the move tooth and nail saying admitting Kappan to any of Delhi’s hospitals, all of which are overflowing with Covid patients, would result in denying facilities to a critical Covid patient. The ruling expands the SC’s 2019 judgment in ‘X vs Maharashtra’ case in which it had said: “The right to dignity of an accused does not dry out with the judges’ ink, rather, it subsists beyond the prison gates and operates until his last breath.” Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had argued that adequate medical treatment is being provided to Kappan as in the case of all other jail inmates and, if need be, further facilities shall be extended to him. The bench took note of grave apprehensions raised by Kerala Union of Working Journalists and Kappan’s wife about the deteriorating health of the accused and said, “The most precious fundamental ‘right to life’ unconditionally embraces even an undertrial. The consideration made herein is keeping in view the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case. Merely because the other jail inmates are receiving treatment similar to the arrestee need not deter us”. “...Owing to the apparent precarious health condition of the arrestee, it is necessary to provide adequate and effective medical assistance to him and allay all apprehensions relating to his health. It would be in the interest of justice to shift Kappan either to Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital or AIIMS or any other government hospital in Delhi,” the bench said. The bench said, “As soon as Kappan recovers and doctors certify him fit to be discharged, he would be shifted back to Mathura jail”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/right-to-life-unconditionally-embraces-undertrials-supreme-court/articleshow/82348483.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||India||Supreme Court to review validity of law on sedition||NEW DELHI: Six decades after upholding the constitutional validity of Section 124-A of Indian Penal Code which penalises sedition, the Supreme Court has agreed to examine whether the verdict needed to be re-looked and whether the penal provision had lost its relevance in the present conditions. A bench of Justices U U Lalit, Indira Banerjee and K M Joseph admitted a plea filed by two journalists, who challenged the validity of the penal provision that prescribes punishment of up to life imprisonment for sedition. The journalists, who are themselves facing sedition charges for allegedly voicing against political leaders and had to spend months in jail, pleaded that the law outlived its utility and it was being misused by people in power against those who criticise them. Read AlsoRight to life unconditionally embraces undertrials: Supreme CourtThe Supreme Court has ruled that an undertrial prisoner’s right to life does not diminish even a wee bit when in jail as an accused for an offence and said such a person’s health concerns have to be taken care of by the state and, if not done so, by the judiciary. This ruling was handed down by aSenior advocate Colin Gonsalves and lawyer Tanima Kishore, appearing for the petitioner, contended that many countries, including England that had introduced sedition law in India, have scrapped the penal provision pertaining to the offence and pleaded the court to re-examine the law in the present context. They alleged that the validity of Section 124A was upheld by the apex court in 1962 since the need of the hour then was to prevent the public violence and public disorder stopping short of waging war against the state. “Section 124-A, was, at the time a necessary tool in crime control. It is conceivable that if sedition had been held unconstitutional in 1962, there may have been a lacuna in the law, the mischief —public disorder and violence — going unpunished. Contrastingly, in 2021, this is not the case. The last nearly 60 years have seen extensive enactment of new legislations dealing directly with safety and security, public disorder and terrorism. Prominent among these are the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, Public Safety Act and National Security Act. Various sections of these Acts deal directly with the overt conduct that sedition seeks to make penal — inciting violence and public disorder,” the petition said. While upholding the validity of Section 124A, a Constitution bench of the apex court in Kedar Nath Singh vs State of Bihar case read down the section and held that acts involving intention or tendency to create disorder, or disturbance of law and order, or incitement to violence would be made penal by Section 124-A. Referring to the misuse of Section 124A, the petitioner journalists, Manipur-based 41-year-old Kishorechandra Wangkhemcha and 53-year-old Chhattisgarh-based Kanhaiya Lal Shukla, alleged that the number of sedition cases registered across the country doubled from 35 in 2016 to 75 in 2018 but no chargesheets were filed in over 70% of the cases, and only four of the 43 cases in which trial had been completed resulted in conviction. “Many cases have recently made headlines in this regard. In examples of authorities employing the uncertain ‘intention’ or ‘tendency’ elements of sedition, people have been arrested and charged for merely possessing Maoist literature, merely interviewing people seen as threats, publicly criticising the government and speaking out against army atrocities,” they contended. The bench after a brief hearing agreed to examine the plea and issued notice to the Centre seeking its response. “This writ petition prays for an appropriate writ, order or direction declaring Section 124-A of the IPc to be unconstitutional and void. Colin Gonsalves, senior advocate appearing for the petitioners, submits inter alia that the decision rendered by the Constitution bench of this court in Kedar Nath Singh v. State of Bihar may require reconsideration. Issue notice,” the bench said in its order. The petitioners said that the section clearly infringes on the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression and the restriction imposed by the section is unreasonable. They said Section 124-A no longer passes muster with the Constitution. They alleged that vagueness of Section 124-A exerts an “unacceptable chilling effect on the democratic freedoms of individuals who cannot enjoy their legitimate democratic rights and freedoms for fear of life imprisonment and that they were also frequently abused and misapplied”. They said that many democratic countries including the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, Canada, Ghana, Nigeria and Uganda, have held sedition law as undemocratic, undesirable and unnecessary. “Section 124-A is unnecessary to protect the interests of state security and public disorder, and is duplicated by more recent legislation, which directly and sufficiently prevents and deals with the mischief of public disorder and public violence. There exists no urgency justifying the employment of Section 124-A, given that the interests of state security and the public order are sufficiently protected by other laws," the petition said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/supreme-court-to-review-validity-of-law-on-sedition/articleshow/82348572.cms||---
---||India||As air tickets to US dry up, Indians eye charter flights||MUMBAI/DELHI: With the US set to restrict from May 4 the entry of most non-Americans who are currently in India, one-way fares for flights bound for the western country from cities such as Mumbai and Delhi have shot up. Meanwhile, with restrictions on travel to London and Dubai and no seats left on non-stop flights between India and the US, the scramble for charter flights has begun. On Saturday afternoon, the cheapest fare available for travel from Delhi to New York on the same day began at Rs 7 lakh, for an Air India flight via Tokyo and onwards to Newark on United Airlines. “The travel curbs imposed last week by the UK and the UAE have stifled Indian passport holders as they can’t board flights to the US that transits via Dubai and London,’’ said a travel industry insider. Neither can those with American passports fly on the May 2 flight as a negative PCR report is mandatory to fly into the US and the likelihood of getting a test report in 24 hours is slim. “Indians are now looking at charter flights. A travel company is apparently selling one-way tickets on direct flights from Mumbai to New York for Rs 1.5 lakh. They probably plan to charter an aircraft, but I don’t know whether the operator they have entrusted this job to has managed to procure the requisite permissions to operate the flight,” said a travel industry insider, requesting anonymity. However, another industry insider said big demand for charters to reach the US was yet to be seen. “Charter companies fly small/medium size airplanes and hardly any of them have permission to fly over the Atlantic Ocean. So, unlike places like Dubai, London and Maldives, the demand for US is mostly restricted to commercial airlines, especially the one’s that go nonstop,” said Rajan Mehra, CEO of Club One Air and former Indian head of Qatar Airways.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/as-air-tickets-to-us-dry-up-indians-eye-charter-flights/articleshow/82349292.cms||Manju V
---||India||Postal ballots up 4 times, may delay poll results today||NEW DELHI: Counting of votes will be taken up for 822 assembly seats across West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Assam, Kerala and UT of Puducherry from 8 AM on Sunday amid elaborate arrangements outlined by the Election Commission as part of its revised Covid-safe protocols. The exercise will proceed simultaneously at 2,364 halls, which is more than twice the 1,002 counting halls set up in 2016 assembly polls. Chief election commissioner Sushil Chandra on Saturday reviewed the counting arrangements – covering 822 assembly constituencies (ACs) across 4 states and a UT, 4 parliamentary seats and 13 ACs where bypolls were held -- with senior EC officers and the chief electoral officers of poll-gone states/UT. During the meeting held via virtual mode, Chandra directed that all EC instructions be adhered to and all counting halls be fully compliant with the Covid guidelines. EC officials told TOI that results for the most constituencies are expected to be in by 5-6 PM, as adequate arrangements have been made to account for increase in number of polling stations on account of Covid, by setting up additional counting tables as well as halls to accommodate the additional tables. Besides, around 7,000 assistant returning officers have been appointed in addition to the 822 returning officers. “Counting of postal ballots will start at 8 AM, while the EVM count will be taken beginning 8.30 AM. While postal ballots, which must be counted manually, may take around 5 hours, EVM rounds which begin half an hour after start of postal ballot count may also take around 6 hours, though the duration may differ depending on the number of polling stations in a given constituency. For instance, Shozhinganallur AC in Tamil Nadu has 991 polling stations,” said an officer. There are some factors, of course, that may prolong declaration of results in some cases. There has been a massive surge in postal ballots this time, thanks to the facility being extended to voters of 80 years age and above, disabled and those in essential services. The total number of postal ballots have grown four times to 13.16 lakh from 2.97 lakh in 2016. However, EC officials said additional tables and AROs are likely to take care of the huge increase in postal ballots to be counted. Once the EVM count is complete, the last one hour or so goes in tallying VVPAT slips with the relevant EVM count for 5 polling stations in each assembly constituency. Only after that can the result be declared. A recount, if necessitated due to a rare mismatch, may further delay the result, though as per rules it is the VVPAT slip count that prevails. As per revised EC protocol, all candidates and counting agents need to produce a Covid-negative report latest by 8 AM on Sunday to gain access to the counting hall. EC on Sunday said 90% of the 1.5 lakh counting agents had been facilitated for RT-PCR or rapid antigen test by the district election officer. A Covid-negative report from an authorized lab is also being accepted. EC had earlier barred all victory processions, including congregation of supporters of victorious candidates anywhere in the constituency beyond limits prescribed by concerned state/UT as per instructions of the SDMA. Also, no gatherings are allowed outside counting halls. Approximately 95,000 counting officials including micro-observers will perform the task of counting. In addition, 1,100 counting observers will watch the process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/postal-ballots-up-4-times-may-delay-poll-results-today/articleshow/82349364.cms||Bharti Jain
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Proposal initiated to dismiss arrested inspectors Waze, Kazi||Mumbai: A proposal has been initiated to dismiss arrested assistant police inspectors Sachin Waze and Riyazuddin Kazi from service under Article 311 (2)b of Indian Constitution. The proposal was submitted to the police commissioner’s office, which may take a decision in few days. Mumbai Police also initiated the process to draft a proposal to dismiss inspector Sunil Mane and constable Vinayak Shinde from service under that provision. Article 311 of the Constitution deals with dismissal, removal or reduction in rank of those employed in civil capacities under the union or a state. Under Article 311, the competent authority can dismiss an erring officer in the larger interest. If the authority is satisfied that the official can be dismissed, he can take action without a departmental probe. All four policemen were arrested by National Investigation Agency (NIA), probing parking of an explosive-laden vehicle near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s bunglaow in South Mumbai, and subsequent murder of vehicle owner, Manshukh Hiran.A senior Mumbai Police officer said, “All those arrested or connected with the cases will be dismissed.” Waze, and others, allegedy conspired to park the Scorpio, with a threatening letter on February 25. The Scorpio belonged to Hiran. Then Mumbai Police chief Param Bir Singh had told Waze, heading CIU of city police, to probe the case. ATS also initiated an investigation, in which Waze got exposed. The Scorpio belonged to Hiran, who was known to Waze. NIA, investigating the parking of vehicle and Hiran’s murder, had arrested Waze, Kazi, Mane and Shinde, along with a bookie, who provided a SIM card used to call Hiran before his murder. NIA is yet to conclude the role of each of them, but prima facie Waze, with the help of Kazi and Shinde, procured fake number plates of vehicles involved in the crime and parked the Scorpio outside Ambani’s residence. Waze and associates also allegedly killed Hiran. Mane allegedly escorted a vehicle carrying Hiran’s body, before they dumped it in Thane creek.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-proposal-initiated-to-dismiss-arrested-inspectors-waze-kazi/articleshow/82348173.cms||Vijay V Singh

Traders estimate that prices will rise even further, to reflect the gap between demand and supply. “Earlier, we were selling grapes between Rs 70 and Rs 80 per kilogram. Now, prices havegone up to Rs 120 per kg. Similarly, the prices of apples were Rs 120 per kg but are now being sold at Rs 220 per kg in the retail market. The price of pomegranate has increased to Rs 180 per kg from Rs 120 per kg,” said K Prasad, a trader in Vizag city. Traders have marked up prices, citing shortage in supply of some fruits and doubling of demand during the pandemic. Prices of lemon and fruits rich in Vitamin C, in particular, have seen a high rise in price, in keeping with increased demand, said P Divakar, a consumer. Another contributing factor to the price rise in cities like Vizag, Vijayawada and Kurnool has been a rise in demand during the holy month of Ramzan. While families and relatives of Covid-19 patients are purchasing Vitamin C-rich fruits to help with the treatment, devotees have also increased consumption. Amid the price rise, it is now mangoes that are selling cheaper at between Rs 100 to Rs 120 per kilo. The price of oranges and sweet lemons also increased in the past few days as people are buying theseto improve immunity, said R Anil Kumar, a trader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/second-wave-pushes-up-prices-of-fruits/articleshow/82347040.cms||Nalla.Babu

---||Patna||Covid second wave, fresh curbs take a toll on weddings||PATNA: It's a repeat of the April-May wedding season last year with the Covid-19 pandemic taking a toll on the matrimonial events. As the number of cases soared, the state government has further reduced the number of guests to 50, prohibited the use of loudspeakers and imposed a time restriction of 10 pm for the ceremonies. The pandemic coupled with the curbs has forced many families to either postpone or make last-minute changes. Shivam Verma, whose sister was to get married in the first week of May, said the wedding has been postponed due to the alarming rise of Covid cases. "The fresh guidelines should be accepted by all as it’s much needed at this point. We don’t want to put our families and guests at risk, so the wedding has been postponed," he said. According to Pandit Chandrakant Pathak, there are few auspicious dates for weddings between May 2 and July 16. "People are shifting their wedding dates in November as there are no dates till then," he said. 28-year-old Sumit Kumari Mani, who was supposed to get married on May 2, somehow managed to reduce the number of guests from 100 to 50 in adherence to fresh orders issued by the state government on Wednesday. "The wedding was already postponed earlier and we again faced a whole lot of hardship to organise it in adherence to fresh restrictions," Mani said. Kankerbagh resident Kiran Loria, whose son is to be married in June, said she has been facing a lot of issues in preparation for the wedding. "My primary concern is shopping as the shops are closed early and it's quite difficult to manage everything in such limited time," she said. People involved in marriage-related trade are ruing heavy financial losses. Prem Chopra, owner of a catering unit near Rajendra Nagar, said they were just recovering from the losses incurred last year and the second wave of the pandemic has made their condition worse. "Almost all bookings got cancelled after the first guidelines issued by the government," he said. Baban Singh, who owns a banquet hall near Bypass Road, said, "Small guests list has already trimmed 75% of my bookings and nowadays people don’t even stay in the function for more than 20 minutes." Ranjit Kumar, a wedding photographer, said, "Guests are already very limited in weddings due to the fear of Covid-19 but as per new guidelines people would not even include photographers in the list." Ratnesh Kumar, a Patna-based wedding music player, said, "It was already difficult to manage our expenses and the sudden restriction on loudspeaker music has created more problems for us."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/covid-second-wave-fresh-curbs-take-a-toll-on-weddings/articleshow/82359806.cms||---

With limited infrastructural facilities available in health centres and the very casual attitude of the people towards this highly infectious disease, lockdowns are the only solution, they assert. Former principal of Patna College, Prof Nawal Kishore Chaudhary, observed that the state government should impose complete lockdown at least for a fortnight to break the chain and people should be strictly prohibited from coming out on the roads except in case of emergencies or for buying vegetables or milk from nearby shops. Infrastructures cannot be created overnight and people who are still attending marriage parties in hundreds, dancing and exploding crackers, can’t mend their ways and adhere to the Covid-19 protocol. Chaudhary further pointed out that saving lives is more important than saving livelihoods. “The government should, however, ensure that every person gets food and other essential items of daily use during the period of lockdown. All political parties should cooperate in this move of the government and steps should also be initiated for getting a larger number of people vaccinated,” he added. Federation of University Teachers’ Associations of Bihar working president Kanhaiya Bahadur Sinha said, “Even though lockdown imposed by the central government last year became very unpopular owing to several problems, including those of migrant labours of Bihar and UP, it is the only solution. If lockdown for a month or a fortnight is not feasible, it should be imposed at least for three days (Friday, Saturday and Sunday) every week for breaking the chain. The pace of rising infection would be reduced considerably and the pressure of government and private hospitals would also come down drastically,” he said. Sinha further said people should also understand the gravity of the situation and strictly follow the instructions issued by the health department with regard to Covid-19. People with the symptoms of Covid-19 should not rush to the hospitals unless they develop some serious complications. Patna University Teachers’ Association’s former president Randhir Kumar Singh said the government must ensure that all citizens of the state are vaccinated as early as possible. He criticized the central government’s decision to send a large amount of vaccine to some other countries of the world when it is not meeting its own requirement. Moreover, suddenly lowering the age of eligibility for vaccination from 45 to 18 has created an unprecedented crisis all over the country. The state government should pool up all its resources to obtain the maximum number of covid vaccines and get its people vaccinated. “Furthermore, a major portion of the state budget should be earmarked this year for creating health infrastructure and the government should also try to rope in the services of a large number of doctors and paramedical staff to meet the challenge,” Singh added. Bihar Public Service Commission’s former member Shiv Jatan Thakur said the Covid-19 protocol must be adhered to strictly by all. The number of casualties from Covid can be greatly reduced by adhering to the protocol and appropriate covid behavior. Everyone should try to stay at home and keep some essential medicines and pulse oximeters, if possible, to be used when needed. They should undertake some light breathing exercises consuming some essential vitamins and minerals regularly to stay healthy. And, above all, they must try to get themselves vaccinated as early as possible, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/academics-bat-for-lockdown-in-bihar-to-break-covid-chain/articleshow/82359960.cms||B K Mishra

In a letter addressed to the district planning officer of Vaishali, Tejashwi said the fund should be used for providing facilities like oxygen cylinders to people infected with Covid at government facilities under Raghopur and Bidupur blocks in the district. The letter contained the list of the facilities to be provided to the referral hospital at Mohanpur and the primary health centre at Bidupur. Each health facility will have 10 oxygen concentrator machines and 100 oxygen cylinders. In addition, 50 oxygen gas trolleys, 200 oxygen masks, 50 bed mats and 100 bed sheets will be provided to the two hospitals. A senior officer posted at Hajipur collectorate said the RJD legislator’s letter has already reached the district headquarters. “The process is likely to start in a day or two. Since Covid infections are spreading in rural areas, availability of oxygen in the referral hospital and the primary health centres will cater to the needs of the patients at the local health facilities,” the officer said. Another RJD MLC, Farooq Sheikh, has donated 50 beds to the Sitamarhi district administration for the treatment of Covid patients. Farooq’s private secretary Saroj Kumar Rai said the beds were handed over to the district authorities in the presence of Covid nodal officer Mahendra Kumar Das.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tejashwi-donates-rs-1-crore-from-mla-fund-for-covid-patients/articleshow/82359914.cms||Ramashankar

This is also the third such LMO tanker consignment that is being transported in container wagons. In all the other cases, road tankers are transported by the railways under ‘roll on-roll off’ services. All the six cryogenic tankers that are being brought by the Railways to Delhi were flown in from Singapore amid scarcity of such tankers to meet the surging demand. Inadequate number of cryogenic tankers turned out to be a major impediment in the smooth supply of liquid medical oxygen despite having enough production of the critical medical aid. Officials said as more cryogenic tankers are imported, their movement in container wagons will give railways one more option for faster transport of medical oxygen. “If we have more options to transport tankers, it’s always better and particularly when we are facing a crisis and there is demand for quick movement,” said an official.Early this week, the first Oxygen Express train for Delhi brought 70 tonnes from the Jindal Steel Works plant in Raigarh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2nd-express-to-reach-delhi-today-with-120-tonne-oxygen/articleshow/82347723.cms||---

The drive was taken up across 76 centres in the city on Saturday. The city youth took to the drive with enthusiasm with 9,417 taking the jab on Saturday. Also, 6,888 persons above the age of 45 years were also vaccinated in the city. Majority of those who turned up at centres across the city had to wait in long queues because of delay in commencement of the vaccination programme. Later in the day, vaccination at some centres came to a halt as the stock of the injections ran out. Those who came for the jab had to wait till stock were replenished at these centres. Technical snags in the vaccination app and people making wrong entries also added to the problems. Many got the message of having received the vaccine despite not getting it. Many who did not get the vaccine received the message about having got one. People also faced issues in downloading the vaccination certificates from the links provided in the messages. “The drive is a massive one and will take a while in getting things streamlined. Presently, most of our centres catering to the 45+ age category are also functioning so that there is no inconvenience to anyone,” said VMC’s medical officer (health) Dr Devesh Patel. Patel said that presently there was sufficient stock of vaccines. He added that a review of all the vaccination centres will be done to come at an estimate regarding number of people getting vaccinated at a particular centre so as to streamlines the distribution of the injections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/vaccination-for-18-begins-in-10-districts/articleshow/82346802.cms||---

In fact, Dr Vinay Aggarwal, former president of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) who runs a 50-bedded hospital in east Delhi, is so agitated about the situation that he threatened to die by suicide if the oxygen supply and availability in the city weren’t improved in the next 72 hours.Aggarwal told TOI they were being forced to beg for oxygen cylinders. “I am not able to focus on the treatment of patients. For the past few days, most of my time has been spent running around in search of oxygen cylinders. This is totally dehumanising and difficult for both the patients, who are dependent on uninterrupted supply of oxygen for survival, and the medical staff who aim to save lives,” said Aggarwal.Dr Narin Sehgal, medical director of Sehgal Neo Hospital in Paschim Vihar, had a similar plaint. He said that the scarcity of oxygen crisis hitting the patients hard. “All our time is spent running around for oxygen cylinders,” Sehgal added.Almost a fortnight after the oxygen crisis began, hospitals in Delhi were in no better situation on Saturday. Uncertainty in supply and confusion created by designated vendors being changed without prior information have been the major reasons for the pressure situation of the past few days. Batra Hospital, which had been constantly flirting with disaster in taking care of 326 patients, ran out of oxygen supply on Saturday, leading to the death of 12 patients, including an in-house doctor. Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital in east Delhi ran out of liquid oxygen around 7.30pm on Saturday. The Delhi government hospital has around 350 Covid patients and while awaiting replenishments, the authorities managed things by reducing the oxygen pressure. The hospital eventually received two metric tonnes of the oxygen. Another Delhi government hospital, Guru Teg Bahadur, also had just an hour and half of oxygen stock left around 7pm on Saturday. With 400 patients to look after, the hospital made several SOS calls. Around 8.38pm, the medical centre received oxygen enough for it to go on for nine hours. Sant Parmanand Hospital also sent an SOS at 3.08pm, tweeting, “We are facing extreme shortage of oxygen at Sant Parmanand Hospital, New Delhi. You are risking the lives of 80 patients.”Indian Spinal Injuries Centre’s woes continued on Saturday. “We are struggling by the hour because our vendor is saying he has some problems and can’t supply oxygen,” said a doctor. “Around noon, we had only six hours of supply. Refilling cylinders is a time-consuming exercise. We can’t even sleep because every hour we panic at the thought of new oxygen stocks not reaching us.”Admission of patients at Fortis Hospital in Vasant Kunj was halted with just four hours of oxygen left around 3pm. The hospital has over 106 Covid patients on oxygen support. Delhi Police stepped in to create a green corridor so a truck of gas could be hurried to the hospital by 6pm. Other hospitals, such as Bhagat Hospital in southwest Delhi’s Dwarka, also issued mayday signals during the day. At 4.30pm, Bhagat Hospital had only half an hour’s supply. The medical director said a replenishment had been ordered, but hadn’t reached the institute. The hospital has 68 patients on oxygen support and five on ventilator.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/oxygen-crisis-still-on-situation-is-totally-dehumanising-says-doctor/articleshow/82347727.cms||---

A senior officer said that if the apex court allows the state to handle the dumps, then mining activities can resume soon to some extent. The officer said that the SC has directed the mines department in one of the Goa Foundation cases to approach the court after dump handling policy is prepared by the monitoring committee. “We have filed an affidavit in the apex court to list the matter for hearing,” the senior officer said. In January 2020, state had filed an application based on the SC-appointed central empowered committee (CEC) report on dump handling. The CEC had recommended that the SC order directing the state government not to carry out extraction of overburdened dumps outside approved mining lease areas till an environmentally sustainable scheme of mining for the removal of minerals from overburdened dumps was prepared. This scheme, the CEC said, would have to be considered along with relevant information regarding the ownership of the dumps and realistic assessment regarding mineral available (grade-wise) in such dumps. It would then have to be approved by the statutory authority. The state government is trying to restart the mining activities but has not been able to restart for the last three years. It even decided to form a Goa mining corporation to restart mining activities by opening new mines in the state. The Goa Mining Corporation “will be functional before May 30”, chief minister Pramod Sawant had said. The deadline was fixed at a meeting held with secretaries to discuss the implementation of the budget. There has been no mining activity in Goa since March 15, 2018, after the Supreme Court quashed the second renewal of 88 mining leases. The state government had filed a review petition on February 7, 2018, in the apex court against the same order. When Sawant met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in March 2020, he had requested the PM to direct the authorities to file an affidavit before the Supreme Court in support of resumption of mining activities in the state. Two mining companies had approached the apex court for extension of leases till 2037.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mining-dept-urges-apex-court-to-list-dump-handling-case/articleshow/82348178.cms||---

Speaking to the media on Saturday, Singhal said that in the initial days, patients had no option other than getting admitted to hospitals. “But now, triaging has been done for Covid-19 patients at the Covid Care Centres being operated to treat mild cases. Based on the symptoms, diagnostics and severity of cases, they would be either referred to hospitals or retained at the Covid Care Centres. Discharges have already started at the hospitals and the health department anticipates that the bed availability situation at the hospitals would be streamlined in the next few days,” said Singhal. “The doctors registered at the 104 call centre for tele-consultation would extend their services to the patients who have opted for home isolation from Saturday evening. As many as 2,668 doctors are offering their services through the call centre. With the increased availability of doctors, the health department has decided to offer services to the patients in home isolation. These doctors would call the patients on a regular basis and would provide guidance on treatment. About 89,000 patients are in home isolation as of Saturday,” said Singhal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/bed-availability-at-hosps-likely-to-improve-soon/articleshow/82347063.cms||---

State health minister Alla Kali Krishna Srinivas (Nani) said that the government is taking steps to bring 120 MT (metric tonnes) of oxygen from Angul in Odisha. The health minister further said that there is no dearth of Remdesivir injections in government hospitals and the government is ready to provide injections to private hospital indents given by doctors. While conducting a review meet on Covid-19 containment and vaccination strategy in Kakinada, the health minister stressed on the need for a strict action plan. He said that chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy regards the ‘104 call centres’ as a crucial system in dealing with the pandemic and directed district authorities to appoint 50 staff in shifts at 104 call centres in Kakinada. The minister stressed on the need to obtain Covid-19 test results within 24 hours and pushed for increasing the speed of conducting RT-PCR tests along with starting TruNat tests to meet rising demand. He further called upon the district administration to increase bed capacity at hospitals and Covid care centres in all revenue divisions. Alla Nani further said closed circuit cameras should be set up in every Covid hospital and a nodal officer, medical officer or hospital superintendent should ensure oxygen is not wasted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/ap-to-bring-120-mt-of-oxygen-from-odisha/articleshow/82347115.cms||Samson Raj

Except a few theatres, the rapid rise in Covid-19 cases saw most theatres downing shutters from April 23. For around 2,000 film theatres, including single screen and multiplex, in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, the future is bleak with few chances of resuming business till August. With no new releases slated in the next few months, managements are once again left with no option but to pay salaries to the over two lakh employees dependent on the industry. “The industry will not get a chance to revive fully. We can only revive 50 per cent in future because many big heroes and producers are now opting for OTT (over the top) platforms. This would definitely ruin the industry as audiences would not come to the theatres in future,” Telugu Film Chamber of Commerce vice-president P Samba Moorthy said. While the governments of both states had given theatres the green signal to reopen last October, revival was slow and many resumed business only in December 2020. “We screened movies for only four months. Each theatre incurred a loss of Rs 3 lakh to Rs 5 lakh every month,” Sri Melody theatre owner Ramana said. Over 1,150 single screens and multiplexes in AP and another 850 theatres and multiplex in Telangana lost an income of Rs 400 crore last year, Samba Moorthy said. Nor has there been any relief in property tax or electricity bills, managements said, even after the governments announced a few measures that are yet to be implemented. “Each theatre has to pay a minimum of Rs 2 lakh power bills and salaries and other maintenance expenses,” a theatre owner said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/curtains-fall-again-on-theatres-in-ap-t/articleshow/82347098.cms||Siva G

So far, there were five incidents of cops and NGOs conducting final rites for the abandoned bodies of Covid-19 victims between March and April. During the same period last year, several instances of abandonment, refusal to allow bodies in crematoriums, burial grounds had taken place. On April 17, family members and villagers refused to take the body of a Covid-19 victim in Nagayalanka area in Krishna district. Avanigadda circle inspector BB Ravikumar and Nagayalanka sub-inspector K Srinivas took it upon themselves to conduct the final rites for the deceased woman with the help of local activists. On July 27, 2020 a 62-year-old woman committed suicide by jumping into the Krishna river after her relatives abandoned her suspecting that she could have contracted Covid-19. The same Nagayalanka cops conducted the last rites for both the elderly woman and her son. According to sources in Vijayawada Government General Hospital (GGH), it has been a common sight to find kin shying away from conducting funerals for the patients. “We have a growing number of unclaimed bodies of Covid-19 patients lying in the mortuary. Some of them blatantly don’t pick our calls or just refuse to come,” a senior police official told STOI. The scenario remains the same in Guntur, Vizag, Vizianagaram and government hospitals as well. Owing to the pandemic, funerals are a low-key affair but may not be a cheap one. At Nellore Government General Hospital, a group of youngsters stand ready near the mortuary offering the service of conducting final rites to Covid victims at an exorbitant rate. The usual price to conduct a funeral is Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000. However, youngsters charge anywhere between Rs 20,000 to Rs 30,000. On April 21, a house owner in West Godavari forced an 80-year-old woman out of his house after suspecting that she might have contracted Covid-19. The woman and her two sons spent two days in the crematorium and after cops learnt about the apathy, interfered and gave a warning to the landlord and ensured she was taken back.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/families-abandon-kins-bodies-as-covid-stigma-returns/articleshow/82347135.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti
---||Delhi||Oxygen langars — celebrations with healing touch at Delhi Gurdwaras||NEW DELHI: Celebrations for Gurpurab on Saturday, the 400th Prakash Parv of Guru Teg Bahadur on Saturday, were relatively muted across the gurdwaras of Delhi. But in the spirit of service, select gurdwaras organised ‘oxygen langar’ by creating facilities on the gurdwara premises for people to walk in and utilise the oxygen on offer for free. While the usual rush of devotees was missing, food was also prepared in the langars, but this was for distribution among homes of the needy and Covid-affected. Manjinder Singh Sirsa, president, Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC), said that with the congregation of devotees not allowed due to Covid, the focus was on ensuring people on the streets didn’t go without food or without a bed. Sirsa said a 250-bedded Covid-care facility with 100 oxygen concentrators had been set up at Gurdwara Rakabganj Sahib, which is likely to become operational in the next two days. “The oxygen langar at Gurdwara Damdama Sahib was started to provide the gas to people in dire need of it. However, we have now identified gurdwaras where a proper bedded facility can be created. We have already set one up at Gurdwara Rakabganj Sahib and aim to set up others at Gurdwara Damdama Sahib and Bala Sahib as well,” added Sirsa. Maninder Singh Chaddha, 55, who visited Gurdwara Damdama Sahib for oxygen on Saturday, said people should stay indoors at a time such as this and only those requiring medical assistance should set out from their homes. “This is how Gurpurab should be celebrated this year. I also pray things will improve soon,” Chaddha added. Other smaller gurdwaras, including the Singh Sabha Gurdwaras in Indirapuram and Model Town, also pitched in, providing oxygen langar and cylinder refills along with NGOs and student volunteers. While the Indirapuram gurdwara set up the gas langar with the assistance of NGO Khalsa Help International, students and activists are collaborating at Model Town. Suraj Sardana, a volunteer at the Model Town oxygen langar, said around 500 oxygen cylinders are being refilled each day. “We are doing it free of cost on behalf of the gurdwara and everyone else involved,” said Sardana. We require details such as the name of the patient, the Aadhaar details and a doctor’s prescription on oxygen requirement. Once these are provided, people can get an oxygen refill on the spot.” The contact number for service is 9999094167. While oxygen refills were earlier being offered at the gurdwara in Greater Kailash I, Sirsa said this was halted to prevent crowding. “We don’t want temporary arrangements, so we are setting up proper centres in gurdwaras where people can be treated as well,” he said. At the major gurdwaras, including Bangla Sahib and Sisganj Sahib, which Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited on Saturday for Gurpurab, the langars prepared food for distribution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/o2-langars-celebrations-with-healing-touch-at-gurdwaras/articleshow/82347720.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok
---||Patna||Former BJP MLC wants 15-day lockdown in state||PATNA: Yet another BJP leader has demanded 15-day lockdown in the state to curb the unprecedented rise in Covid cases during the second wave of the pandemic. BJP’s former MLC Krishna Kumar Singh said on Sunday that a fortnight lockdown was need of the hour as the deadly virus is spreading in rural areas rapidly. “If lockdown is not imposed, the situation will aggravate in the days to come,” he said in a statement. The former lawmaker from Gaya said even members of the trading community now favoured complete lockdown to check the spread of the pandemic. “The cases will drastically drop once the movement of people is completely restricted,” he opined. Expressing his dissatisfaction over the night curfew imposed by the state government, the BJP leader said it was not sufficient as the virus has gripped major parts of the state. “Under such circumstances, lockdown appears to be the only solution,” he asserted. Singh’s statement came a few days after a similar demand was made by BJP MLA from Aurai Ram Surat Kumar. Kumar, who is the revenue and land reforms department minister, had urged CM Nitish Kumar to impose lockdown to save the lives of the people. BJP state president Dr Sanjay Jaiswal had also described the night curfew as inefficient to handle the situation. Another BJP minister in the Nitish cabinet, Samrat Choudhary, defended the state BJP chief and said more restrictions were required to bring the situation under control. JD(U), which is a coalition partner in the state government, however, said CM Nitish was reviewing the situation on a regular basis. “The CM is very sensitive towards the issue. The state administration has taken adequate steps for the purpose,” JD(U) spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan Prasad said. The government has ordered closure of all shops by 4pm, except those dealing in drugs. The assembly of people in wedding ceremonies and funerals has been reduced from 100 to 50 and from 50 to 20, respectively as a precautionary measure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/former-bjp-mlc-wants-15-day-lockdown-in-state/articleshow/82359931.cms||Ramashankar

Despite our best attempts, we could not arrange for oxygen or hospital bed for her when she turned critical. The loss motivated us to ensure that all our nears and dears get vaccinated. It would at least save patients from turning critical,” said Turakhiya, who got vaccinated with four family members. As the pandemic rages on in the state, Gujarat witnessed high turnout for vaccination in the 18 plus category with 55,235 persons turning up for the jab against projection of 60,000, giving 92% vaccination on the first day. While several could not book slots, some could not find their names in the list at the booth. But overall, the inoculation went smooth in 10 selected districts, said state health department officials. But as the state has rolled out phase IV of the vaccination, analysis of the data available on CoWIN portal shows that 1 crore from Gujarat have got the first shot (as the state health department figure showed 98.11 lakh), covering one-sixth or 16.7% of the population if one takes the base of 2011 Census. But the spread of vaccination is not uniform –Porbandar administered 1.42 lakh first doses against a population of 5.85 lakh, giving 24.4% coverage, whereas Surendranagar only covered 8.2% of population (1.43 lakh first doses for the population of 17.56 lakh). In fact, more than a quarter (26%) of the shots were administered in the eight municipal corporations with Ahmedabad and Surat cities recording 9.38 lakh and 7.64 lakh vaccinations so far. The analysis also showed that Gujarat has used Covishield as its primary vaccine with over 90% getting the vaccine, as only 9.8% got Covaxin. The sex ratio of the recipients was 53% men and 47% women. “The vaccination has gained steam in the third phase and we have got very good responses from both urban and rural areas. There is rise in awareness and amid rise in cases, people see it as a sure-shot way to remain safe,” said Dr Nayan Jani, state immunization officer. “We are hopeful of higher participation in the fourth phase as all districts will ramp up the drive.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/17-of-state-popn-inoculated-55k-take-shot-on-day-1-of-18-drive/articleshow/82347651.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: A woman’s Covid struggle — preemie twins in NICU, husband critical||AHMEDABAD: The Covid-19 pandemic has unleashed unprecedented hardships of disease and struggle in the state. In such times, imagine the travails of a coronavirus positive, first time mother, whose premature twins are admitted in neonatal ICU while the husband is gasping for breath with virus-related complications. Chandkheda-resident Krupa Sheth has valiantly fought a long-drawn battle this pandemic which included calling all the numbers in her phone contact list to arrange for an oxygen bed for her husband Krunal who developed Covid-19 complications and waiting for 108 ambulance for 58 long hours. All this while she herself was recovering from Covid and her premature twins-- a boy and a girl born at six months and 10 days gestation, fought their own survival battles! The twins delivered on March 1 and weighed only 910 gms and 844 gms at birth and underwent extensive critical care. “When God gives you hardships, he also gives you strength. My husband and I live alone and the past three months which included me being hospitalized for the month of February before premature delivery on March 1, kids being hospitalized in NICU and then both of us turning Covid positive on April 10. All of us have fought a life and death battle and finally look forward to uniting as a family at home in the next few days,” says Krupa. Her husband Krunal, who was put on Bipap-ventilator, was discharged two days ago and together the couple is looking forward to bringing their twin bundle of joy home. Leading neonatologist Dr Ashish Mehta said that the current Covid surge has led to many premature babies recovering alone, without the healing touch of loving parents and Kangaroo Mother Care, as couples test positive and are forbidden from coming to the neonatal hospital. “We make video-calls from the NICU and help them connect to the new-borns. This keeps them going,” said Dr Mehta. Krupa says that her husband used to give maximum KMC to their son and she was aghast to see his oxygen levels drop when the father was hospitalized. “Even during all the struggles with Covid-19, the twice a day video call to see the kids kept me going. I hope Covid ends soon,” says the hopeful mother who wants to put the health and financial crisis triggered by lengthy hospitalizations behind her.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/a-womans-covid-struggle-preemie-twins-in-nicu-husband-critical/articleshow/82347666.cms||Radha Sharma
---||Visakhapatnam||Daily O2 demand surpasses state’s first phase numbers||VISAKHAPATNAM: Andhra Pradesh had 1.03 lakh active cases at the peak of the first wave on September 2 last year. Only some 1,600 critical cases had then required ICU facility, while some 7,000 patients were treated with supplemental oxygen. But of the nearly 1.3 lakh active cases as of Saturday, about 3,900 patients are receiving intensive care and 13,300 patients are on oxygen beds. This might also be the reason for the state’s daily oxygen demand surpassing the first phase numbers. The peak liquid medical oxygen demand during the first wave was only 260 metric tonnes a day, and that too this peak quantum was used for only two to three days. But with the increasing clamour for oxygen supplies across the country, Andhra Pradesh is already utilising about 420 to 430 metric tonnes of oxygen for the last one week. According to the state officials, the quota of medical oxygen allocated to Andhra Pradesh by the Union government is some 470 metric tonnes a day. However, logistics have emerged as the biggest bottleneck in the transportation of oxygen as there are a limited number of cryogenic oxygen tankers in the state. Moreover, several hospitals have not been equipped to store or centrally supply oxygen. And hospitals have never been prepared to handle such huge quantities of oxygen before this pandemic. The three medical oxygen production units of Andhra Pradesh, including the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (RINL), are located in north-coastal AP. For instance, if a hospital in Guntur requires oxygen, it has to be transported from Visakhapatnam. Apart from local supplies, the state is procuring oxygen from Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Odisha. The Rayalaseema districts are dependent on oxygen supplies from Chennai. The AP industries department has reactivated four defunct units producing gaseous oxygen in the last few days to tide over the situation. These units located in Guntur, Anantapur, Kadapa and Krishna can produce 20 tonnes of gaseous oxygen suitable for short duration transportation. The department is also in the process of getting about 26 tonnes of oxygen from other industries in Visakhapatnam, Nellore, Guntur and Anantapur. Principal secretary, health and family welfare department, Anil Kumar Singhal, said that constant monitoring of oxygen supplies and consumption is needed to ensure optimum and rationalised utilisation of oxygen at various hospitals. “Andhra Pradesh has requested the Union government to increase its quota of medical oxygen. The health department is exploring options to purchase more cryogenic tankers to improve logistics,” said Singhal. The Union government recently decided to divert liquefied natural gas tankers for transportation of medical oxygen. Two such tankers have been allocated to Andhra Pradesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/daily-o2-demand-surpasses-states-first-phase-numbers/articleshow/82346922.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Ahmedabad||Midnight horror: 18 killed in Bharuch Covid hospital blaze||Bharuch/Surat: At least 18 people — 16 coronavirus patients and two intern nurses — perished in a massive fire that broke out in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a Covid-19 hospital run by a private trust in the industrial town of Bharuch after Friday midnight. While some of them got charred to death, others died of severe asphyxiation caused by smoke when the fire was sparked at around 12:40am in Welfare Hospital on Bharuch-Jambusar Road. Dipak Makhijani, regional fire officer, said the hospital did not have a fire NOC. “The first responders from the hospital said in their statements that the fire started from the ventilators, so we suspect that there could have been a spark in the machine which started the fire,” Makhijani told TOI. The hospital run by Bombay Welfare Trust has been functional since 1995, but the building where the accident occurred was unused and refurbished last year for Covid-19 treatment. Chief Minister Vijay Rupani ordered an inquiry by two senior IAS officers — additional chief secretary, labour and employment, Vipul Mittra and commissioner of municipalities, Raj Kumar Beniwal. There were 57 Covid-19 patients in all, including 23 in the general ward and 12 each in two ICUs. Forty-one patients were shifted to various other hospitals in Bharuch and nearby towns. Policemen broke the glass windows of the building and brought out seven to eight patients. Bharuch district superintendent of police (SP) Rajendrasinh Chudasama said, “It took nearly 90 minutes for the fire brigade teams to bring the flames under control. Many locals from near-by areas rushed to the spot and helped shift other patients to different hospitals.” Barring one from Vadodara’s Karjan taluka, all victims were residents of Bharuch and Ankleshwar. Eleven of the deceased were women. Sarfaraz Patel, a resident of the Jambusar Chowkdi area said, “It was a horrific sight. Many locals who rushed for help broke open the glass doors and windows and brought out many patients. But some of them died.” The rescue operation was also affected due to a sudden power failure in the entire hospital premises while the main oxygen supply line was also damaged. Meanwhile, a team of state-run power distribution company Dakshin Gujarat Vij Company Ltd (DGVCL), fire department, police and forensic teams have initiated a detailed investigation into the cause of fire. Nurses were interns The blaze snuffed out the lives of two young nurses — Madhvi Padhiyar of Bharuch and Fariga Khatun from Ankleshwar. The 19-year-olds were working as trainee nurses in the hospital. As Fariga’s PPE caught fire, Madhvi tried to save her, but her kit was also caught in the flames. They ran towards the bathroom to douse the fire with water, but it was too late. Rs 4L compensation Expressing grief at the tragedy, chief minister Vijay Rupani announced a compensation of Rs 4 lakh each to the relatives of each victim. The compensation will be given from the CM Relief Fund.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/midnight-horror-18-killed-in-bharuch-covid-hospital-blaze/articleshow/82347683.cms||Jay Pachchigar
---||Ahmedabad||Gir sanctuary, nat’l parks, zoos closed amid corona surge||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat forest department on Saturday ordered shutdown of the Gir lion sanctuary among other wildlife tourist attractions across the state till further notice. This follows an advisory issued by the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) — as reported by TOI earlier — to close for public all national parks, sanctuaries and zoos in the country with immediate effect due to the alarming spread of Covid-19 cases. The order also mentions that there have been reports of some lions dying due to the virus, due to which the ministry feels that coronavirus also poses a major threat to animals living in these spaces. Principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife) Shyamal TIkedar said, “Following detection of virus in lions in Hyderabad zoo, MoEFCC officials convened a meeting on Saturday wherein the possibility of spread of coronavirus from humans to animals and vice versa was expressed. Therefore, they have asked all the skilled staff to be tested for Covid-19 before they are allowed to work in the sanctuary,” said Tikedar. The Gujarat PCCF said that following the central government directive, all the wildlife sanctuaries, national parks and zoos across the state will be closed for public from Sunday onwards. It needs mention that the Gir sanctuary was open to tourists from October 2020 and has been witnessing an average 40 tourist vehicles going inside the sanctuary on a daily basis. This will end from Sunday. “We have been asked to form a taskforce consisting of field managers, veterinary doctors and frontline staff for surveillance of animal health and keep a strict vigil for any virus-like symptoms,” said a senior forest official. A round-the-clock control control will also be set to pick up early signs of any viral outbreak and administer emergency isolation and treatment to prevent spread of the virus. It needs mention that Gir lions have been under viral attack for the past few years now. In 2019, 34 lions had died due to outbreak of Canine Distemper Virus (CDV) and babesiosis. The order by MoEFCC order dated April 30 states: “There are reports of transmission from both symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers (human beings) of the disease and COVID-19 affected persons may or may not exhibit symptoms, field functionaries must be COVID-19 negative when they are deputed for duty and should follow COVID appropriate behavior such as maintaining social distancing, wearing of masks, proper screening, regular sanitization etc,” the order mentions. The order advises officials to set up essential services for emergency treatment of animals and their safe release back to their natural habitats, as and when required.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gir-sanctuary-natl-parks-zoos-closed-amid-corona-surge/articleshow/82347688.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The process for purchasing the vaccines for the age group has begun and it will take some time for them to reach the state, he said. “Hence, the people in the 18-45 age group should not rush to vaccination centres from tomorrow. At present, the state is conducting the vaccination drive for individuals above 45 years and it is intending to complete the inoculation drive before May 30,” the chief minister said. The third phase of the vaccination drive for those in the 18-45 age group was to have started from Saturday. In Kerala, so far 74 lakh vaccines have been administered till date, which include the second dose as well. Even though the government had set the target to complete the vaccination of individuals above 45 years before May 30, the state has not achieved even 50% of it due to shortage of vaccine doses, the chief minister said, adding that the Union government should take immediate steps to provide vaccines to the state. The chief minister also urged the leaders and workers of all political parties to maintain strict vigil on the counting day and to avoid all kinds of celebrations. He also requested the candidates not to encourage gathering of people or hold victory processions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/vax-shortage-will-delay-jabs-for-18-plus-says-cm/articleshow/82347461.cms||---

The cremation ghats of the city including the three important ghats, namely Rasulabad, Daraganj and Phaphamau are witnessing a record number of bodies that are being cremated every day. The situation is no better at PMC in terms of people applying for death certificate of their dear ones they have lost to the deadly virus. The number of people approaching the zonal offices of PMC, which are located at different localities or those coming to PMC main office at Civil Lines speak volumes of the destruction caused by the pandemic. According to PMC sources, in the month of April 2020, a total of 229 people had applied for death certificate of their relatives. However for the same month this year, the PMC and its zonal offices have receive 734 registration for death certificates. The number is almost three times as compared to last year. This figure does not include the number of death certificates of those which are handed over by the government hospitals. “As per the record collected by PMC from April 1 to 27, the number of bodies cremated at the electric crematorium of Daraganj were around 400, excluding around 20 unclaimed bodies”, said MC Pandey of PMC. Likewise, at Shankarghat electric crematorium, 130 bodies were cremated. These numbers are far from the average that these electric crematoriums cremated few months back, he added. At Daraganj ghat, 350 bodies were cremated between April 1 to April 16. Likewise, at Rasulabad ghat, everyday around 50-60 bodies are being brought for cremation. The numbers at Phaphamau are around 30. “This ghat also caters to those coming from Pratapgarh and Jaunpur and there has been an increase in the number of bodies coming these days,” said the local priest, Shanu Tiwari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/applications-for-death-certificate-grow-manifold-after-covid-19-ravages-lives/articleshow/82347857.cms||---

Cops entered the house in full PPE kits and following all Covid-19 protocol and recovered the bodies. DCP, Central zone, Somen Barma said the bodies have been sent for post-mortem examination. “We have given permission for following of medical protocol in the case so the exact cause of death can be ascertained,” Barma said. “The woman, Ranjana Goel, has been admitted to the hospital.

There were no indications of any struggle or attack,” Sinha added. The officer said the neighbours told police that Kashish was mentally challenged while his father was unwell for the last many days. “They had stopped venturing out for the last 4-5 days,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/decomposed-bodies-of-elderly-man-son-found/articleshow/82348177.cms||---

The centre was ready some time back, but its opening had got delayed due to oxygen shortage. Ashram authorities say they have made preparations for 1,000 beds. “We have made all preparations, including beds, food supply, etc. Medical staff, oxygen and equipment will be provided by Delhi government. Initially, 500 beds will be made operational and the number will be ramped to 1,000,” an ashram official said.“The site was used for weekly satsang congregations before the pandemic struck. It will now be used to save the lives of people of Delhi,” the official added. Jain said that he visited the 1,000-bedded centre in Burari on Saturday evening where he met doctors and ensured preparedness to tackle the situation. More centres are coming up in the city, which has been hit hard by the pandemic’s fourth wave. Manjinder Sirsa, who heads Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management committee, said that they were also setting up a 250-bed Covid care centre with 100 oxygen concentrators. “It will soon be operational at Bhai Lakhi Shah Vanjara Hall in Gurdwara Rakab Ganj,” he added.Jain has also announced that a 100-bed extension of Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital is being developed in Rohini by Rotary Club. “Together, we will defeat this pandemic,” he said. Member of Parliament Vivek Tankha tweeted that the project is estimated to take four weeks.Dr Navneet Kumar Goel, who is the medical director of BSA Hospital, in a letter to Rotary International, stated that the hospital would run the facility while the club would provide infrastructure on the allocated space. “BSA Hospital intends to use this facility for the next five years or till the pandemic lasts. Rotary will construct a liveable structure in one month,” the letter states.The project will also include development of an oxygen plant and biomedical waste management system.While several new Covid-19 care centres are coming up in the capital, most of them have been affected by oxygen shortage. TOI had earlier reported how Sardar Patel Covid Care Centre in Radha Soami Satsang Beas Ashram in Chhatarpur was operating at low capacity due to oxygen shortage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ashram-care-centre-to-open-tomorrow-in-burari-more-planned/articleshow/82347732.cms||Paras Singh

Meanwhile, the district administration has intensified the surveillance at border checkposts in Idukki to prevent the spread of Covid-19 in the district. Officials are inspecting vehicles at Bodimettu, Cumbumettu, Chinnar and Kumily checkposts in the district. Devikulam sub-collector S Premkrishnan said that the inspection would continue at the checkposts and at Munnar. “The number of cases is increasing in the district everyday and it is not a good sign.

---||Delhi||After losing a dear one, a long wait for funeral||New Delhi: The tattered infrastructure has robbed even the dead of dignity, with the last journey of those claimed by Covid-19 filled with humiliation. Chandan Kumar knows it only too well. It took him four days and daily visits to get his uncle’s body from AIIMS to the Green Park cremation ground. “From morning to evening, we were made to sit in the mortuary at AIIMS. We were told the body would be released but nothing happened. I hope no one else suffers the misery that I have gone through,” said the distraught Kumar.Poor coordination between cremation facilities and the linked hospitals is putting the kin of corona victims to much suffering. Families complain of the final rites being delayed by 3-4 days. They pointed out that arranging private vehicles to carry the body of their relative to the crematoriums is of little use, with funeral facility management often not allowing them entry, citing official regulations. Yet, the hospitals are unable to provide hearses or ambulances to ferry the bodies. Raj Kumar’s wife passed away in AIIMS Trauma Centre, but he couldn’t get the body cremated for three days. “We are told to come the following day every time we went to get the body,” said Raj Kumar. “There is no system for releasing bodies for cremation.” Similarly, a man said he was able to get his brother’s body only three days after his death on April 26. He alleged, “The poor are being made to suffer because we saw other bodies being released. I was told the hearse had time slots at 8am, 12 noon and 3pm, but people with people get preference.”The shortage of hearse vans is a big factor behind the slowness in releasing bodies by hospitals. Chandan Kumar said hospitals suggest the use of private hearses. “But if people transport the body in a private van, the Green Park crematorium staff inform us that bodies arriving in such vehicles will not be accepted,” he revealed. “They only cremate bodies coming in government or hospital vehicles. We approached the police, but got no redress.”Several such complaints about the conflict in rules have surfaced now. An official at the Green Park facility admitted that the district authorities had indeed ordered acceptance of bodies brought only by hospital ambulances or hearses. A municipal official explained. “This year, the daily toll is very high. Each hospital is linked with a cremation ground and the bodies released for cremation regulated to prevent overcrowding at any particular site. That is why private vehicles are not allowed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/after-losing-a-dear-one-a-long-wait-for-funeral/articleshow/82347739.cms||Paras Singh

The Sikh guru is respected for his bravery and supreme sacrifice. Known as ‘Hind Di Chadar’ (Shield of India), he was the leader of the Sikhs from 1665 to 1675 when he was beheaded by the order of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. Gurdwara Yahiyaganj, believed to be the site where the Guru stayed in the 17th century during his visit to Lucknow, Sukhamani Sahib paath (prayer of peace), followed by a petal shower on the holy Guru Granth Sahib. Five devotees at a time entered the gurdwara while adhering to Covid-19 protocol. Those who couldn’t visit the gurdwara, watched online live-streaming. Packed langar was distributed among the devotees. Gurdwara Naka Hindola marked the day with paath and kirtan. President of Lucknow Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee, Rajendra Singh Bagga, said: “Though the gurdwaras are open for the public, the devotees should not overcrowd any religious place and follow Covid protocol. Even while staying at home they should meditate and pray to the gurus.” The gyani (a learned person in Sikh religion who leads the congregation in prayers) in the gurdwara shed light on the life of the Sikh guru, his valour, and his teachings, followed by distribution of packed langar and honouring the devotees who have been involved in sewa (selfless service). While Gurdwara Sadar remained closed, live streaming of paath and shabad kirtan was done on Facebook.

---||Kochi||Kerala: Church urges faithful to donate blood before jabs||KOCHI: Joseph Mar Gregorios, the metropolitan trustee of the Jacobite Church, has written to parishes urging the churchgoers to make arrangements for donating blood ahead of taking vaccinations. He has urged various organizations within the church to coordinate the drive. “At a time when the spread of the disease is getting worse, the children of God should work with a sense of utmost social responsibility. We should plan schemes, centred around the church, to protect families affected by Covid and to get them avoid being stranded without help. Works, including arranging medicines, ambulances, food for the infected and generally checking their wellbeing, should be done with carefulness,” mar Gregorios said in a circular. The bishop added that all parishes and churchgoers should donate generously to the chief minister’s ‘vaccine challenge’. “Priests who have any symptoms should inform the same to the concerned diocese and make alternative arrangements. Those who assist in churches should ensure proper mask compliance in situations like the preparation of the bread for communion,” the statement said. The circular also provides clarity on the protocol to be followed during funerals of those who died due to Covid. “In locations, where there is permission to bury the body at the church cemetery, the body should be brought in an ambulance to the church compound with the permission of health authorities and as per their directions. Primary rituals should be conducted, keeping the body in the ambulance itself, maintaining proper distance. Later, the burial can be done with the priest and others wearing PPE kits. In situations, where there is a need for cremation, it is permitted to keep the remains at the church, conduct ceremonies and then bury it at the cemetery,” the circular said. Mar Gergorios urged the churchgoers to go forward with care, faith and prayers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/church-urges-faithful-to-donate-blood-before-jabs/articleshow/82347476.cms||---

---||Mumbai||US travel ban exemption has Mumbai students relieved||MUMBAI: Jamnabai Narsee’s Vian Jain who is to join Syracuse University for mechanical engineering in the Fall of 2021 heaved a sigh of relief on learning the travel ban from India had exempted students.  Like him, thousands of other candidates were comforted when they read the fresh travel policy put out by the US department of state on Friday. The psychological boost came at a time when prospective freshmen are in the process of finalising their admits and making deposits to universities before they can get their crucial i-20, needed to apply for a visa. On Friday, the US reviewed its travel policy and suspended entry into their country for non-immigrants who were physically present in India during the 14-day period preceding their entry or attempted entry into the country. “Students seeking to commence studies in the fall, certain academics, journalists and individuals who provide critical infrastructure support in countries affected by a geographic Covid-19 restriction may qualify for a National Interest Exception,” read the presser issued by the US department of state. The rising Covid cases in India had also seen the UK refuse entry to those who departed or transited from India from April 23, but excluded students from the ban. Indian students who have been booking visa appointments under the emergency category (national interest exception) have been able to get appointment slots, said consultant Pratibha Jain. It is between April 30-May 30 when most students finalise their university from the offers received and pay their admission deposits. “Some post-graduate students have received an i-20 and have been looking forward to applying for their visas,” said Jain. Students with valid F-1 and M-1 visas intending to begin or continue an academic program commencing August 1, 2021, or later do not need to contact an embassy or consulate to seek an individual NIE to travel. The travel policy stated these candidates may enter the US not before 30 days prior to the start of their studies. And those seeking to apply for new F-1 or M-1 visas would need to check the status of visa services at the nearest embassy or consulate. Education consultant Karan Gupta said students planning to join summer schools in the US in May are not likely to be permitted entry. “Our students are happy to fly out this year for Fall 2021 as the US has had an exhaustive vaccination drive and many universities are also willing to vaccinate students on arrival, if required. Most universities have also informed students that classes will be held in person,” Gupta added. Although US consulates across India remain shut till May 15, a few students who have received their i-20 have been applying for appointments under the emergency category. “The pandemic continues to limit the number of visas our embassies and consulates abroad are able to process. As always, visa applicants should check the website of the nearest embassy or consulate for the most up-to-date information about visa appointment availability,” the presser added. For those like Jain with an i-20 and a ready visa application, though, it is just a matter of time till the visa window opens.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/us-travel-ban-exemption-has-mumbai-city-students-relieved/articleshow/82347475.cms||---
---||Delhi||No 02 for hosps; clandestine sales are on, say kin of dead||New Delhi: Grieving kin of Covid-19 patients who died for want of oxygen in south Delhi’s Batra Hospital on Friday demanded that the authorities crack down on the sale of the gas in the black market. “People are dying due to lack of oxygen and people are selling cylinders clandestinely for Rs 50,000-70,000,” alleged an indignant man who had lost his aunt. “Meanwhile, the hospitals on which we are dependent are unable to get oxygen or have cylinders refilled because the suppliers are hoarding the gas. Selling of cylinders in the black market should stop immediately stop and those indulging in it booked for murder.”TOI was able to speak to some of the families of the 12 individuals who lost their lives at Batra Hospital. Most stressed that all politics should be eschewed and the official focus should be on saving people's lives. “The central and state governments had a year to prepare for this, but we are losing hundreds every day,” one of them said. Saurabh, whose mother-in-law, Manjula, 68, passed away in the tragedy after she was admitted in the ICU on April 24, said, “I had come for an update on her health but saw some tumult over the oxygen supply. I was walking to the ICU at 2.15pm when I received a call informing me she was no more. If the ICU can’t have a consistent supply of oxygen, what should one do?” There was a call for action from a family of an 85-year-old who died. Vishal, a close aide of the family, told TOI, “People are dying because of the oxygen scarcity and the government isn’t doing much. I don’t wish to get into the nitty gritty of who is at fault, but whether it is the Centre or state, something must be done. We had an entire year to prepare for this. We have lost someone and that person can never come back, but without action more lives will be lost.”Amit was angry at being kept out of the loop. He lost a relative, Prakash Dutt, 62, and claimed they did not know there was an oxygen crisis brewing. “I don’t know if saying this matters now, but if we had known, perhaps we could have arranged a backup,” Amit said. “The doctors and police did all they could. Humans are helping each other, but not the government. Nobody expects anything from the government any longer.” Manik Malhotra lost his 71-year-old father. “He was my mentor, my idol, not only mine, but the entire family’s,” he mourned. “He was in the ICU after admission on April 23. The hospital did its best.” Relatives of those who had died had gathered outside the hospital on Saturday and were angry at oxygen cylinders being sold outside at inflated prices. “Those selling cylinders on the sly should be immediately booked and put behind bars,” said one of the grieving people. “The hospitals are not getting cylinders, while these unscrupulous people are lining their pockets at the expense of suffering people.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-02-for-hosps-clandestine-sales-are-on-say-kin-of-dead/articleshow/82347747.cms||---

In another major decision taken during a review meeting on Saturday, the CM directed authorities to fix the ambulance fares to prevent overcharging by drivers since several complaints had been received regarding the same. During the meeting, the issue of some private hospitals providing inaccurate information about the availability of oxygen beds was also discussed. The CM said that there needs to be complete transparency on the availability of oxygen beds in private as well as government hospitals. He also directed authorities to take feedback from the attendants of the patients. Meanwhile, it was also decided that ASHA workers who are playing a frontline role, would be given an encouragement allowance of Rs 1,000. The district authorities have also been asked to conduct a door-to-door survey for a detailed compilation of records related to Covid-19. The drive would be carried out with the help of ASHA workers and volunteers. Besides, 147 special task force (STF) teams have been constituted in the state to prevent black-marketing or stocking of medicines. The district magistrates have also been asked to take a call on reducing the hours for which shops can remain open in rural areas. CM Rawat said that there is a need to increase the phone lines in the CM Helpline and police call centres. He added that updated information on the availability of beds and injections should be provided to these call centres. The CM also pointed out the need for increasing the number of oxygen cylinders and ensuring uninterrupted power supply to oxygen manufacturing plants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/now-only-25-people-allowed-in-wedding-ceremonies-ambulance-charges-to-be-fixed-amidst-overpricing-plaints/articleshow/82346923.cms||Kautilya Singh

The Margao legislator said that the mix-up over the number of deaths suggests that the government headed by chief minister Pramod Sawant is trying to hide the deaths due to Covid-19 in the state. “The goof-up between 54 deaths and 40 Covid deaths in Goa by the irresponsible BJP government pops up another window of blunder by this insensitive government,” said the Margao MLA. Though DHS said that the mix-up was because of a technical glitch, Kamat said that the government needs to explain why the 14 deaths were not reported on time. “How many times in the past they have done it? Chief minister Pramod Sawant must explain,” said Kamat. “Government is not allowing people to live. Now they play even with those who have passed away.

Right now, a group of over 60 volunteers is running errands for elderly people, who are unable to move around, and the number of volunteers is said to be on the rise. “Taking inspiration from Bengaluru, we have decided to start relief riders to help the elderly. We have cyclists across the city and we try to complete the delivery within 30 minutes after receiving the request,” said Santhana Selvan, bicycle mayor of Hyderabad. adding that the team is growing in number with every passing minute and soon they would have about 150-200 volunteers.

On average, a cyclist is able to take three to four requests per day, they said and added that almost all the cyclists, who are acting as volunteers are working in IT companies in the city. “I received a request from a diabetes patient today for tablets from Balanagar. I went to a medical shop and got the elderly man to talk to the pharmacist so that I won’t get the medicine wrong. As I felt that the person is not financially well off, I have sponsored the tablets,” said Ravi Sambari, a cyclist. He said that he resides in Miyapur and would be able to get medicines for the elderly living within 5 km radius from his residence. Explaining how the team is functioning, Selvan said that when a request is received, it is posted in their internal group, is picked up by the nearest cyclist and the task is completed in the shortest possible time or as per the convenience of the elderly person who made the request. They said that the services are only for those who are not in a position to step out of their houses. Another cyclist, Rahul Soni, said that he delivered a couple of injections to a 75-year-old in Hafeezpet on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cyclists-help-sr-citizens-with-meds-essentials/articleshow/82348229.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

Johnny Pearson who arrived in the state more than a year ago on a short visit, had decided to extend his stay here after the pandemic peaked in the US. With the second wave of Covid-19 tearing through the state Pearson had been trying to get himself vaccinated since January this year but he was allegedly refused the jab as he was a foreign national. Pearson has been staying alone at Vagamon after renewing his visa. When he failed to get the vaccine last Tuesday again, he contacted the embassy officials who informed him that they will make arrangements to provide the vaccine to him. However, Pearson is keen to return to his country as cases have been increasing steadily in Kerala, said a source close to the American citizen.

The Wildlife Institute of India (WII) has consented to provide technical support to the department and train its staff. The department was to carry out the second census in April 2020, but the plan had to be abandoned due to the pandemic. “Being season specific, the second census could not be carried out in 2020 as the best period to spot animals had passed due to the lockdown. It is difficult to locate animals in other seasons,” said UT chief conservator of forests Debendra Dalai. The first census was carried out in 2010 in the Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary, which is spread over 26 sq km in the catchment area of Sukhna Lake. A team of experts from WII, environmentalists, representatives of NGOs and biology and zoology students from Panjab University had taken part in the exercise. The team took three days to count nine species of mammals and 65 species of birds by using direct evidence, including their spotting, and indirect evidence like footprints and animal faeces.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/2nd-wildlife-census-likely-this-week/articleshow/82347481.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

Led by the school art teacher Gurudatta Vantekar, the rangoli was created over a period of eight days. The employees of Vivekanand Dnyan Mandir High School, Keri, said they wanted to express gratitude to all the Covid warriors who are struggling persistently to help curb the spread of Covid-19. Vantekar said that their rangoli design is a tribute to medical, police and all other frontline workers, who are working tirelessly to save during the pandemic. Vantekar was helped by 17 teaching and non-teaching members of the school to give shape to his rangoli design. “We have strictly adhered to the Covid protocol while creating the rangoli. My colleagues in the school and I want to express our utmost gratitude to the warriors for their inspiring struggle. In the pandemic, I want to create hope and I believe art is the best way to display our sincere feelings,” Vantekar said. Shripad Gawas, chairman of Swami Vivekanand Education Society, said the rangoli is an attempt to help school staffers and locals, who view the rangoli, overcome the increasing mental stress, fear and anxiety about this disease during the pandemic. “Through social media, we will be exhibiting this rangoli in public domain, without inviting students, parents in the school,” said school in-charge, Gopinath Gawas. A teacher at the school, Chandrashekhar Gawas, said, “Everyday, we are fed up with hearing and reading the news pertaining to increasing numbers of Covid-19 cases.

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Lungs bear the brunt of the impact in Covid second wave||HYDERABAD: Unlike its behaviour during the first wave, the Covid-19 virus is now attacking the lungs early on, resulting in many patients being wheeled into hospitals with 60% to 70% lung damage, say doctors. According to them there are also many instances of patients going from comfortably sitting at home to reaching a hospital and succumbing to the virus in barely 10 to 15 hours This pattern, observed in several cases in the city recently, show that sudden deterioration in health — in the latest wave of Covid-19 — is leaving doctors with almost no time for treatment. Adding to the problem is the large number of patients from poor socio-economic strata who have no access to oximeters and are reaching later than required. “This time, the virus is directly affecting the lungs in the first few days itself unlike during the first wave. We are seeing patients come with 70% or more damage of the lungs, bilateral damage with only a part of the lung functioning. In patients from poor economic background, there is still lack of understanding on the gravity of the situation and they come after five-six days of symptoms, which makes it worse,” said Dr Marri Mallikarjun, nodal officer, Covid-19 at King Koti Hospital. In a recent instance, a suspected patient of Covid passed away within hours of developing fever. “After one of our family member tested positive and others were preparing to get tested, my aunt developed fever. Within a few hours, it progressed to gasping and on checking the oxygen saturation, it was less than 78. We rushed to the hospital but by the time we could get a bed, she had deteriorated severely and succumbed shortly after getting a bed,” said the patient’s relative. Also, deaths among younger patients are being increasingly reported and doctors say that many patients who turned up at emergency rooms were clueless that they had comorbidities. “This only makes the process of stabilizing them more difficult. When we admit them and start checking their vitals, that is when we find out that they already have a cardiac issue or a kidney failure. In a few cases it might also be information withheld by the patients, but a large chunk of the younger patients is unaware of their actual health status. This is one of the reasons for deterioration, apart from the fact that the virus has severely mutated,” said a senior doctor from the Gandhi Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/lungs-bear-the-brunt-of-the-impact-in-covid-second-wave/articleshow/82348243.cms||Amrita Didyala

---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Gen Y quick off blocks to take first Covid shot||LUCKNOW: From stepping outside the safe boundaries of their homes to visiting a hospital in the midst of a pandemic, the scare was immense but the desire of being one step ahead of the novel coronavirus drove the young and healthy for vaccination against Covid-19 on Saturday. High participation and an eagerness to beat the disease was witnessed on the first day when those in the age group of 18 to 44 years could get themselves vaccinated. Of the 3,200 people who registered for vaccination, 2,700 turned up for the first dose at 11 centres. The turnout of men (1,641) was more than women (1,063). The urgency to stay safe in grim times was palpable, particularly among the younger lot, at all the centres. Some came alone while others brought their family members along. They held hands and took selfies after taking the jab. Some newlywed couples were also spotted at the centres. All beneficiaries in this age group were given Covaxin, indigenously developed by Bharat Biotech. Most beneficiaries used double masks, N95 masks, gloves and some even used face shields over and above these. “As youngsters, it is our responsibility to keep everyone around us safe. Right now, vaccines are the only option against Covid-19,” said Anshuman Singh Chauhan (20), a civil service aspirant, who took the shot at KGMU. Shirshika Kapoor, a 25-year-old resident from Chowk, reached the vaccination centre at BRD hospital in Mahanagar before the scheduled time. “I was surprised to see many people there. There was a long queue and I had to wait for 30 minutes. Initially, I was scared but on reaching the centre I found that the vaccination area was completely separate from the hospital wing and social distancing was being maintained,” said Kapoor, an academic counsellor. “My father and mother have already been vaccinated. I joined the club today. I have also posted a message on social media urging my relatives and friends to get vaccinated as soon as possible,” said Shivani Singh (18), a student, who took the jab at SPM Civil Hospital. Sudha Yadav (44), a primary teacher at a government school who took the jab along with her son and daughter at Jhalkari Bai hospital, said: “We stepped out of home after 15 days just for the vaccine and took all precautions like double masking, regular use of sanitizer and social distancing.” While Ayush Jaiswal (24), a student, took the shot at a government centre. He said that vaccine was the lifeboat which was must for survival. Chadra Bhushan Singh (23), a government employee, who took shot at Virangana Avanti Bai hospital said that vaccines were safe, effective and lifesaving. Vivek Singh (40), a businessman, who took the shot along with his wife, said: “I have to go out for work daily, so there is a high chance of infection. Vaccination has brought some confidence.” Spokesperson at CMO office, Yogesh Raghuvanshi, said that barring those who came for the second dose of Covishield vaccine, all first dose beneficiaries were inoculated with Covaxin. (With inputs from Pragati Shukla and Naman Gopal) Many fail to get slot for vaccination: Registration and getting a slot for vaccination was easy for some but for a large number of people who registered themselves on the portal complained of not getting a slot. “I registered my brother and myself on the portal on the very day the process began, but I kept checking for slots. It did not show even one slot for days together. The only slots that were available were for people above 45 years of age. It was quite upsetting,” said Pavitra Chaturvedi (30), a resident of Paper Mill Colony.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/gen-y-quick-off-blocks-to-take-1st-shot/articleshow/82348238.cms||---

A video clip of the incident went viral on social media. The minister was on inspection to review the arrangements at the CHC where vaccination of people in the 18 to 44 age group had started on Saturday when the youth complained of delay and used intemperate language for the doctors and medical staff. The minister later told reporters, “The youth had come hours before the time slot allotted to him online and was accusing doctors of delaying his vaccination and he was using abusive words for them.” “There were two queues of people, one of those above 45 years and the other of 18-44 category. All the people in queue had been allotted time slots. The man Sanjay Dubey had been given time slot after 12 noon, but he reached CHC at 10am and was bullying CHC doctors and paramedical staff to vaccinate him first,” said Jaiswal. He was using abusive words for doctors and CHC staff though they are working tirelessly to ensure registration, vaccination and post vaccination care, he added. “People should have respect for the doctors and paramedics,” said Jaiswal. Shivpur CHC was among 17 sites, where vaccination started with the opening of slot for those above 18 years. While the elderly were standing in a queue for their second shot, those registered in 18 plus category were in another queue. By afternoon, there were long queues when Jaiswal, who had also tested Covid-19 positive, and had arrived at the CHC after completing his quarantine period to take stock of the arrangements. When Dubey saw the minister he went near him and started complaining about the arrangements and delay saying people were standing in queues in hot weather and used abusive language for staff which infuriated Jaiswal who moved menacingly towards him. The video of incident shows Jaiswal moving towards Dubey, but his security personnel and followers stopped him. Later, Dubey alleged that he wanted to speak to the minister for knowing the reason for delay being caused in administering vaccines to the people when Jaiswal tried to assault him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/min-loses-cool-as-man-complainsof-delay-in-vaccination-in-kashi/articleshow/82347865.cms||---

---||Allahabad||Prakash Utsav of Guru Tegh Bahadur ji culminated||Prayagraj: The Prakash Parv, commemorating the 400th year of the birth of Guru Tegh Bahadur, the ninth guru of Sikhs, culminated on Saturday. The celebrations, that kicked off across the country on April 12, ended today. Despite the restrictions of the Covid-19 pandemic, the celebrations bear special significance in terms of Sangam city wherein the gurudwara ‘Pakki Sangat’ is located. The gurudwara, which was visited by the Guru himself in the 17th century, is located at the Aiyapur locality of the city and finds a special place among the Sikh community. The 9th Guru, Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji Maharaj, arrived in 1666 and stayed at this place for six months and meditated at the banks of Sangam. This place also bears historical significance as Mata Gujri Devi conceived here the 10th Guru of the Sikh community, Guru Gobind Singh, who was later born in Patna. According to Mahant Gyan Singh of the gurdwara, Guru Sahib came here along with Mata Gujari Ji (his wife), Mata Nanaki Ji (his mother), Mama Kirpal Das Ji and other followers. In those times, the confluence of the three rivers (Sangam) was quite close to this place and local Sangat (followers) requested guru sahib to stay for some more time. Accepting their request, Guru Teg Bahadur stayed here for almost six months. “It was here that Mata Nanaki Ji (wife of Guru Hargobind and mother of Guru Teg Bahadur) asked Guru Sahib that her husband and Guru sahib’s father had blessed her with valiant warrior grandson and guru sahib told her that time is near to her desired wish”. It was here that Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji was conceived by Mata Gujari Ji, he added.Many personal belongings of guru sahib are preserved here at the gurudwara including his sword, conch shell etc. Later, in 1671 Shri Guru Gobind Singh Ji, on the way back to Punjab from Patna Sahib, stayed here for five days. The guru was five-year-old and he took a holy dip in Sangam and visited Benimadhav temple and Akshaywat. The celebrations, marking the 400th Prakash Utsav of the 9th Guru was celebrated by the devotees, although in a low profile. Because of the present restrictions owing to covid protocols, the main devotees managing the Gurudwara offered the prayers. The rest of the Sikh devotees offered their prayers from their homes only. “Although the day bears special significance for all of us but because of the restrictions, we sung ‘Ardas’ from our homes and prayers at Gurudwaras were offered by the pujari," said Amarjeet Singh, the corporator of Preetam Nagar locality.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/prakash-utsav-of-guru-tegh-bahadur-ji-culminated/articleshow/82347863.cms||---

Officials should get in touch with experts from IIT Kanpur and other technical institutes and look at the possibility of converting nitrogen to oxygen,” said a government spokesperson. A crusher unit in Jhansi has begun production of oxygen and with a little technical expertise, sugar mills can also begin oxygen production, the CM said, asking officials to discuss these possibilities with experts. The CM also instructed officials to ensure all government and private medical colleges that don’t have a liquid medical oxygen plant, should start setting up within the next six months. For private hospitals, the government said, it will reimburse the money spent as per demand raised by each institution. The CM also said, the state government is receiving 50,000 vials of Remdesivir every day from the Centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogi-explore-possibility-of-o2-production-from-nitrogen/articleshow/82348248.cms||Neha Lalchandani

---||Lucknow||Teachers’ assns blink after SC order, withdraw call to boycott counting||Lucknow: Hours after Supreme Court refused to defer counting of panchayat poll ballots in Uttar Pradesh, the teachers’ association retracted their decision to boycott the exercise, which will kick off on Sunday. Teachers have been restive over deaths of hundreds of their colleagues, who contracted Covid while on poll duty. Uttar Pradesh Shikshak Sangh (UPSS) led by Dinesh Chandra Sharma on Saturday issued a statement, saying since the apex court directed strict adherence to Covid protocols during the counting process, teachers won’t skip poll duty. “The government has also assured that safety measures will be in place at counting centres and if protocols are violated, we will cease work,” Sharma said. Rashtriya Shaikshik Mahasangh, an RSS affiliate, which threatened to boycott counting, citing absence of healthcare and Covid protocols at polling booths, also withdrew its decision. “Those involved in the vote-counting exercise have been asked to report two hours in advance at counting centres for taking an antigen test. We have been assured Covid protocols will be in place for our safety and security,” said Shiv Shankar Singh, organisational secretary of RSM. On the eve of counting, chief secretary RK Tiwari held a virtual meeting with teachers and employees’ union leaders. A joint organisation of teachers and employees — Karamchari Shikshak Adhikari Evam Pensioners Adhikar Manch — issued a statement, confirming participation in counting. “Workers complaining of cough and fever will be exempt and those deployed will be provided with masks, sanitisers and gloves. Lives of teachers and employees are precious and since Supreme Court has refused to defer counting, we will participate in the process,” said general secretary Susheel Kumar Tripathi. Teachers have sought a curfew in areas which are in proximity to counting venues. Oximeter tests will be conducted at the entry point and no crowds will be allowed inside the venue. Also, the booths will be sanitised after every shift, social distancing will be maintained along with thermal checking.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/teachers-assns-blink-after-sc-order-withdraw-call-to-boycott-counting/articleshow/82348280.cms||Isha Jain

The guidelines that made admission in JLN Hospital strict, are leading to patients flocking to other hospitals. A woman from Ramganj was not allowed admission in JLN Hospital on Saturday, as she was not referred by any private hospital. A relative of the patient said that there was no place in other hospitals and after her mother got sick, they directly brought her to JLN Hospital, but the admission was denied at the main gate by police. Sources said that hospitals are full and doctors are advising for treatment at home. On Saturday, there were 510 Covid cases recorded in Ajmer, with five deaths. Police are making efforts to get all shops to shut by 11am and checking traffic in city. On the other hand, closing gates of JLN hospital has provided space to the doctors to review every patient in the Covid ward. On Saturday, there was no crowd at the hospital. Sources said that there is a problem of beds, but oxygen is as per demand. While private hospitals and Covid care centres are full, the administration has decided to open one more Covid care centre at Chandrawardai. Ajmer oxygen group has started an initiative wherein they have gathered money to purchase oxygen concentrators and will provide these for free to the homes of patients, and after using it, the patient can return it to the bank. Member of the group Vipin Basil said that on Saturday, Riju Junjhunwala provided Rs 5 lakh to the bank so that concentrators can be purchased and provided to people at home. Basil said that they targeted about 100 concentrators in the oxygen bank. Meanwhile, Ajmer north MLA Vasudev Devnani started a campaign of distributing Parivar Arogya kits with pamphlets describing how to remain safe at home and exercises to do at home. These kits contain ayurvedic medicines to boost immunity as well as tablets of vitamin C and zinc and these kits will be distributed for free to about 2,000 families and on Saturday alone, 250 kits were distributed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/with-jlns-gates-shut-people-rush-to-other-hosps-in-ajmer/articleshow/82347502.cms||---

Parida said they have sufficient supply for the city. “Directions have been issued to officials to ensure remaining quota is properly distributed among private hospitals. A senior doctor or official will be deputed to regularly monitor the supply to private hospitals and coordinate with them,” he added. The UT administration has already roped in three vendors for refilling of cylinders for health institutions.  Garg said, “The ministry of health and family welfare has fixed the daily quota of 20MT of medical oxygen for UT from Inox, Barotiwala. This is being utilised for GMH-16, GMCH-32 and the Covid hospital in Sector 48. Recently, three oxygen generation plants were commissioned at these three hospitals.” However, there is an additional requirement for refilling of oxygen in cylinders in these three government hospitals. The private healthcare institutions also require medical oxygen and PGIMER’s requirement is met from a separate quota. After meeting the daily requirements of GMCH-32, GMH-16 and Sector 48 Covid hospital, the remaining oxygen, out of 20MT quota of the UT, will be provided to the private refilling vendors to cater to the needs of the other government hospitals and private healthcare institutions. Anaesthetic Gases Pvt Ltd (AGPL), Sector 22-A, is the approved private refilling vendor for GMCH-32, GMH-16 and Sector 48 Covid hospital. AGPL is also refilling cylinders for private institutions. Two more vendors—Chandigarh Gases, Industrial Area, Phase I, and Super Gases, Derabassi—have been roped in to provide oxygen, out of the 20MT quota of UT, for refilling cylinders for both government and private institutes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/o2-supply-from-uts-quota-to-pvt-hosps-will-be-monitored/articleshow/82347503.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

---||Jaipur||Longer recovery time & panic put pressure on med resources||JODHPUR: Longer time of recovery of Covid patients in the second wave and panic have emerged as key factors exerting pressure on the resources in hospitals and depriving many serious patients of timely medical aid. According to doctors, both these factors are beyond their control. Neither they are in a position to reduce the recovery time nor can they convince the panic-ridden patients to be judicious while using the resources, like beds and oxygen, which are acutely scarce these days. Senior professor of medicine (SN Medical College) Naveen Kishoria said longer time taken for recovery of patients is resulting in longer bed occupancy. "Unlike the first wave, when the patients remained in hospital for 5-7 days, this time, patients are taking 20-25 days on beds during treatment, which has been creating a huge backlog as the resources are limited," said Kishoria. The reason behind this shift in pattern of infection was a matter of study but this has turned out to be a major cause of chaos in the hospitals, forcing both the patients, their relatives and hospital administration to run helter-skelter for beds and oxygen, he added. Secondly, the patients have been occupying beds in the hospitals without their condition being serious out of apprehension that they are not fully cured and their condition could become serious anytime. "Many of them are not even ready to heed our assurance that they are out of any danger and do not require to be in the hospital anymore. But they insist on being kept under observation for 2-3 more days," Kishoria said, adding that the hospital could not force them to leave. Panic is also driving the patients to self-regulate oxygen flow, especially at night. Many patients or their attendants are so panicked and uninformed about the oxygen saturation levels that they assume that the higher the oxygen saturation, the better it is. With this assumption, they increase the flow of oxygen, especially at night, when there is no active monitoring like during day time. Wastage is also common among patients during the day, while having food, medicine, etc. According to the doctors, oxygen concentration for a patient is to be decided by a doctor only treating it as a drug, not lifesaving gas. Excessive intake could cause harm leading to toxicity in the body.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/longer-recovery-time-panic-put-pressure-on-med-resources/articleshow/82347507.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Plea against Covid-19 vaccine ‘discrimination’ faced by people below 45 years filed in HC||CHANDIGARH: A petition has been filed before Punjab and Haryana high court alleging discrimination by the Union government for Phase-3 of the vaccination drive in which people above 18-years of age are to be vaccinated for Covid-19 on payment. The main plea is that no such payment was received from the beneficiaries of Phase-1 and Phase-2 when people above 60 years and people between 45 and 59 years of age were vaccinated free of cost in government hospitals. The petitioner, Abhishek Malhotra, a student of law at Panjab University, Chandigarh, sought directions for reducing the price of Covishield and Covaxin vaccines to be administered to people of 18-44 years in the third phase of vaccination, which was to commence from May 1. The petition, expected to come up for hearing next week, has impleaded Union health and family welfare minister, state governments of Punjab, Haryana, and UT Chandigarh as respondent parties in the case. According to the petitioner, exclusion of persons in the age group of 18 to 44 years for free vaccine quota of the Centre, amounts to illegal discrimination. As per the Union ministry of health and family welfare, two vaccines granted emergency use authorization by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) in India are Covishield (AstraZeneca's vaccine manufactured by Serum Institute of India) and Covaxin (manufactured by Bharat Biotech Limited). On January 16, vaccination for Phase-1 of the National Covid-19 Vaccination strategy was launched, which focused on healthcare workers (HCWs), frontline workers (FLWs) and persons over 60 years of age. On March 1, vaccination for Phase-2 was initiated and it focused on protecting the most vulnerable population of persons between 45 and 59 years with comorbid conditions and later on people between 45 and 59 years without comorbidities were added to the list. On May 1, vaccination for Phase-3 commenced, for which everyone over the age of 18 years is eligible. The petitioner stated that the prices set by Serum Institute of India (SII) on April 21 for Covishield is exorbitantly high. “Moreover prices of these vaccines could be set by GOI by using the power under Section 4 of the Drugs (Control) Act 1950, as these prices are unreasonably high and the same could not be afforded by the middle class or financially weak sections of the society and violates Article 14, 15, and 21 of the Constitution of India of the petitioner as well as of public at large,” the plea said. The petitioner sought directions for the Union government to reduce the price of vaccines, Covishield or Covaxine for Phase-3 vaccination for private hospitals, by using the relevant provisions of the drug (Control) Act 1950 and keep the prices synchronised with Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials ie Rs 250 for private hospitals so that the price of the vaccine can be easily afforded by below poverty line (BPL) financially weaker sections/downtrodden /vulnerable sections of society.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/plea-against-covid-19-vaccine-discrimination-faced-by-people-below-45-years-filed-in-hc/articleshow/82347779.cms||---

In the first, an insurance cover of Rs 2 lakh will be given to all labourers for accidental death or disability. A health insurance cover of Rs 5 lakh will also be given to them. In a virtual interaction with labourers from across the state on Saturday, the CM said that in the midst of the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, the government was going to restart distribution of free ration under the PM Garib Kalyan Yojana from May 5. He said that in 2020, the government had not just given free ration to labourers but also a bharan poshan bhatta or allowance. Around 54 labourers benefited from the financial assistance. More than 40 lakh migrant workers who returned to the state were given benefits. Yogi said that the Uttar Pradesh Labour (Employment Exchange and Job) Commission had been set up which is working to find employment for workers. A Kanya Vivah Sahayata Yojana is also going on through which the government provides financial aid for the wedding of daughters of labourers. Atal Residential Schools are also being set up in each of the 18 divisions to provide education to children of registered labourers and provide with them free hostel facilities. He said that the government was providing free coaching to children of labourers under the CM Abhyudaya Scheme and helping them get good ranks in competitive exams. He assured them that all steps had been taken to ensure that essential services and activities were not affected during the weekend curfew. During this time, industrial units would continue functioning. Covid help desks had been set up in all units and if workers faced any problem they could visit the help desk. Directions have been given to provide workers with sanitisers, thermal scanning, pulse oximeters at work places.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cm-yogi-announces-accident-health-insurance-cover-for-labourers-in-state/articleshow/82348287.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Ivermectin a miracle drug or a placebo? Hyderabad experts differ||HYDERABAD: Is Ivermectin that is widely prescribed to decrease viral load among Covid-19 patients is a placebo or a miracle drug? Expert doctors treating Covid-19 patients differ on use of Ivermectin. While a few experts say it is of no use and termed as another hydroxychloroquine, city-based specialists say it helps in decreasing the viral load and that there is no harm taking it as there are no side-effects. Dr K Subba Reddy, chief intensivist at Apollo Hospitals, said: “Ivermectin is an anti-parasitic medication. In view of good anti-viral activity invitro against SARS-CoV-2 and being a harmless medication, most of the physicians are prescribing it.” However, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has recommended against the use of Ivermectin in Covid-19 patients. The WHO issued guidelines stating that Ivermectin should be used on Covid-19 patients only in clinical trial settings. Ivermectin has a “very low certainty of evidence” on mortality, admission and decreasing the viral load from the body, it said. Dr Pavan Gorukanti, director and pulmonolgist, Yashoda Hospitals, said Ivermectin is a difficult drug to comment on since there are hardly any large-scale reliable trials done on its use. “It may have some anti-viral effect but most of its role is anti-inflammatory effect. But, the drug is fairly harmless and cheap. Probably like HCQ, it may be mildly useful but without dramatic results. It has no major side- effects,” he said. He added: “Remdesivir and steroids definitely have more data when compared to Ivermectin.” Also, stronger anti-inflammatories like Infliximab, Tocilizumab and Baricitinib have more data and are suggested for severe Covid-19 patients. They have more side-effects though, he added. Another school of doctors who go by research from randomised clinical trails are strongly opposing use of Ivermectin. Dr Hari Krishna Paladagu of Krishna Gastro and Liver Centre in Vijayawada says: “Anti-viral drugs Remdesivir, Favipiravir and anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine, Ivermectin and antibiotics Doxycycline and Azithromycin and convalescent plasma therapy have not proven to save the lives of Covid-19 patients as per the research studies published in scientific journals. The WHO has also warned against their routine use in the treatment of Covid-19 patients. Tocilizumab drug was also proven to be not effective in the treatment of patients by multiple randomised control studies,” he said. He said worsening of Covid-19 symptoms, hypoxia and raising serum markers like CRP, D-Dimer and high CT server score on CT scan of chest will indicate the disease is severe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ivermectin-a-miracle-drug-or-a-placebo-experts-differ/articleshow/82348304.cms||---

The boy, who is believed to have got infected from his Covid-positive mother, was referred from Paonta Sahib in Himachal Pradesh to Dehradun. According to his parents, the toddler, who was gasping for breath and was using 8 to 10 litres of oxygen per minute, was refused treatment by at least five hospitals in the city.According to the doctors at GDMC, which is the only paediatric Covid healthcare facility in the state capital, the condition of the baby was so critical that people dealing with the emergency services immediately pressed him to be moved to the ventilator. He was even suffering from fits as the level of sodium in his body had gone down abysmally low due to illness. He was brought to GDMC on April 18. “The child was gasping for breath when he was brought to us. Even after consuming 8 to 10 litres of oxygen per minute, his O2 level was barely 80%. We immediately put him on ICU and he spent three days on the ventilator and was moved to a bed with oxygen support on April 22. We tested him after 10 days of admission and he tested negative for Covid-19 on April 29. We discharged him on Friday and he was properly feeding at the time of the discharge,” said Dr Vishal Kaushik, paediatrician at GDMC who said that he felt elated when the 7 months old recovered and was discharged. “My own baby turned a month old recently. I haven’t met him in a couple of weeks since I don’t want to expose him to any infection,” Dr Kaushik said. The doctor told TOI that the baby’s parents claimed that they were turned away by at least five big hospitals across Dehradun as his condition was critical and not a single hospital has the paediatric Covid facility. Dr Kaushik said children had better chances at beating the coronavirus. “Kids between the age group of 1 to 12 years have better immunity and there are various reasons for the same as they get vaccinated for various diseases,” added Dr Kaushik. Till now, around 20 toddlers have defeated Covid in GDMC’s paediatric wing, including a 9 months old who was infected by his father. According to the doctors, it is established in some researches that kids below 12 months of age are more susceptible to the coronavirus than others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/7-month-old-recovers-from-covid-19-after-3-days-on-ventilator/articleshow/82347060.cms||Ishita Mishra

However, this year, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, villagers of Poriem observed the annual Rathotsav symbolically, while in Vithalapur, Sakhali, it was decided not to hold it altogether.  The lunar month of Chaitra sees the famous Dashavtari folk drama performances, Ramnavami, Veerbhadra, Hanuman Jayanti and Rathotsav celebrated with great fervor. In Vithalapur, the celebrations are especially singular. However, this year, the temple committee of Shri Vitthal of Vitthalapur cancelled the celebration, which otherwise witnesses large gatherings. In the Shri Bhumka temple in Poriem, the committee emphasised on a symbolic observation. The Chaitra Pournima celebration of Shri Vitthal temple is interlinked with that of the temple of Shri Bhumka in Poriem. Shri Bhumka, the presiding deity of Poriem, holds the honour of being Saptashati Bhumka not only in the town of Sakhali, but also beyond. Villages of Satha-Sattari, which means devotees from 130 villages of Sattari taluka and vicinity, hold the deity in high esteem. Ramchandra Gawas from Poriem said, “On the day of Hanuman Jayanti, the Rathotsav procession was held symbolically without involving a large number of devotees.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/poriem-sakhali-observe-low-key-rathotsav/articleshow/82348295.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar
---||Hyderabad||Officials urged to convert more public spaces to hosps||Hyderabad: An acute shortage of Covid-19 beds across city hospitals, including government-run tertiary centres like Gandhi Hospital, Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences (TIMS) and King Koti Hospital has left patients in utter despair, with many succumbing while looking for a bed. Given the magnitude of the crisis, doctors and common residents are now urging the authorities to convert other public spaces into makeshift medical facilities for the ill. On an average, private hospitals say they have been turning away at least 30 to 40 patients every day from their emergency department, unable to get them a bed. The situation across the three government hospitals is much the same. About 30 to 60 patients are regularly sent away from there too. TIMS, for instance, was nearly full on Saturday and struggling to accommodate new patients. “We have just about one or two oxygen beds available as there will be some discharges. But it’s a dynamic situation. We are almost full,” said the hospital superintendent, Dr Ehsan Ahmed Khan. At Gandhi Hospital too officials were fighting the same battle. “We do not have a single vacant ICU or ventilator bed out of the 600 beds. Even the oxygen beds are running at full capacity. We are somehow managing as there are 50 to 60 discharges every day and around 20 deaths too,” said the hospital superintendent Dr M Raja Rao. With the wards chock-o-block and ambulances carrying critical patients lined up outside this nodal Covid hospital on many days, experts feel that this is the right time for the government to take over certain public sector facilities and turn them them into temporary Covid care centres and hospitals. “As a future step, to mitigate the crisis of shortage of beds, we can even think of setting up beds in stadiums, hotels, resorts, hostels and educational institutes,” said professor Subodh Kandamuthan, director, Centre for Healthcare Management, ASCI. He added: “Not just Hyderabad, it is also important to add beds in districts too. Government should think of collaborating with DRDO, HAL and army facilities where they can set up beds.” At present, the shortage of beds is leading to patients succumbing to the virus, while looking for a bed, say doctors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/officials-urged-to-convert-more-public-spaces-to-hosps/articleshow/82347837.cms||Amrita Didyala

The role of CMHO Dr B S Tanwar is also under scanner and he is likely to be booked after the probe is over in the matter.Accounts manager Mahendra Kumar Maliwal, 47, was arrested from his office after he had allegedly accepted the bribe from the proprietor of a travel agency, additional superintendent of police (ASP), ACB, Kota Chandrasheel Thakur said. The accused claimed to have demanded and accepted the bribe amount for CMHO, Kota Dr Bhupendra Singh Tanwar, he added.The proprietor of travel agency, Avinash Hada, 28, a resident of Kunhari area of Kota city, had filed a complaint with ACB Kota alleging that the CMHO demanded Rs 1.30 lakh as bribe, 7% of the 3-month billing amount of four cars hired by the CMHO office under tender and threatened to dismiss the tender in case of non- payment of the bribe, the ASP said, adding the complainant alleged the CMHO mounted pressure for the bribe through the accounts officer.The ACB carried out verification of the complaint on April 15 and accordingly laid trap to arrest the accused CMHO and accounts manager on Friday evening when Maliwal was held red-handed, the ASP said and added when the accused account manager called the CMHO to collect the bribe amount, he did not attend the call. The bribe amount of Rs 50,000 was recovered from the account manager’s car in the office.The key accused in the matter is Tanwar as the complaint was filed against him, but he is yet to be booked as investigation into the matter is under way and evidences against him are linked up, ASP Thakur said. The CMHO was not called for interrogation on Saturday. However, he did not respond to calls. Meanwhile, Tanwar had skipped CM Gehlot’s VC which gave rise to suspicions that he might have absconded.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Flat buyers who had paid up Rs 22L will get Rs 25L for 10-yr delay in possession||Mumbai: Over a decade after a family from Airoli booked a 350-sq-feet flat in Navi Mumbai but failed to get possession, the state consumer commission recently directed the builder to hand over possession along with total compensation of around Rs 25 lakh. The family had paid Rs 22 lakh for the flat by 2012 besides Rs 8,000 as society formation and electricity charges. The compensation includes 12% interest on the amount paid and another Rs 2 lakh for mental pain and agony. “The complainants could not get possession of the flat from the opponent. They required to knock the doors because of act and inaction of the opponent [builder], hence, it is clear that they have suffered mental agony. Hence, the complainants are entitled for some compensation,” the commission said. Sanjay and Gulabodevi Singh moved Maharashtra State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in 2017 against Ishaadit Enterprises. The Singh’s had booked the eighth-floor flat at Airoli. In the complaint, they submitted that although they had paid the amount, the builder failed to complete construction work, execute the agreement and hand over possession of the flat. They said communications and notices through advocates were exchanged but it was fruitless. They sought the flat and compensation. Along with their complaint, the Singhs submitted copies of the brochure, cost sheet, payment receipts, bank statement, advocate’s notice and communication between the parties. After admission of the consumer’s complaint, a notice was issued to the builder by publishing it in a newspaper. However, no one appeared for the builder. In October, 2017, the court passed an order and said that the complaint should proceed ex-parte. The state commission found that possession was to be handed over in 2011. “Considering the submissions, it has become clear that opponent [builder] has not completed construction work and handed over possession of the flat in dispute to complainants which amounts to deficiency in service and unfair trade practice adopted by the opponents,” it said. The commission said that with the Singhs’ submitting that they were willing to pay the balance, they were entitled to get vacant, peaceful and legal possession of the flat along with occupation certificate after completion of construction work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-flat-buyers-who-had-paid-up-rs-22l-will-get-rs-25l-for-10-yr-delay-in-possession/articleshow/82348301.cms||Rebecca Samervel

Government spokesperson and cabinet minister Sidharth Nath Singh said that Vadra was responsible for spreading lies and creating a scare, referring to her statement on Saturday where she had said that over 700 teachers had died of Covid during poll duty. “UP government maintained all the protocols relating to Covid-19 which were issued by the state poll panel, but the Congress leader has been spreading false information. She is a habitual liar and a habitual scare monger,” he said. The minister said that the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic had affected the entire country but the Congress had nothing to offer. Instead, the party was throwing baseless allegations at the government. He accused Congress of trying to regain lost ground by indulging in petty politics. “When it was in power, it did nothing for the people and even now the Congress is not standing with the government in the fight against the pandemic,” Singh said. The counting for the panchayat polls is scheduled for Sunday after the Supreme Court gave its go ahead. It also said that no rallies will be allowed after the announcement of the election results.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/priyanka-a-habitual-liar-says-up-govt/articleshow/82348292.cms||---

The UT health department will be the sole authority to distribute it. Prior to this, the UT administration had authorised three stockists and categorised seven private hospitals under them. However, after someone approached the court, the UT health department centralised the sale of the drug on the pattern of Tocilizumab. “We are, so far, the only place in the country to have allowed a government authority to distribute it to other hospitals as per their requirement. This step will check black marketing and irregular pricing by the chemists,” said UT’s director, health services, Dr Amandeep Kang. She said, “This will also control the sale of drug outside the city. Buyers come from Delhi and NCR, exhausting our local supply.” Tocilizumab, as per the Central government’s orders, is also not allowed to be sold through chemists. “We can now monitor the sale and check production of medicine’s fakes. If it is sold through the chemists, it gets difficult to verify the fraudulent activities.” Remdesivir will only be available at the authorised private and public Covid hospitals and mini-Covid centres. “These hospitals have to send us patients’ details and test reports. This will discourage unnecessary prescription of the medicine that has been going on rampantly. There are also some who have been hoarding drugs at home,” added Dr Kang. According to most of the PGI doctors, Remdesivir should be recommended only when there is a fall in oxygen saturation and patients have white spots in chest X-ray or CT scan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/remdesivir-will-not-be-sold-in-open-market-in-ut/articleshow/82347509.cms||Shimona Kanwar

While late start, lack of vaccines and mismatch of data was reported at a few centres, the city officials said that overall, the operation for 18-45 age group went smooth with about 10,000 doses administered. “In all, 35,451 shots were administered including first and second doses. For the past one week, the number of shots for second doses is higher than the first, as several in 60-plus and 45-plus categories are now due for the shot. But with the start of phase IV, we expect the number of first dose to rise again,” said a senior health department official. This time around, the experts are witnessing higher involvement of the society due to rise in awareness and rise in Covid-19 cases around them. Health department officials said that regular vaccination would not be affected with the new phase, even as fewer private hospitals are likely to start the phase soon. At several centres, the vaccination started around 10am instead of 9am due to delay in arrival of vaccines, said sources. In Naroda and Bapunagar, a few centres reported mismatch of the data as a few youths had to go back with suggestion that they must register again and book a session. At some centres in western city parts, citizens tried to take the token for spot registration, but they were also told to register on CoWIN and attempt again. “Except pain on the hand on which the vaccine was administered, I have not got any symptoms after 10 hours,” said Sanket Rajput, a resident of Jodhpur and a BBA student.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amdavadis-queue-up-for-vaccination/articleshow/82347833.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Petrol sales down 20%, diesel 30% due to curfew||JAIPUR: Petrol pump owners in the state claimed that because of the Covid curfew, petrol sales are down to 20% and diesel 30%. They claimed that an absolute lockdown would have been more beneficial as they are finding it difficult to manage the pumps. Rajasthan Petroleum Dealers Association president Sunit Bagai said, “While we are allowed to sell fuel to private vehicle owners till noon everyday, trucks and other heavy vehicles are allowed anytime. However, this has not really worked in our benefit as even these vehicles have more or less stopped operations due to multiple restrictions in every state. Our profits are now in the negative.” There are approximately 7,000 petrol pumps in the state, which sell around 390-crore litre diesel and 65-crore litre petrol each year. However, due to Covid restrictions, their sales have been reduced drastically. “As the Centre has left it upon the states to decide on the restrictions, each state is following different guidelines and there is no coordination among them due to which heavy vehicles’ movement has become difficult. While some states ask for negative Covid report, others have some different requirements. It would have been better if there was a central guideline”, added Bagai. The fuel pump owners were already facing losses due to the high VAT imposed on petrol and diesel in Rajasthan as compared to the neighbouring states. While there is 36% VAT on diesel, the same tax is 26% on petrol. Some of the fuel pumps on highways have shut down permanently and the association officials said it will take a decade to recover from the losses sustained due to the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/petrol-sales-down-20-diesel-30-due-to-curfew/articleshow/82347517.cms||---

Each school will have five session sites and the number of schools is to be scaled up to 274 by May 7. Kejriwal visited a polyclinic at Saraswati Vihar on Saturday for the ‘symbolic start’ of the vaccination drive. “In one way, today is symbolic as the vaccination drive has started only at one centre from today onwards, for those between 18-44 years. We have already received 4.5 lakh vaccines and we are now distributing them in all the districts,” he said. The CM said that from Monday, the vaccination drive would start on a larger scale. “It’s my request to everybody, it’s not walk-in yet, so please don’t queue up outside the vaccination centres. Everybody will get an appointment, you make your appointment online and come according to that. Without registration and without an appointment, please don’t come,” he urged. “The vaccination process for those above the age of 18 years has begun today. The arrangements at Polyclinic Vaccine Centre at Saraswati Vihar have been reviewed. As soon as Delhi gets the consignment of vaccines, we will boost the vaccination drive in Delhi,” Kejriwal tweeted after the visit. Delhi government is providing free vaccination at the government-run centres and from Monday, this will start for those in the 18-44 age bracket at 100 schools, with each centre having around five session sites and 150 doses will be given at each site in a day, sources said. The number of schools will be scaled up to 274 by May 7.

Also, after a gap of several days, daily recoveries outnumbered new cases. “As many as 38,826 persons were discharged from home isolation and hospitals in the past 24 hours. However, the risk of contracting infection remains high and everyone must adhere to the prevention protocol,” he said. ACS, information, Navneet Sehgal attributed the improvement to the state’s aggressive policy of test, track and treat. “The total number of tests conducted in the state reached 4.10 crore which is highest done by any state. This is also about 14% of the total tests done in the country as per Indian Council of Medical Research,” he said. Meanwhile, the official Covid-19 bulletin revealed that the surge in Lucknow was slowly stabilising. In all, 3,125 new cases were reported in the state capital but cases continued to pour in Kanpur, Varanasi, Prayagraj and Gorakhpur. Officials regretted the loss of 303 persons to the pandemic infection in the past 24 hours. The total number of lives lost to coronavirus complications reached 12,874 Lucknow, Kanpur, Varanasi, Gorakhpur and Prayagraj recorded maximum deaths during the day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/record-2-6l-tests-in-up-30k-fresh-cases-and-303-deaths-in-24-hours/articleshow/82352170.cms||Shailvee Sharda

The provocative post comes at a time when Amarinder has openly taken on Sidhu after his repeated jibes at him. Amarinder Singh dares Navjot Singh Sidhu to contest next poll against him, says he’ll lose security deposit.https://t.co/QbfzUf4SbK— TIMES NOW (@TimesNow) 1619578920000In the 2016 video, Amarinder is shown saying that when the report of the Behbal Kalan incident comes out, the name of former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal will crop up. “I had visited Bargari and saw what had happened.. the SP gave orders for the firing but who directed the SP, it was the chief minister,” he said. The second video, from a recent interview, shows Amarinder saying he couldn’t have sent Badals to jail soon after forming the state government as he had wanted no interference in the functioning of the SIT, which had to be totally independent. Sidhu pinned the tweet on Amarinder to his account. Later, he posted another post with his own video from 2018, addressing the media after he had submitted a letter to the Akal Takht Jathedar for ex-communication of the Badals. “People of Punjab did not elect the high court judge, blaming the Verdict for what is the failure of Executive Authority will not be accepted. My Stand Yesterday, Today & Tomorrow - Justice for Punjab’s Soul ... Letter to Jathedar Akal Takht Sahib for Ex-Communication of Badals (2018),” he tweeted. Breaking his silence on the repeated jibes by his former cabinet colleague on the issue of religious sacrilege, Amarinder had on April 27 challenged Sidhu to contest the next election against him in the former’s pocket borough Patiala, adding that Sidhu was indulging in “total indiscipline” and had no claim to the post of state Congress president or the deputy chief minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sacrilege-cases-sidhu-hits-back-at-amarinder-with-old-video/articleshow/82347786.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Can’t look into malware attack on Wilson’s laptop now in Mumbai: NIA||MUMBAI: National Investigation Agency (NIA) has questioned the maintainability and sought dismissal of a quashing petition filed by Elgar Parishad case accused, Rona Wilson (42), who is relying on a US forensic lab report that indicated planting of evidence on his laptop. The agency’s officer, in an affidavit in reply to Wilson’s February petition, said he “stoutly” denied the reports of Arsenal Consultancy and American Bar Association. The independent forensic report of a “malware’ attack on his computer “cannot be looked into at this stage’’, NIA said. Wilson, relying on the report, alleged he was “framed by somebody’’. NIA said his petition did not mention by who, “if at all it even happened’’, hence it was “vague’’. Wilson, a human rights activist, lodged at Taloja prison since his June 2018 arrest by Pune police, sought quashing of a chargesheet filed by NIA, which took over the probe in January 2020. He was “charged for his role and involvement in larger CPI (Maoist) conspiracy in light of clashes at Koregaon Bhima on January 1, 2018, after an Elgar Parishad programme on December 31 at Shaniwarwada, Pune,’’ NIA said. The chargesheet invoked serious anti-terror offences under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act against the accused, apart from offences under IPC, including section 121 (waging war against Government of India), 124a (sedition), 120b (criminal conspiracy) and 153A IPC (promoting enmity between groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc, and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony) evidence, he said, was subsequently relied by NIA to book him in the case. The last chargesheet against him was on October 10, 2020. Wilson’s petition cited a February 8 digital forensics report from Arsenal, which said his computer had been “compromised’’ for 22 months. He urged the court to form an SIT to probe “planting of evidence”. The report had analysed a cloned copy of digital records he received from the prosecution on July 30, 2020. Mark Stevens, president of Arsenal, in a 16-page report, had said Wilson’s was “one of the most serious cases involving evidence tampering’’ the firm encountered, “based on metrics that include a vast timespan between delivery of the first and last incriminating documents”. NIA said claims in the petition “are disputed question of facts and cannot be entertained in the present writ petition’’. It said since Wilson contended that the “attacker’’ had “used virtual proxy server (VPS), making it difficult to identify the IP address, and …the attacker’’ and US report is not part of chargesheets, it cannot be relied on by the accused at this stage. Besides, since the “attack”, according to Wilson, occurred before the Pune FIR was registered, it is for him to explain how, when the laptop was in his control, CBI said, and added that the accused “cannot blame other persons, leave aside independent agencies’’ like itself. NIA said Wilson can file for discharge to drop the case. It said, “Wilson and co-accused would be charged shortly’’ and he can raise his contention and prove the report by “leading evidence’’ during the trial, and his plea was “premature’’ . Since the special trial court had taken cognizance of chargesheets, the petition was “an attempt to delay the trial”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cant-look-into-malware-attack-on-wilsons-laptop-now-in-mumbai-nia/articleshow/82348332.cms||---

After assurance of safety, the doctors agreed to resume duty. The protest had erupted after relatives of a patient barged into the premises of the hospital on Thursday night in PPE kits and manhandled doctors on duty. The group also reportedly assaulted a woman medical student who was leaving for home, forcing her colleagues to immediately leave the premises in protest. The students had later given a letter to the dean of BJ Medical College, complaining about the incident and had refused to join the duty. On Saturday, their juniors were sent for the Covid duty, said sources. “The incident not only raised questions about safety of the doctors, but also the system at the hospital where the doctors can’t rely on any government officials for help in such an incident,” said a doctor on condition of anonymity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/dhanvantari-junior-docs-call-off-strike/articleshow/82347829.cms||---

The sources told TOI that funds for vaccination, budgeted at Rs 35,000 crore for the current financial year, are also adequate and further money will be provided to vaccine manufacturers in line with the supplies that have been ordered by the Centre. “We have paid an advance (of over Rs 4,500 crore to Bharat Biotech and Serum Institute) and the orders that come will go to states for the 45 year plus age group,” an official said. Besides, the companies didn’t have the capacity to step up production immediately and the Centre also did not want to appropriate the entire supply from the two companies. While announcing the allocation, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had made it clear that more funds will be provided, if required. The government expects vaccine supplies to improve with the first batch of Sputnik V landing in the country on Saturday and domestic production expected to commence soon. Sources said the Centre is also pushing for spending by states as well as government departments and on Saturday, had cleared additional loans of Rs 15,000 crore for states’ capital expenditure with a tenure of 50 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/step-up-investment-centre-tells-states-rules-out-funds-squeeze/articleshow/82349495.cms||Sidhartha

The procedure was carried out on Saturday at the state-run J J Hospital following the April 29 order. The family’s lawyer, Prosper D’Souza, said he was informed the baby was delivered but could not survive. The woman (36), who has two teenaged children, had petitioned HC since the pregnancy was beyond 20 weeks. On her counsel D’Souza’s plea that doctors at civic and government hospitals had informed her of a grave risk to her health and the child, if born, would suffer severe congenital anomalies, a bench of Justices Amjad Sayed and Madhav Jamdar sought recommendation on April 26 from the medical board. The board had confirmed to the HC the foetus has “holoprosencephaly’’ (where the forebrain of the embryo fails to develop into two hemispheres) and other foetal anomalies. HC posted the matter on May 6 “for directions”. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-permits-mtp-of-32-wk-foetus-with-abnormalities/articleshow/82347524.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

During Saturday’s review meeting with the newly constituted core team, Team-9, the chief minister said, there was a need to augment the healthcare force in Covid hospitals, where number of beds were raised manifold. Retired servicemen, doctors, army personnel, experienced paramedical staff and students in final year of medical or paramedical courses can be mobilised to meet the crisis, he said. “Due to the changing situation, a manpower bank or something similar would be a great help when a district raises a demand for specialised workforce,” the CM said, directing health education minister Suresh Khanna to work out modalities of such a system. The CM said, ventilators were available, but lying idle in some districts due to lack of trained manpower and directed the health department to immediately depute anaesthesiologists and technicians to such hospitals. “This work has to be done on priority. Also, ensure appointments are made to vacant positions of chief medical officer and chief medical superintendent in some districts,” the CM said. As part of the plan to raise Covid beds in the state, another 100 Covid beds are being added to RML Hospital, Lucknow, and another 250 in KGMU over the next few days. The CM said, a special 500-bed temporary Covid facility is being prepared by DRDO and Cancer Hospital, which be ready by early next week. Health and education minister Suresh Khanna is monitoring these facilities and overseeing addition of Covid beds in other districts.

Thousands listened to my call to donate plasma since last year, which has resulted in saving many lives,” chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said at the launch. The government, in a statement, said, through this initiative, it was looking to get urgent support on a range of critical equipment, including oxygen concentrators and D-type oxygen cylinders. Jasmine Shah, vice-chairperson, Dialogue and Development Commission of Delhi, said, “DDC will reach out to these “Corona Heroes” with details of priority equipment required and the mechanism of making donations. The initiative will also provide details of usage of the equipment or donation amount and an appreciation certificate to the donor.” Over 5,000 oxygen concentrators and 36 Oxygen PSA plants have already been committed to by the donors and would arrive in Delhi soon, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-launches-portal-for-nris-to-donate/articleshow/82348333.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Saving O2: Docs use innovative methods||Ahmedabad: At a Covid ward in Civil Hospital, the staff from physiotherapy department is seen instructing the new patients in prone positioning and how to hold the position for every 30 minutes with various combinations. The technique is said to reduce the oxygen requirements by 20%, which can make or break a small hospital’s oxygen setup. It’s not all – attendants check the oxygen saturation and oxygen flow (usually 5 to 10 litres per minute) for patients who don’t have severe symptoms and try to reduce the flow a bit to check whether the patients respond favourably. These are not solitary examples. All hospitals, currently hand-to-mouth when it comes to oxygen availability, are trying to think out of the box to reduce oxygen dependency for the patients. This, in turn, reduces the oxygen demand. The city alone requires over 150 tonnes of oxygen for Covid patients, said industry experts. The reason? Dr Shachi Dave, a city-based pulmonologist, said that compared to the last surge, more patients are coming to medical setting with higher oxygen requirement. “About 60% of the patients require high-flow (7 to 12 litres oxygen per minute) today. Thus, there are more patients who want more oxygen,” she said. “Thus, in the earlier surge, oxygen saturation below 95% would have sent alarm bells ringing, which in this surge can go up to 92% if the patient doesn’t have any other health issues. It’s because we are now regularly seeing patients who have saturation as low as 75%.” Thus, experts are looking at other solutions. Dr Kaushal Gandhi, an intensivist, said that they are using Bain circuit, generally used by the anaesthetists to re-flow the air, for some patients to reduce their oxygen requirement. “Every litre of oxygen saved by the procedure can save some other patient’s life,” he said. Dr Manoj Singh, a city-based pulmonologist, said there is more frequent assessment of oxygen requirement of patients to see if their intake can be reduced without hampering their condition. “Physiotherapy is encouraged in all patients along with diaphragm breathing to improve their breathing pattern,” he said. “In some patients, early use of ventilator is also required.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/saving-o2-docs-use-innovative-methods/articleshow/82347826.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Lucknow||Vaccine airlifted from Hyderabad, 18+ pilot drive takes off in UP||LUCKNOW: The UP government on Saturday went an extra mile to roll out the vaccination drive in the 18-44 age-group in seven cities by airlifting vaccines from Hyderabad. State aircraft dispatched to the Telangana capital returned with consignment in the morning to ensure adequate doses were available for those already registered. This is the fourth instance when state planes were used during the Covid-19 emergency. The vaccination drive began after a formal launch by chief minister Yogi Adityanath at a humble ceremony in Veerangana Avanti Bai Women and Child Hospital, Lucknow. Urging people to come forward and take the jab, the CM handed over a vaccine card to a group of youngsters. He also monitored the exercise through the day. Other members of the state cabinet launched the immunisation campaign in other cities, including Kanpur, Varanasi, Prayagraj, Meerut, Gorakhpur and Bareilly. Officials at the state health department revealed as many as 84 sessions were held to vaccinate 19,000 persons in the new category till 8 pm. Another one lakh citizens, including first-timers in other categories and those due for the second dose also took vaccine. As per data from the CoWIN portal, as many as 7,075 persons were vaccinated in Kanpur and 6,490 shots were given in Lucknow. In Varanasi, 6,834 persons, including youngsters got the shot while 6,969 persons were vaccinated in Meerut. Likewise, 4,107 doses were given in Bareilly and 3,419 in Gorakhpur. The data for Prayagraj was yet to be uploaded. Any separate agewise data was not recorded. Officials in the health department said, 1.26 crore doses of Covid-19 vaccine were provided to Uttar Pradesh, which means 1.03 crore persons have taken the first dose and 23.68 lakh persons have taken both doses. In the vaccine type category, 1.14 crore doses were Covishield, while the remaining were Covaxin. Officials urged people to shun fear and take the shot as it was a strong defence against the virus. “While few adverse events after immunisation have been reported, negligible number of persons needed hospitalisation even after contracting the infection in the second wave,” said a senior government doctor engaged in the vaccination process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/vax-airlifted-from-hyderabad-18-pilot-drive-takes-off-in-up/articleshow/82348343.cms||Shailvee Sharda

Bharadwaj had then tested negative and had taken the first dose of the vaccine. Another accused, Jyoti Jagtap, had tested positive last month. Last year, during the first wave of the pandemic, Bharadwaj had moved an interim bail plea, telling court she suffered from diabetes and high blood pressure. Bharadwaj’s plea had said no social distancing was possible at Byculla jail. The plea was rejected by special NIA court.

---||Chandigarh||Positivity rate in 1/3 of districts higher than Punjab average||CHANDIGARH: With a massive second wave of Covid-19 raging across the state, the test positivity rate in more than one-third of Punjab’s districts has grown higher than that of the state. Barring two districts, the overall test positivity rate of the state and 20 districts is above the 5% level recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Punjab since March has been reeling under a heavy caseload, accumulating 1,88,866 cases and 3,191 deaths in 61 days, accounting for 51% of total cases in the country and 35.36% of deaths reported since the beginning of the pandemic. In the week ending on April 30, the positivity rate of Punjab scaled to 11.7% from 10.2% recorded in the preceding week, a rise of 1.5%. As many as nine districts posted a higher jump, while only three districts recorded a drop. The positivity rate jumped by 9% in Mansa from 12.8% to 21.8%, highest among all the districts, while in Muktsar, the rate went up from 12.5% to 17.2%, a rise of 4.7%. Similarly, the rate rose from 15.4% to 20% in Fazilka, 7.7% to 10.1 in Jalandhar, 7.7% to 10% in Barnala, 8.2% to 10.2% in Ropar, 15.7% to 17.6% in Bathinda, 5.6% to 7.4% in Tarn Taran and 9.7% to 11.4% in Patiala. The trend has left the health experts worried as the higher the positivity rate, the difficult it gets in controlling the spread of the virus. Kapurthala, Fatehgarh Sahib, and Ferozepur are the districts that bucked the trend by registering a drop in the rate. Testing in Punjab has improved, and the state is ranked eighth in the country for tests per million population on an average in the last seven days, surpassing the neighbouring state of Haryana. Punjab conducted 1,813 tests per million population against the national average of 1,248 and 1,603 tests by Haryana. Despite improvement in overall testing numbers, there are districts that are not conducting enough tests and have a high positivity rate. Moga, where only 597 tests per million population are being done, has a positivity rate of 14.7%. With 982 tests per million, Ferozepur has a positivity rate of 12%. LOWEST INFECTION RATEEven as Punjab is witnessing a high number of fresh cases, the state’s effective reproduction rate (R-value) — an indicator of how fast infection spreads — is the lowest in the region. As per calculations done by Prof Sitabhra Sinha of Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai, Punjab’s estimated R-value stands at 1.25+/- 0.01. With R-value at 1.43 +/- 0.03, Haryana has the highest infection rate in the region followed by 1.32 +/- 0.01 in Himachal Pradesh and 1.30 +/- 0.03 in Chandigarh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/positivity-rate-in-1/3-of-districts-higher-than-punjab-average/articleshow/82347821.cms||Vinod Kumar

In a letter sent to the ministry of health and family welfare, adviser to the Prime Minister Bhaskar Kulbe referred to the request of ITBP DG S S Deswal seeking allocation of the ventilators for the centre, and said that 150 ventilators provided under PM CARES Trust Fund and embedded with GPS-enabled devices, “may be provided from the available stock on loan basis for a period of six months now, which if necessary, may be extended further on review”. “I also request you to organise immediate installation of these ventilators by the selected vendor(s). Simultaneously, please advise the SPCCC for the site preparation. Necessary training for use of these ventilators may also be organised by the selected vendor(s),” Khulbe said while asking MoHFW secretary Rajesh Bhushan to be informed of the decision. tnn There are around 500 oxygen beds at the Covid care facility, which is sought to be increased to 1,000 beds in the coming days. Around 600 admissions have been taken in at the facility since it started operations a few days back, though as of now around 325 beds are occupied with some patients either having been discharged or moving to other facilities. "Once the ventilators arrive, we will be able to address critical needs of the patients here itsef," ITBP spokesperson Vivek Pandey told TOI. Though there were some issues earlier regarding availability of oxygen at the facility, an officer said these have been resolved with around 600 oxygen cylinders and oxygen concentrators having been arranged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/give-150-ventilators-to-itbp-centre-pmo/articleshow/82348347.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Judges’ association defends priority||Ahmedabad: After the decision to give priority in Covid-19 treatment to judicial officers in districts, the members of legal fraternity – lawyers and judges – have come into an argument with advocates from Rajkot raising a strong objection to the decision alleging it was “discriminatory and violative of equality clause of the Constitution of India”. The Association for Judges has put forth several arguments against the lawyers’ attack including that judges cannot stand in queue like common people and that like IAS, IPS officers and politicians, they cannot use powers to secure Covid treatment for themselves. Following the state government’s directives to district health officers to give priority and timely treatment to district judiciary and court staff, a group of lawyers from Rajkto shot off a letter to the chief justice of the Gujarat high court stating, “From our knowledge of the Constitution and its equality clauses we feel that the directions/suggestions of the Gujarat high court to the state government to give such priority are discriminatory and violative of equality clause of the Constitution of India.” The advocates urged the CJ to consider equality in this regard. The reply came from the Association of Judges, especially from the retired judges who said that since in-service judicial officers would not be able to make public statement, they were replying on behalf of the serving judicial officers also. It said, “You all (lawyers) know well that these judges cannot stand in queue like common people. We have not demanded priority by taking treatment at the cost of others.” The association questioned the lawyers for not raising objection against politicians taking out huge rallies, thousands gathering at religious fairs, and IAS and IPS officers and politicians using their clout to get VIP treatment for themselves and family members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/judges-association-defends-priority/articleshow/82347838.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Tech survey done, 3 civic hospitals to get O2 plants by June||NEW DELHI: While governments and courts try to arrange for more medical oxygen for the national capital, the ground work for installing oxygen generation plants in three municipal hospitals has been initiated. With a corporation official reporting technical visits to the plants on Saturday, the units will take another month to be operationalised. A corporation official said that the installation work at the plants will begin from next week. Currently, there are around 250 Covid patients admitted in the Hindu Rao and Rajan Babu hospitals. North Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Jai prakash said that the plants will be ready by June and each plant will take space of 350-400 sqm space in a hospital. Prakash said that in spite of being some of the oldest hospitals in the city, Hindu Rao and Rajan Babu TB hospitals are currently equipped only with oxygen storage infrastructure, not oxygen generation plants. Hindu Rao has an oxygen storage capacity of 10,000 cubic meter while Rajan Babu has the capacity to store 6,000 cubic meters of oxygen. Balak Ram hospital, where another covid care center has been developed, has no storage plant. The erratic supply of medical oxygen to the city has also led to sleepless nights for municipal corporations in the last couple of weeks. The mayor himself approached Haryana CM Manohar Lal khattar on an occasion to secure oxygen supply from a Faridabad plant. All three hospitals will get new oxygen generation plants by next month, the mayor said, after the finalising the sites with technical teams on Saturday. The technical teams comprised of municipal engineers, private agency and additional commissioner. “Hindu Rao Hospital will get the generation plants right next to the storage unit. In Balakram Hospital, we will be utilising the vacant space next to dispensary for this purpose. The exact location for the unit at Rajan Babu hospital will be finalised on Sunday,” a senior official said. “A site has been identified, but an existing structure will have to be demolished.” Prakash said that the permission from petroleum ministry has been sought to start the oxygen plants and the file is likely to be cleared by next week. “Each plant will generate enough oxygen to take care of needs of 200 patients at each site. When situation normalizes, the excess oxygen will be diverted to other healthcare facilities,” he added. Meanwhile, East Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Nirmal Jain said they will install an oxygen plant in Swami Dayanand Hospital with the help of PM Cares Fund. “In view of the rising cases of Covid-19, we also need to increase the capacity of hospitals. We have sought funds for re-operationalising two wards in Swami Dayanand hospital. 60 nurses and 20 doctors will also be hired under this expansion,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/tech-survey-done-three-civic-hosps-to-get-o2-plants-by-june/articleshow/82348375.cms||Paras Singh
---||Chennai||Most ICU, O2 beds in 5 city GHs full; only 10% pvt hosp beds free||Chennai: More than 90% of beds and almost all oxygen beds and ICU beds in the five state-run Covid-19 tertiary care hospitals in Chennai were full on Saturday, even as several people were dialling the state helpline 104 and tagging its twitter handle to help them find beds. At the end of the day, hospitals in the state were using nearly 400 metric tonnes of oxygen. At 9.30pm, the data on https://tncovidbeds.tnega.org/, a webpage set up by the state health department for information on beds in private and government hospitals, showed just six out of 1,683 beds and one out of 919 ventilators in government hospitals were vacant. While normal beds in most of the city private hospitals were occupied, 150 oxygen beds and 23 ICU beds were vacant. Overall, 10% of beds in private and 12% of beds (mostly normal beds) in government facilities were vacant. Officials manning 104 said the bed position was dynamic and most people who called them for beds were still being accommodated. State health secretary J Radhakrishnan said efforts were being made by the government to ramp up beds. While nearly 7,000 more beds will be added to government hospitals by May 7, private hospitals have been asked to allot 50% of their beds for Covid patients after postponing elective surgeries. Several private hospitals – Apollo Hospitals, MGM Healthcare and Kavery Hospitals – said they had no ICU or oxygen beds vacant. Many hospitals also said they have increased the number of beds and are recruiting more nurses and doctors for isolation wards. The Director of Medical Education, Dr R Narayanababu, said the state was working to expand isolation beds in self-financing colleges and deemed universities. While many of these hospitals have allotted too few beds, the occupancy was less than 10% in some of them. While epidemiologists from the National Institute of Medical Sciences and experts in the state medical panel have been pushing the state to create additional beds in trade centres and stadiums, they say that beds in private medical college hospitals must be used. Former director of public health Dr K Kolandaisamy said many of these hospitals have state of the art infrastructure and team to function as tertiary care centres, some others should be used for secondary level care. “Most of these colleges don’t have patients in non-covid wards. When the government has closed out-patient services and non-emergency surgeries, these college should also do so. In 2020, Orissa government paid private institutions about Rs 3,000 per bed and the model was successful,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/most-icu-o2-beds-in-5-city-ghs-full-only-10-pvt-hosp-beds-free/articleshow/82347843.cms||---

The scheme is “against public policy and public interest at large’’, said the Aurangabad HC bench. HC said it was an “abuse of powers’’ as well as violative of well-settled labour law principles and against fundamental rights of people. The bench of Justices S V Gangapurwala and S D Kulkarni said if the scheme was permitted it would send a wrong signal that employees involved in misappropriation were being reinstated in MSRTC. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-sets-aside-scheme-for-staff-reinstatement/articleshow/82348387.cms||---

The channel was launched in 2018 to disseminate video lectures on various branches of engineering, information about placement drives, tips on how to crack an interview among others. The channel registered rapid increase in subscribers, both students and academicians, during the first and second Covid waves. Students from across the countries and even abroad have been posting comments and asking questions from professors who deliver lectures on the channel. “AKTU has been uploading informative videos on its channel from time to time to ensure that engineering and management students don’t face any problem in learning, placements and developing skills required to grab a job,” said AKTU spokesperson Asheesh Mishra. He said the university will receive a silver badge of recognition from YouTube for crossing 1 lakh hits. The university has also been providing the educational material for broadcast on the government’s Swayam Prabha channel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/youtube-channel-of-aktu-gets-1-lakh-hits/articleshow/82348407.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Chennai||Sneakerheads share sole stories||Watching basketball matches on television, and following the star players and their styles was Alwarpet-based Manish Ravi’s entry into the world of sneakers. The 24-year-old student, who got his first pair seven years ago, now owns 130 pairs."Finding exclusive sneakers was very difficult back then. I used to send photos to my uncle who lives in the US and he would pick up limited-edition ones for me," he says.Ravi is part of the growing sneakerhead culture in the country. One that has grown through dedicated groups and interactive online pages. These groups help both new and experienced collectors share information on where to find rare limited edition sneakers, exchange trivia, and engage in discussions on the topic.Ravi, for instance, has found it easy and useful to connect with fellow sneakerheads across the country through social media platforms such as Instagram. It helps him stay updated about sneaker-related news and also build his network within the community.Chennai is still in its nascent stage with regard to sneaker collection. However, it is rapidly growing due to the accessibility to retailers and resellers created by the community, says Ravi who has spent more than `30 lakh on sneakers. "Most of my sneakers are exclusive. My most expensive sneakers are the Off-White x Air Jordan which cost me `3.8 lakh," he says.Bengaluru-based Sole Culture, a sneakerhead community created by enthusiasts Joel Rudolph, Jeffrey Stephen, and James Thomas, is one of the first groups formed for sneaker collectors to bond and share their love for shoes."We knew of people who were collectors, but there was no way for all of us to meet. Since Sole Culture began hosting events a few years ago we have seen a huge growth in the number of people coming together to appreciate sneakers," says Stephen.The first event conducted by the community in 2017 saw about 17 participants, while the last event in February 2021 at Hard Rock Café hosted about 200 enthusiasts. "The events also help in the promotion of other related aspects of the sneaker culture, such as digital art, streetwear and posters," he says, adding that once the number of Covid-19 cases reduces, there are a few events and an upcoming sneaker store in the pipeline for Chennai.The number of limited-edition sneaker drops by brands such as Nike, Jordan, and Yeezy today is much higher than a few years ago. Q"These brands put out a new collection very often and it is extremely difficult to get your hands on a pair. This is where raffle and resale come into play," says the 29-year-old marine engineer.Those who are unable to purchase the newly dropped sneakers through raffle or retail usually purchase from resellers who sell them at a price higher than the retail price. "Reselling has become a lucrative business," he says.Sneaker retail space is dominated by just about one or two major chains in India. Delhi-based Vegnonveg is one of the first and leading multi-brand sneaker stores in India with outlets in Mumbai and Bengaluru as well."We curate sneakers for all. Sneakers cannot exist without pop culture, sports, design, and other street-style art forms. While these became popular in India, sneakers also rose in popularity," says Henry Vinoth, brand and culture manager at Vegnonveg. "They are a form of self-expression, each person has a different story."Omran Hamza, a member of Sole Culture and a sneakerhead from Bengaluru hosted a sneaker-themed sangeet during his wedding celebrations in 2019. "Every guest wore sneakers and for those who did not own a pair, I lent some of mine," says the 29-year-old advertising professional, who wore a black Adidas x Pharrell Williams human race NMD at the event.Weddings and sneakers don’t end with limited edition brand wear. With companies such as Saree Sneakers, you can customise your pair with initials, hashtags, and designs in hand embroidery. "While most branded sneakers are not female-centric, we produce sneakers mostly for women who enjoy wearing fusion outfits," says Shruti Kasat, founder of Kolkata-based Saree Sneakers.The brand has created a niche in the footwear market where the options are unlimited, says Kasat, who recently designed a pair of sneakers with a Harry Potter spell knit on them.Sneakers are no longer just footwear, they are seen as a symbol of expression and status, owing to Black-American NBA and music artists, believes Vijay Sidhhartha, a sneaker collector and director from Mylapore. "Jay-Z brought me into this and I am proud to be a part of this community. And I intend to continue collecting," he says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/sneakerheads-share-sole-stories/articleshow/82347545.cms||Harshitha Kumayaa
---||Mumbai||Oxford and Cambridge students launch joint Covid relief fundraiser||Distressed about the Covid catastrophe unfolding over 4000 miles away at their hometowns in India, anxious students and members of the Oxford and Cambridge communities have set up a joint fundraiser with a goal of raising £50,000 (roughly Rs 50 lakh) in 10 days. This joint endeavour by the Oxford India Society, Oxford Hindu Society and Oxford South Asian Society along with the Cambridge University India Society, the Cambridge South Asia Forum, and the Cambridge University Bharatiya Society, comes after the Oxford societies amplified their calls for donation and managed to hit their initial target of raising £10,000 (Rs 10 lakh) within 72 hours of launching the fundraiser on Wednesday. The first set of funds will be committed to four NGOs — The Raah Foundation (Maharashtra), SEEDS (Uttar Pradesh), Delhi Solidarity Group (Delhi) and Mercy Mission (Karnataka) — with which they expect to fund nearly “100 oxygen cylinders for areas in need, provide over 1500 refills of oxygen cylinders or around 10 new 5-litre O2 concentrators.” The Oxbridge societies have been urging the international community and South Asian diaspora to step forward and help raise funds to provide for oxygen, ventilators, food, water and home medication in areas acutely affected. “Donors can be anyone. It’s been set up by students who have family in Bangalore, Pune, Hyderabad, and other cities and targeted at members of the University,” said Anvee Bhutani, president of the Oxford India Society, anxious about the safety of her own grandparents who live in Delhi. Suyesha Dutta, president of the Oxford South Asian Society--who has been at the epicentre of the outbreak in Delhi-spoke of her “real-time view of the crisis” as she put aside her school work to help out “full time” with relief in Kanpur to Kolkata and Bangalore to Bhilai. As the Indian diaspora chips in from different corners of the world to support India’s fight against the virus, Nishant Saxena, president of the Cambridge University India Society, stressed on why it was crucial for the South Asian student community to coalesce for this charity effort. “Witnessing such difficult times in India is hurtful. Being Indian not only requires us to celebrate the country's successes but to help amidst times of crisis despite living abroad. We should all come together for those working hard to help India's health system recover and save lives,” said Saxena. Aditya Dabral, president of the Oxford Hindu Society, agreed: “Our hope is that we keep the momentum going with this collaboration and make a meaningful difference to the situation on ground.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/oxford-and-cambridge-students-launch-joint-covid-relief-fundraiser/articleshow/82348455.cms||Mohua Das
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: To lift your spirits, stop the scroll||CHENNAI: It was in March that Raji Maheswaran realised she was spending double the time she used to on her mobile phone from last year. After months of staying up late, the 35-year-old caught herself scrolling through disturbing coronavirus-related content — mass cremations, newer strains, celebrity deaths, angry families — lying in bed past 2am, until her eyes hurt and forced her to sleep. "My cellphone usage was previously restricted to WhatsApp and YouTube videos. In a matter of three months, I was incessantly consuming one heart-wrenching story after another, unable to stop, even as I fought insomnia and anxiety on most nights," she says. "I later realised this screen time was leaving me in a cold sweat and racing heart when I woke up the next morning." What this work-from-home engineer is experiencing is a phenomenon that has gripped most of the world’s netizens battling deaths of loved ones, job losses and feelings of uncertainty over the past year, so much so that lexicographers at the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) gave it a name — ‘doomscrolling’ — among words like ‘covidiots’ and ‘twindemic’ that they released under the Oxford Languages’ Words of an Unprecedented Year in 2020. Simply put, ‘doomscrolling’ is described as ‘the action of compulsively scrolling through social media or news feeds related to bad news’, a condition more harmful and obsessive than your casual late night Instagramming. It usually starts pretty harmlessly, as it did with Mumbai teacher Priya R. "Because there was so much happening, there was a need to get answers, just to feel a sense of control," she says. "Added to it, conflicting facts, fake news, Covid myths and vaccine information kept me glued to my phone all day, and most such times, I navigated to stories of doom without even realising," she says. A report by J P Morgan throws light on the extraordinary increase in news media consumption over the last year, following a worldwide pandemic and lockdowns imposed across the globe. Twitter saw an increase of 23% in daily active users since 2019 and Facebook’s total use across its messaging services had risen by more than 50% over the last month in areas most affected by the virus, it observed. "Doomscrolling, which leads to an excess of negative reinforcement, causes anxiety, makes you feel demoralised and affects your psychological health. It may even make you irritable and affect your appetite," says Chennai-based psychiatrist N Rangarajan. "Freud came up with a theory called ‘neurotic paradox’, which basically states we are curiously drawn to that thing that frightens us; like a child who believes there’s a ghost under his bed, is very aware of that space and tempted to take a peek once in a while," he says. Rangarajan suggests that while there is a genuine interest to stay in the loop, it could make sense to readapt the once-practiced schedule of television news consumption. "Like how we used to watch the news once in the morning and once in the evening, limit what you consume." While working online all day, he says, tell yourself, you will not read or watch anything related to Covid-19 beyond two specific time periods, and consciously tell those sending WhatsApp forwards all day to stop. "You’re not missing anything, this too shall pass."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/to-lift-your-spirits-stop-the-scroll/articleshow/82347550.cms||---
---||India||‘Oxygen shortage’ in two Andhra Pradesh hospitals kill 16 Covid patients||TIRUPATI: In two separate shocking incidents, 16 Covid-19 patients died for alleged want of oxygen supply in Anantapur and Kurnool cities in Andhra Pradesh on Saturday. While 11 patients died at Anantapur government general hospital reportedly due to low pressure in oxygen pipeline, five others died at a private hospital in Kurnool. According to Anantapur joint collector Nishanth Kumar, 21 Covid-19 patients died at the Anantapur GGH since Friday due to “various reasons”. He, however, did not elaborate what the “various reasons” are. But, the relatives of the deceased told mediapersons that doctors of the GGH had themselves confirmed that there was a low pressure in the oxygen supply system, which resulted in the high mortality. On the other hand, Anantapur district collector G Chandrudu said there was no shortage of oxygen in the district. But following complaints of low pressure, the entire pipeline was thoroughly checked. “Oxygen supply related complaints are being attended to and being sorted out,” he said. Earlier, five Covid patients died at a private hospital in Kurnool on Saturday allegedly for want of oxygen. The hospital has set up a Covid care centre without the requisite permission of the state government. The managing director of the hospital was arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/oxygen-shortage-in-two-andhra-pradesh-hospitals-kill-16-covid-patients/articleshow/82349671.cms||Sandeep Raghavan
---||Allahabad||Carrying bodies to cremation ghats since15 years: Story of a Muslim devout||Prayagraj: In the current Covid times, when people are struggling to find a vehicle to carry the bodies of their relatives to the ghats for cremation, a 52-year-old Muslim devout, Faizul Ahmad, is a ‘one-man army’ who is always available to help out others. Faizul has been involved in carrying the bodies to the cremation ghat free of cost for the past 15 years. He reaches the house or the hospital, helps the family in keeping the body in his vehicle, and ferries it to the cremation ghat. Many a time, when there are not enough people to carry the body to the pyre, Faizul even lends his shoulder. Faizul has been doing this selfless work for the past 15 years. Earlier, he used to carry the bodies on his rickshaw-trolly. It was around ten years ago when he purchased a second-hand vehicle from his savings and donations from the people he knew in the city. He then converted this vehicle into a ‘shav-vahan’ (vehicle to carry the bodies). Since then, this samaritan of the Sangam city has been helping the public, police, district administration, hospitals, etc, in carrying the bodies to the ghats and graveyards free of cost. “I don’t charge anything for my service. Whatever contribution is made by the people I help adds to my savings, from which the salary of the vehicle’s driver and diesel are met out. I don’t keep anything for myself,” says Faizul, who lives with his mother. His father had died many years ago. Because of his 24*7 engagement, Faizul is not able to keep Roza. Faizul says, “It is not that I don’t pray to Allah, but I do apologize to Him. I believe doing good to people is nothing less than a prayer. Owing to my round-the-clock duty towards humankind, I am unable to keep Roza.” In order to be able to continue social service, Faizul decided not to marry. He says, “If I got married, I might not be able to do enough for the people. My family responsibilities would hinder my social obligations and my work. This is why, I haven’t married till date.” “This noble work of Faizul is the need of the hour and is being recognised more these days when the relatives of many Covid victims turn their back towards them, and do not come forward to take the bodies. In such a crisis, this selfless man comes to the rescue, who not only takes the bodies to the cremation ghat, but also lends his shoulder to the body till the pyre,” says Dr Santosh Singh, who has been treating Covid patients at SRN hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/carrying-bodies-to-cremation-ghats-since15-years-story-of-a-muslim-devout/articleshow/82347858.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: HC asks state why Rs 50L cover for frontline staff not extended||Mumbai: Bombay high court has questioned the state government as to why it has not extended Rs 50 lakh insurance cover for Covid frontline workers who die while performing their duty, beyond December 31, 2020. A bench of justices K K Tated and Nitin Borkar on Thursday heard a petition by Dilip Sawant, an assistant section officer in high court, seeking directions to the state to continue operation of the May 29, 2020 government resolution till the pandemic is officially declared “completely over”. The petition said the government resolution is not continued after December 31, 2020. Sawant’s petition states that following the Centre, the state government on May 29, 2020 announced Rs 50 lakh insurance cover for health care workers, police personnel and others. During last year’s lockdown, high court staff were called to work to keep the court functional to conduct online hearing and physical hearing of some cases. Two high court employees and a number of lower court staff died due to Covid last year. In November 2020, two petitions were filed to include employees of lower courts and high curt in the scheme. These petitions were disposed of on March 18, 2021 after the state informed of its January 28, 2021 decision to bring court staff under the purview of the resolution. Thereafter, Sawant learnt that the resolution was initially valid till September 30, 2020 and extended till December 31, 2020. He did not find any order/circular extending its operation beyond December 31, 2020. His petition says the Centre’s original scheme is still in force and “it is not known how the state government could effectively close the said scheme”. Also, the State kept the high court “in the dark on the correct status” of the government resolution in the earlier proceedings. The petition refers to the second wave that started in the state, contributing to 50 % of the national figure of positive patients. It informs that many high court staff have tested positive and two died. Further, that the “said insurance scheme is, in fact, required now more than at any time’’ and the state not extending it will have “demoralising effect” on frontline workers. Sawant’s advocate Ramesh Ramamurthy argued that the fact that the scheme was not extended beyond December 31, 2020 was not informed to anyone. The judges then asked when the Central government has extended the scheme by a year, why the state cannot do so. They asked the government pleader to take instructions and inform at the next hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-asks-state-why-rs-50l-cover-for-frontline-staff-not-extended/articleshow/82348559.cms||Rosy Sequeira

New commodities too were drawn from roads to tracks. The goods trains carried 26.84 million tonnes, of which the load of food grains, fertilizers, iron ore, cement and raw material for steel plants and automobiles increased substantially when compared to the previous year, as per the report submitted for the last financial year.Material which would not be carried on trains earlier, such as automobiles, gypsum, super phosphate, boilers, tractors, clinker, limestone and cement, harvesters, power tillers and mosquito nets were transported by trains to the tune of 4.42 million tonnes which raked in Rs 54 crore. As parcel bookings were made easy, 37 parcel trains were operated to Patel Nagar, Rajkot and Guwahati, often moving items needed for Covid-19 precautions and control earning Rs 70.8 crore, an 8% increase.Food grains, fertilizers and raw materials for steel plants recorded loading in excess of target. While the load of raw material for steel increased by 200% at 1.87 million tonnes, food grains registered an increase of 70% with 1.76 million tonnes. Further, at least 4.43 million tonnes of fertilizers were loaded, notching up its increase by 23.6% compared to the same period in the previous year.“These goods were carried by trains after officials carried out a marketing drive after forming business development units at the zonal level and at the divisions,” said a senior official.As the lines were not congested, goods trains could be operated at a double the speed from 28.22kmph to 45.54kmph making movement of goods more viable by trains than roads. “There was a substantial increase in movement of goods during the pandemic time. The number of passengers were low because the trains were suspended and the services resumed much later. The number of passenger carrying trains increased when services resumed,” he said.Southern Railway has now resumed 75% of mail and express trains and also all suburban trains.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/goods-trains-moved-26-8m-tonnes-during-the-pandemic/articleshow/82347554.cms||---

Doctors who are tackling home-care patients too are feeling the heat, especially amid lack of adequate resources and increasing number of Covid-19 patients. There are various forms of home care services available to Covid patients taking treatment at home which include daily/ weekly doctor visit, paramedic supervision and check-up and tele-consultation from time to time. However, several private hospitals and doctors who offered home care services have stopped accepting more patients. “Home care services are typically availed by patients who have high severity of infection or those who are elderly or have co-morbid conditions. However, the cases have increased to such an extent that doctors often complete their visits way past midnight. Home care doctors are so overburdened that many are unable to meet the growing demand for their services or at least avoid daily visits,” said Dr Mona Desai, president, Ahmedabad Medical Association. “As hospital beds are not available, many Covid patients prefer home treatment. However, with the alarming rise in cases and shortage of resources, home care services too are getting stretched,” said Desai. Ahmedabad has some 64,199 active cases as on date. Shortage of doctors, paramedics and even resources, especially oxygen and medicines is yet another challenge faced by private hospitals and individual doctors providing home care services.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/homecare-services-struggle-to-serve/articleshow/82347868.cms||---

As per rules, employees under suspension are eligible for subsistence allowance ranging from 50% to 75% of their last drawn basic salary.According to the petitioner, he was working as a sanitary inspector and was caught taking a bribe of Rs 2,000 in 2009. Subsequently, he was convicted by a special court in 2020 and sentenced to four years of rigorous imprisonment. Since a parallel proceeding was initiated by the department for the same charges, the petitioner moved the court to quash the same.“It is painful to note that several talented persons have been working temporarily in government departments under contractors, especially in PWD, under non-muster roll for years together without regularisation. Whereas, corrupt officials, who were under suspension, are paid all the monetary benefits,” the court said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/sad-that-corrupt-and-suspended-officers-are-paid/articleshow/82347557.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Though I have someone who walks him every day, it wasn’t possible once I began quarantining at home.”And that’s when she decided to send him to a pet boarding facility. “He is a rescue dog and has separation and anxiety issues so I was apprehensive. But he has settled in well and taken to the people there. They send me videos regularly and now that I see he is happy, it’s a huge pressure off me,” says Meera, a resident of Anna Nagar.While some pet boardings did close during the pandemic, several others have come forward to help pet parents who contract Covid-19. They have staff who come donned in PPE kits to pick up the pet, ensure that the animals stick to their daily routines and keep the owners regularly updated.Linda Alexander, who runs Pet Paws in Nungambakkam along with her husband Ram Prakash, took care of Coco like her own. “We realised we have to help and began taking in animals last year. The second wave has been bad, in the past one week, we have been getting three to four calls a day,” says Linda, adding that most pet owners call for help as they are unable to cook for the animals or take them on walks. “If they are hospitalised it’s worse, and sometimes relatives are hesitant to take the animals in.”The staff members follow all safety protocols — they wear PPE kits when they go to pick up the animal, use their own leash, the dog is given a bath as soon as it reaches the facility, the collar is sanitised. “Our driver, Martin, has been really a hero,” she says. The facility has sand pits, toys and lots of space for the animals to wander around. “We also take them for walks and send videos and photos to the owners. We have about 20 dogs now.”Ginger’s Pet Stay in Panaiyur has also been taking in pets. “Many people who are home quarantined are worried how they will manage. Also, even if they decide to keep the pet with them, the animals will keep pawing at the door, and want to be with them,” says Jennifer Jacob-Murali Anand, who runs the facility. “Though we usually don’t do pick-ups and drops, we have begun doing it for pets of Covid-19 patients. We pick up the animal from a non-positive person and follow all safety protocols.”Hotel For Dogs in Akkarai says it has also been getting a lot of requests. “If no one can drop the dog off, we pick it up. We bathe and disinfect the animal and also keepit apart from other dogs for a day. During the second wave we have hosted five dogs,” says Anuj Madathil, in-charge of the facility||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/pet-boarding-comes-to-the-rescue-of-covid-affected/articleshow/82347562.cms||Priya Menon
---||Chennai||HC quashes closure of 186 brick kilns citing procedural violation||Chennai: In a reprieve to 186 brick kilns in Coimbatore which were sealed by the district administration for allegedly encroaching the elephant corridor in the area, Madras high court has set aside the closure orders.Passing the order in a batch of pleas moved by the owners of the brick kilns, Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana made it clear that the closure orders are being set aside only on the ground that those were not issued by the authority vested with such power. The orders were passed by Coimbatore north tahsildar while such power is vested only with the district collector under the Maine and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act and the Tamil Nadu Minor Mineral Concession Rules.The issue pertains to two public interest petitions seeking a direction to the authorities to secure the elephant corridors in the Coimbatore division and to close all illegal brick kilns operating in Thadagam valley. On February 10, the first bench directed the district administration to take immediate remedial measures to ensure that brick kilns function within the parameters set down and upon obtaining licence remain confined to the areas demarcated. Burgeoning brick kilns that encroach into forest lands or elephant corridors should be proceeded against without delay, the order read.Pursuant to the direction, the tahsildar and other officials inspected the kilns and sealed those found to be operating without valid licences. Alleging that the closure order is a colourable exercise of power, the owners of the kilns moved court.Representing the petitioners, senior counsel P Wilson and other counsel contended the principle governing the natural justice theory has been thrown in the air, while passing the impugned orders and thereby they are liable to be quashed.They added the manufacturing activities are done on patta lands of the petitioners or leased-out lands with the consent of the owners and they would not fall under the elephant corridor. Recording the submissions, the court made it clear that it is open to the authorities to take any action against the brick kilns if it is found that the same has been operated without any licence/clearance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/hc-quashes-closure-of-186-brick-kilns-citing-procedural-violation/articleshow/82347560.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Bldr told to pay back couple Rs 5.6 lakh after ‘medical emergency’||Mumbai: Maharashtra Real Estate Appellate Tribunal (MREAT), in a recent judgment, stated that the home-buyers’ right to make a request for reservation of flat includes right to withdraw such a request for reservation of flat. MREAT, while hearing an appeal against a MahaRERA order of October 3, 2019, directed Piramal Estate Pvt Ltd to pay a Thane couple Rs 5.6 lakh, which they had paid in 2019 towards cost of a flat in Vaikunth cluster in Thane. The couple canceled the booking in May and sought a refund due to a medical emergency. While stating that MahaRERA had passed the impugned order without proper application of mind and without correct appreciation of facts, MREAT members Sumant Kolhe and SS Sandhu observed that the clauses, relating to forfeiture of 10% of the price of flat or amount paid till date whichever is lesser in case of withdrawal, in the request for reservation form was an unreasonable, unfair and one-sided condition, and was against the object and purpose of RERA. MREAT members also observed that though this claim of refund was not governed by any specific provision of RERA, it cannot be ignored that the objective of RERA was to protect interests of consumers. Dinesh and Ranjana Humane, represented by advocate Sunil Kewalramani, submitted a form of “request for reservation of flat” on January 29, 2019, and booked a flat in Vaikunth Cluster project, paying more than Rs 1 lakh. They also paid nearly Rs 4.5 lakh on March 1, 2019, towards price of the flat. But due to a medical emergency in the family, they decided to cancel the booking. They requested the promoter to refund Rs 5.6 lakh. But the promoter claimed the amount had been forfeited on account of cancellation, as per clause 17 of form of request for reservation. MREAT observed that the forfeiture clause and clause that allottees had no right to withdraw their request for reservation, was unfair, unreasonable, one-sided and inequitable, and home-buyers cannot be restrained from exercising their right of withdrawing from the project. MREAT also pointed out that such unreasonable and unfair transactions cannot be enforced. The promoter, represented by advocate Abir Patel, argued that allottees claimed relief on the basis of clause 18 of ‘model agreement’ for sale, as given under rules of RERA. Patel also claimed there was no violation of provisions of RERA or rules and regulations and the clause of forfeiture was given in model agreement under RERA rules and was not against its spirit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bldr-told-to-pay-back-couple-rs-5-6-lakh-after-medical-emergency/articleshow/82348615.cms||Sanjeev Devasia

Vaccination of those above 18 years of age was scheduled to start from May 1. However, it was not done due to unavailability of vaccines. May 2 is Sunday and vaccination does not take place on Sundays and it is most likely that there will be no vaccination of 18 plus population on Monday and on Tuesday there is no Covid-19 vaccination as universal vaccination is carried out. As such, it is most likely that vaccination can start on May 5, but the final call will be taken by the government, said sources. Sources said that as of now, only around 1.5 lakh doses of Covaxin has been received. Earlier, the state government had placed order for 45 lakh doses of Covisheild but it is yet to be received. The registration of vaccination on Cowin portal and Arogya Setu app started on April 28, and is going on people who have registered themselves will not have to register again, once the vaccination start date is finalised, they will just have to choose the available site, date and time on first come, first served basis, said sources. The government is now shifting the vaccination centres outside the hospitals, so that people could participate without any restraint and at each centre there would be two teams one for the 18 to 44 age group and other for the 60 plus and 45 plus age group, added sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/wait-for-v-day-gets-longer-for-18-govt-yet-to-fix-date/articleshow/82347569.cms||Amarjeet Singh
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: ‘Greed motivating some docs, staffers’||AHMEDABAD: The state has so far registered 23 complaints for black-marketing or sale of spurious remdesivir injections and in about 50 per cent of cases, officials found the involvement of hospital staff or even doctors. “It is just sheer greed that is leading doctors and those involved directly with the patient’s treatment to black-market remdesivir injections. In more than 10 cases it has been established that hospital staff including pharmacists were directly involved in black-marketing of the drug. In two or three cases, the direct involvement of pharmacists was found,” said a senior police officer. Officials said in Surat a doctor and three others were held for allegedly black-marketing remdesivir injections in the last week of April. In another incident, two homeopathy doctors were among five persons arrested this week. In Vadodara, where 90 injections were seized, the accused acquired them from the store of a hospital in Kalali. In Ahmedabad, in the case of Shifa Hospital, police uncovered the involvement of a nurse who wrote bogus prescriptions on the letterhead of the hospital. “Basically, it is the greed to make quick money which lures hospital staff and doctors to black-market the injection. In many cases, staff and doctors have made bogus medical histories and got injections to sell in the market. Officials said it remains to be investigated if the staffers got the injection in the name of the patients and then told relatives to procure them, citing the shortage.” A senior officer said that where the involvement of pharmacists or doctors is not fully established, there remains the possibility that they may be involved . Director general of police Ashish Bhatia said, “The involvement of doctors or pharmacists or hospitals are established in some cases and it is just greed which is resulting in black marketing. We are keeping vigil,” he said. Another crime branch officer said that in one case in Ahmedabad, a plant operator who was working Rs 17,000 per month had made over Rs 2.4 lakh by pilfering 80-odd injections. The money he made was equivalent to 14 months of salary. The officer said barring one incident, such accused had not risked the lives of patients. Only in one incident, in Nikol, an accused mixed sterilised water in an injection, but a doctor would never use such an injection for patients. In Vadodara, labels were pasted on piperacillin and tazobactam injections and some 5,000 such injections were sold as remdesivir.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/greed-motivating-some-docs-staffers/articleshow/82347572.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Court denies bail to man accused of raping aunt||Mumbai: A 28-year-old man accused of raping his 35-year-old aunt was denied bail despite the victim submitting that she had no objection to his release. The sessions court found that the woman had done so only on the “request” of their family members. “In such circumstances, at this stage, the court is not inclined to release the accused on bail even after considering her affidavit. Let the police file the final report, and thereafter, it can be considered, that too, on merits,” the court said. The woman, a mother of two, admitted that she was also forced to file another complaint with the cops after the accused had been threatening and abusing her to take back the rape complaint. It is the the prosecution’s case that the accused was residing at the woman’s house. On November 9, 2020, her husband and she had gone for work. It was alleged that she returned home around 2pm for lunch. The prosecution submitted that the accused drove her children out of the house. When she asked him not to drive them out, he told her that they were creating a ruckus. It was further alleged that he then closed the door, windows and raped her. He then left the house and went to reside at Dadar. Ultimately, she disclosed the incident to her husband and the criminal offence was lodged. The accused absconded and was arrested in the case last month.

According to Almora SSP Pankaj Bhatt, the three men were found with a 14-year-old girl by a few villagers. Thereafter, they were thrashed by the locals. Following the incident, Bhanu’s brother Govind Joshi approached the police with a complaint on Thursday. "We have nabbed five accused, including the father of the minor girl and the former sarpanch of Rubaal village, so far. Further probe is underway," added SSP Bhatt.

Taking a serious view of this, two panchayats, Salvador do Mundo and Penha de Franca, on Saturday adopted a voluntary lockdown, which will be on till May 9. Stores selling essentials will be open from 6am to 11am and pharmacies will be allowed to operate through the day, the panchayats said. “On Saturday, the first day of the voluntary lockdown, we received good response from the people. We had created awareness and, with the cooperation from the villagers, it was a 100% lockdown post 11am,” said Sandeep Salgaokar, sarpanch of Salvador do Mundo, not ruling out the possibility of extending the lockdown beyond May 9 if cases in Porvorim do not show a drop. Salgaonkar said the rising number of Covid-19 patients in his village is posing a challenge for the panchayat officials. “We constantly get calls from villagers to arrange beds for them and to help with other medical aid. I have lost a 35-year-old friend on Saturday and my own relatives are battling Covid-19 in the hospital. The state government should have imposed a lockdown, but as it hasn’t, we took the step so we do not lose any more lives in our village,” he said. In both panchayats, the lockdown is set to be lifted as of now on May 10 morning. Penha de Franca sarpanch Swapnil Chodankar said that the Malim jetty, which comes under its jurisdiction, has also been asked to shut its fish trade at 11am. “Wine shops, restaurants have been asked to shut. We have told supermarkets to mark spots at entry points to ensure social distancing when it operates upto 11am. We are also going around monitoring the situation. Even today there were two Covid deaths in my panchayat, yesterday there were four deaths. My intention is that people should stay indoors and save their own lives,” said Chodankar. He said that the local MLA, police officials and the collector have been informed of the voluntary lockdown. “We are not forcing anyone, but we have appealed to the villages to stay indoors and we have received good response,” said Chodankar. “It will be good if the state government imposes a lockdown as we are unable to control the people walking in from other village panchayats, like Socorro, where there are many active cases as well,” Salgoankar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/two-panchayats-in-porvorim-adopt-voluntary-lockdown/articleshow/82347893.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Spurned lover attacks woman with acid||AHMEDABAD: Sola police has on Friday registered a case for voluntarily causing grievous hurt by use of acid against one Hitesh Solanki, a resident of Ranip. Solanki allegedly threw a corrosive liquid, most likely acid on her face and on her hand. The 33-year-old woman, a resident of Sola, stated that Solanki attempted to throw a corrosive liquid, most likely acid, on her face. She stated that she had met Hitesh, who is 39-years-old, when she went to Kaligam for a library course. She said that the two fell in love and Hitesh told her that his family would not accept the relationship. He married her in court and kept her at a separate house. The complainant said that during her stay there, she learned that Hitesh was already married and had two children. She then divorced him and started staying with her parents. Currently, she was staying as a paying guest and Hitesh used to follow her, harass her and try to talk to her. He told her he could not live without her. When the complainant rebuffed him, he took her to a secluded spot on SG Road and tried to persuade her. As the complainant refused him, Hitesh took out a bottle and threw an acid like liquid on her face. She pushed him away and the acid fell on her hand. She began shouting for help and Hitesh left her at the spot and ran away. The complainant claimed that she somehow reached SG Road and was rescued by a police vehicle who took her to a hospital. She filed a complaint against Hitesh under Section 326 (B) of the Indian Penal Code (causing grievous hurt by use of acid).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/spurned-lover-attacks-woman-with-acid/articleshow/82347580.cms||---

The new high-capacity furnace will be able to cremate at least 10 bodies per day. It will operate at 18-kilowatt power supply and produce 1,000 degree Celsius of heat. The furnace will cremate a body within 40 minutes. Moreover, one furnace out of total four at the electric crematorium were made functional on Saturday. After overheating, all the four furnaces at the Tajganj crematorium had stopped functioning two days ago. The exterior part of the furnaces made of iron had melted. Tajganj crematorium in-charge Sanjeev Kumar Gupta said, “On Saturday, one furnace was made operational. Mechanics are working to repair the remaining three furnaces. The work will be completed within the next 48 hours. We are also working to set up a high-capacity furnace at the electric crematorium. It will help in reducing waiting time for cremations.” Caretakers at the crematorium said the number of bodies arriving here has jumped five-fold in the last two weeks. Since Friday evening, 75 bodies have been consigned to flames. Earlier, 15 bodies used to be cremated per day on an average, they pointed out. Chief medical officer (CMO) of Agra district Dr RC Pandey said, “In 24 hours, eight Covid-19 patients have died in Agra district. The huge rush at crematoriums may be due to some other reasons." The CMO didn't spell out the "other reasons" though. Scenes at the crematoriums tell a different story. With barely any space to stand, families of the deceased are not allowed to even wait inside the compound. Interestingly, as per the ritual, cremations are usually avoided after sunset. But, in the last few days, the bodies are being cremated right through the night, a local said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/tajganj-electric-crematorium-to-get-one-more-furnace-1-repaired/articleshow/82347578.cms||Deepak Lavania

Senior police officials took rounds of the city to check people not coming out of their homes. Cops also kept eye from the CCTVs installed in different city areas and tipped the local police teams. DIG Bhopal hit the streets on a routine basis and took action against the people venturing out without any valid reason. The police officials arrested the people unnecessary moving out, sent them to the police stations concerned of the area and later released them after completing the formalities. Officials said two buses move in different city areas to take the people moving out to the police stations. Objective is to give a message that tough action would be taken on venturing out during the pandemic. However, officials ruled out to detain such people overnight like done in the state's industrial capital Indore, pointing that it would leave the possibility of spread of coronavirus. Police remained on toes in different city areas and allowed people on streets only with a serious valid reason. Barricading and diversions were put in place to restrict the vehicular movement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/55-more-booked-for-lockdown-violation/articleshow/82347585.cms||---

In a communiqué issued on May 1 by UWB chief executive officer Dr Ahmed Iqbal, the local administration has been asked to shut down three Sufi shrines — Dargah Sabir Pak, Dargah Imam Sahib and Dargah Kilkili Shah Sahab. The statement added that all three shrines have been vacated and fully sanitized. Meanwhile, social workers say that closing down the shrines under the Uttarakhand Waqf Board will increase pressure on other three shrines — Dargah Abdal Shah, Dargah Gayab Ali Shah and Dargah Baba Jilani — which are owned by private individuals. "The UWB should reconsider its decision as the crowd at other shrines (not under UWB control) will now increase, thereby, increasing the risk of transmission of Covid-19," said social worker Rao Shah Nawaz Khan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-waqf-board-asks-admin-to-shut-shrines-in-roorkee/articleshow/82347194.cms||Tapan Susheel

According to the complaint by head constable Ravirajsinh Natubha, he and other police staff members were on duty in Vejalpur and were on patrol to see that no crowds were gathering in the bylanes. On Friday evening, he noticed a group of 30 or 40 people gathered outside a place of worship. Seeing the police vehicle, these people dispersed immediately and ran into the nearby houses. However, two people were caught standing near the area. One of them, a 65-year-old man, told police that he was the priest of the religious place and the other person was his assistant. The cops asked him why they had gathered 40 people and why no social distancing was followed. The priest did not have an answer but said that they had come for community prayers and were dispersing before the police came. Natubha in his complaint has charged the two under Section 188 of the IPC (disobedience to an order duly promulgated by public servant) and Section 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/two-booked-for-leading-prayers/articleshow/82347586.cms||---

Amid the pandemic, the families are running from pillar to post to ensure dignity in death for their loved ones. The lockdown has restricted families from conducting even the last rituals for the dead. Photo studios and frame shops are shut. Finding even a decent framed photo for the rituals has become a mammoth task. RTI activist Dharmendra Singh Gour lost his cousin Mahendra Singh Gour to Covid on April 29. After Mahendra’s funeral, the biggest challenge for mouring Gour was to arrange a framed photograps for the rituals. “Due to the curfew all photo studios are shut. I tried my best to arrange his pic but I am still not able to arrange it,” said Gour. He is now making efforts to get the framed photograps from other city. “I am trying to get the photographs from an other city. However, it will consume a lot of time as movements on roads too are not allowed. This is really a painful. What days are these when we can not even get a framed photograph of the departed soul for the last rituals.” Kartik Mishra, an entrepreneur, faced similar problem. He lost his father while he was in hospital. Kartik too was admitted to a hospital after being infected with Covid while his sister Kanupriya Sharma, his only family, was in Bengaluru. “Kin had gathered to pay tributes my father. Amid the pain of losing him, we had to leave everything and struggle to get his framed photograph. I had to manage it from my brother’s friend who happened to be a journalist. I can’t even imaging the pain of others who can not get their kin’s picture to pay them floral tributes.” Said Kanupriya. Vikas Das lost his uncle Sukh Sagar Das to Covid. “I knew a photographer. On my request, he agreed to provide me the photograph. But even getting the printed picture from his place to my home was an herculian task due to the Corona Curfew,” said Vikas. When contacted, photo-studio owners said the business is down to the curbs. “Only 30% photo studios are left now in Bhopal. Forget orders for marriages and birthdays, finding an order even for the last rituals is tough now. All that we can wish is end of all these bad days,” said a senior photographer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/studios-shut-getting-framed-photo-for-last-rituals-turns-painful/articleshow/82347587.cms||---
---||Mumbai||992 in 18-44 group get first shot in Mumbai; 11,492 in Maharashtra||MUMBAI: The first day of the Covid-19 vaccination drive for the 18-44 age-group got off to a soft start in Maharashtra on Saturday, with 11,492 getting the shot in 26 districts. Of these, 992 recipients were from Mumbai. The ‘token’ round (Maharashtra has been vaccinating around 3 lakh a day on an average before the vaccine stockout earlier in the week) was held because chief minister Uddhav Thackeray wanted the induction of the 18-44 age-group – the biggest section in the state with comprising 6.5 crore people -- into the vaccine drive to coincide with Maharashtra Day, the state’s foundation day, on May 1. Pune witnessed the highest vaccinations with 1,316 shots, while Nagpur saw 252 and Nashik 247. Mumbai’s neighbours, Thane and Palghar, managed 611 and 700 respectively. On Sunday, each of the five centres in Mumbai will vaccinate 500 people in the 18-44 age-group while the question mark over vaccination for the 45-plus age-group continues. In Mumbai, the vaccination centres saw small crowds around 9 am as youngsters who had registered themselves turned up for vaccination. “We could only take 200 who had registered and taken an appointment on CoWin. No walk-in appointments are allowed for this age-group,” said Dr B Adsul, dean of Seven Hills Hospital, Andheri, where 200 got vaccinated on Saturday. The other centers were Nair Hospital at Mumbai Central, the BKC jumbo Covid centre, Cooper Hospital in Juhu and Rajawadi Hospital in Ghatkopar. “We got help from the police who stood at the gate and screened people and only allowed those with appointments to come into the hospital,” said Rajawadi Hospital medical superintendent Dr Vidya Thakur. Byculla resident Imran Abbas Sayyed, along with his wife and sister, was among the 992 people who got the shot in Mumbai on Saturday. “My parents have been inoculated, and they wanted us to take the vaccine at the earliest. While there was a crowd initially, only those with registration were allowed to enter,” said Sayyed, who took the vaccine at Nair Hospital at Mumbai Central. Ghatkopar resident Rachit Maru, 26, reached Rajawadi Hospital at 10.30 am to take the jab. “I run a tours and travel business and wanted to get vaccinated at the earliest. Also, many of my friends have concerns about the vaccine, I therefore wanted to put their concerns to rest,” he said. Vile Parle resident Kshitij Janve, 26, went to the nearby Cooper Hospital along with his younger brother and his friends. “It was well-managed, and social distancing was maintained there. We reached at 2.15 pm and were out by 3.30 pm,” said Janve, an architect.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/992-in-18-44-group-get-first-shot-in-mumbai-city-11492-in-state/articleshow/82347909.cms||Richa Pinto

The university authorities are trying to ascertain if these candidates were genuine students in the first place. “So many students not registering for the exams could be a result of bogus or fake admissions,” said a senior GTU official. “We are looking into that aspect as well.” As many as 6,900 diploma students did not take the pre-trial test at GTU. The university has decided to hold online exams between May 4 and May 13. The university conducted a trial on April 27 for diploma and degree engineering students. Of the total 33,000 students of diploma engineering courses, over 6,000 did not participate in the pre-trial test, said sources. The trial is mandatory before taking the semester exams. The first semester exams for degree and diploma candidates will be held between May 4 and May 13 online. The exam paper will be in the MCQ format.

---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Only 22 turn-up at Railway’s isolation coaches in a week||BHOPAL: Lukewarm response has been witnessed for the isolation coaches at platform no-6 of Bhopal railway station. In the past one week, only 22 patients have turned up while the capacity is 320 beds. District administration had started the facility for Covid patients in the form of train isolation coaches at Nishatpura coach factory with necessary facilities. Bhopal railway handed over the train to district administration on April 24. ADM Umrao Maravi told TOI that six patients have been discharged after the treatment. “At present 16 patients are there in the isolation coaches,” said Maravi. He added that people will gradually start coming in the future. Officials said that the low number of patients for isolation coaches might have been because of that several people are still unknown about it. “People will start coming when they feel comfortable. Majority of the people are taking treatment at home or going to hospital,” said an official without quoting his name. District administration officials have made it clear that the isolation coaches admit only those patients who do not have the facility of being isolated at their homes. “There is no oxygen or ventilator facility in isolation coaches. Any patient who feels that he does not need oxygen and wants to isolate himself can avail the facility,” said Maravi. Sources said that Bhopal railway division was also planning to put around 20 isolation coaches at Habibganj station. However, that depends on the response of the patients for the existing isolation coaches that have been put at Bhopal railway station. These coaches are equipped with essential medicines and necessary staff, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/only-22-turn-up-at-railways-isolation-coaches-in-a-week/articleshow/82347591.cms||Ramendra Singh

The magistrate deputed there cited the imposition of section 144 on and around the premises of the sadar hospital. The magistrate said, “Since Section 144 has been clamped around the premises, only patients and their attendants are allowed to enter.” When Pappu tried to reason with the Sadar SDO Vaibhav Shrivastava, he said, “We will have to understand that the rate at which Covid is increasing, the need of the hour is to follow some precautions. We have even reduced the number of attendants of patients who can stay here.” Local JAP leader Raghupati Yadav who had contested the assembly election from the Barhara constituency said, “Our leader, who had arrived at about 7.30am on Sunday, kept on arguing with the Sadar SDO for about an hour, but he was not allowed to enter the sadar hospital. He then interacted with some attendants of the patients outside the hospital gate and came to know about their grievances.” Later addressing a press conference, the JAP supremo lashed out at the state government. “I have been visiting various hospitals in Bihar to see the arrangements for Covid patients, but I was not stopped anywhere. Now it seems that the government is trying to hide its shortcomings. I was able to talk to some attendants of the patients outside the gate of the sadar hospital, who complained about the problem of water and hygiene. Private hospitals are minting money as government hospitals have failed to provide quality treatment to the common man .” “The government should have set up some oxygen plants 13 months back. Now there is no oxygen, no beds and no ventilators for common man. People have been left to die. There was no debate on the health system by the government. They are only concerned with politics,” added Pappu. It may be mentioned here that the Bhojpur unit of JAP-L sat on an indefinite fast on the sadar hospital premises on Saturday morning to press for their demand for better treatment for Covid patients. However, all the members sitting on fast were taken into custody in the evening and brought to the Town police station. They were given assurance that their demand will be considered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/japl-chief-prevented-from-entering-ara-hospital/articleshow/82359819.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: CBI gets week-long custody of GST official||HYDERABAD: Officials of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) took GST official Bollineni Gandhi into custody for questioning after shifting him from Chanchalaguda central jail to the investigation agency’s office at Koti. Gandhi was arrested by the central agency in a disproportionate assets (DA) case on April 20 and later shifted to jail. The CBI court has granted Bolineni’s custody for seven days. It may be recalled that despite the serving of several notices by the CBI, the accused official had refused to extend his cooperation. In July 2019, the investigation agency had conducted searches on Gandhi’s properties in Hyderabad and Vijayawada and unearthed assets worth Rs 4 crore which were deemed to be beyond his known sources of income. Gandhi is also involved in another case along with another GST official, Chilaka Sudha Rani, in a Rs 5 crore bribery scandal. The CBI, on July 8, 2019, had registered a disproportionate assets case against Gandhi and his wife under charges of illegally possessing assets to the tune of Rs 3.8 crore. But the accused reportedly did not cooperate with the investigation agency and also did not furnish the requisite information or documents pertaining to the case. While seeking his custody, the CBI said that Gandhi had influenced some key witnesses from joining the investigation. The investigation agency also charged the accused of submitting false Covid-19 positive reports in the name of his family members in an attempt to evade arrest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cbi-gets-week-long-custody-of-gst-official/articleshow/82347756.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

Late on Friday night, the duo also gave up their lives in the line of duty in the same hospital, engulfed in the fire that killed 16 other patients too. Madhavi Padhiyar, a resident of Bharuch town, and Fariga, who stayed in Ankleshwar, were probably the youngest among the victims. Madhavi’s father Mukesh is a tour operator, while her mother Seema works at a public health centre in Amod taluka of Bharuch. She is survived by a younger brother who studies in Class 11. Madhavi’s uncle Jignesh said that she was pursuing a two-year nursing course in a nursing college. She was posted as a trainee for Covid duty at Welfare Hospital on the orders of the district administration. Fariga too was a trainee nurse at the hospital. At about 12.50 am, when fire broke out in the hospital, Fariga’s PPE kit caught fire. Madhavi, who was nearby, immediately rushed in to save Fariga, but her PPE kit too caught fire. The duo ran towards the bathroom and tried to douse the flames with water, but it was too late. After dousing the blaze, when firemen reached inside they found both Madhavi and Fariga dead in the bathroom. ‘My PPE kit was burning, I rushed out’ Charmi Gohil, another trainee nurse who witnessed the entire incident, said that a spark in a ventilator near bed number 5 started the fire. “My PPE kit also got burnt. But when Madhavi and Fariga rushed to the bathroom, I headed for the door amid all the smoke. I knew where the exit was as I had worked in the ICU for 15 days. I removed the kit when I reached safety,” said Charmi, who suffered burns on her legs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/two-19-year-old-trainee-nurses-die-in-the-line-of-duty/articleshow/82346838.cms||Tushar Tere

---||Ahmedabad||Vacations: Govt, varsities not on same page||Ahmedabad: There seems to be a lack of coordination between the universities and the state government over summer vacations. Several universities have recently announced vacations on their own. So the government, it appears, was compelled to announce a common vacation schedule before more universities came forward with such announcements, said sources aware of the matter. The Gujarat government announced vacations for all universities and colleges in the state from May 1 to June 5 amid the prevailing Covid-19 situation. A few universities had declared vacations ahead of the state government’s announcement due to the worsening Covid-19 situation. For instance, North Gujarat University announced its May vacation a few days ago. On Friday, ahead of the state’s announcement, Gujarat Technological University announced its vacation from May 3 to June 2. “There was pressure from faculty and other staff members to announce the summer vacation from May,” said a source in GTU. “Since there was no such announcement till the last week of April, the universities began announcing vacations on their own.” The decision by the state government came after concerns were raised by student bodies and faculty members against the instruction to staff and faculty members to work at colleges and universities. The government had made it compulsory for colleges and universities to continue running at half the staff strength on the rotational basis. The government began re-opening schools and colleges from January this year after they had remained closed for over nine months due to Covid-19. But soon the government decided to shut them down as Covid-19 cases began rising in the state. Online education resumed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/vacations-govt-varsities-not-on-same-page/articleshow/82347599.cms||---

Similarly, Saina Nehwal would travel pillion on her father’s scooter for 13 kilometres to reach LB Stadium while PV Sindhu’s father would take her for practice daily, to an academy 30 kilometres away from their home. These stories are now part of badminton folklore. Things haven't changed much over the years. Even today, parents of budding stars are making lagre sacrifices to fulfill their children’s dreams. Some of them have even gone to the extent of leaving the country they are living in and giving up their jobs to help their wards realise their passion. This is the story of three non-resident Indians (NRIs) who have travelled all the way from the Gulf to admit their children in the Pullela Gopichand Badminton Academy (PGBA) in the city. One of them is Tanisha Crasto, who is regarded as one of the brightest prospects for India. The 17-year-old has already won the Bahrain International Challenge and represented India at the junior international events. The Indian government has included her in the Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS) last year. But nothing came easy for Tanisha. She was born and brought up in Dubai. When her parents, who are originally from Goa, noticed her talent, they put her in a Dubai academy in 2008. Within 10 years Tanisha had won over 400 medals. The challenge now for Tanisha’s father, Clifford, was to find a quality training center for his daughter. After a few attempts to get her into one of India’s premier academies failed, he enrolled her with Goa’s badminton association. Clifford, thereafter, was forced to take one of the biggest decisions of his life. He gave up his lucrative IT job and started travelling with Tanisha. Father and daughter would travel twice a month from Dubai to India between 2016 and 2018 as she was not able to get admission into India’s top academies in India. However, Tanisha’s talent got the due recognition when she was invited to join the PGBA here. A relieved Clifford now wanted to get back to work. But he failed to get a job and the Covid-19 situation accentuated the crisis “I had to give up my job as there is no other option. I can’t send a girl who is just 15 to India. So, we had to take the tough decision. It was not easy to shuttle between Dubai and India twice a month,” Clifford told STOI from Dubai, adding that his foray into business had backfired. Like Clifford, Prakash Kurbkhelgi also quit his job to help his daughter Sakshi. Prakash was with the Dubai government for 13 years but once his daughter started doing well in badminton, he had set up three courts near his home to nurture her talents. Now, those three courts have become 13 and he has set up three academies - two in Sharjah and one in Dubai. Sakshi lived up to expectations and became the state champion of Goa, helping her secure an admission to Gopichand academy. “It was tough to quit a good job you have been doing for 13 years but I had to make the decision. My friends, who noticed Sakshi’s talent, helped me set up the badminton facility here. Now she is training with Gopichand and we are quite happy about it,” Prakash told STOI from UAE. While Tanisha and Sakshi have already settled in Hyderabad, 15-year-old Rajatraj Ramesan will be joining the Gopichand academy in the near future, the second wave of Covid-19 delaying his arrival. Following the advice of Rajatraj’s local coach in Qatar, his father Ramesan Koliyat had approached Gopichand last year. However, it’s not just NRI parents who are moving such great distances; there are several others from far-off places within India who have sacrificed their careers to nurture their children’s talent. One of them is Riza Mehreen’s mother who gave up her career as an architect to travel with her daughter. Chief coach Pullela Gopichand said that India’s model of sports is not an IIT model but a road to IIT model. “Indian parents pushing for sports is a welcome change. Many from all over the country and some even from abroad have given up their jobs to help their kids,” Gopichand said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/parents-of-prodigies-ensure-no-gulf-separates-their-child-from-their-passion/articleshow/82347814.cms||---

The chief minister Pramod Sawant on Friday said the government would not extend the lockdown, which ends on Monday morning. Speaking to reporters, Dhavalikar said that he expected that Covid cases would drop after the lockdown, but they remained the same. “I have appealed to the the state government to continue the lockdown, but the government has not reacted,” he said. He also said that the vaccine is not available for those in the 18-45 age group. “The health department and Goa government is not able to perform its duty,” he said, adding that there are long queues for vaccination. He said there are less than 1 lakh doses in Goa, when 4.5 lakh are required.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hope-hc-takes-suo-motu-orders-lockdown-dhavalikar/articleshow/82347931.cms||---
---||Patna||94 big containment zones in Gaya: DM||GAYA: Though Gaya recorded the second highest Covid cases after Patna on Saturday with 969 people testing positive, the mortality rate in the district is less than other cities of the state. While state average of testing samples for Covid is 1.8 lakh per million, in Gaya it is 2.22 lakh. Additional restrictions have been imposed in the district and it is likely to deliver better results in the next 2-4 days. Now the transmission rate is 16%, and the target is to bring it down to 10%, district magistrate Abhishek Singh said while presenting the statistics at a virtual meeting on Saturday with the public representatives, including MPs of Gaya and Aurangabad, MLAs of all the 10 assembly segments and the MLCs. Singh said there were 8,328 active cases in the district till Saturday. Out of the 22,932 tested positive so far, around 14,000 have recovered, while 117 deaths have been recorded across the district. As the new strain of Covid is more infectious, all efforts are being made to ensure that people follow the Covid protocol. Across the district, 94 big containment zones have been made, which include 49 in urban and 45 in the rural areas. At present, 245 people are in institutional isolation. At Anugrah Narayan Magadh Medical College and Hospital (ANMMCH), 170 patients are undergoing treatment. Apart from this, 500 beds have been kept ready at the dedicated Covid health centres at Bhusunda (Manpur), Tekari, Sherghati, Neemchak Bathani and Gaya town. The DM appealed to the public representatives to motivate people having oxygen level just below 94 to go to the dedicated Covid health centres for treatment. He asked the owners of private hospitals willing to offer treatment facility to contact the civil surgeon. A team would conduct inspection of the hospital to assess treatment, availability of doctors, oxygen and other facilities and submit a report. The DM admitted that people are not very serious about vaccination. Efforts are being made to clear confusion and the rumours about vaccination through miking, pamphlets and other mediums of publicity. According to the data of district health society, against the target to vaccinate 8,64,000 people, only 1,91,687 have taken the first dose and 19,979 the second shots so far. At the meeting, Bodh Gaya MLA Kumar Sarvajeet requested for vaccination in the monasteries of Bodh Gaya and increase the number of beds at Nyingma monastery and other places. Gaya town MLA Prem Kumar suggested to increase the number of beds and the doctors at ANMMCH. Barachatti MLA Jyoti Kumari suggested to engage rural medical practitioners by imparting training to them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/94-big-containment-zones-in-gaya-dm/articleshow/82359786.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Corona curfew in Jabalpur extended till May 17||JABALPUR: Corona curfew has been extended till May 17 in Jabalpur district as the infection continues to spread. Sources said that the increase in cases of infection has also laid bare the tall claims of appropriate medical arrangements in the city. As per the official figures a total of 17,835 people have tested positive for Covid-19 in the district in the month of April alone. With these the tally of positive patients has reached 37,010. Around 71,000 people were tested in April and nearly 25% of them have tested positive, thus every fourth person whose samples were tested was found to be positive. And 157 people have died in the month, as per official records. There are several factors which have led to these dismal figures which include delay in getting test reports, inadequate oxygen and Remdesivir availability. It is even taking more than 4 days to get the report. A bank employee who is resident of Madan Mahal locality of the city said, “It was on the fourth day after the test that he received the report”. Delay in getting test reports is one of the major causes of the spread of infection, and this delay is despite the fact that high court has instructed to ensure reports within 36 hours of test, said sources. Oxygen scarcity is also one of the reasons for high mortality, city’s private hospitals are even informing patients while admitting them, that they are not be held accountable in case there is no oxygen availability, sources said. There is no contact tracing of the Covid-19 positive it has stopped completely. “No one asked me about the people whom I have met, in-fact no one asked me anything”, says a Dhumapur resident covid-19 positive patient. Patients are inadequately provided Remdesivir injections in government hospitals of the city, said kin of patients who were admitted government hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/corona-curfew-in-jabalpur-extended-till-may-17/articleshow/82347600.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Amid rising demand, a peek into Madhya Pradesh’s ‘O2 control room’||BHOPAL: With unprecedented oxygen demand in the second Covid wave, the Madhya Pradesh government set up a special cell of officers to monitor demand and supply and ensure every bit of oxygen the state gets is put to optimum use. Madhya Pradesh is in a unique position in the fight for oxygen — it doesn’t have any major plant of its own and has to manage its needs from other states. This makes having a proper monitoring system all the more important. The special oxygen cell is led by Additional chief secretary (PHE) Malay Shrivastava, MSME secretary Vivek Porwal, and P Narahari, commissioner, food safety and controller, food and drugs administration. The severity and gravity of the situation in MP and possible problems that might come up in the near future were quickly assessed, said an official. Under the directions of ACS-health Mohammed Suleman, an oxygen control room was established at MP Public Health Services Corporation Ltd. A dedicated phone line was installed for districts to call up and explain their issues, and the number was flashed to all districts and nodal officers (oxygen supply). The Control Room functions round the clock. Any emergencies are immediately reported to the senior officers to be resolved, said an official. A team of nine employees of the health corporation handles the calls, with a senior in charge. Five priority districts and 18 priority institutions/medical colleges are have monitored on a regular basis. The GAD posted two officers in the control room who call them up thrice a day — 8am, 2pm and 8pm. Any emergency situation is red flagged and immediately reported to CFDA.

---||Dehradun||Entry of outsiders banned in Corbett, other protected areas also shut till May 15||DEHRADUN: The Uttarakhand government, on Saturday, suspended all kinds of tourism activities, including film-making and research works, in Corbett Tiger Reserve (CTR) and Rajaji Tiger Reserves, wildlife sanctuaries and zoos till May 15. The order in this regard was issued by JS Suhag, chief wildlife warden of the state forest department. The decision has been taken in view of the prevailing Covid-19 situation. According to the order, “all liberties— including investigation or study of wildlife, photography, scientific research and tourism — granted under section 28 of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 have been suspended till May 15.” Meanwhile, it was also decided that those who made bookings at CTR will be given a refund on cancellation. An official of CTR said, “We had tourist bookings almost till May 20. Now, we will refund a collective booking amount of Rs 80 lakh approximately. However, the refund will be made only to those who cancel their bookings. Last year, we had to pay back a cumulative of Rs 5 crore to the tourists who cancelled their bookings in the wake of the coronavirus-induced lockdown.” In yet another development on Saturday, forest officials were given the go-ahead to purchase utilities — like sanitisers, handwash, N95 mask, oximeter, thermometer etc — to the tune of Rs 2-3 lakh per forest division. The decision comes in the wake of frontline forest workers demanding better facilities to fight the ongoing pandemic. Besides, officers of Dehradun, Pauri, Kotdwar, Ramnagar, Haldwani and Nainital forest divisions have been given the additional responsibility of establishing Covid-19 care units, exclusively for the frontline staff of the forest department, in their respective jurisdictions. A letter in this regard, signed by Rajeev Bhartari, head of forest force, reads, “Efforts should be made to establish a Covid-19 care centre in all forest divisions.” In Dehradun, a facility with all necessary infrastructure has been developed in the Chandrabani Transit Hostel. The facility has been kept reserved for the forest officials of the Dehradun division.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/entry-of-outsiders-banned-in-corbett-other-protected-areas-also-shut-till-may-15/articleshow/82347203.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Madurai||11 survivors of ‘hit-and-run’ on high seas return to TN||Thengapattanam (Kanyakumari): There were tears on their eyes as well as those of their relatives as the weary fishermen got down from their damaged boat ‘Mercedes’ at 3.10 pm on Saturday at the Thengapattanam harbour. It was nothing short of a miracle that all 11 of them could be back after their boat was hit by a foreign fishing vessel in mid-sea, about 1,100 kms off Goa a week ago. They had virtually gone missing for four days after that when their relatives even feared the worst could have happened. Recounting the incident, boat owner K Joseph Franklin said they had gone to sleep close to midnight on April 23. There were a few big foreign fishing vessels at a safe distance. “They should be more than twice the length of our boat that is 55 feet long. Their sides were widespread like a bird’s wings extending from their boat’s body,” Joseph said. Around 1 am, they heard a thunderous sound. “The side of a foreign vessel hit our boat’s right. Its protruding side crushed our cabin that is right in the middle of the boat. A plank from my boat hit me and I was thrown into the sea. Six of us were either thrown into the sea or had jumped off the boat fearing for our lives,” he said.Joseph recalled that two men on the vessel realised they hit the boat. “They spoke in their language. For a moment we expected them to extend some help as we were battling for our lives. But they immediately turned off all lights on their vessel and fled,” he said. The cabin of their boat in which important gadgets and support systems are kept was thrown into the sea. “I got on the boat. Five of my men (Freddy, Jegan, John, Jeniston and Yesudhason) were missing. Diesel was leaking from the pipe connecting the tank that was damaged by broken pieces of glass. Priority was to save the men. With only one torch light we rescued four men from the sea by 3 am. Yesudhason was spotted around 7 am clinging to one of the two fibre boats that we brought along,” he said. A Dornier aircraft of ICG spotted them 460 nautical miles (852 kms) away from the accident spot on April 28 as they were heading home. The ICG gave first aid and food to the men and escorted them all the way to Thengapattanam on an interceptor boat. The fishermen were given a hero’s welcome on Saturday as they reached Vallavilai village where a special thanks giving mass was also organised. Those who received them at Vallavilai included Killiyoor MLA S Rajesh Kumar (Congress) and Congress candidate for Kanyakumari Lok Sabha bypoll V Vijayakumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/11-survivors-of-hit-and-run-on-high-seas-return-to-tn/articleshow/82347922.cms||M K Ananth

---||Madurai||Rush to stock O2 piles pressure on supply; sellers jack up prices||Madurai: The mobile phone of N Sivanadian, managing director of Kalyan Oxygen on Madurai-Trichy highway, fails to stop ringing these days as he is besieged by hundreds of people from hospitals, volunteers and relatives of Covid-19 infected people seeking oxygen. Though there is enough oxygen at the moment in most cities and regions, there is scarcity of cylinders to fill it. Apart from hospitals, there is also a demand from people who have returned home from hospital after treatment. “Medical fraternity has made it clear that oxygen is not required for all Covid-19 patients. But people want to stock it to be on the safer side. If people stop looking for oxygen, the stress on the suppliers and demand for cylinders will come down automatically,” Sivanadian said. Suppliers in Madurai say that demand from hospitals has gone up after smaller hospitals also started treating Covid-19 patients. S Kesavan of Shree Meenakshi Gas said the price of an oxygen cylinder with capacity of seven cubic metre, which was Rs 10,000, has risen to Rs 25,000. A smaller one of 1.5 cubic metres capacity, sold for Rs 4,500, has now increased to 14,000. “Once a cylinder is delivered to a patient, we will get it back only after a week. We had 200 cylinders but all of them are now being used,” he said.In Chennai, an oxygen concentrator, which is generally recommended for patients with mild or moderate symptoms, now costs Rs 20,000 a month on rent. The same device, which may cost anywhere between Rs 42,000 to Rs 45,000 in shops, are now sold at Rs 80,000. “There is an acute shortage of oxygen across the city, whether it is a concentrator or a cylinder. Some patients have started stocking without any logic and some people who are taking advantage of the situation to jack up prices,” Dr Avinash Rajkumar, founder and head, NORMS, told TOI. A private oxygen supplier on the Trichy-Thanjavur border said they were supplying 10 metric tonnes of liquid medical oxygen to Mahatma Gandhi memorial GH alone. With the demand up, they have increased the frequency of supply from once in three days to a regular basis.Sivanadian said that a seven cubic metre cylinder full of oxygen at the manufacturing outlet is sold at Rs 280, but some retailers are selling the same for up to Rs 1,500 in the market. The average price of the oxygen in the open market until last week was only Rs 500, which has gone up to Rs 1,000.“There are occasional phone calls from people in faraway places such as Kolkata and New Delhi seeking a cylinder. But we cannot entertain them as we have to concentrate on the local demand,” Sivanadian said. Most multispeciality hospitals in Coimbatore say they have moved to piped oxygen and face no shortage in supply as of now. However, in Trichy, even some of the big hospitals had no liquid oxygen tanks installed. Private hospitals are mulling installation of tanks in the new circumstances.(with inputs from Chennai, Coimbatore, Trichy)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/rush-to-stock-o2-piles-pressure-on-supply-sellers-jack-up-prices/articleshow/82347923.cms||V Devanathan

The accused, identified as Pawan Singh, had duped a Dehradun resident of Rs 25 lakh. The arrest comes after the cybercrime police received a complaint from Prem Nagar-resident Rakesh Rawat, who claimed that he had been duped of Rs 25 lakh. In his complaint, Rawat alleged that the caller introduced himself as an employee of a telecommunication company. The caller told Rawat that he had won a prize of Rs 51 lakh and a four-wheeler. Under the pretext of registration and tax money, the caller lured him to deposit Rs 25 lakh in separate bank accounts. SP STF Ajay Singh told TOI, “We followed the case and traced its roots to Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. Teams were rushed to both these states and the accused was arrested from Arya Nagar area of Kanpur district.” He added that Pawan Singh was a cybercriminal who lured his targets by making lucrative offers. “The gang also defrauded people by telling them that they have been selected as beneficiaries under government schemes,” said the senior police official. While the STF team caught Pawan, the two other members of the gang — Sheelu and Pankaj — are still at large. An amount of Rs 24,500 was recovered from Pawan. According to the police, Sheelu and Pankaj have Rs 10 lakh each. Three mobile phones and five sim cards were also seized from Pawan’s possession.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/stf-arrests-mastermind-of-gang-which-duped-people/articleshow/82347207.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra acting DGP recuses from two Param Bir inquiries||Mumbai: Acting director general of police (DGP) Sanjay Pandey has written to the state government saying he is recusing himself from the task of conducting two inquiries against former city police commissioner Param Bir Singh. Pandey sent the communication after Singh alleged that the acting DGP had offered to mediate in his stand-off with the state government. Singh had telephoned Pandey and recorded the conversation with him, in which the acting DGP allegedly offered to mediate between him and the state government. Singh attached the transcripts of the conversation to a petition he filed in the Bombay high court against the government decision to conduct the two inquiries. Singh challenged the two orders passed on April 1 and 20 by the state and which direct a preliminary inquiry by Pandey under service rules and an inquiry into allegations made by a police inspector against him. Sources said that Pandey wrote to the government denying Singh’s allegations. They said that in his letter Pandey sought his recusal on the grounds that an inquiry conducted by him would be open to accusations of bias in light of recent events. It is learnt that Pandey will also file an affidavit in the Bombay high court when it takes up the matter for hearing. Both Pandey and Singh declined to comment on the matter. Singh’s stand-off with the state government began when he alleged that former home minister Anil Deshmukh had asked some police officers to extort Rs 100 crore per month from bars and restaurants. It was followed by a high court order directing a CBI inquiry into the matter and the resignation of the minister. The CBI conducted a preliminary inquiry and registered an FIR against Deshmukh saying a cognisable offence was made out. Sources said that Singh had called on Pandey after he was made acting DGP and that was when the former brought up his stand-off with the government. Pandey, as head of the state police, said it was for Singh to decide what he wanted to do and offered to help, said a source. Subsequently, Singh called up Pandey and discussed this issue, said the source. Earlier this week, an FIR alleging corruption was registered against Singh at the Akola police station in Vidarbha along with 32 others on a complaint by police inspector Bhimrao Ghadge. Ghadge alleged that when he was posted in Thane, Singh asked him to drop the names of some high-profile persons from a cheating case in Kalyan, but he refused. Ghadge alleged that Singh was upset with Ghadge for not following his directive and implicated him in a false case. The Akola police transferred the case against Singh to Kalyan for investigation as the alleged incident had taken place there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-acting-dgp-recuses-from-two-param-bir-inquiries/articleshow/82348938.cms||Vijay V Singh

The court also ordered the collector to seal all illegal kilns within four weeks.HC judge Pushpa Shakthi Narayana heard a Mandamus writ petition filed by brick kiln owners stating that the kilns were sealed by the north tehsildar, who has no authority to seal them.Kiln owners stated that under the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation). Act, 1957, the collector should initiate proceedings and the revenue divisional officer or district revenue officer should seal the kilns. They also said that all the kilns were sealed on a day.The judge admitted their grievance and said, “Licensed brick kilns can show the court order to the collector and open the kilns with his permission”.However, the petitioners fighting the kilns said none of the kilns have license. “Neither have they got the collector’s permission. How are they operating?” asked petitioner and social activist S Ganesh.As many as 187 brick kilns were sealed in March-end and April based on the HC’s order, issued on February 10.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/illegal-brick-kilns-continue-operations-say-activists/articleshow/82347605.cms||---

The laboratory has successfully processed 10,50,000 samples till date. This is considered as the highest number of tests done among all government laboratories in the state. The lab processed 10,000 samples (7,000 routine and 3,000 election agents samples) successfully in a single day on April 30. “All steps are taken to increase the workforce if it is required to process a high number of samples,” he has said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/virology-lab-in-madurai-screened-10k-on-friday/articleshow/82347926.cms||---
---||Madurai||Residents’ associations take lead as vax camps resume in Madurai||Madurai: Vaccine camps in Madurai that were suspended last weekend due to lack of supplies were conducted in some places in the past two days, with some resident associations going a step further and informing their members of the available stocks in the nearest PHC. The vaccination process started very slowly initially and picked up in mid April, when many people came forward to get vaccinated. As the UPHCs started witnessing large crowds, many organisations like the Tamil Nadu Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Maditssia, residents welfare associations and trade bodies came forward to organize camps. But, some of them had to be suspended due to shortage of vaccine stocks.The Gomathypuram-Thendral Nagar Residents Welfare Association is keeping a close track of the arrival of vaccines at the PHCs in its limits. On Saturday morning, it circulated a message saying that 100 doses were available in the Mastanpatti PHC and requested those who were waiting for their second dose to go there without further delay. “These messages are of great help because with the numbers rising, getting vaccinated seems to be the only solution,” said S Ganeswary a resident. Surya Nagar Residents Welfare Association which organised a camp on Thursday, had about 30 of their members getting the vaccine. P Andi, president of the association said that with only Covaxin available, only a handful of people got the jabs. “We are going to organise a camp in the PHC for those who need the second dose,” he said.Meanwhile, as the Cowin site for registration for vaccines for those above the age of 18 displayed the name of a private hospital with availability of vaccines, many youngsters called up eagerly to check if they were doing it on Saturday. But, none of the hospitals in Madurai vaccinated those above the age of 18 on Saturday and said that they were awaiting stocks and also further communication from the state government.As on April 30, as many as 2,22,594 people had taken their vaccines, and the district had a total 13,210 doses in various facilities. Meanwhile, members of the fan club of actor Ajith, organised a blood donation camp on May 1, to mark his birthday and also to create awareness on the importance of blood donation as young people have been told they should not donate blood for three months after getting the vaccine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/residents-associations-take-lead-as-vax-camps-resume-in-madurai/articleshow/82347928.cms||---

Around 20 to 25 Covid patients are admitted to the ICUs daily over the past few days. There were only 90 patients in ICU care on April 12. It doubled in 10 days with 182 patients on April 22. It again rose to 204, 225, 243, 269 and 307 on April 23, 24, 25, 26 and 27 respectively. There were 317 patients in ICU care as on Wednesday. Authorities expect around 800 to 1,000 patients in ICUs in two weeks. Authorities fear that the rising ICU admissions will eventually lead to more fatalities. Doctors tell if the patients get admitted in ICU ventilator, particularly in invasive ventilator, chance of survival is very difficult. More than one third of ICU admissions are in ventilator support in Ernakulam. They say ICU admissions can be avoided to a certain extent if we identify infection early and start treatment. There are only 140 ICU beds with the government hospitals. They expect 40 more beds will be available once the super specialty block at Ernakulam General Hospital is ready. In private sector, around 1,100 ICU beds are available. Ernakulam needs 1,000 more ICU beds once the district reaches its peak. “Only 150 ICU beds are currently used in private hospitals. Steps have been taken to utilize the remaining ICU beds for Covid treatment. If there is any shortage of ICU facility, we will have to put patients in oxygen beds,” said NHM district programme officer Dr Mathews Numpeli. Authorities fear if the cases increase again, early detection will be difficult, which will result in shifting of categories from A to B and C in no time. It will lead to more fatalities. It takes two weeks for a patient to get discharged from ICU care and eight to 10 days from hospital after treatment. With the increase in number of patients, the demand for oxygen has also increased in the district. Currently medical oxygen is transported once in a week from Palakkad. Authorities said hospitals will have to increase the frequency of transport twice in a week with the increase in cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/number-of-icu-admissions-shoots-up-in-ernakulam/articleshow/82347219.cms||T C Sreemol

According to Jagat Singh Rawat, vice president of Sewa Samiti, a Haridwar-based charitable organisation which oversees operations of Kharkhari cremation ground, around 50 bodies were brought daily to the crematorium, which has capacity of cremating around 25 bodies a day. "The bodies that come wrapped in PPE are obviously of Covid-19 patients. However, a lot of people die without making it to a health facility so a lot of bodies which are not covered in PPE are also being brought in," Rawat said. Haridwar’s other two major main crematoriums, Chandi Ghat and Kankhal, have been working at double their capacity. Haridwar sub divisional magistrate (SDM) Gopal Singh Chauhan told TOI, “We have sent a proposal to set up a temporary crematorium on the bank of Ganga in Chandi Ghat region as the number of Covid deaths are increasing by the day. We have selected a 20,000-square-meter area for the crematorium to be built in. The facilities will be installed soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/haridwar-seeks-to-set-up-temporary-crematorium-to-deal-with-rising-covid-deaths/articleshow/82347222.cms||MS Nawaz
---||Coimbatore||Positivity rate rises to 12.2%, active cases at all-time high||Coimbatore: The district recorded its highest-ever single-day spike in Covid-19 cases on Saturday, when 1,257 people were declared positive for the virus, even as the tally increased to 79,669, just 331 short of another milestone of 80,000-mark. The daily test positivity rate also shot up to 12.2%, with 1,257 of the 10,224 samples testing positive.The number of active Covid cases in the district too touched an all-time high of 7,288, with only 913 patients getting discharged from treatment centres on the day. The recovery rate in the district, where 71,658 of the infected have survived the virus attack, stands at 89.9%.Officially, the Covid-19 toll in the district rose to 723 with a 63-year-old woman, who was admitted to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH) on April 25, succumbing to the virus. She didn’t have any comorbidities and died of acute respiratory distress syndrome and bilateral bronchopneumonia on Thursday (April 29).However, officials said the district had actually recoded a double-digit toll on Thursday alone. According to a source, at least two thirds of the victims were residents of the district, while the remaining were the patients who had come for treatment from other districts. The government hasn’t added them in the health bulletin so far.An official said some of the victims were brought to the CMCH after meeting with accidents or attempting suicides and declared brought dead. “They were found to be positive for the virus during postmortem. Hence, they were not included in the list. Others died of respiratory distress but tested negative in the RT-PCR tests. Such cases are considered suspected Covid deaths.”Another official said the number of deaths on Saturday was also too high that they didn’t have enough dead body bags to pack them. Despite the spike in Covid-19 cases, the officials said 36% of the beds (1,493 of the 5,871 beds) in hospitals was vacant as on Saturday. While 638 of them were in the government sector, the remaining 855 were in the private sector. In a bid to increase the bed availability, officials have roped in at least six new hospitals for Covid treatment. With this, the number of hospitals handling Covid patients has increased to 47 from 41.In an alarming trend, oxygen and ventilator beds are getting filled up rapidly. As on Saturday, 628 out of the 796 oxygen beds and 222 of the 239 ventilator beds were occupied in the government sector. In the private sector, 376 oxygen beds and 66 ventilator beds are still available. “If patients come to our triage centres in the ESI Hospital and Ramanathapuram, it will be easier for us to allot them beds based on their requirement,” an official told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/positivity-rate-rises-to-12-2-active-cases-at-all-time-high/articleshow/82347608.cms||---

This Toda tribal woman also offers a helping hand to the senior citizens with health complications to buy medicines and other essential supplies.Priya says the elderly people could contact her over phone for free vegetarian meals, which would be delivered at their houses. “I started this free service just four days ago. I depend on social media and word of mouth information to reach the needy elderly people who are home quarantined or with health complications and scared to come out of their houses.”Her service area is, however, limited to Ooty town. But that doesn’t mean the number of people depending on her free food delivery is less. In fact, she has received a fairly good response in just four days.“As of now, I deliver food with my own logistics. My friends and relatives are ready to help me with the transportation of food, when it comes to bulk orders,” says Priya.Elderly people in home quarantine could either call or ping her at 9787715555 by 10am any day for free and simple homemade vegetarian lunch to be delivered at their doorsteps. “The details of recipients will be kept confidential,” she says.Priya, who is basically an interior designer and land developer, also volunteers to help the people, who cannot step out of their houses, with getting medicines, essential provisions and vegetables as per their requirement upon payment. “We are delivering everything with all the safety measures.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/this-toda-woman-serves-free-meals-to-elderly-covid-patients/articleshow/82347613.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: RIL, nation’s largest oxygen producer from one location||Mumbai: Covid-19 has pushed the world out of its comfort zone, onto hitherto uncharted paths. India’s petroleum and steel companies have not been spared and as they rise to the occasion by turning their industrial facilities into liquid medical oxygen plants, they seem to be turning into major producers of the commodity, which has become the most sought-after as well as scant resource. On Saturday, Reliance Industries (RIL), a new entrant to the liquid medical oxygen manufacturers’ club, became India’s ‘largest producer’ of the resource from a ‘single location’. It said it is producing over 1,000 metric tons of medical oxygen per day over 11% of India’s production from its Jamnagar complex and other facilities. Though RIL did not give a facility-wise break-up, it said most of it was produced at Jamnagar. Several Covid-19 deaths in the country are being attributed to shortfall in medical treatment due to lack of medical oxygen. To fill this gap and save lives, petroleum and steel companies turned their cryogenic air separation units, used to generate industrial oxygen, into liquid medical oxygen manufacturing plants. Companies reconfigured cryogenic air separation units. For RIL to produce liquid medical oxygen at -183°C and with 99.5% purity, it ‘repurposed’ its plants at Jamnagar, with chairman Mukesh Ambani “personally supervising scale-up of production and transportation”, the company stated. RIL started producing medical oxygen at its Jamnagar refinery in Gujarat, the world’s largest, only after onset of the pandemic. India allowed captive industrial oxygen manufacturers to produce and sell medical oxygen in April 2020 to fight surging Covid-19 infections. Medical oxygen was earlier produced only by those with licences for it. JSW Steel too claimed it had become the ‘largest liquid medical oxygen producing private steel company’ in the country. It is producing over 1,100 metric tons of medical oxygen daily across its plants at Vijayanagar (Karnataka), Dolvi (Maharashtra) and Salem (Tamil Nadu). Over 70% of its oxygen production is at Vijayanagar. Rival Tata Steel is producing over 800 metric tons of medical oxygen per day across its Jamshedpur, Kalinganagar and Dhenkanal plants. Other sectors too are chipping in with automotive players like Maruti Suzuki undertaking temporary shutdowns of its factories to boost oxygen supplies. Shut since 2018, Sterlite Copper’s Tuticorin plant in TN too is set to reopen to produce oxygen after it sought and received Supreme Court approval. Sterlite Copper’s oxygen plants can produce 1,000 metric tons daily. Others such as Steel Authority of India, BPCL, ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel and Jindal Stainless too have been supplying oxygen for medical purposes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ril-nations-largest-oxygen-producer-from-one-location/articleshow/82348891.cms||Reeba Zachariah

The railway has also not taken action against any of the loco pilots for hitting elephants and injuring them. On the contrary, it says none of the locos or coaches were damaged after hitting elephants.”He questioned the railway’s commitment to preventing elephant deaths on Podanur-Palakkad stretch, where 13 elephants had died between 2002 and 2010. Three elephants were killed in 2009 alone. “The track is almost 10ft above the ground level. So, elephants cannot easily step to the side of the track when a train comes. Bringing both the lines parallel and closer to each other will help address the issue.”Referring to the A line, which is meant for the trains to Palakkad from the city, and B line that caters to the trains to the city, he says the first one passes through dense forest areas for 6.5km between Walayar and Ettimadai and the second one for 8.5km.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/rti-activist-blames-southern-railway-for-not-installing-speed-governors-on-trains/articleshow/82347612.cms||---
---||Goa||Divert Rs 300 crore Goa’s Liberation Day gift to fight Covid: Vijai Sardesai||Panaji: With Goa’s Covid-19 cases continuing to surge at an alarming rate, the state government needs to immediately utilise Rs 300 crores, allocated by the Centre to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Goa’s Liberation Day, for improving the state’s healthcare infrastructure, said president of Goa Forward Party (GFP) Vijai Sardesai. He said instead of taking up “unnecessary developmental” projects, the state government needs to show foresight to mitigate the Covid-19 disaster. “The government needs to move rapidly with foresight and urgently strengthen Goa’s health infrastructure to mitigate the distress the people find themselves in,” Sardesai said. GFP urged the government not to delay any further in deploying unused funds to fight the second Covid wave. “This is not the time to procrastinate, but the time to be resolute and determined. We need every resource we can muster to fight this pandemic and save our fellow Goemkars. We hope the government will acknowledge the magnitude of the second wave and rise up to the occasion as this is the time for urgent intervention.” The former deputy chief minister urged the government to draw up an effective plan that lists out its priorities in these times and allocate funds accordingly. Further, he suggested that the government declare the total number of vaccines it needs for both the doses so as to avoid people rushing to the centres in panic when vaccines arrive in the state. “Keeping the public informed will also help avoid unnecessary queuing, and the government would be able to roll out the vaccines effectively,” Sardesai said. Sardesai stated that the government’s lack of foresight and seriousness towards Covid-19 coupled with the chief minister’s refusal to listen to the opposition while taking directions from the Centre has created complications. “The government should stop the PR narrative that Covid is under control; now is the time for honesty and transparency. A government should be able to foresee difficulties and plan for adverse circumstances that could befall the state,” the GFP president said. The GFP chief also agreed with American immunologist Anthony Fauci that a lockdown for a few weeks in the state will make a difference. “We should go into a voluntary lockdown for a few weeks and help each other as government won’t agree and that would perhaps be a game changer in our fight against the pandemic,” Sardesai said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/divert-rs-300cr-l-day-gift-to-fight-covid-sardesai/articleshow/82347933.cms||---

---||Surat||Bharuch hospital was ill-equipped to tackle blaze||SURAT: The Welfare Hospital in Bharuch refurbished its unused building last year and started treating Covid patients there without any charges. The hospital administration made all arrangements for treatment, but they missed the most important factor that could have protected the 18 lives on Friday midnight – fire safety. The ground floor of the sprawling building, which had the capacity to admit 58 patients at a time, had just three fire extinguishers. The floor too was divided into different sections – ICU and general ward besides the service area. “There were no fire hydrants, water sprinklers or a smoke detector system which are must for a hospital. With such systems not installed, the hospital did not even apply for a no-objection certificate (NOC) to the Bharuch municipality,” said Dipak Makhijani, regional fire officer and in-charge deputy chief fire officer of Surat Municipal Corporation. NOC procedures can be initiated only if the hospital has installed all fire-fighting systems. Zuber Patel, trustee of the Bombay Patel Welfare Society, said, “We had some equipment but since everything happened suddenly during the night hour and the power too went off it was difficult to control the fire immediately.” "We have cured hundreds of patients from not only Bharuch, but from Vadodara, Surat and Narmada for free in one year. Our Covid treatment centre and entire medical infrastructure has been reduced to ashes. We will not be able to continue the facility anymore," Patel said. Meanwhile, police registered a case of accidental death at B Division police station in Bharuch but are investigating if there was any negligence which caused the deaths. “We will be investigating if the building usage permission was obtained or not and whether the guidelines for operating a Covid treatment centre were followed or not,” said assistant superintendent of Bharuch police Vikas Sunda. He added that the investigating team is also collecting documents to check whether any fire safety audit of the building was done and what the audit report was.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/sickening-neglect-fires-rage-on-as-rules-smoulder/articleshow/82346610.cms||Jay Pachchigar
---||Jaipur||Multi-pronged strategy to check Covid in prisons||Jaipur: The surge in Covid cases in several prisons has forced the jail department to adopt a multi-pronged strategy — from shifting inmates to other facilities, creating space for isolation, screening the staff, stopping visitors and utilising medical infrastructure built in the last few months. Dungarpur district prison has space for 75 but has 125 inmates. Of these, 32 are Covid-positive, who have been allotted independent barracks while some have been kept in the remaining space, while moving out another 30 to maintain Covid protocol in the prison. Reports say that the state has 105 prisons with a total of 21,500 inmates and 504 inmates have tested positive for Covid. Of its 5,000 prison staff, 104 have tested positive in a special screening to create a Covid-free environment. The jails are one of the most vulnerable places for the spread of the virus. “Of the total infected, 459 are asymptomatic while the remaining have been hospitalised in our facilities inside the prisons and a few of them have been admitted in other hospitals. Jaipur has around 50 positive cases in its three prisons together — Central Prison, District Prison and Women’s Prison,” said Rajeev Dasot, DG prisons, who claimed that they are taking strict measures to ensure that none of the prisons become a Covid hotspot. The rule of admitting inmates who have a negative report is followed by seven days’ quarantine period. Every inmate who enters the prison is Covid-negative and to minimise the chances of them being infected from the jail staff, all 5,000 staff have been tested and will be tested regularly. Refuting the myth that the jails are overpopulated, Dasot said that all jails in the state put together are just 97% occupied. “The total space is for around 22,000 while the occupancy is 21,500. Some prisons like ones in Bharatpur and Bikaner are underutilised while some are occupied more than their strength. The even distribution is not practical. We, however, balance the numbers by shifting the access to other prisons,” said Dasot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/multi-pronged-strategy-to-check-covid-in-prisons/articleshow/82347634.cms||---

---||Goa||Goa may share Delhi’s fate if lockdown not imposed: Congress||PANAJI: Questioning the state government’s strategy to curb the rise in Covid cases, Congress on Saturday said Goa will share the same fate as Delhi if a longer lockdown is not imposed in the tourist state. Party functionaries said the state government is needlessly dragging its feet, which would be detrimental for Goa. People across the country are dying due to BJP’s gross mismanagement of the Covid-19 pandemic, said state Congress general secretary Amarnath Panjikar. He said that Goa too may soon see cases of people dying due to the lack of oxygen as seen in the national capital. The party has demanded that, in light of the rise in Covid-19 cases and the high mortality rate, the state government needs to extend the lockdown for 15 days in order to break the chain. “It is really hard to understand why, though we have a chief minister from the medical field, corrective actions and measures were not taken at the beginning of the second wave,” youth Congress president Varad Mardolkar said. He pointed out that Goa’s current Covid-19 mortality rate has gone beyond that of the first wave, with every second test result coming positive. “We can see the serpentine queues at testing centres. This means there is spread of the virus everywhere. Hence, there is a need to break this chain. This will not happen by just 80 hours of lockdown, it will need at least 15 days to contain the spread of community transmission,” Mardolkar said. Accusing AAP and BJP of trying to gain political brownie points in the midst of the pandemic while people are struggling to survive, Panjikar said, “The chaos in Delhi as well as other parts of the nation has brought to the fore that BJP and AAP did not take any preventive actions to minimise the effects of the second wave.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-may-share-delhis-fate-if-lockdown-not-imposed-congress/articleshow/82347983.cms||---

In a letter issued by secretary (in-charge) health, Dr Pankaj Pandey, the committee with members, including professor Hem Chandra, VC Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna Uttarakhand Medical University, Dr KC Pant, senior physician Government Doon Medical College, and Dr SK Gupta from medical health and family welfare department of Uttarakhand government, will collectively review the patient-wise request from hospitals to seek the drug which is advised to be used judiciously and strictly. The team should have detailed recommendations from hospitals and an expert will analyse the patient’s condition. According to a note from the Union health ministry, Tocilizumab is being only distributed by Cipla and it is an expensive medicine. The drug went out of stock in the last few weeks and had been replenished in limited quantities and states had been allotted fixed quotas. The states have been given specific units of the drug and they would further distribute them to government and private hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/centre-allots-25-units-of-tocilizumab-to-uttarakhand/articleshow/82347240.cms||Ishita Mishra

The robbers, who were working as waiters, had burgled the store near their hotel. “The Kerala police had shared CCTV images and the Aadhaar copies of the trio, Manjit Hooda, Virendra Nepali and Suraj Dhami. We knew that they were travelling by Mangala Express. The RPF personnel boarded the train at Panvel station and started searching for the trio. Hooda was spotted when the train was approaching Kasara station. Seeing the cops, his aide jumped off from the train and the third had already alighted at Igatpuri,” said Panvel RPF inspector Jasbir Rana. Both were nabbed based on Hooda’s admission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-panvel-rpf-nab-three-thieves-recover-mobiles-worth-rs-rs-17-lakh/articleshow/82348953.cms||George Mendonca

He is bedridden at home in Vaishali Nagar and is rationing the available gas by consuming it for 7-8 days. "My father is on intermittent use of oxygen and my worry is that if oxygen is not available on time it might take his life," said Mohit Lal, son of Lal, who is spending sleepless nights worrying from where to get the next oxygen supply.Oxygen is required by those suffering from ILD, chronic lung illness, heart diseases, cancer patients and those who require oxygen therapy. Lal family is not the only one facing uncertainty over oxygen supply. The shortage of oxygen is not only costing dearly to Covid patients but is proving taxing for regular users having chronic illnesses. Supply of oxygen from private suppliers is being regulated by the drug department leaving the non-Covid patients at the mercy of the availability of supplies.Most of the oxygen dealers take oxygen from air separation plants which is availed locally and is limited. The city has 6-7 air separation plants which are supplying to the government via drug department and dealers. Mohsin Sheikh (name changed), who is recovering from lung cancer, needs oxygen on regular basis. He managed a refill on Saturday but is unsure of getting it next time. "Earlier, it was Rs 350 per refill and today I paid Rs 1,000. I felt lucky to have received it," said Sheikh. Since the oxygen dealers’ numbers have been made public, their regular clients are suffering. Sahil Singhal, an oxygen gas supplier based in Jaipur, says that shortage is a reality no one can run away from it. "I have asked my regular clients to look for oxygen concentrators since I don’t know whether I will be able to supply them in the short run or not. With folded hands, I am saying sorry to my routine clients since my cylinders are being forwarded to the hospital for Covid patients," said Singhal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/chronic-patients-with-regular-o2-need-have-a-harrowing-time/articleshow/82347633.cms||---

The state reported 63,282 fresh cases and 802 fatalities on Saturday, taking the total cases to 46.6 lakh and the total death toll to 69,615, inching close to the 70,000 mark.  While the daily load of Covid cases in Mumbai has been between 3,500 and 5,000, the daily toll continues to be a matter of concern. On Saturday, when the city registered 3,897 cases, the deaths climbed to 90. The total cases in the city since the start of the pandemic have been 6.5 lakh, and the toll stands at 63,325. BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare said an analysis of the deaths during the second Covid wave has revealed that although the prevalence of the cases is not the highest in the under-40 age- group, there is an increased mortality in this age-group. “Young people shouldn’t take Covid lightly and seek help as soon as they develop symptoms,” she said. The BMC is also checking if patients are dying within 24-48 hours of admission. A doctor working for a private hospital said that many serious patients are those transferred to bigger hospitals after admission to smaller hospitals. “We have had cases of patients transferred from a small hospital after 14 days or more. They are too critical to be helped,” he said. Dr Rahul Pandit, who heads the ICU department in Fortis Hospital, Mulund, said deaths could continue to increase in Mumbai and Maharashtra. “We are close to the peak of Covid deaths, but we haven’t yet reached there,” he said. The daily toll could climb higher, he feared. The highest number of daily deaths witnessed in Mumbai was on June 24, 2020 (120), which was after data reconciliation. State officials said that smaller cities and towns were seeing a high numbers of deaths due to late detection and wasting time in seeking medical treatment. Districts like Osmanabad in the Marathwada region reported 37 deaths, while Beed in the same region reported 29 deaths. Meanwhile, in a positive sign, the number of active cases in the state and the city reported a slight dip. The state witnessed 61,326 recoveries on Saturday, taking the total number of recoveries so far to 39.2 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/maharashtra-daily-cases-stable-at-63k-but-toll-in-mumbai-climbs-to-90/articleshow/82349789.cms||Malathy Iyer

---||Jaipur||Ready to spend entire year’s budget on Covid treatment, but it won't be enough, says CM||Jaipur: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot said he is ready to spend the entire year’s budget on Covid treatment, but it would not be sufficient if the virus spreads at its current pace. He appealed to the people to follow the guidelines and break the chain.He was speaking at the launch of the CM Chiranjeevi health insurance scheme and Covid immunisation of 18-45 age group on Saturday. He said the second wave of Covid has turned out to be very dangerous and the mortality rate is also very high. Critically ill people are requiring high pressure oxygen, leading to its shortage. If the average mortality per day in the first wave was about 20, it has now crossed 100, said the CM expressing concern.He said another feature of the second wave is that many cases are asymptomatic initially and they turn out to be spreaders in the family and friends circle. Within a few days of symptoms, the patients became critically ill requiring oxygen and ICU putting immense pressure on the health system.He said the government is leaving no stone unturned to provide relief to the people, but no government could succeed without the cooperation of the people. He asked people to stay at home following the guidelines.Gehlot said the Chiranjeevi scheme has been conceived as a comprehensive social security and healthcare right to the needy, helpless and deprived people like developed countries to facilitate healthy and dignified living. He said the scheme has been made universal as it will relieve people from the worries about expensive treatments. Under the scheme, every family in the state will be able to get free medical insurance of up to Rs 5 lakh per annum.The scheme offers 1,576 packages and procedures for the treatment of various diseases. He said the government will incur an expenditure of Rs 3,500 crore for the scheme.Launching the free Covid-19 vaccination programme for the people aged 18-45 years , the chief minister said vaccinations have always been free of cost to prevent epidemics. “We had strongly urged the Centre to make vaccination free of cost for people of all age groups in the country, but the Centre has so far not accepted the suggestion,” he said, adding that the Centre can consider it even now. Since the Centre has not acted on the proposal, the state had to take an additional burden of Rs 3,000 crore on this count.Health minister Raghu Sharma said the Chiranjeevi Yojana is a unique scheme where people don’t have to worry about procedures like health check-ups, restrictions on the size of family etc.Secretary, medical and health, Siddarth Mahajan said for about 1.10 crore families of National Food Security Act beneficiaries, socio-economic census as well as contractual workers, small and marginal farmers, destitute and helpless families, the premium will be borne by the state.About 76 lakh other families of the state could also avail the health insurance by paying a partial premium of Rs 850 per year and the remaining 50% premium of such families will be borne by the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ready-to-spend-entire-years-budget-on-covid-treatment-but-it-wont-be-enough-says-cm/articleshow/82347637.cms||---

---||Meerut||UP education bodies to boycott today's panchayat poll counting amid Covid surge||BIJNOR: Hours after Supreme Court (SC) allowed Sunday's UP rural polls counting following state election commission's (SEC) assurance to adhere to strict Covid protocols, several education bodies of the state such as Shaikshik Mahasangh and Rajya Karmchari Sanyukt Parishad declared a "boycott of the counting process". Thousands of teachers have been called on duty for the counting session on Sunday. Many have died during the four-phase panchayat polls. Notably, after a special sitting held on Saturday, the SC has refused to defer the counting. It will now take place with strict Covid safeguards. District secretary of UP primary teachers' association, Prashant Chaudhary, said, "We respect the SC's order. But, we cannot put our lives at risk. There are no concrete arrangements for employees to safeguard them from Covid infection." In Bijnor, around 800 staff, out of 5,200, had recently skipped a three-day training session on poll counting. Out of them, 500 staff complained of fever, cold and cough - all Covid symptoms. Responding strongly, Bijnor chief development officer KP Singh said that staff missing out deliberately on poll count training will be served notices. The government employees and teachers' association have also sent a letter to chief minister Yogi Adityanath stating their inability to perform duty during poll counting. President of Karmchari, Shiksha, Adhikari and Pensioners' Manch, Dinesh Chandra Sharma, said, "Several teachers, support staff and other government employees who took part in the four-phase panchayat poll duty had later succumbed to Covid. In such a desperate situation, government staff have expressed apprehension of performing the duty amid Covid surge." However, Bijnor district magistrate Ramakant Pandey claimed that all preparations have been made for the counting day with strict Covid safeguard norms. Employees are ready to perform their duties. In addition, candidates who contested the rural polls are also facing a lot of problems after the court's order. Rajendra Singh, who is contesting for the post of village head, said, "Candidates and their agents can enter the counting centres only if they have an RT-PCR negative result or certificate of having taken two doses of Covid. We are trying to find agents who are following Covid norms." Earlier, the teachers' unions alleged that from training to polling, the SEC did not follow the requisite Covid-19 norms anywhere, which has made the situation more frightening. The federation has released a list claiming that "nearly 706 teachers and staff engaged in election duty have lost their lives due to Covid-19 infection, with a large number of teachers still battling the disease". On behalf of the SEC, all district magistrates have been instructed to strictly follow the 13-point guidelines for the counting of votes. Local bodies have been asked to take special care of hygiene and the health department must maintain medical arrangements.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/up-education-bodies-to-boycott-todays-panchayat-poll-counting-amid-covid-surge/articleshow/82347252.cms||Harveer Dabas

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra daily Covid-19 cases stable at 63k, but toll in Mumbai climbs to 90||MUMBAI: While the daily Covid-19 detections in the state have stabilized at around 63,000 cases, the fatalities continued to remain high. The state reported 63,282 fresh cases and 802 fatalities on Saturday, taking the total cases to 46.6 lakh and the total death toll to 69,615, inching close to the 70,000 mark.  While the daily load of Covid cases in Mumbai has been between 3,500 and 5,000, the daily toll continues to be a matter of concern. On Saturday, when the city registered 3,897 cases, the deaths climbed to 90. The total cases in the city since the start of the pandemic have been 6.5 lakh, and the toll stands at 63,325. BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare said an analysis of the deaths during the second Covid wave has revealed that although the prevalence of the cases is not the highest in the under-40 age- group, there is an increased mortality in this age-group. “Young people shouldn’t take Covid lightly and seek help as soon as they develop symptoms,” she said. The BMC is also checking if patients are dying within 24-48 hours of admission. A doctor working for a private hospital said that many serious patients are those transferred to bigger hospitals after admission to smaller hospitals. “We have had cases of patients transferred from a small hospital after 14 days or more. They are too critical to be helped,” he said. Dr Rahul Pandit, who heads the ICU department in Fortis Hospital, Mulund, said deaths could continue to increase in Mumbai and Maharashtra. “We are close to the peak of Covid deaths, but we haven’t yet reached there,” he said. The daily toll could climb higher, he feared. The highest number of daily deaths witnessed in Mumbai was on June 24, 2020 (120), which was after data reconciliation. State officials said that smaller cities and towns were seeing a high numbers of deaths due to late detection and wasting time in seeking medical treatment. Districts like Osmanabad in the Marathwada region reported 37 deaths, while Beed in the same region reported 29 deaths. Meanwhile, in a positive sign, the number of active cases in the state and the city reported a slight dip. The state witnessed 61,326 recoveries on Saturday, taking the total number of recoveries so far to 39.2 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-daily-cases-stable-at-63k-but-toll-in-mumbai-climbs-to-90/articleshow/82347971.cms||Malathy Iyer

Sheila Devi's positive attitude and regular lung exercise is the sole reason, besides timely hospitalisation and medicines, behind her speedy recovery, said doctors. “Maa herself took bath today and did normal activities including eating her meals and medicines,” said her son Dr Arvind Saxena, expressing gratitude towards god and the medical staff.“I had never met or conversed earlier with any of the doctors and medical staff who attended to my mother in the hospital. Their dedicated treatment and care to my mother is highly appreciative,” said Saxena, a sexagenarian who is visually impaired. He is a noted historian retired from government college, Kota.After complaint of fever and cough for two days, Sheila Devi Saxena, on medical advice, underwent RT-PCR test on April 16 and chest CT scan the next day that showed a score of 10/25 ringing an alarm bell for the family. Her grandchildren comprise a doctor and engineer, but they are on duty at Jaipur and Bengaluru, respectively, making it hard for Dr Saxena to arrange for treatment of his mother.He called the superintendent of Maharao Bhim Singh (MBS) Hospital Dr Naveen Saxena and explained the severity of the patient and his visually impaired condition. "Dr Naveen Saxena without any approach or influence asked for immediate hospitalization of my mother to a private ward where she underwent critical Covid treatment for 7 days from April 18 to April 25," Dr Saxena said."The doctor at MBS Hospital asked me to send one attendant and assured to make all arrangements. The dedicated medical care the staff provided to my mother for seven days round-the-clock is unforgettable," Dr Saxena said.Sheila Devi was put on oxygen support on the very first day and was administered innumerable drips."My mother would call me from the hospital and say that 4-4 drips are continuously being administered to her and I would soothe her by saying that she would get well soon with the treatment," he further said."92-year-old Sheila Devi is full of positive energy which is the main reason, besides the medicines and timely hospitalization, behind her speedy recovery," said Dr C P Meena, incharge of Covid ward at MBS Hospital, and nodal officer of Covid Care centres in private hospitals at Kota. He added that at such an old age, the lungs suffer most adversely and the immunity also diminishes."If the Covid patient maintains a positive outlook and regularly exercises lungs with spirometer or performs yogic exercise ‘anuloma viloma’, he/she is sure to defeat Corona and Sheila Devi did all this actively’, Dr Meena said.Pic – Sheila Devi Saxena at her home on Friday after recovery from Covid 19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/92-yr-old-woman-of-kota-successfully-battles-covid-19/articleshow/82347644.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Dehradun||As death toll mounts, lack of freezers to keep bodies a concern in Dehradun||DEHRADUN: The limited number of freezers at morgues in state capital Dehradun has cropped up as an issue of concern amidst rising instances of mortalities due to the pandemic. An average of around 30 Covid-19 deaths and an almost similar number of mortalities due to other reasons is taking place on a daily basis in Dehradun district. This has led to heavy rush at cremation grounds necessitating keeping of bodies in freezers till they are cremated.  While the district’s Coronation Hospital has two freezers, with capacity to keep two bodies each, Doon Hospital, the biggest government hospital which has been declared as a Covid-only facility, has four freezers of the same size. Only three community health centres in the district have freezers to keep bodies apart from a few private hospitals. With temperatures soaring, many families where deaths have occured are forced to keep bodies at home as freezers are not available and cremations are delayed. Vijay Kumar, whose mother-in-law died of Covid recently had to wait over 20 hours for cremation as there were queues at the cremation ground and he got a token for next day. “We tried to get a freezer to keep the body but were unable to do so,” he said. Meanwhile, a complaint of foul smell emanating from the mortuary situated at the Coronation Hospital on Friday led to the hospital administration finding that five bodies had got spoiled since the freezer in the morgue had stopped working. A senior doctor at the hospital said, “Police had brought three bodies to the morgue on April 27 and as per protocol, they had to wait for 72 hours before cremating them. The other bodies were of destitute patients who died during treatment. ” Dr Manoj Upreti, chief medical superintendent of the hospital told TOI that both the doors of the deep freezers kept at the morgue had been broken as the bodies were being kept along with the stretcher by the morgue staff. “We have noticed this defect last week and a letter in this regard was sent to the chief medical officer (CMO),” he said. Dr Anoop Dimri, CMO, when queried, said, “We have contacted a few technicians who can fix the issue but as the Coronation Hospital has been recently turned into a Covid hospital, no one was ready to go there. We will get this issue fixed as soon as possible.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/as-death-toll-mounts-lack-of-freezers-to-keep-bodies-a-concern-in-doon/articleshow/82347287.cms||Ishita Mishra

A young man, whose kin was admitted in the ward, said, “there is no oxygen supply. Doctors are very cooperative, but what would they do without oxygen. They have no facilities to fight Covid.” Standing near a store room where oxygen cylinders are placed, “ he told a local TV reporter who had entered the ward in a PPE kit, “look, all these cylinders are empty.

The hospital said that all the patients were brought in a critical condition -- some barely able to speak -- and couldn’t be revived despite oxygen support. “Most of them died within hours of admission,” said Dr RC Agarwal, chief medical superintendent (CMS) of the hospital. The CMS also said, “Strangely a few of them had negative Covid-19 report." According to the hospital register, six patients died on Friday night between 9pm and 12am. And another 25 people passed away by Saturday evening. The register says that they all had “difficulties in breathing”. CMS Agarwal confirmed to TOI that the number of deaths might be higher than 31. “Most of the people are coming to the hospital in the last stage. All of them had Covid-19 like symptoms. They were barely able to speak. Many of them were unconscious and couldn’t be revived despite putting them on oxygen support.” “The infection had possibly damaged their lungs badly. Strangely many of them had negative Covid-19 report. Their cremation will be done according to protocol.” When asked if lack of oxygen led to some of the deaths, the CMS said, “It is true that there is a deficiency of oxygen in the district. We are yet to receive uninterrupted supply from Lucknow. But most of these patients were extremely critical and ventilator was the only option for them. We tried to revive them, but couldn’t. We are not sure if those patients had multiple infections or there is some other mutant variant of virus.” Another senior doctor told TOI that a large chunk of patients are starting treatment at the last stage, when the infection is spread and lungs are damaged. “High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) should be done by the patient if he thinks that he has contracted the virus. It tells us the exact position of the lungs. Now patients turn up for treatment when their lungs are totally damaged and there is nothing left for us to treat,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/31-die-at-ups-lakhimpur-kheri-hospital-in-24-hours/articleshow/82347317.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The Haryana government asked fire departments of its civic bodies to audit firefighting arrangements at institutional buildings in the state. In Punjab’s Patiala district, fire officials carried out an audit of Rajindra Government Hospital, which has a capacity of over 600 beds, and is being used to treat Covid-19 patients. Officials claimed that the hospital building had all facilities and infrastructure. Haryana additional chief secretary (urban local bodies) S N Roy said directions had been issued to civic bodies and local administrations where civic bodies are not in place, to carry out fire-safety audits. “Though standing instructions are in place, we have renewed orders to ensure proper audit of private and government hospitals, daycare centres and community centres,’’ said Roy. Officials at Rajindra hospital had also held meetings last week to discuss fire-safety measures amid a rise in Covid patients. Dr H S Rekhi, medical superintendent, said, “For the last few days, we had held three meetings with officials, including district fire officer, two nodal officers of fire safety at Rajindra hospital and with the Punjab health system corporation. There were minor deficiencies and we have corrected them.” Patiala assistant divisional fire officer Laxman Dass said all facilities related to fire safety were in place in the new building where Covid patients were being treated. In Punjab’s Bathinda, civil surgeon Dr Tejwant Singh Dhillon said fire-safety norms have been put in place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/after-gujarat-tragedy-haryana-punjab-check-fire-safety-in-hospitals/articleshow/82347652.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Andhra Pradesh: 16 Covid patients die due to ‘low’ oxygen pressure||TIRUPATI: In two separate shocking incidents, 16 Covid-19 patients died for alleged want of oxygen supply in Anantapur and Kurnool cities in Andhra Pradesh on Saturday. While 11 patients died at the Covid-19 ward of Anantapur government general hospital reportedly due to low pressure in oxygen pipeline, five others died at a private hospital in Kurnool. According to Anantapur joint collector Nishanth Kumar, 21 Covid-19 patients died at the Anantapur GGH since Friday due to “various reasons”. He, however, did not elaborate what the “various reasons” are. But, the relatives of the deceased told mediapersons that doctors of the GGH had themselves confirmed that there was a low pressure in the oxygen supply system, which resulted in the high mortality. GGH doctors maintained during interaction with local mediapersons that there were some technical glitches in the oxygen supply system which are being rectified by a technical team from Chennai. On the other hand, Anantapur district collector G Chandrudu said there was no shortage of oxygen in the district. But following complaints of low pressure, the entire pipeline was thoroughly checked. “Oxygen supply related complaints are being attended to and being sorted out,” he said. “The deaths are not due to shortage of oxygen,” said principal secretary, health, Anil Kumar Singhal. YSRCP legislator Ananta Venkatrami Reddy visited the Anantapur GGH and interacted with doctors and patients. Later, he told media that while the hospital management said there was no shortage of oxygen supply, relatives of the deceased alleged that the deaths were due to oxygen glitches. “We are ordering an inquiry and if medical negligence is found, we will take action,” he said. Earlier in the day, five Covid-19 patients died at a private hospital in Kurnool on Saturday allegedly for want of oxygen supply. The hospital has set up a Covid-19 care centre without the requisite permission of the state government. The managing director of the hospital was arrested for flouting rules. District authorities have ordered an inquiry into the deaths and registered a case against the management of the hospital. Officials said the hospital is ill-equipped to deal with emergency Covid-19 cases. According to officials, the hospital admitted five Covid-19 patients from Kadapa district in the last one week. They died one after another on Saturday. Relatives alleged that the hospital management failed to provide oxygen to the patients resulting in their death. Veerapandian and Kurnool district superintendent of police Kaginelli Fakeerappa visited the hospital and interacted with the relatives of the dead patients. “We have arrested the managing directors of two private hospitals in the city for flouting rules and endangering lives of patients.We appeal to the public to take note and get admitted only in the authorised private hospitals or at government-run Covid-19 care facilities in the district,” Veerapandian said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/16-covid-patients-die-due-to-low-o2-pressure-in-ap-hosps/articleshow/82347990.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

---||Vadodara||Chaos added to horror as thousands turned up to help||Surat/Bharuch: Within minutes of the fire breaking out at the Welfare Hospital late on Friday night, locals started to gather outside the hospital in thousands, the mob, mostly comprising frantic relatives of patients, adding fuel to the chaos. The police said that it had to deploy staff to control the mob of about 15,000 which turned up to help in rescuing the patients. “Relatives of the patients started making frantic calls for help. A few locals circulated audio messages on WhatsApp urging people to come and help. All of this led to a large gathering outside the hospital,” said a police official.As it was the month of Ramzan, many locals were awake and were hanging around after breaking the daylong fast. The first to rush in were a group of youngsters who were hanging out at Jambusar Chowkdi located about half kilometre away from the hospital. Some of them entered the hospital and rescued the patients who were then shifted to hospitals in Vagra and Jambusar.Blaring sirens of ambulances and fire tenders filled the air around the hospital as dozens of vehicles rushed in to douse the fire and help shift patients who survived the blaze. Along with the rescue teams, many locals were seen volunteering to rescue the patients and shift them to ambulances so that they could be taken to nearby hospitals. Several patients were shifted out on wheelchairs or by makeshift stretchers using cloth in absence of stretchers.A pall of gloom descended on Sansrod, Tankaria, Bhadbhut, Kasad, Manubar, Tankaria, Hinglot, Rahadpore, Karmad, Manubar and Dhadal as the victims who died in the inferno were natives of these villages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/chaos-added-to-horror-as-thousands-turned-up-to-help/articleshow/82346983.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Javed, who drives around the city, to help people in need of oxygen and hospitalization, said he lost crucial time in the argument with police when he was responding to a family’s SOS. “I got a call in the morning that someone needed oxygen urgently. When I reached Bhanpur, I was blocked by a wall of barricades,” said Javed. “I requested the policemen to let me go as I was responding to an emergency, but they wouldn’t listen. They went on asking why I was driving an auto without permission. I showed them all the papers and everything was in order, but then they started writing out a challan,” said Javed. The 34-year-old auto driver said he explained to the cops that he is using his vehicle as a free ambulance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bhopal-auto-ambulance-angel-gets-challaned-on-sos-trip/articleshow/82347657.cms||Ramendra Singh

In view of the Covid crisis, doctors and pharmacists of the rural development department should work together to save precious lives, he said. According to Bajwa, Punjab government is aware of demands of rural doctors and pharmacists, which have been brought to the knowledge of chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh. The minister assured that all demands would be discussed with the chief minister next week. Bajwa also lauded the contribution of rural doctors and pharmacists in saving people’s lives during the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/genuine-demands-of-rural-doctors-pharmacists-to-be-fulfilled-bajwa/articleshow/82347656.cms||---
---||Bareilly||Denied admission at a Covid facility, a family of three turns to a peepal tree for help||Bareilly: An old peepal tree turned into a makeshift Covid ward for a family of three in UP’s Shahjahanpur for three days, from Wednesday to Saturday. Anil Kumar, a resident of Tilhar town, his wife Urmila Devi (36) and daughter Muskaan (17) were suffering from Covid-like symptoms – high fever and difficulty in breathing. However, when they were denied admission to a local Covid facility on Wednesday, they took refuge under a nearby peepal tree for ‘oxygen’ and shelter after some locals told them that the tree “releases a good amount of oxygen, 24 hours a day”. On Saturday, the local MLA, Roshan Lal Verma, came to the aid of the family and admitted the wife and the daughter, who were more critical, to a Covid facility. Verma told TOI, “Anil himself was ill and his wife and daughter had breathing problems. They first reached out to their local CHC but because there was no oxygen there the doctor told them to go to the Covid facility in Banthra. When they reached Banthra, they were denied admission on Wednesday. Having nowhere else to go the family took refuge under a peepal tree after some locals told them that it releases a good amount of oxygen 24 hours a day. Fortunately, they have survived and now I am assured that they will get good treatment.” Verma raised the issue of the family with the district magistrate and arranged an ambulance and beds for them at the Banthra Covid facility. Anil Kumar told TOI that the tree ‘saved’ his life. “It is a sacred tree for us and it saved our lives so far, otherwise there was a time when my wife and daughter were barely able to breathe,” he said. That peepul releases a lot of oxygen throughout the day is a myth. It does not release oxygen at night. However, on account of its big canopy and large-sized leaves, it does release a slightly higher amount of oxygen compared to other trees. Chief medical officer Shahjahanpur, Dr S P Gautam told TOI, “The patients were shifted to a Covid centre where their oxygen levels were found above 90 and their antigen test was negative. Since they were panicky, we took their RT PCR sample for testing and kept them in the isolation ward. They will remain under observation and we are providing them necessary medicines.” Gautam added, “Many patients are coming to us thinking that they have Covid but the decision of admitting the patient is taken by the doctors on duty. We are still probing the allegations levelled by the MLA and will take necessary action against the staff if found guilty.” Verma added: “Our government has ensured many facilities but these officials are only busy serving influential people rather than thinking about the common man. I will raise this issue with chief minister Yogi Adityanath for sure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/denied-admission-at-a-covid-facility-a-family-of-three-turns-to-a-peepal-tree-for-help/articleshow/82347328.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Mumbai||Mumbai City’s O2 quota sent to N Mum, Thane; depute officials to stop diversion: BMC||Mumbai: At a time when Mumbai is grappling with insufficient oxygen supply at its hospitals, it has come to light that the quota meant for Mumbai is being diverted by suppliers to other cities such as Navi Mumbai and Thane. Taking a serious view of the short supply of oxygen to Mumbai, the BMC has written to the newly appointed Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) commissioner Parimal Singh and Konkan divisional commissioner Annasaheb Misal, asking that officials be deputed to ensure Mumbai gets its full quota of oxygen cylinders. Officials said due to the shortage in hospitals, the state government had fixed the oxygen quota for each district. According to the fixed quota, liquid medical oxygen (LMO) is taken in tankers to bottling or refilling plants where jumbo and dura cylinders are filled and then resent to hospitals. BMC officials said out of the 240 tonne of oxygen that Mumbai requires each day, around 180 tonne is used from oxygen tanks installed at major hospitals. The remaining 60 tonne is supplied through jumbo and dura cylinders that are refilled at plants located in Navi Mumbai. Half of this 60 tonne was being diverted to other cities, said BMC officials. “The supply of LMO should go as per the quota fixed for a particular region. Some LMO is received in jumbo tanks in BMC hospitals and part of the LMO is diverted to refillers who, in turn, provide filled dura cylinders and jumbo cylinders. It has been observed the LMO received for the Mumbai quota has been diverted to Navi Mumbai and Thane. This has created multiple distress calls of short supply of oxygen and on one occasion patients were shifted to other hospitals,” P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner (Projects) wrote in a letter to Singh and Misal. “BMC is facing daily crises of LMO and at any given time there is always a distress call from a hospital. In spite of allocation of the LMO quota, availability of LMO at refillers is decreased to BMC by more than 50% of the available quota. There is a need for monitoring and ensuring dispatch of the full allocated quota of LMO to Mumbai region without any diversion. This will certainly help BMC reduce distress calls from hospitals and avoid forceful transfer of patients or loss of human life due to unavailability of LMO,” Velrasu added in his letter. Officials said BMC suppliers Satramdas Gasses and Phoenix Gases are located in Navi Mumbai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-citys-o2-quota-sent-to-n-mum-thane-depute-officials-to-stop-diversion-bmc/articleshow/82347327.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Mumbai||Past tense: In heyday of trade unions, Mumbai gasped for air often||Though the city has perhaps never gasped for oxygen at the current scale, there were times in the past when air was not everywhere. This was chiefly because there was only one firm that monopolized industrial and medical oxygen in Bombay. Every time its workers would decide to fight for their rights or demand outstripped supply, surgeries had to wait. At the start of 1967, 400 workers in the plant of the oxygen firm stayed away from work over a dispute about the payment of additional increments for increasing productivity. These striking workers had stopped the trucks outside the gates of the factory, which meant that hospitals, laboratories and engineering industries ran out of oxygen. Nearly 800 hospitals used to get oxygen from this plant and bulk supplies were dispatched to Delhi and Kanpur. "Many of the engineering firms affected by short supplies had laid off some workers, it is learnt," said a report dated January 28 that year. Almost eight years later, in May in 1975, when nitrous oxide, which is needed for anesthesia, was in short supply--a dearth attributed to a stir by employees in the bottling section of the firm--hospitals contemplated getting oxygen bottled through other agencies. In fact, in March 1984, erratic oxygen supplies caused by labour troubles was reported to have contributed to the deaths of two patients--one with a lung injury and another heart patient--at Parel's KEM Hospital. Other public hospitals were also affected, though not to the same extent as KEM, because their needs were smaller. The hospital's dean had taken up the matter with the company, the state government and the state governor to declare the industry an "essential" one. A company spokesman had even admitted that there was a "go-slow" by a section of workers following the charter of demands presented by the Indian Trade Union Controlled union. Supplies had dropped by 30 to 40 per cent in three days and trucks were prevented from leaving the premises of the factory with cylinders. The company was forced to contemplate delivering the cylinders through other vehicles. Another time in 1986, when operations were said to have been postponed due to inadequate supply of oxygen, a company official denied shortage and said that the dearth may have been a result of hospitals not having returned the empty cylinders. Interestingly, during a transport strike in July 1992, when hospitals faced a similar crunch, Commodore Rai of Bombay Hospital said they were sending ambulances to the firm to fetch oxygen cylinders. This meant that the staff had to work doubly hard. "But the hospital is functioning normally as far as the patients are concerned," Rai had said. "Perhaps they have noticed the vegetables are not as fresh as before but they are certainly edible."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/past-tense-in-heyday-of-trade-unions-mumbai-gasped-for-air-often/articleshow/82347994.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Over 100 Madhya Pradesh cops on Bengal poll duty test positive||BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh has lost 45 police personnel to Covid-19’s devastating second wave, including 43 in April alone. The youngest was a 29-year-old constable posted in the administration wing of the state economic offences wing (EOW) who got infected while taking care of his father who too died of the infection. To put it in perspective, 33 police deaths were reported during the first wave between March and December 2020. The second wave is far deadlier. Among those infected in the police force now are more than 100 policemen who had gone to West Bengal on election duty. The state police had sent 20 companies (around 1,500 personnel) for the polls. The company from Chhindwara has reported the maximum ‘positive’ reports. DGP Vivek Johri said 90% of policemen have been vaccinated, and remaining ones are those who didn’t go for it. “We are providing all possible help to our staff and their family members. Oxygen beds are being arranged at police hospitals in various districts which includes 16 beds at Indore, 20 at Bhopal and 14 at Jabalpur,” Johri told TOI. The police headquarters is releasing advance payments for their treatment. There are several examples where policemen went beyond the line of duty to save lives. In Jabalpur police managed to save several patients by quickly arranging oxygen cylinders after the hospital was out of stock. Similar efforts were made by police in other districts as well. But the relentless struggle is taking a toll. Senior police officers have expressed fears of fatigue interfering with the immunity of even the fully vaccinated lot. They have been in the field since the pandemic started, while most civilian staff have worked remotely. Health and safety of own families are becoming a big concern of law enforcement officers who have been on the frontlines of the coronavirus pandemic. “In Bhopal, we are monitoring SpO2 levels of each personnel twice daily, keeping a tab on their family's health, doing mandatory CT scans and following progress of positive cases end to end in both hospitalised and home quarantine cases,” said SP Bhopal (south) Sai Krishna. “This wave is significant in four aspects – more exemptions from curfew, vast spread, limited police staff, and more regular crime work than the last time,” he said, adding: “This presents a challenge as police have to do deeper verification of people moving around, do longer duties, apprehend culprits who often turn out to be Covid-positive, and come into direct exposure over and over.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/over-100-mp-cops-on-bengal-poll-duty-test-ve/articleshow/82347663.cms||P Naveen

---||Hyderabad||Telangana CM KCR ousts Eatala, chief secretary to monitor Covid-19 operations||HYDERABAD: Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Saturday removed Eatala Rajender as state health minister and left him without a portfolio. The chief minister will himself take charge of the health department now, even as the Covid-19 pandemic rages across the state. He directed his secretary P Rajasekhar Reddy to monitor the situation from the CMO. KCR also ensured officials of revenue, vigilance and enforcement wing and anticorruption departments hand over a report to him on the alleged encroachment of assigned lands by Eatala. The action came a little more than 12 hours after KCR ordered a probe into the allegations made by farmers of Hakimpet and Achampet on the outskirts of Hyderabad that Eatala had encroached assigned lands to expand his chicken hatchery. For his part, Eatala remained adamant and refused to put in his papers as minister. KCR also instructed chief secretary Somesh Kumar to review the Covid 19 situation thrice a day and personally monitor the situation and ensure that there is no shortage of Remdesivir, vaccines, Oxygen and the beds in hospitals. Sharply reacting to his ouster from the health ministry, Rajender on Saturday said that the chief minister has every right to shift any minister, but a systematic plan was hatched against him and there would be repercussions for those involved. “It is a pre-planned attempt to tarnish my image,” he said. “I have clean image for the past 20 years of my political life and people in my constituency are feeling bad about it. If this happens to me, it can happen to anyone. I have been associated with TRS for the past two decades.” The next move of the minister is expected to be known only after a few days. Eatala had actively participated in the Telangana agitation along with KCR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kcr-ousts-eatala-cs-to-monitor-covid-19-ops/articleshow/82347998.cms||Koride Mahesh

The couple, marginal farmers, hailing from Kasimpur village, had travelled to Pilibhit city, around 30 km, after Longshree complained of unbearable pain on Friday morning. “As her condition deteriorated in the morning, I brought her to the hospital but the doctor refused to come closer. When I asked him to admit my wife, he said she would be fine with the medicines he had prescribed and sent us back,” said her husband Brijesh Kumar. “Longshree was in immense pain and she was unable to walk, but the doctor didn’t show any mercy and even refused to check her properly, leaving her to die on the footpath,” added the husband, who made repeated calls to the ambulance helpline service for help. Nearly three hours after her death, a resident brought the matter to the notice of police who arranged an auto-rickshaw to take the body away. Adnan Khan, who is with an afternoon daily, was on his way home when he noticed Brijesh, who was sitting with his dead wife’s head in his lap, on the footpath near Naughwa bridge around 5 pm. “He was looking disturbed. When I asked him about the matter, he told me that his wife was suffering from a chronic renal disease and died for the want of medical attention. The elderly man said that he had made several calls to the ambulance service helpline, but in vain,” said Khan. “I, then, contacted the health department and the district administration for help, which finally came from police,’ said Khan. Sub-inspector Anchal Kumar posted at Sungadi police station finally arranged an auto-rickshaw from his pocket and sent the body to Kasimpur village, added Khan. Vinod Kumar, the couple's elder son, told TOI, "My father is shocked. He is not eating anything.

Sources, however, said that it is unlikely to be deployed before mid-May. “Unless they give an exemption (from testing), it will take about two weeks for rollout. If exempted, the rollout could happen within a week,” sources told TOI. The testing must be done at the Central Drugs Laboratory at Kasauli in Himachal Pradesh. Dr Reddy’s Laboratories also indicated as much in a statement issued by its CEO (API& Services) Deepak Sapra. It said: “The rollout of the consignment will be subject to the necessary clearances, which will be processed over the next few days”. Sources also pointed out the consignment contains only first dose of Sputnik V. The second dose is expected to arrive later this month. “Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) wanted to make a statement by sending first lot of Sputnik V on May 1, the day the vaccination drive opened up for all adults,” said a source. “From May 20 onwards, we will start getting consignments of Sputnik V every week.” Sources added the first shipment will be used by Dr Reddy’s to test out the cold chain, both in rural and urban settings. “This initial quantity will be used across different channels as a pilot to line up our supply chain for the larger vaccination programme rollout. Subsequent consignments will arrive in the next few weeks,” said Sapra in his statement. Dr Reddy’s has not yet announced the pricing for the vaccine, which has a global uniform price of $10 per dose. STOI has learnt that the cost of shipment of these doses, which is in the frozen form, could cost around $10 per dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sputnik-vax-lands-in-hyd-rollout-after-clearances/articleshow/82348000.cms||Swati Bharadwaj
---||Mumbai||Biotech associate must only make Covaxin at plant near Pune: HC||Mumbai: Bombay high court has sought an undertaking from an associate of Bharat Biotech before it permits it to begin manufacturing Covaxin at a fully operational and ready vaccine manufacturing plant on 12 hectares near Pune. A bench of Justices K K Tated and Nitin Borkar heard on April 29 an interim application by Karnataka’s Biovet Pvt Ltd to hand over peaceful possession of a ready-to-use BSL-3 vaccine manufacturing facility at Manjari Khurd village, Haveli taluka, Pune district and building/structure and manufacturing equipment of Intervet India Pvt Ltd, a multinational and subsidiary of Merck & Co, that was granted the land in 1973 for manufacturing FMD vaccine. Intervet is exiting business operations in India and entered into an agreement with Biovet to transfer the land and manufacturing unit to it. When Biovet sought the government’s approval to the transfer, the deputy conservator of forests (Pune division) pointed out that it was a reserved forest and the initial 1973 grant itself was bad. An order was passed in September 2020 to resume the land. Biovet filed a petition in HC challenging it and the issue whether or not it was a reserved forest was pending adjudication. Last month, Biovet moved an interim application, saying the fully operational unit, if not operated, will be “ruined and will not be fit for further operations, and it will be a national loss”. Biovet’s advocates Ramesh Soni and Sujay Gawade argued that during the pandemic, when there was a shortage of vaccines, it was in national interest to permit operations of the unit so that demand for vaccines can be augmented. They also said it will ramp up production of millions of Covaxin vials, even as the country opens up vaccination for the 18-44 age group. Advocate-general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni, with advocate Akshay Shinde, said the state had no objection to Biovet’s prayer, but it must manufacture Covaxin and not use the land for any other purpose. Also, it must not claim equity on the basis of the permission, and it must be subject to HC’s final orders in the main petition. Soni said Biovet was willing to file an undertaking. The judges will pass a formal order on May 4.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/biotech-associate-must-only-make-covaxin-at-plant-in-mumbai-hc/articleshow/82348002.cms||Rosy Sequeira

The cops said most challans were issued in the east divisions of the city, which consists of sectors 18,19, 20, 21, 26 and 27 and colony number 4, Kishangarh, Manimajra, New Indira Colony, Mauli Jagran and IT Park. The police have intensified the challaning drive in the city and cops can be seen catching people for not wearing masks at Sukhna Lake, Elante Mall and other busy markets of the city. In the meanwhile, the UT police fined 109 people for roaming without wearing masks, spitting in the public and not maintaining social distancing on Saturday. Apart from this, the cops also arrested 11 persons for roaming in public places and violating the curfew norms. The police also arrested eight persons for stepping out on roads without wearing masks, 78 people were fined for not maintaining social distancing and 23 people were caught for spitting in the public, between 5 am and 6 pm on the first day of the weekend lockdown in the city. The police collected Rs 58,500 as fines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cops-fine-over-20k-this-year-for-flouting-covid-19-rules/articleshow/82347343.cms||Pawan Tiwari
---||Goa||State govt playing with lives: GSM||Panaji: Accusing the state government of ‘criminal negligence’, Goa Suraksha Manch (GSM) has blamed it for Covid-19 cases in Goa spiralling out of control. Party president Nitin Faldesai said that the state allowed municipal elections to take place even as Covid-19 related deaths were already on the rise. He said that now at least the state should take corrective measures and stop playing with the lives of people. “The state government should immediately declare containment zones wherever cases are on the rise or else it is feared that the number of deaths will go up further,” he said . Further, he said that chief minister Pramod Sawant is only seen blaming people for the rise in Covid-19, which has occurred due to his own negligence. “Every now and then Sawant is seen saying that people are not wearing masks, not maintaining social distancing. But when the Covid-19 situation has reached its worst, he inaugurated a new bridge amidst a crowd. All have seen what social distancing was being observed in that crowd led by the CM,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-govt-playing-with-lives-gsm/articleshow/82348025.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Three years on, no signs of a thaw in KCR-Eatala cold war||HYDERABAD: The cold war between chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and minister without portfolio Eatala Rajender began in 2018 and showed no signs of a thaw between the two senior TRS leaders. It reached a point of no return with KCR stripping Eatala of his health ministry. Eatala remained belligerent on Saturday, refusing to meet the CM, a day after a probe was ordered into the alleged encroachment of assigned land in Medak district. Refusing to spell out his future course of action, Eatala merely said he would first talk to his constituency people and leaders. Eatala’s stubborn stand is the first rebellion in the ruling TRS after it came to power in 2014. He was one of the founding members of the party and second minister facing axe in the last seven years. In the first term, then health minister and deputy CM Thatikonda Rajaiah was sacked from the cabinet following corruption charges in the purchase of ambulances. In fact, there were doubts if Eatala would be inducted into the cabinet by KCR and got a dekko at the last minute when the CM expanded his team in 2019. BC MLA from Karimnagar district Gangula Kamalakar was also inducted into the cabinet much to the chagrin of Eatala. Eatala, who represents Huzurabad constituency in Karimnagar district, has been taking pot-shots at the TRS leadership in the last two years. Speculations were doing the rounds that he would bid farewell to the party, float a new party or join the BJP, but he dismissed them as a propaganda. That Eatala was nursing ambitions to form his own party did not cut much ice with KCR. At a meeting with partye MLAs and other elected representative at Telangana Bhavan, he made a teasing remark, “floating a party is not an easy task like establishing a pan dabba (shop).” The CM’s remarks were ostensibly directed towards Eatala. Eatala, a strong BC leader from Mudiraj community, has been courting controversy and made half a dozen remarks on KCR and party leadership. In his first comment in his constituency a year ago, he had said: “We are the owners of the TRS who have carried the pink party flag and a minister’s post is not anybody’s pittance. I am here today because of my work and not because of my caste.” The Huzurabad MLA went on to say, “I am not somebody’s son and I am a hardworking party worker.” Later, he clarified that his comments were quoted out of context. When the legislative assembly was in session recently, Eatala at the inauguration of a Rythu Vedika in Veenavanka in Karimnagar said money, caste or party were not important to him and that only good deeds and humanism were important. He said he was upset, hurt and disappointed, but had never left the right path despite facing hurdles. The party leadership was ill at ease with the comments and party working president KT Rama Rao stepped in to calm the nerves. He held a one-to-one meeting with Eatala and took the minister in his car to Pragathi Bhavan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/three-years-on-no-signs-of-a-thaw-in-kcr-eatala-cold-war/articleshow/82347674.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Mutant N440K 10 times more infectious than parent strain||HYDERABAD: Even as scientists are busy decoding the potential threat of the double mutant (B.1.617), a team of researchers from Hyderabad and Ghaziabad has found that the mutant N440K of the novel coronavirus is 10 to 1,000 times more infectious than certain strains now in circulation. This mutant appears to be fuelling the second wave of Covid-19 in certain pockets of India. The mutant N440K, first found in Andhra Pradesh’s Kurnool city, is spreading fast in some parts of the country, including AP and Telangana, if the number of infections attributed to this mutant in March and April is any indication. Already one-third of infections in both Telugu states are caused by this variant and in the second wave, its presence is rapidly increasing. In the last two months, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana and Chhattisgarh together contributed to about 50 per cent of the samples indicating the geographicallylocalised spread of the N440K variant in India. The research study involved scientists from Hyderabad-based Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) and the Academy for Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh. The study reveals that the N440K variant produced 10 times higher infectious viral titres (viral load) than a prevalent A2a strain and over 1,000-fold higher titres than a much less prevalent A3i strain prototype in Caco2 (epithelial) cells. As many as 1,555 entries with N440K substitution could be identified from across the world. Interestingly, India contributed the largest proportion of N440K variants at 33 per cent followed by the US and Germany, the researchers said. The proportion of the N440K variant in India has increased from 4.9 per cent sequence earlier to 8.82 per cent between January and April 24, they explained. “Our studies unambiguously demonstrate that N440K variant prototype has capacity to generate significantly higher titres of infectious virus in shorter duration and suggest that this feature could promote its faster spread among certain populations,” the study, published in pre-print server ‘Bio-Rxiv’ on April 30, said. The research team comprised Dixit Tandel, Divya Gupta, Vishal Sah and Krishnan Harinivas Harshan. According to the researchers, the N440K variant belongs to the lineage of A2a strain. “Data suggests that the proportion of N440K variant has been increasing gradually and suggesting its improved replicative fitness or increased infectivity,” they said. Stating that the N440K mutation has been reported in several viral sequences across India, the team said: “Based on our results, we predict that the higher infectious titres achieved by N440K variant could possibly lead to its higher rate of transmission.” The researchers, however, added that availability of more sequencing data in the immediate future would help understand the potential spread of this variant in more detail. The study pointed out that recent data indicate the prevalence of variants with N440K spike substitution in several parts of India, which is under the second wave of the pandemic. It confirmed the increased potency of the N440K variant. “A further breakdown of the recent data indicates a gradual increase in the representation of this variant with March and April adding more of this variant than the previous months. An increase in the proportion of N440K variant in the Indian samples is also evident with almost 10 per cent of the sequences submitted in April 2021 carrying this substitution,” the researchers said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/mutant-n440k-10-times-more-infectious-than-parent-strain/articleshow/82348011.cms||Syed Akbar
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: 66 acres of assigned land encroached, says probe report||HYDERABAD: A day after minister Eatala Rajender dared CM K Chandrasekhar Rao to order a probe by a sitting judge, the Medak district administration on Saturday concluded that Eatala’s Jamuna Hatcheries had encroached 66 acres of ceiling assigned land in Achampet and Hakimpet villages in Masaipet mandal. After conducting a probe, the administration said another 55 acres of patta (private) land in possession of Jamuna Hatcheries is being examined. District collector S Hareesh sent a report to the government with each survey number land, ceiling assigned land, encroachments noticed and patta land. The district administration is likely to initiate action against Jamuna Hatcheries in a day or two after getting orders from the government. The company, however, denied the charges made in the report. According to the report (a copy of which is in possession of STOI), of the total 315 acres in contention, 121 acres was surveyed using digital technology. “The land in survey Nos. 77 (7.19 acres), 78 (8.25 acres), 79 (10.10 acres), 80 (10.10 acres), 81 (9.19 acres) and 82 (3.11 acres) in Achampet and another 15.24 acres in survey No. 130 in the same village and 1.02 acres in survey No. 97 in Hakimpet was encroached upon by Jamuna Hatcheries,” the collector said in the report. The report said patta land in survey Nos. 55, 104, 110, 111, 112, 113, 124 to 129 in Achampet and in survey Nos. 111 and 112 in Hakimpet (total 55 acres) is still being examined to check if there were any violations. Denying the allegations in the report, Jamuna Hatcheries in a letter to the collector said it purchased 60 acres in Achampet and Hakimpet in a lawful manner and constructed a 12-breeder laying farm sheds in addition to two brooding farm sheds maintaining bio-security standards in survey Nos. 55, 124, 126, 127, 128, 129 and 130 of Achampet and in final stages of erecting a poultry feed plant in survey No. 111 of Hakimpet by obtaining loans from Canara Bank.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/66-acres-of-assigned-land-encroached-says-probe-report/articleshow/82347678.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Kochi||Kerala: Continuity or comeback? Poll suspense to end today||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Finally, a month’s wait for the state assembly election results would be over on Sunday. While the ruling front, LDF, is confident of retaining power, the UDF camp is also firmly believing in its chances for a comeback. Though exit polls have predicted continuity for the LDF government, the UDF has ruled out all such predictions. NDA too is confident of bettering its position. If the LDF retains power as projected by poll surveys, it would be naturally counted as a testimony to the public acceptance chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had garnered amid the unparalleled crisis and controversies. Irrespective of how effectively he managed the crisis like floods and the pandemic, Vijayan was certainly able to improve his public persona is a narrative in vogue. “His demeanour and the involvement he exhibited in his daily evening news conferences have helped him to create an impression that he is more capable of leading the state during the hour of crisis. This could be a major advantage for LDF in its possible comeback,” said political scientist G Gopakumar. But there is a counter narrative which says that LDF winning with less number of seats should not be mistaken as an authentic win. “If the campaign by the LDF has really clicked with the voters, it should result in a sweep by the LDF,” says psychiatrist Dr C J John. If LDF retains power with lesser seats, and lesser vote share, such a victory should humble them. In such a case, it could only mean that the anti-government votes have split among the opposition parties, argue some observers. “The behaviour of people when caught in the midst of a crisis need not to be politically driven,” points out Dr John, hinting at the folly of considering a less glorious victory by LDF as a apolitical one. On the other hand, UDF camp pins its hopes on the corruption and nepotism charges faced by the LDF government. Politically enlightened voters in Kerala would not give a second term to a government that is facing allegations of severe magnitude, the UDF leaders believe. They also think that the welfare pension and free kits distribution are gimmicks that voters would understand easily. Regarding the exit polls, the UDF leaders point out how the poll predictions of 2019 Lok Sabha election had gone awry. But still, there are concerns about how a large number of voters who were badly hit by the pandemic and other calamities might have voted during the crisis. The BJP-led NDA is equally confident of emerging as a decisive force. The front is hopeful of increasing its vote share significantly and winning at least a few seats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/continuity-or-comeback-poll-suspense-to-end-today/articleshow/82347381.cms||B S Anilkumar
---||Goa||Goa: Smallest state grapples with India’s highest positivity rate||PANAJI: Goa’s sub-par contact tracing and limited testing in April has seen India’s tiniest state report the highest positivity rate in the country. The steep curve of Goa’s Covid indicators not only show rapid disease spread, but also reveals the state government’s lackadaisical attitude towards the pandemic. At 40.5%, Goa’s weekly positivity rate remains the highest in the country, far ahead of larger states like Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra. A few days ago, the daily positivity rate stood at 51%, and epidemiologists and doctors said the data shows that one in every two persons getting tested in the state has been infected by the virus. On Saturday, of the 5,897 swab samples tested, 2,303 samples returned positive. A senior government doctor involved in managing Covid facilities said Goa’s high positivity rate presents “a true picture of the spread of the infection” in the tourist state. “Initially, we were doing less testing as our capacity was limited and the government was not able to pick up all the positives. The government increased testing and thought that this would dilute the positives, but the results are revealing a scary picture,” said the doctor, who refused to come on record due to fear of reprisal by the government. He said it is scary since “it is being matched by that many deaths too. Many deaths of those dying at home are not being tested for Covid, and are reported as heart attacks, etc, instead.” In the past week itself, the average growth rate of Covid-19 cases in Goa jumped from a steady 1.5% to 3.1%, sending fresh jitters in the corridors of the overburdened directorate of health services, even as the chief minister’s office remained non-committal about a strategy to quell the second wave. “There is a high possibility that the backlog in tests is getting cleared,” said former president of the Indian Medical Association's (IMA) Goa chapter, Dr Anil Mehndiratta. However, a doctor with the directorate of health services said “backlog testing has nothing to do with the high positivity rate, and that the numbers are equalised as and when the test results come in and are added in everyday’s bulletin”. The DHS doctor did say that the virus strain spreading in Goa is “far more infectious” than the state government had expected. “Now, even young people with no comorbidities are dying,” he said. “People need to come forward to get themselves tested and treated early,” said Mehndiratta. IMA has recommended that Goa needs to take serious steps to bring down the positivity rate to 10%, which is not only manageable for the healthcare sector but also considered the benchmark for adequate testing. Expressing concern over the trend in Goa, various doctors have called for round-the-clock testing for symptomatic patients, particularly antigen testing which would lessen the burden on labs carrying out RT-PCR tests. “The government is saying 5,000 tests are carried out, but we must know how many of these are antigen and RT-PCR to analyse them,” said an epidemiologist. “The high positivity rate is very worrying. We are just hoping it will peak and come down.” Goa’s high positivity rate has also prompted a cross-section of Goan society to demand a proper lockdown in the state, so that positive cases can be isolated, and to give the health sector a breather. “The government should at least now listen to the concerns raised by the Indian Medical Association and extend the lockdown period by 15 days to bring down the cases. The IMA says there is a need to bring the positivity rate down to 10%,” said youth Congress president Varad Mardolkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/smallest-state-grapples-with-indias-highest-positivity-rate/articleshow/82348019.cms||Newton Sequeira
---||Chandigarh||Parts of sectors 4, 6, 2 & 15 in Panchkula are also macro-containment zones||PANCHKULA: The Panchkula administration has formed four more macro-containment zones in the city and installed barricades outside the houses in various sectors. All the shops remained closed during the weekend lockdown. Deputy commissioner-cum-chairman of the district disaster management authority (DDMA) Mukesh Kumar Ahuja stated the report shows that the cases are increasing in few a sectors and thus, these areas have been declared as macro-containment zones. The areas include house numbers1205 to 1215, 1201 to 1189, 1228 to 1241, 1254 to 1242 and 194 to 181 at Sector 4; house numbers 77 to 65, 78 to 90, 364 to 370 and 379 to 373 at Sector 6; house numbers 795 to 800 and 774 to 780 at Sector 2 and house numbers 340/A to 341, 1250 to 1283, 2044 to 2061 and 2906 to 2930 at Sector 15. According to the orders of the DC, residents living in these areas will not be allowed to step out of their houses. Special teams will make sure that the residents are not flouting the norms. Soon after the orders, the police were deployed outside these houses and barricading was done. Markets, shops and religious places falling under the macro-containment zones will remain closed. The MC team will make sure proper sanitisation is done in the area and garbage is disposed from these houses. Supply of essential items and milk will be done by the officials of the food and supply department. The DC said the move comes in following the MHA guidelines. The police will guard the area and the health department team will be deployed to conduct random sampling and screening. UHBVN and Huda officials will make sure of uninterrupted power and water supply to residents in these areas. If a person is found flouting the norms, he/she will be booked under Section 51 of the Disaster Management Act and Section 188 of the IPC. Apart from this, during the lockdown on Saturday, the Panchkula streets wore a deserted look. All the shops, markets, religious places and restaurants remained closed. The cops were on duty. A total of 18 check posts were set up throughout the district to maintain the lockdown orders and the police checked all the vehicles passing through the entry/exit points and also inside the city. Deputy commissioner (DC) M K Ahuja and deputy commissioner of police (DCP) Mohit Handa took several rounds of the district to check the law and order situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/parts-of-sectors-4-6-2-15-in-pkl-are-also-macro-containment-zones/articleshow/82347379.cms||Arvind Bishnoi

Thackeray was chairing a review meeting with municipal corporations in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region and Pune Metropolitan Region. Dr Shashank Joshi of the state’s Covid task force said that due to sudden deterioration in the health of mild and asymptomatic patients who are in home isolation and late hospitalization, the mortality rate has increased in the cities, and so it is important to closely monitor these patients. The CM has also said that with experts projecting a third wave in the next few months, all corporations must ensure that they are self-sufficient in terms of their oxygen requirement. He also said that experts have projected that in the third wave, more children will be impacted, so the administration should ensure that hospital beds for child care treatment are planned for in advance. He said that the monsoons bring a host of monsoon- related ailments such as malaria, leptospirosis and jaundice, and treatment for these should be made available too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/need-control-rooms-with-docs-to-watch-mild-cases-in-mumbai-cm/articleshow/82348060.cms||---

On Friday night itself, Eatala’s supporters took to the roads in the Huzurabad assembly constituency disrupting traffic. They raised slogans against chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and municipal administration minister K T Rama Rao. They put up a flex photograph of Rajya Sabha MP Joginapally Santosh Kumar and burnt it. That Eatala was displeased with the way he was being treated was expressed by him at a press conference he organised at his Shamirpet residence. His supporters took to the roads immediately in Huzurabad in Karimnagar district and expressed solidary with him. Police made elaborate security arrangements in Kalamapur village, the minister’s native place to ensure there was no law and order problem. Eatala took to social media urging the people of his constituency not to come to Hyderabad in view of the Covid situation. However, by morning scores of his supporters arrived and staged a rasto-roko at Sharmirpet on Rajiv Rahadari close to the residence of the minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rajendars-supporters-block-rajiv-rahadari/articleshow/82347684.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

However, the civil hospital rejected the allegations. Senior congress leader Gayatriba Vaghela found large number of unused ventilators during an inspection of the hospital on Saturday. “The medical superintendent told me that these ventilators were allocated by the government just 15 days ago and the process of installing them has begun. “But the question is when there is a tremendous shortage of ventilators why the hospital took two weeks to install the same? Are these ventilators out of order or does the hospital doesn’t have staff to install these machines,” Vaghela told TOI. According to sources Dhaman-1 ventilators were being used last year but those were not suitable for critical patients. Later, the Rajkot-based company introduced the upgraded version Dhaman-3. Sources claimed that the ventilators lying in the medical college’s premises are Dhaman-1.Later, R S Trivedi, medical superintendent of Civil Hospital, issued a statement to counter the claims. “We got Dhaman-1 during the first wave and thereafter we got Dhaman-3. There is a non-invasive technique in Dhaman-3 so we are using it more. We are using Dhaman-1 also if the need arises. We have sufficient ventilators currently,” the release stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/ventilators-lying-unused-at-rch-alleges-congress-leader/articleshow/82346795.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: As US airfare sky high, some offer Rs 1.5L charter flight seat||Mumbai: With the US set to restrict from May 4 the entry of most non-Americans who are currently in India, one-way fares for flights bound for the western country from cities such as Mumbai and Delhi have shot up. With restrictions on travel to London and Dubai and no seats left on non-stop flights between India and the US, the scramble for charter flights has begun. On Saturday afternoon, the cheapest fare available for travel from Delhi to New York on the same day began at Rs 7 lakh, for an Air India flight via Tokyo and onwards to Newark on United Airlines. For travel on Monday, May 3, from Mumbai to New York, there were no seats available on any flights. “Indians are now looking at charter flights. A travel company is apparently selling one-way tickets on direct flights from Mumbai to New York for Rs 1.5 lakh. They probably plan to charter an aircraft, but I don’t know whether the operator they have entrusted this job to has managed to procure the requisite permissions to operate the flight,” said a travel industry insider, requesting anonymity. With a negative PCR report mandatory to fly into the US, fares for travel on May 3 were priced higher than those for May 2 (RT-PCR test results take longer now due to the second Covid wave). For May 3, the cheapest one-way fare on the Delhi-New York route began at Rs 4 lakh. For travel on May 2, the cheapest one-way ticket on a Mumbai-New York flight began at Rs 74,000, which was for a 30-hour flight, operated by British Airways and American Airlines, which transits via London and Miami. Indian passport holders cannot board this flight though. “The travel restrictions imposed last week by the UK and the UAE have stifled Indian passport holders as they can’t board flights to the US that transit via Dubai and London,’’ said another travel industry insider, requesting anonymity. Neither can those with American passports fly on the May 2 flight as a negative PCR report is mandatory to fly into the US and the likelihood of getting a test report in 24 hours is slim. For Americans in India, the going is tough as well. The cheapest, one-way fare for travel on May 3 and arrival before the deadline started at Rs 4.37 lakh on Delhi-New York Air India-Lufthansa, 17-hour, Frankfurt-transit flight. On certain travel portals, one could find one-way tickets for travel on Sunday and Monday that were priced around Rs 70,000. On selecting the ticket, though, the website would show the fare had changed to over Rs 1 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-as-us-airfare-sky-high-some-offer-rs-1-5l-charter-flight-seat/articleshow/82347391.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Plea against vaccine ‘discrimination’ faced by people below 45 filed in HC||CHANDIGARH: A petition has been filed before Punjab and Haryana high court alleging discrimination by the Union government for Phase III of the vaccination drive in which people above 18 years of age are to be vaccinated for Covid-19 on payment. The main plea is that no such payment was received from the beneficiaries of Phase I and Phase II when people above 60 years and people between 45 and 59 years of age were vaccinated free of cost in government hospitals. The petitioner, Abhishek Malhotra, a student of law at Panjab University, Chandigarh, sought directions for reducing the price of Covishield and Covaxin vaccines to be administered to people of 18-44 years in the third phase of vaccination, which was to commence from May 1. The petition, expected to come up for hearing next week, has impleaded Union health and family welfare minister, state governments of Punjab, Haryana, and UT Chandigarh as respondent parties in the case. According to the petitioner, exclusion of persons in the age group of 18 to 44 years for free vaccine quota of the Centre, amounts to illegal discrimination. As per the Union ministry of health and family welfare, two vaccines granted emergency use authorization by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) in India are Covishield (AstraZeneca's vaccine manufactured by Serum Institute of India) and Covaxin (manufactured by Bharat Biotech Limited). On January 16, vaccination for Phase I of the National Covid-19 Vaccination strategy was launched, which focused on healthcare workers (HCWs), frontline workers (FLWs) and persons over 60 years of age. On March 1, vaccination for Phase II was initiated and it focused on protecting the most vulnerable population of persons between 45 and 59 years with comorbid conditions and later on people between 45 and 59 years without comorbidities were added to the list. On May 1, vaccination for Phase-3 commenced, for which everyone over the age of 18 years is eligible. The petitioner stated that the prices set by Serum Institute of India (SII) on April 21 for Covishield is exorbitantly high. “Moreover prices of these vaccines could be set by GOI by using the power under Section 4 of the Drugs (Control) Act 1950, as these prices are unreasonably high and the same could not be afforded by the middle class or financially weak sections of the society and violates Article 14, 15, and 21 of the Constitution of India of the petitioner as well as of public at large,” the plea said. The petitioner sought directions for the Union government to reduce the price of vaccines, Covishield or Covaxine for Phase-3 vaccination for private hospitals, by using the relevant provisions of the drug (Control) Act 1950 and keep the prices synchronised with Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials ie Rs 250 for private hospitals so that the price of the vaccine can be easily afforded by below poverty line (BPL) financially weaker sections/downtrodden /vulnerable sections of society.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/plea-against-vaccine-discrimination-faced-by-people-below-45-filed-in-hc/articleshow/82347687.cms||---
---||Goa||Another grim record: State sees 54 deaths, over 2.3k new cases||Panaji: The state reached another grim high on Saturday after it reported a record 54 deaths and 2,303 fresh cases. Fourteen of these deaths occured earlier, but were reported Saturday. Of the 40 deaths that took place in the 24 hours before the bulletin was issued, 24 were at Goa Medical College (GMC), 12 at South Goa district hospital, and two at the North Goa district hospital. Two were brought dead to the primary health centre, Madkaim, and a North Goa private hospital. Almost half the deceased were under 60. This has taken the death toll to 1,223. The state’s positivity rate slightly dropped to 39.1%, and Goa now has 23,884 active cases. A doctor said that Covid infections over the weekend don’t reflect the true picture during lockdown, as all government testing centres except hospitals are closed on weekends. “People who don’t have their own transport to go to centres to get tested during the lockdown haven’t tested. The sick people have not come out to test. The ones who could go all the way to hospitals and have their own transport have tested. We will know the true picture only after the lockdown,” the doctor said. Another 225 hospitalisations were reported, and 2,799 people applied for home isolation. The health system continues to be is inundated, with beds filling up quickly no sooner than new Covid wards are added. “There are a finite number of beds, and once these are full, it is but natural that one cannot get access to all facilities like oxygen,” said a doctor. “People have to wait for beds, and sometimes rationing of beds and oxygen has to be done. A lot of people are also not coming in on time, and have a very casual approach to Covid. They come in with bad pneumonia. Early detection can prevent them from getting pneumonia and starting medication on time.” However, citizens have told TOI of the difficulties they face getting tested and getting their RT-PCR results on time. “During the last wave, the cases were fewer, severity was less and deaths were fewer, but more caution was exercised by the public. This time, a lot of people are not taking precautions and roaming. Another reason is the recent elections, where party workers have tested positive,” the doctor said, adding that people give excuses of the weather and seasonal flu instead of getting tested for Covid. “There are those who tested positive but hadn’t applied for home isolation and never got the kit, and said they were feeling fine. Covid can be managed at home in many of the cases if those on home isolation meticulously check their oxygen saturation. The pulse oximeter is given free of cost. This is the least they can do,” the doctor said. “Breathlessness is definitely not the first symptom,” the doctor said. “People ignore earlier symptoms and then the cytokine storm hits them and saturation starts dropping slowly, but sometimes it’s too late as damage to lungs has already taken place.” He added that doctors who have taken the vaccine have got mild Covid. Another doctor in a private hospital said oxygen supply continues to be a major issue. Meanwhile, the state’s recovery rate has fallen to 73.1%, with 1,310 persons recovering over the past 24 hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/another-grim-record-state-sees-54-deaths-over-2-3k-new-cases/articleshow/82348027.cms||---
---||Goa||Testing difficulties add to patients’ dilemma||PANAJI: Even as Covid-19 rages and continues to spread its tentacles across the state, citizens struggle to get tested, with late results and lack of social distancing acting as major deterrents. In Porvorim, a symptomatic persons couldn’t get tested on Saturday since the local health centre was shut. “No testing is taking place at government facilities except government hospitals,” she told TOI. “I avoided these, as there would be a crowd, and turned to private labs. Here, too, most had queues, and others were shut on the weekend. One private hospital said they were only testing for emergencies, as their staff was tired.” She finally found a private hospital in Porvorim, but panicked when she saw no social distancing in the queue. “There was no place to sit,” she said. “I got a spot to wait near medical waste bins. The bins were locked, but not closed. I waited for a minute and then ran away from there.” Other private labs were shut while others said their bookings for the day was full. “A doctor advised me to consider myself positive, isolate and begin medication. I’m keeping my fingers crossed,” she said. Advocate Siddharth Sardesai said that a person who goes from place to place to find testing could spread the virus, which defeats the purpose of stopping Covid-19. “A senior citizen should be able to call a hotline and get themselves tested at home either for free or at a nominal cost,” he said. A senior citizen from Caranzalem with fever wanted to get tested, but found the centre closed. “The government is advising people to be vigilant and get themselves tested, but testing is done only on alternate days. There should be more testing booths. Testing should be 24x7,” she told TOI. The crucial gap between testing and getting one’s result is taking away lives. “It took my aunt three to four days to get her test results, and though yes, she tested late, it cost her her life,” Sardesai told TOI. A 32-year-old Panaji tech worker, Ashish, has been waiting for ten days for the results of his wife’s Covid test. “My wife got tested on April 21, and she hasn’t received the results till date. The government needs to streamline this and use technology to simplify the process of delivering results. Health officers are working hard, but the government needs to step up its game.” A doctor told TOI that since the positivity rate is very high, the government must carry out rapid antigen testing 24x7 on all symptomatic patients to bring down the load on RT-PCR testing, which can be done based on capacity of the government and on those who are symptomatic but still test negative on rapid antigen tests, he said. Porvorim resident Juino de Souza told TOI that getting tested at the Porvorim primary health centre is a nightmare where hordes of people gather everyday and spill over onto the road. The PHC occupies a tiny two-bedroom apartment in government quarters, and needs more space to cater to the growing population of Goa’s de-facto capital, he says. “Why is the government not allocating a bigger space? It appears that Porvorim is being neglected by the health ministry and by the local MLA, who has not bothered to take up the issue with the government.” “Just shifting the vaccination centre to Sanjay school doesn’t suffice. The whole PHC must be accommodated in a bigger space,” he told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/testing-difficulties-add-to-patients-dilemma/articleshow/82348068.cms||Newton Sequeira
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: 98,000 acres of assigned land encroached or sold illegally||HYDERABAD: Stating that the alleged encroachment of assigned land by minister Eatala Rajender’s Jamuna Hatcheries was only a tip of the iceberg, the revenue department said over 98,000 acres of government assigned land in the state is either gobbled up by land sharks or illegally sold by allottees. Of this total parcel of land, 6,600 acres is illegally purchased by realty companies, individuals and institutions in erstwhile Rangareddy district alone, it said. Senior revenue officials said the government is seeking reports from district collectors on the status of assigned land in the state in the wake of large-scale encroachments. Assigned land is a parcel of land allotted by the government to landless poor for agriculture purposes. Farmers do not have any powers to sell or transfer the land to other parties and if they resort to any such activity, it would be illegal. However, there have been several instances of farmers selling their assigned land parcels to private partiesin the last 20 years. “As per the Telangana Assigned lands Prohibiton of Transfer Act 1977, sale or alienation or transfer of assigned land is both civil and criminal office and a tahsildar can take action. There are some exceptions. It is not applicable to land assigned prior to 1958 and banks going for an auction when the land was mortgaged ,” M Suneel Kumar, an expert on land laws, told STOI. A revenue divisional officer of erstwhile Rangareddy district said the farmers continue to resort to sale of assigned land despite several warnings. “Such violations come to our notice when farmers illegally sell their land at cheaper rates at Rs 5 lakh. Now, the selling price tops Rs 50 lakh to Rs 1 crore,” he said. The district administration has filed cases in 4,200 illegal transactions in the past few years. As resuming an assigned land is a cumbersome process and one which could upset farmers, the state government has recently decided to auction them by paying compensation to the allottees. “The chief minister had thought of regularisation of assigned land by collecting some penal amount. He had even admitted on the floor of the assembly that several thousands of illegal transactions on assigned land were taking place,” a senior official of the chief commissioner of land administration said. In another move, the government has also decided to take over the assigned land from the allottees for setting up industries and SEZs like Hyderabad Pharma City.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/98000-acres-of-assigned-land-encroached-or-sold-illegally/articleshow/82347689.cms||Koride Mahesh

He climbed atop the tower along with his daughter and stood there, poised to jump down. Locals who spotted the man informed Rampur’s Tanda police. They rushed teams to the tower and began persuading the man to climb down and spare his daughter from harm. The incident occurred in Nai Basti of Nawabpura area under Tanda police jurisdiction late on Friday. The man climbed the mobile tower located near Mekka mosque in the area. Tanda police said it took police over two hours to persuade the man, identified as Aqeel, to climb down with his daughter. Investigation revealed that the man was apparently upset after an argument with his wife earlier in the day. An FIR was registered against Aqeel and he was later sent to jail, police added. Talking with TOI, Madhav Singh Bisht, SHO of Tanda police station, said, “After much persuasion, the man was successfully convinced by police to come down along with his daughter.” He said that Aqeel took the step due to an ongoing family dispute and that he was disturbed by his wife’s alleged “love affair”. The child was handed over to her mother, the SHO added. A case has been registered against Aqeel under IPC section 307 (attempt to murder) and 309 (attempt to commit suicide). The man has been arrested and further investigation is underway, said Bisht.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/man-climbs-atop-mobile-tower-with-4-yr-old-daughter-persuaded-to-come-down-arrested/articleshow/82347396.cms||Maria Khan

The second wave has been disastrous, with many losing near and dear ones, shattering their lives completely. Lack of strict vigilance and foresight to handle the pandemic has also accounted for this scenario,” said PFG’s Mahesh Mahambrey. He said citizens in the age group of 18-44 years are eagerly awaiting their vaccine doses, but it has not taken off here as announced on May 1 due to lack of doses. “Private health care players, however, are already stocked with vaccines. This is an unfortunate, unprecedented phase our state is going through. As a responsible NGO fighting for causes of the state, it is our responsibility to leave aside political affiliations and unite at this hour of need,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/take-all-into-confidence-to-fight-virus/articleshow/82348116.cms||---

On average, over 2,000 Covid cases are reported daily in the state. “In the interest of the state, I will take a decision on Sunday. I will take everyone into confidence before taking the decision. I will also discuss the issue with my colleagues,” Sawant told TOI. Earlier in the day, science and technology minister Michael Lobo said that the chief minister would extend the lockdown with stringent measures for 10 days from Monday to stop the spread of Covid-19 as the situation is going out of control. “I have told the chief minister to go for lockdown with stricter standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the next 10 days to break the coronavirus chain in the state. I have told him that this is not my opinion, but I have received calls and messages from different people from across the state to tell the chief minister that he needs to do this,” Lobo told TOI. On Friday, Sawant had said that the government will not extend the lockdown period ending on Monday morning. The state is currently under lockdown from Thursday evening. In most areas, people have voluntarily kept their shops and establishments closed, even though the government order has not called for it. Lobo said, “If the government fails to extend the lockdown, the entire machinery may collapse. I have told the chief minister that there is no way that Goa should open on Monday. We have to go for preventive measures. People should not move out except for essentials. Chief minister has told me that he will go ahead and extend the lockdown.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-extension-of-lockdown-more-stringent-measures-likely-cm/articleshow/82348083.cms||Murari Shetye
---||Goa||Young docs deliver baby of mom hit by Covid pneumonia||PANAJI: A team of young doctors performed a successful Cesarean section on a 29-year-old Covid-positive woman at a small non-corporate hospital in Margao. The mother, from Panaji, was 8.5 weeks pregnant and had moderate Covid pneumonia with high fever ten days after testing positive. She was admitted to Mother care hospital, Margao, due to the shortage of beds in Panaji and other places. Dr Sawani Hegde Surlakar, the consultant gynaecologist and obstetrician who performed the surgery, said that she consulted several senior doctors and took the decision to deliver the baby for the wellbeing of the mother as well as that of the baby. The mother, she said, couldn’t be aggressively treated for Covid while she was pregnant, and at the same time, they feared the high fever would harm the unborn baby. The 2.2kg baby was successfully delivered at 34 weeks, and is currently in the NICU at Classic hospital. Although several similar deliveries of Covid-positive mothers have taken place in government hospitals, this is one of the first few in a private hospital. The severe shortage of beds due to the significant rise in cases made referring to GMC a difficult option. The team of young doctors decided to step up to save the mother and baby. Others in the team were Dr Neeraj Borkar, Dr Kefas Quadros and Tirthanaka Naik. Radiologist Dr Prasad Hegde performed the ultrasound for detection of the estimated weight of the baby. The patient was managed by Dr Aman Prabhu Gaonkar, MD and partner at the hospital, and pulmonologist Dr Jagruti Nadkarni. She was then discharged. “Big corporate hospitals can do it, but this is quite a feat for a small setup like ours. It was a bold decision taken by a very young team of doctors and the results were good,” said Prabhu Gaonkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/young-docs-deliver-baby-of-mom-hit-by-covid-pneumonia/articleshow/82348110.cms||Lisa Monteiro

Former Malkajgiri MLA Akula Rajender said ORR alignment was finalised by then Hyderabad Urban Development Authority officials. Eatala who was a TRS MLA then wanted a change in the alignment as it was passing through his land. YSR asked the officials to help him along with other land owners at Shamirpet. “It was not only his (Eatala’s) land which was facing alignment issues. Many MLAs’ land and then minister Mukesh Goud’s land was also taken over for the ORR at Tukkguda,” he recalled. “Eatala instead of dragging YSR’s name into the issue should come clean in the assigned land grabbing fiasco,” Rajender said. On Friday night, Eatala alleged that the ORR alignment in 2006 was designed to pass through his land at Shamirpet and he fought against it and a House committee was constituted on ORR alignment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/eatalas-claims-on-alignmentof-outer-ring-road-flayed/articleshow/82347697.cms||---

---||Goa||Walk-in vax for 45+ all through May: State||Panaji: The state government has decided to continue vaccinations for those in the 45+ age group at all government vaccination centres on public holidays and weekends. State immunisation officer Dr Rajendra Borkar said that vaccinations for first dose and second dose will continue for the 45+ age group at all government vaccination centres every day of May, just as it was in April. “There’s no need to book a slot. They can walk in for both doses. If people wish, they may book a slot and visit,” he said. Some vaccination sites are limiting the number of beneficiaries per day due to the shortage of staff. “It varies from site to site and how many staff are working. The staff are doing optimal vaccinations possible. They have been working seven days a week, 30 days a month and a number of them have also tested positive, some of their families have also tested positive. There are constraints with staff and they are trying to strike a balance,” Borkar said. The state government has sent a requisition to Serum Institute of India for vaccines for the 18-45-year age group. but is yet to receive assurance that it will reach soon. The 45+ year olds needn’t be apprehensive about supply of vaccines as there is “continuous supply from the government of India for this age group,” Borkar said. “Those vaccinated are less likely to be infected, admitted to hospital and die. It is evident that those vaccinated will get a milder infection if at all they get the infection,” he said. A GMC doctor told TOI that the doctors who got vaccinated before the second wave and yet turned positive, have generally got mild infections and recovered quickly. “It was just like a viral flu and they recovered within a few days. We haven’t seen anyone vaccinated, getting severe pneumonia,” the doctor said. A retired doctor suggested speeding up the process by having more than one data entry operator. “The vaccine jab only takes a few seconds. The data entry stage takes time. Volunteers should be brought on board to help speed up this process. Besides, the vaccinator and a doctor to check on any adverse effects following immunisation (AEFI), the rest can all be volunteers,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/walk-in-vax-for-45-all-through-may-state/articleshow/82348125.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

While one person was arrested at Arambol in North Goa, the other was intercepted at Andheri (W), Mumbai. Sameer Wankhede, zonal director, NCB said that NCB Mumbai launched two operations in Goa and Mumbai, and registered two cases within 12 hours on Friday. In the first operation, teams of NCB Mumbai and Goa raided a shack, ‘Negi Cafe’, located opposite Arambol beach, and seized 58g of amphetamine (commercial quantity), 15 blots of LSD (commercial quantity), cocaine, mephedrone and heroin in intermediate quantity, he said. “This drug syndicate was being operated by one suspect, Mustafa alias Tiger, a Nigerian national. Further, the caretaker of Negi Cafe, Ranbir Singh has been placed under arrest. NCB Goa has summoned the shack owner for the further investigation,” Wankhede said. Wankhede said Tiger is a notorious drug trafficker who is active in North Goa and was allegedly running his operations from Negi Cafe. “Efforts are on to intercept him,” Wankhede said. The officer also said on the basis of special inputs, NCB Mumbai intercepted one Indian national Irfan Ansari, 24, at Lokhandwala Circle, Andheri (W), Mumbai and seized 56 tablets of ecstasy/MDMA (commercial quantity) during the midnight raid on Friday. MDMA (methylenedioxy-methamphetamine), commonly known as ecstasy, is a party drug that alters mood and perception. It is chemically similar to both stimulants and hallucinogens, and produces feelings of increased energy and pleasure, Wankhede said.

---||Surat||Gujarat: Search for missing Covid-19 victim ends in morgue||SURAT: That it ended on International Workers’ Day, added irony to the morbid tale. Migrant worker Sanjay Tiwari’s search for his father Maharanidin (65) ended at a morgue on Saturday. Maharanidin (65) had died 18 days ago at the state-run Covid-19 hospital in New Civil Hospital (NCH). But the hospital staff failed to inform the son about his father’s death. Tiwari was inquiring for his father since Tuesday but did not receive any information until TOI took up the issue with the top NCH administration. Later, Tiwari cremated his father at Ramnath Ghela Crematorium in Umra on Saturday. Tiwari, who hails from Prayagraj, lived with his father in Godadara. His other family members live at their native place in Uttar Pradesh. “The hospital administration had lost my father’s case papers due to which they were neither able to confirm his death or locate him. He died on April 12 but I was not informed,” Tiwari told TOI. Maharanidin, a security guard in a high-rise building in Bhatar, was admitted to NCH on April 9 after he tested positive for Covid-19. Until April 12, when Tiwari tested positive, he visited the hospital and inquired about his father at the helpdesk. Tiwari was under home quarantine till Tuesday. “I used to inquire over the phone and those at the help-desk told me that my father’s health is normal,” said Tiwari. Since Tuesday, the helpdesk staff could not give a satisfactory reply about location of Tiwari’s father. They also asked Tiwari to go to the police. Tiwari works at textile unit of the city. Body of Maharanidin was kept in a morgue at NCH and since the case papers were missing the body was considered as that an unidentified person. “On coming to know about the missing patient through the TOI report, I ordered senior officials to track and find him immediately. Unfortunately, the patient had died and due to the poor maintenance of the case record his son had to suffer,” said Dr Ragini Verma, medical superintendent, NCH.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/search-for-missing-covid-19-victim-ends-in-morgue/articleshow/82346832.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: ‘State must prepare for pediatric Covid surge’||Mumbai: The state’s Covid task force member and medical education director T P Lahane on Saturday said the entire healthcare machinery should be prepared for an “unpredicted” pediatric Covid-19 surge, in terms of infrastructure, medicines, equipment specific to the pediatric age-group, standard operating procedure and high-level training to medical staff. “In the first wave, Maharashtra had witnessed one per cent pediatric cases, and in the second wave, it was between 3.5% to 4%. In the third wave, it will not be surprising if it touches 10%. Initially the maximum of Covid patients were above 50 years old, and in the second wave, over 20 years old. Now it appears even younger people may be infected,” Lahane told TOI in an interview on measures to prevent a third wave in Maharashtra. “We have drafted a multipronged strategy to tackle the situation. We will have to strengthen primary healthcare centres on a war footing, and vaccination strategy will have to be based on epidemiological data, integrated district-wise lockdown, international/inter-state district travel norms, involvement of communities and elected representatives and aggressive focus on social media,” Lahane said. Elaborating, Lahane said in the days to come, aggressive public health measures at the primary health centres with the objective of identifying cases and providing treatment at an early stage will have to be drafted. “At primary health centres, we will have to detect the disease at an early stage to reduce severity of the disease and in turn reduce the number of ICU admissions and deaths. Oxygen plants for primary health centres should be made mandatory,” he said. On the vaccination strategy, Lahane said it is a game-changer in the real sense, but if the vaccination drive is not implemented properly, it will not be effective. “The concept of vaccination should change from age-wise to comprehensive. We should not look at age-groups but look at districts/wards as a unit and plan to vaccinate everyone above 18. In view of acute shortage of vaccines, more emphasis should be given to districts with more cases or deaths, and a decision should be taken on the basis of per million statistics rather than total numbers,” he said. To avoid vaccination centres being super-spreaders, an online system with only appointments must be made mandatory. “In my opinion, the decision to give free vaccine should be reviewed, and it should be implemented with minor changes. Business houses should be given responsibility to vaccinate their employees and private vaccination charges can be capped to make it more affordable,” Lahane said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-must-prepare-for-pediatric-covid-surge/articleshow/82348158.cms||---

He said the BJP does not support corrupt politicians but Eatala’s looks like a clear case of chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao targeting the “most hardworking” minister in his cabinet. Asked about rumours that the party’s central leadership is already in touch with Eatala, Arvind said: “All such matters of some leader joining the party are taken care of by the party leadership.” He charged TRS surpemo K Chandrasekhar Rao with not allocating sufficient funds to the medical and health department.

---||Chandigarh||To tackle rising Covid cases, Haryana looks to IAS, IPS officers with MBBS degrees||CHANDIGARH: The Haryana government on Saturday decided to rope in IAS and IPS officers who have studied medicine to manage the sitation arising out of a surge in Covid-19 cases. Three IPS officers with MBBS degrees have been deputed for Covid-related duties. The spokesperson said services of these IAS and IPS officers had been placed at the disposal of the additional chief secretary of Haryana health and family welfare department for creation and operation of 500-bedded hospitals in Panipat and Hisar, operating a 100-bedded facility at Atal Bihari Vajpayee Medical College, Faridabad, and any other duties, as required from time to time. An official said officers who have an MBBS degree and whose services would be used for Covid-related duties include Dr Chander Shekhar Khare, director and special secretary (food, civil supplies and consumer affairs); Dr R S Dhillon, director of Haryana Governance Reforms Authority, and managing director of CONFED; Dr Sangeeta Tetarwal, district municipal commissioner of Sirsa; Dr Manoj Kumar, additional deputy commissioner of Jind; and Dr Vaishali Sharma, sub-divisional officer (civil) of Naraingarh. The state government has also decided to use the services of three IPS officers — South Gurugram DCP Dr Dheeraj Kumar, Faridabad NIT DCP Dr Anshu Singla, and Ballabhgarh DCP Dr Arpit Jain. Relief for vulnerable staffIn view of the surge in Covid-19 cases, Haryana government has decided that its employees with severe disabilities, comorbidities like hypertension, blood pressure, heart or lung disease, cancer and other chronic disease, and who are pregnant — whether regular, contractual, outsourced, daily wager or ad hoc — will not be called for duty, even if they are engaged in essential services.  If required, the staff could work from home, provided they have necessary infrastructure. This exemption will remain in force till further orders. The decision has been taken by the state to break the infection chain and ensure safety of persons who are likely to suffer a serious illness because of coronavirus infection. As part of this, the government has issued detailed preventive measures, titled ‘Coronavirus (Covid-19): Guidelines for Protection and Safety of Persons with Disabilities (Divyangjan), Vulnerable Persons and Pregnant Women’.  On May 8 and July 16 last year, the government had issued similar orders for blind employees in view of their dependence on ‘touch’. According to the guidelines, vulnerable employees will not be exposed to any frontline work requiring direct contact with public. A letter in this regard has been sent to all administrative secretaries, heads of department, commissioners of all divisions in Haryana, deputy commissioners, managing directors/chief administrators of boards/corporations, and registrar of all universities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/to-tackle-rising-covid-cases-haryana-looks-to-ias-ips-officers-with-mbbs-degrees/articleshow/82347701.cms||---

According to the physiotherapists on the front line TOI spoke to, they are seeing a range of people in hospital, from those in their early 30s through to people in their 80s and say that if symptoms of Covid are not managed on time, they can have a prolonged limitation in functional capacity, hamper the quality of life and delay return to work and normal routine. “It is important to note that Covid-19 patients benefit immensely from physiotherapy which can prevent risk of ICU acquired weaknesses and promote rapid functional recovery,” said Dr Thomas Parey, senior physiotherapist, Apollo Health City. Physiotherapists also said that for many patients admitted to the hospital with Covid-19, surviving the virus is only half of the battle. “Once deemed virus-free, it is often a long road to recovery including rebuilding lung capacity and overall respiratory health. To combat such problems and prevent risk of ICU acquired weaknesses, it is important that they consider physiotheraphy which helps promote rapid functional recovery,” said Dr Thomas. As per WHO guidelines, physiotherapy can play an important role in the rehabilitation of patients with Covid to improve lung function and oxygen saturation levels, apart from other symptoms. “Since there is infection in the lung, there will be respiratory distress. So we are training the lung muscles for them to become strong. In Covid-19 patients, the air will not go to the lower end of the lung. Physiotherapy exercises to improve lung function helps air goes deep into the lungs more easily,” said Dr Mahmood Hussain, physiotherapy HOD, Care Hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/doctors-physiotherapy-key-for-rehabilitation-of-covid-patients/articleshow/82348155.cms||Moulika.KV

He was 53.  The former MP had been lodged in high-security jail number 2 at the Tihar Jail Complex in a murder case. The Delhi prison administration said Shahabuddin had been admitted to Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital on April 20 after he showed symptoms of Covid, and was shifted to the ICU three days ago. Director-general (prisons) Sandeep Goel said they received information from the hospital that Shahabuddin had died during treatment. Shahabuddin had been the terror of Siwan for many years. An RJD MP four times and twice an MLA, political patronage was said to have allowed him to cultivate his infamy for illegal profit. The “don” of Siwan had figured in murders that had made national headlines, including those of a JNUSU president and the journalist Rajdeo Ranjan. He had more than 36 cases against him. Politicians from different parties, including Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, condoled his death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/shahabuddin-ex-mp-and-don-of-siwan-dies/articleshow/82349706.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Rates of oxygen concentrators, oximeters shoot up in Haryana||CHANDIGARH: As the surge in Covid cases continue to go unabated, after shortage of beds, Remdesivir injections and oxygen, now oxygen concentrators and oximeters rates too are touching a new high. Oxygen concentrators are used for home care of Covid-19 patients. Usually, it was used by defence personnel deployed on high altitudes. But in the absence of monitoring, rates of even the non branded oximeters have gone up to Rs 1700 to Rs 2,000 per piece and oxygen concentrators are priced between Rs 1 lakh and Rs 1.5 lakh. While weekly and monthly rental for concentrators can be anytrhing between Rs 5,000 and Rs 20,000. Enquiries revealed that high demand of these equipment in NCR has played a role in the hike and its blackmarketing. A Chandigarh-based trader said the increase in rates is due to advance preparation by caretakers of Covid positive patients, who are apprehensive of non availability of beds as well as oxygen. “Till December, we would procure Chinese oximeters for Rs 150 and Rs 250. Thermal scanners would cost us around Rs 500 and we were assembling the machines of concentrators for Rs 35,000 and was sold at Rs 45,000,’’ he said. Now, according to him, one cannot get machines for anything less than Rs 70,000 and rates are shooting up day by day. “In the absence of monitoring, the rates may skyrocket,” he added. “Firstly, it’s very difficult to make the oximeters available for consumers now. Even traders are not giving them for less than Rs 900, hence we sell it after taking the margin. This cannot be helped unless the government takes total control like they have done it with injections,’’ said Amit, a Rohtak-based drug store owner. Nishant Jain of Zirakpur had arranged the oxygen concentrator for Rs 15,000 per month for his relative in New Delhi. “We know this rent is exorbitant, but we have no option now. Everyone is exploiting the situation. After procuring on rental, we had to pay double rent to the cab to ensure that it reaches our relative well in time,” he said. Haryana’s food and drug control department is controlling the supply of oxygen and Remdesivir injections through the district drug control officers and district-level monitoring committees. But there is no such official monitoring of oximeters and concentrators. Meanwhile, Haryana BJP president Om Parkash Dhankar has claimed to have arranged more than 500 oximeters donated by non-resident Indians. The consignments will start arriving by Monday, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/rates-of-o2-concentrators-oximeters-shoot-up-in-hry/articleshow/82347703.cms||Manvir Saini
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Private schools go back to quarterly fee system, levy late fee charges||HYDERABAD: With the academic year 2020-21 coming to an end, many schools which gave monthly fee payment option have now gone back to collecting term fee and are even levying late fee charges on those who failed to pay the first quarter fee on time. Parents said that besides increasing the fee for the academic year 2021-22 by about 10-15%, schools are asking them to pay late fee on the advance fee they are paying. “My daughter’s school has been charging Rs 200 per day as a late fee from April 27 from parents who did not pay the first term fee,” said a parent, whose child is studying in class 8 at an international school in Rangareddy district. The parent said that the school has hiked the fee by 10% and is not providing a monthly fee payment option. Last year, the state issued GO 46 and asked schools to not hike the fee and collect only tuition fees on monthly basis. However, as the GO is not in force anymore, many schools have gone back to collecting fees on a quarterly basis. Parents said that the state should immediately address the issue and issue the order to ensure that fees is not hiked even during this academic year. “The GO 46 should be implemented this year. In fact, instead of just issuing the order, the state should ensure that it is strictly implemented by all schools at least this year,” said VV Sharma of Indian Parents Association adding that with pay cuts and job loss, many parents are not in a position to pay the enhanced fee. A few schools in the city, meanwhile, have voluntarily decided not to hike the fee even for the academic year 2021-22 as the pandemic situation continues in the state and elsewhere and have asked parents to continue paying fees on a monthly basis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pvt-schools-go-back-to-quarterly-fee-system-levy-late-fee-charges/articleshow/82347414.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Bharat Biotech in talks with global MNCs to make Covaxin||HYDERABAD: After sealing a deal with Indian Immunologicals Ltd (IIL) for manufacturing its indigenous Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin, Bharat Biotech is now in parleys with global pharma giants for manufacturing the desi vaccine. While the company has already joined hands with Ocugen for Covaxin in the US market, it has now initiated dialogue with drug majors in Europe that have vaccine manufacturing capabilities. According to sources, Bharat Biotech top brass is already in talks with the likes of a French biopharma biggie that also has vaccine manufacturing capacities in India. Bharat Biotech too had earlier indicated that it is exploring manufacturing partnerships abroad for Covaxin. “Manufacturing partnerships are being explored with our partners in other countries, who have prior expertise with commercial scale manufacture of inactivated viral vaccines under biosafety containment,” it had said while announcing commencement of capacity ramp-up to 700 million doses per annum. Sources pointed out that while Bharat Biotech has ample fill-finish capacities, it is struggling with capacity constraints as far as bio-reactor facilities are concerned. Bio-reactors are required to make the drug substance, a critical component of a vaccine. In fact, Bharat Biotech’s tie-up with IIL too is aimed at utilising the latter’s bio-reactor facilities for producing the drug substance. IIL, which is currently in the midst of a technology transfer for Covaxin, is expected to start with about a couple of million doses from July and ramp this up to nearly 10 million doses from November this year. Apart from IIL, the Centre has roped in Maharashtra government-run Haffkine Biopharmaceutical Corporation Ltd for churning out 20 million doses of Covaxin per month and Bharat Immunologicals & Biologicals Ltd, a central public sector enterprise, for 10-15 million doses per month, the Union ministry of science and technology had said on April 16. Covaxin, which has been priced at around $15-20 per dose for the export market, has already received emergency use authorisation (EUA) in several countries like Mexico, Philippines, Iran, Paraguay, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Guyana, Venezuela, Botswana and Zimbabwe, even as EUAs in around 60 countries are under process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bharat-biotech-in-talks-with-global-mncs-to-make-covaxin/articleshow/82347412.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy was hearing a PIL filed by M Bhuvana, a law student from Hyderabad, questioning the lack of Covid-19 protocols at the weekly shandies that are held every week on city streets and residential colonies. B Mayur Reddy, counsel for the petitioner, said that though there are guidelines meant for street vendors, they were neither followed nor enforced. Since most of the vegetable shops in these shandies are run by the poor, some of them are even employing children at such shops. There were no arrangements to follow norms like social distancing, masks, and sanitisers at these shandies. “The two GOs issued by the state government in respect of following norms in such areas were totally ignored,” Mayur said. GHMC counsel P Krishna Reddy said all markets come under agriculture market committees, which are governed by agriculture department. The GHMC has nothing to do with them, he said.The bench did not agree with this line of thinking and told him that they are dealing with the weekly shandies. “The GHMC is according permission to hold these shandies and sanitary inspectors will have to monitor them,” it said and directed GHMC to file an affidavit explaining the number of street markets permitted and steps taken to prevent spread of the virus. The bench, while refusing to issue a notice to the Union health secretary though he was made a respondent, slapped a notice on the state health secretary asking him to explain Covid-19 containment measures. The case will come up for hearing on June 3.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/outline-steps-to-check-spread-of-covid-at-shandies-hc-to-ghmc/articleshow/82347423.cms||---

Bishop Anthony, in a circular issued to all parish priests, said: “Taking into account safety of priests, people and grave-diggers employed by the church, guidelines have been issued. As Covid-19 deaths are rising with each passing day, people are facing problems to bury their kin in cemeteries.” He asked the priests to insist on death certificate and if the certificate says death was due to Covid-19, the guidelines must be followed. He said those who do not have graves in the cemeteries, can contact the Telangana State Christian Minority Finance Corporation for help. “For Covid-19 deaths, there is no public requiem mass. The body has to be taken directly to the burial ground where the funeral rites will be administered at the grave before the burial. The family has to take responsibility for arranging the last rites of persons who die of Covid-19 with the help of GHMC,” the archbishop said. The body will have to be sealed in a leak-proof zip bag tightly packed in the coffin before getting it into the cemetery. Body handlers will have to wear PPE kits. Sanitiser has to be sprayed in the grave after dropping the coffin. Only five relatives of the dead person will be allowed to attend the funeral. Priests will administer the last rites by wearing PPE kits and maintaining a physical distancing of eight feet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/archbishop-issues-directions-for-burial-of-covid-victims-bodies/articleshow/82348160.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

The military railway siding in Secunderabad and the Air Force station at Begumpet, which played a key role in World War II, are once again on a war-footing mode to save the lives of Covid-19 patients in Hyderabad. While the military railway siding built in 1878 is facilitating roll-on and roll-off of oxygen tankers between Hyderabad and Angul in Odisha, the Air Force station, set up in 1934, is helping in the airlift of oxygen tankers from Hyderabad to Rourkela. The old railway infrastructure created by the Nizam’s Guaranteed State Railways (NGSR) for British troops in Secunderabad Cantonment had helped in saving the lives of innumerable people during the influenza pandemics in 1918 and 1957 and several epidemics in between through movement of healthcare equipment, medicines and medical staff. It also served during World War I and II. The Air Force station at Begumpet, though a late entrant when compared with the military railway siding in Secunderabad, nevertheless played a crucial role in the movement of men and medicines during World War II and during medical emergencies in the later years. Now in its 87th year, the Air Force station including Begumpet airport has always risen to the emergent situations, be it medical or military. Earlier this week, the Oxygen Express loaded with five empty oxygen tankers left the military siding and after refill of oxygen at Angul, the train is returning to Secunderabad and will reach on Sunday or Monday. The five tankers have a total liquid oxygen capacity of 63.6 tonnes. According to heritage expert P Anuradha Reddy, the rulers in the erstwhile princely Hyderabad state had created infrastructure with foresight that could help people even centuries later. “The military siding was set up in 1878 by extending the Wadi-Secunderabad railway line built during 1874. This gave a seamless connectivity between Secunderabad Cantonment (SC) and Bombay (Mumbai) on one hand and SC and Madras (Chennai) on the other. The British brought horses for the cavalry and a cavalry barracks station was set up. The infrastructure is so robust that even today it is helping in the fight against Covid-19 pandemic,” Anuradha, who is also the convener of INTACH Hyderabad, told TOI. Established in 1934 as a grassfield runway, the Begumpet airport was taken over by the British during WW-II as an elementary training flying school in 1941. Initially commercial operations were from Hakimpet and passengers were carried in buses from Secunderabad to Hakimpet for boarding.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/143-yr-old-infra-gives-o2-boost-to-covid-fight/articleshow/82347428.cms||Syed Akbar

While the complaint against the senior citizen is for escaping quarantine despite testing positive his daughter is alleged to have abused a civic staff. BMC's quarantine guidelines for international passengers travelling from Europe, the Middle East, South Africa and Brazil, makes it mandatory for incoming passengers to be sent to institutional quarantine for seven days. According to BMC’s K east ward medical officer Dr NR Tiwari, who lodged the complaint at Powai police station on April 29, the passenger who had returned from Dubai was initially sent into quarantine at a hotel at Andheri east. “We conducted the Covid test on the seventh day of his quarantine and he was found positive. Accordingly, following the protocol, we arranged for an ambulance to send the patient to GT hospital in South Mumbai,” said Dr Tiwari. He further added that but his daughter kept insisting that they would get him home quarantined as he had no symptoms. The patient had given the daughters contact and therefore all communication was being directed towards her, said officials. Civic staff said that they informed her to speak to the hospital authorities for further process. “She came to the hotel and instead of allowing her father to get admitted took him away. On telling her that taking a Covid positive patient was not allowed and would need a legal action, still did not budge. She later sent abusive messages and called the entire process a scam,” Tiwari said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-fir-filed-against-dubai-returnees-for-escaping-quarantine/articleshow/82348167.cms||Richa Pinto

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Accept govt rate or face action: CM||Thiruvananthapuram: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has warned the medical laboratories for staying away from conducting the RT-PCR tests. He has warned of severe consequences, including cancellation of their licences, if they are not ready to accept the government rates. On Saturday, in several parts of the state the labs had stopped the testing since they were not ready to accept the revised rate of Rs 500 per test, fixed by the government. The labs have been demanding that the rates should be made a minimum of Rs 1,500 or else they will not be ready to conduct the tests. The chief minister said the labs cannot stay away from the testing and if they continue to do so, then the government would be forced to act against them legally. “This is not the time to make profit through business. It is the time of the pandemic and the labs should take note of it. The government has fixed the new rate after conducting a detailed study,” the CM said. He said it is estimated that per test the maximum expense incurred is Rs 240 and yet the government has fixed Rs 500 per test. Only a few labs have stayed away from the new rates and the remaining ones are conducting the tests. But the government is making it clear that no one can refuse to go by the government rates and charge above it. “The government requests everyone to cooperate and conduct the tests. This is the time of a pandemic and it is the time we have to come together to support the people. Hence the government hopes that all the labs will follow the government rate. No labs can take individual decisions at this time and if they are going against the government rate, they will have to face the consequences,” the CM said. However, the consortium of the labs associations have approached the state government and urged to revise the rate to at least Rs 1,500 since the present rate was not affordable for them. Earlier, the government had fixed the rate at Rs 1,500 and the labs had approached the high court. Following the court verdict, the rate was revised to Rs 1,700. Any private laboratory that denies RT PCR testing/any of the other tests for Covid-19 at the rates fixed by the government of Kerala or that charges in excess of the rates fixed by the state government shall be deemed to have committed offences under the provisions of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, the Kerala Epidemic Diseases Ordinance, 2020 and other relevant provisions in law and action shall be initiated against such laboratory accordingly. The District Disaster Management Authority, police and other agencies, including health department, involved in regulating the affairs of such private laboratories shall initiate stringent, lawful steps for the same, according to an order issued by the chief secretary. Act against labs that fleece patients: BJP Meanwhile, BJP has criticized the state government for the refusal of private labs to slash the charges for RT-PCR testing. BJP state president K Surendran said that the government was responsible for private labs charging Rs 1,700 for the test. “It was the state government that helped the labs to charge Rs 1,700 for the test that costs only Rs 500 in other states. But even after the state government fixed the rate at Rs 500, labs are not willing to obey the same. The government should take stern action against labs that refuse to cutdown the RTPCR testing rate,” he said. If the rates are not brought down immediately, BJP would launch protest, he warned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/accept-govt-rate-or-face-action-cm/articleshow/82347449.cms||---

EPFO members no longer need to submit physical forms to file their nominations and can do so online using the e-nomination facility available at https://unifiedportal-mem.epfindia.gov.in/memberinterface. In light of the ongoing surge in Covid-19 cases, the EPFO office has also urged employees and employers to avoid coming to the EPFO office to submit physical claims. “The online e-nomination facility is open for all EPF members whose mobile numbers are linked with their universal account number (UAN) and whose Aadhaar verification is also complete,” said regional provident fund commissioner Ashwini Kumar Gupta. He also said that the registration process is user friendly and users are advised to file their e-nomination at the earliest. The e-nomination in the system enables members and beneficiaries to file their online pension claims too and in the event of the demise of an employee, their nominee will be able to file the online claim based on the one-time password (OTP) they receive on their Aadhaar-linked mobile. “One doesn’t need to apply with any physical document to the employer or ex-employer after the online nomination is done.

The trough which had formed about a week ago had triggered moderate rainfall in most parts of Goa on Tuesday night. Mapusa had recorded the highest rainfall at 53mm and Dabolim at 36.8mm. During the last two days the activity has reduced and no rain was recorded by most centres in the last 24 hours till Saturday morning. A couple of centres had recorded light rain during the previous 24 hours till Friday morning. “After 48 hours there may be light rain for two more days (on May 3 and 4),” the scientist said. The weather is likely to be dry for about four days from May 5 onwards. Indian national centre for ocean information services (INCOIS) has forecast that the sea along Karnataka coast will be rough from 5.30pm on May 1 to 11.30pm of May 2. “This is due to the effect of high period (15-18 seconds) swell waves, having heights of 1.0 to 1.8 m. ” the bulletin states. No damage has been reported so far and the warning for fishermen is of precautionary nature, IMD source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rain-activity-may-continue-for-next-2-weeks-met-dept/articleshow/82347825.cms||---

At the end of the day, hospitals in the state were using nearly 400 metric tonnes of oxygen. At 9.30pm, the data on https://tncovidbeds.tnega.org/, a webpage set up by the state health department for information on beds in private and government hospitals, showed just six out of 1,683 beds and one out of 919 ventilators in government hospitals were vacant. While normal beds in most of the city private hospitals were occupied, 150 oxygen beds and 23 ICU beds were vacant. Overall, 10% of beds in private and 12% of beds (mostly normal beds) in government facilities were vacant. Officials manning 104 said the bed position was dynamic and most people who called them for beds were still being accommodated. State health secretary J Radhakrishnan said efforts were being made by the government to ramp up beds. While nearly 7,000 more beds will be added to government hospitals by May 7, private hospitals have been asked to allot 50% of their beds for Covid patients after postponing elective surgeries. Several private hospitals – Apollo Hospitals, MGM Healthcare and Kavery Hospitals – said they had no ICU or oxygen beds vacant. Hospitals increase no. of beds Many hospitals also said they have increased the number of beds and are recruiting more nurses and doctors for isolation wards. The Director of Medical Education, Dr R Narayanababu, said the state was working to expand isolation beds in self-financing colleges and deemed universities. While many of these hospitals have allotted too few beds, the occupancy was less than 10% in some of them. While epidemiologists from the National Institute of Medical Sciences and experts in the state medical panel have been pushing the state to create additional beds in trade centres and stadiums, they say that beds in private medical college hospitals must be used. Former director of public health Dr K Kolandaisamy said many of these hospitals have state of the art infrastructure and team to function as tertiary care centres, some others should be used for secondary level care. “Most of these colleges don’t have patients in non-covid wards. When the government has closed outpatient services and nonemergency surgeries, these college should also do so. In 2020, Orissa government paid private institutions about ₹3,000 per bed and the model was successful,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/most-icu-o2-beds-in-five-city-ghs-full-only-10-pvt-hosp-beds-free/articleshow/82349741.cms||Pushpa Narayan

Velingkar had held a protest recently in Bicholim demanding withdrawal of grants to English medium primary schools. BJP Sakhali unit member Deepraj Prabhu accused Velingkar of using derogatory language during the protest. “Velingkar used very lowly and unacceptable language. It does not suit a person of his stature to use such language. He should either improve, or control his language. He should stop misleading people,” he said. Velingkar had said the state BJP government was one of U-turns and that it flouted assurances given on boosting the mother tongue. “Velingkar is currently running a defamatory campaign to mislead people. The state government is helping Konkani and Marathi medium schools, along with English medium schools,” Prabhu said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/velingkars-language-unacceptable/articleshow/82347866.cms||---

One Saturday in 2005, when Roth was 4 years old, her family went to look at a house on fire in their neighbourhood in North Carolina. Firefighters had intentionally set the blaze as a controlled fire, so it was a relaxed affair. Roth remembers watching the flames when her father, an amateur photographer, asked her to smile. With her hair askew and a knowing look in her eyes, Roth flashed a devilish smirk as the fire roared behind her. “Disaster Girl” was born. In the years since Dave, Zoe’s father, entered it in a photo contest in 2007 and won, the image has been edited into various disasters from history, with Roth grinning as a meteor wipes out the dinosaurs or the Titanic sinks Now, after more than a decade of having her image endlessly repurposed as a vital part of meme canon, Roth has sold the original copy of her meme as a nonfungible token, or NFT, for nearly $500,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/mad-mad-world/disaster-girl-sells-meme-for-500k/articleshow/82349748.cms||---
---||Goa||Scientists call for bio control of sucker fish in Cansaulim||Panaji: The deadly threat to native fish species of a third invasive variety, Janitor fish - found in worrisome numbers in Cansaulim ponds - has triggered calls for biological management of the hardy aquarium fish. Invasive species of fish and plants severely impacting the local ecology is a worldwide problem. In Goa, two exotic species, Mozambique Tilapia and African catfish have established their habitats, destructively squeezing the local ecosystem. “The catch from fresh water systems yields over 50% exotic species. There is a significant reduction in populations of small native types, such as Rasbora, barbs, pearl spot, and even the predatory murrel species,” G B Sreekanth, fisheries scientist, Indian council of agricultural research, Old Goa said. TOI reported on March 9 and April 12 about a large haul of Janitor fish - an ornamental variety kept in home aquariums - in two large Cansaulim ponds. “The dynamics of flooding, whether these ponds are connected to other water bodies need to be studied,” Baban Ingole, retired chief scientist, biological oceanography, National Institute of Oceanography, said. Fishing activity starts after ponds start drying up in summer. “Pumping out the water from ponds is the best way to weed out the invasive species. The fishermen may lose the catch for a year and even some brood stock may remain,” Ingole said. In Kerala, sucker fish has severely affected the fresh water ecosystem. “The management (of this invasive species), including weeding is difficult, as there are large populations of other species,” Rajeev Raghavan, assistant professor, Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean Studies, Kochi. While suggesting awareness campaigns to educate aquarium owners about disposing off the fish, he said management at initial stages is effective. Director of fisheries, Shamila Monteiro stated the problem appears to be localised. “We appeal to aquarium owners not to release the fish in ponds,” Monteiro said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/scientists-call-for-bio-control-of-sucker-fish-in-cansaulim/articleshow/82347879.cms||Paul Fernandes
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Goods trains moved 26.8m tonnes during the pandemic||CHENNAI: Trains moved more freight and parcels in the past year as the pandemic conditions forced Southern Railway to make a switch from a passenger-oriented railway to almost a freight service operator. When mail/express and passenger trains were suspended and road transport had become unreliable, railways stepped in to transport goods including items that were needed for Covid-19 care and precautions to different parts of the country. New commodities too were drawn from roads to tracks. The goods trains carried 26.84 million tonnes, of which the load of food grains, fertilizers, iron ore, cement and raw material for steel plants and automobiles increased substantially when compared to the previous year, as per the report submitted for the last financial year. Material which would not be carried on trains earlier, such as automobiles, gypsum, super phosphate, boilers, tractors, clinker, limestone and cement, harvesters, power tillers and mosquito nets were transported by trains to the tune of 4.42 million tonnes which raked in ₹54 crore. As parcel bookings were made easy, 37 parcel trains were operated to Patel Nagar, Rajkot and Guwahati, often moving items needed for Covid-19 precautions and control earning ₹70.8 crore, an 8% increase. Food grains, fertilizers and raw materials for steel plants recorded loading in excess of target. While the load of raw material for steel increased by 200% at1.87 million tonnes, food grains registered an increase of 70% with 1.76 million tonnes. Further, at least 4.43 million tonnes of fertilizers were loaded, notching up its increase by 23.6% compared to the same period in the previous year. “These goods were carried by trains after officials carried out a marketing drive after forming business development units at the zonal level and at the divisions,” said a senior official. As the lines were not congested, goods trains could be operated at a double the speed from 28.22kmph to 45.54kmph making movement of goods more viable by trains than roads. “There was a substantial increase in movement of goods during the pandemic time. The number of passengers were low because the trains were suspended and the services resumed much later. The number of passenger carrying trains increased when services resumed,” he said. Southern Railway has now resumed 75% of mail and express trains and also all suburban trains.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-goods-trains-moved-26-8m-tonnes-during-the-pandemic/articleshow/82349755.cms||---

Mayank Pratap Singh is now in home isolation. Mayank was ill since April 9. He was admitted to Noida Covid Hospital on April 17 after his condition deteriorated and oxygen levels began dipping. In the meantime, his father Uday Pratap contracted Covid and his oxygen levels dropped too. When attempts to find a bed for his father failed, Mayank decided to vacate his one and requested the hospital administration to admit his father. Mayank told TOI, "I got my positive RT-PCR report on April 12. And several attempts, I got a bed at Noida Covid Hospital on April 17, but I was kept in the general ward there". ‘We didn’t get a bed anywhere’"However, as my condition deteriorated, the hospital shifted me to the intensive care unit the very next day. My treatment was started, and I stayed at the hospital for 10 days. "Once my oxygen level stabilised, I was informed about the condition of my father (a retired registrar of Allahabad high court). My father's condition was deteriorating by the day and his oxygen levels had been dropping. We started looking for a hospital but to no avail. I thought that he would get a bed in the Covid hospital itself, but they refused citing shortage of beds," he added. Mayank then approached a senior doctor. "Although I was very weak, my condition was relatively better. I was confident I would pull through and my condition would stabilise. Fortunately, a senior doctor came on a visit and I requested that I wanted to vacate my bed for my father. They agreed. My father was admitted to the hospital in my place on April 27," said Mayank, who works with a private company. His father continues to be in the intensive care unit (ICu). Mayank said he was aware of the hospital admission problems people were facing. “I was on the fifth floor. I saw many people being denied hospital beds while many could not get proper treatment because they failed to get oxygen on time. Even I was told to get my own cylinder once when I insisted that I be put on oxygen support,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/son-gives-up-hospital-bed-for-fathers-treatment-in-noida/articleshow/82349777.cms||Shikha Salaria
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Pet boarding comes to the rescue of Covid affected||CHENNAI: When Meera Krishnan tested positive for Covid-19 two weeks ago, she was worried about her pet, Coco. “I was tired and didn’t know how I would take care of him. Though I have someone who walks him every day, it wasn’t possible once I began quarantining at home.” And that’s when she decided to send him to a pet boarding facility. “He is a rescue dog and has separation and anxiety issues so I was apprehensive. But he has settled in well and taken to the people there. They send me videos regularly and now that I see he is happy, it’s a huge pressure off me,” says Meera, a resident of Anna Nagar. While some pet boardings did close during the pandemic, several others have come forward to help pet parents who contract Covid-19. They have staff who come donned in PPE kits to pick up the pet, ensure that the animals stick to their daily routines and keep the owners regularly updated. Linda Alexander, who runs Pet Paws in Nungambakkam along with her husband Ram Prakash, took care of Coco like her own. “We realised we have to help and began taking in animals last year. The second wave has been bad, in the past one week, we have been getting three to four calls a day,” says Linda, adding that most pet owners call for help as they are unable to cook for the animals or take them on walks. “If they are hospitalised it’s worse, and sometimes relatives are hesitant to take the animals in.” The staff members follow all safety protocols — they wear PPE kits when they go to pick up the animal, use their own leash, the dog is given a bath as soon as it reaches the facility, the collar is sanitised. “Our driver, Martin, has been really a hero,” she says. The facility has sand pits, toys and lots of space for the animals to wander around. “We also take them for walks and send videos and photos to the owners. We have about 20 dogs now.” Ginger’s Pet Stay in Panaiyur has also been taking in pets. “Many people who are home quarantined are worried how they will manage. Also, even if they decide to keep the pet with them, the animals will keep pawing at the door, and want to be with them,” says Jennifer Jacob-Murali Anand, who runs the facility. “Though we usually don’t do pick-ups and drops, we have begun doing it for pets of Covid-19 patients. We pick up the animal from a non-positive person and follow all safety protocols.” Hotel For Dogs in Akkarai says it has also been getting a lot of requests. “If no one can drop the dog off, we pick it up. We bathe and disinfect the animal and also keepit apart from other dogs for a day. During the second wave we have hosted five dogs,” says Anuj Madathil, in-charge of the facility||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-pet-boarding-comes-to-the-rescue-of-covid-affected/articleshow/82349775.cms||Priya Menon

The state government has identified about 1.33 crore population as eligible for vaccine before the rules were relaxed to give vaccine for people above 18 years age. With sufficient stocks not coming from manufacturing firms and the Centre, the state government decided to continue vaccination only for above 45 years age group. However, only around 29 per cent of the targeted group got vaccinated till Saturday due to vaccine shortage. Nearly 38 lakh people have got their first dose and another 7 lakh people received the second dose. While people who got their first dose have been anxiously waiting to get the second dose, others too are lining up to get the first dose. The state government has taken up the special drive to cover the people who got their first dose by keeping others wait. Huge rush is being seen at urban health centres (UHC) where vaccination is administrated every day. “The registration is taking a lot of time as there is huge rush. We were made to wait for nearly six hours” said K Sivaprasad, a 60-year old resident of SVN Colony at Mallikharjunapet UHC in Guntur city. Although it is a good trend to see awareness among the public to get vaccinated, they should follow social distance and wear masks as it was not possible for the government to discipline them, said a medical officer at UHC. He said that nurses and other staff have been warning them to follow queue but no one is taking the instructions seriously. He feared that such gathering at vaccine administration centres might pose new troubles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/social-distancing-norms-go-for-a-toss-at-vaccine-centres/articleshow/82347236.cms||Samdani MN

With this, there is no firm word yet on restarting the drive for the 45-and-above age-group. “We would like to start on Monday as we had said earlier, but we haven’t got fresh stock from the Centre yet,” a senior state official said. Public health minister Rajesh Tope said that while the state hasn’t received any intimation, vaccination centres can resume inoculaton even at short notice. “We have been demanding adequate doses from the Centre for the 45-plus category. Vaccination for seniors has come to a halt in most of the state due to shortage of vaccines,” Tope said. He said that Maharashtra requires at least 40 lakh doses a week to keep its vaccination drive consistent. Maharashtra’s National Health Mission director N Ramaswami said, “We have exhausted almost all our vaccine stock.” The main stock with the state is the three lakh doses procured for the 18-44 age- group, he added. BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare said there are no vaccine stocks in Mumbai. State govt is also in talks with makers of Sputnik V, says TopeBMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare said, “A private hospital on Saturday procured vaccines and gave the shots to 400 people. Private hospitals registered with us can start their drives using stocks they have procured.” Tope said that the new phase of vaccination for the 18-44 age-group was flagged off on a small scale in the state on Saturday, with just three lakh vaccines procured by the state from the Serum Institute of India. “Only three states could start vaccination for 18-plus on May 1, which includes Maharashtra. The stocks have been distributed in such a way that the drive can continue for one week with the three lakh doses, and in the meanwhile, the state will look for more opportunities to get more stocks,” Tope added. “We have been promised a total of 17-18 lakh vaccines by SII and Bharat Biotech. A schedule with the delivery dates will be made available to us in the next week. Meanwhile, we are also in talks with the manufacturers of Sputnik V vaccine,” Tope said. Officials said that the additional 17 lakh stock will not be arriving in the state before the third week of May, but if the manufacturers can supply to the state even in small batches, it will help in continuing the vaccination drive for the 18-plus group. The state government had on Friday distributed three lakh Covishield doses to districts for starting vaccination of the 18-44 age-group from Saturday. Mumbai, Thane and Pune had each got the largest share of 20,000 doses. Other districts in Maharashtra were given anywhere between 3,000 and 10,000 doses each. Districts like Hingoli, Wardha, Bhandara, Washim and Sindhudurg received 5,000 doses each on Friday for this group of beneficiaries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/centre-gives-maharashtra-23l-doses-of-vaccines-for-next-15-days-but-no-details/articleshow/82349817.cms||---
---||Chennai||Chennai: ‘Sad that corrupt and suspended officers are paid’||CHENNAI: The Madras high court has observed that while suspended, corrupt government officials get all monetary benefits, several deserving candidates are engaged as contract workers and paid meagre salaries. Justice S Vaidyanathan made the observation while dismissing a plea moved by a sanitary inspector seeking to quash departmental proceedings against him in connection with a corruption case. As per rules, employees under suspension are eligible for subsistence allowance ranging from 50% to 75% of their last drawn basic salary. According to the petitioner, he was working as a sanitary inspector and was caught taking a bribe of ₹2,000 in 2009. Subsequently, he was convicted by a special court in 2020 and sentenced to four years of rigorous imprisonment. Since a parallel proceeding was initiated by the department for the same charges, the petitioner moved the court to quash the same. “It is painful to note that several talented persons have been working temporarily in government departments under contractors, especially in PWD, under non-muster roll for years together without regularisation. Whereas, corrupt officials, who were under suspension, are paid all the monetary benefits,” the court said.

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Calls grow to convert public spaces to hospitals||HYDERABAD: An acute shortage of Covid-19 beds across city hospitals, including government run tertiary centres like Gandhi Hospital, Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences (TIMS) and King Koti Hospital has left patients in utter despair, with many succumbing while looking for a bed. Given the magnitude of the crisis, doctors and common residents are now urging the authorities to convert other public spaces into makeshift medical facilities for the ill. On an average, private hospitals say they have been turning away at least 30 to 40 patients every day from their emergency department, unable to get them a bed. The situation across the three government hospitals is much the same. About 30 to 60 patients are regularly sent away from there too. TIMS, for instance, was nearly full on Saturday and struggling to accommodate new patients. “We have just about one or two oxygen beds available as there will be some discharges. But it’s a dynamic situation. We are almost full,” said the hospital superintendent, Dr Ehsan Ahmed Khan. At Gandhi Hospital too officials were fighting the same battle. “We do not have a single vacant ICU or ventilator bed out of the 600 beds. Even the oxygen beds are running at full capacity. We are somehow managing as there are 50 to 60 discharges every day and around 20 deaths too,” said the hospital superintendent Dr M Raja Rao. With the wards chock-oblock and ambulances carrying critical patients lined up outside this nodal Covid hospital on many days, experts feel that this is the right time for the government to take over certain public sector facilities and turn them them into temporary Covid care centres and hospitals. “As a future step, to mitigate the crisis of shortage of beds, we can even think of setting up beds in stadiums, hotels, resorts, hostels and educational institutes,” said professor Subodh Kandamuthan, director, Centre for Healthcare Management, ASCI. He added: “Not just Hyderabad, it is also important to add beds in districts too. Government should think of collaborating with DRDO, HAL and army facilities where they can set up beds.” At present, the shortage of beds is leading to patients succumbing to the virus, while looking for a bed, say doctors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyderabad-calls-grow-to-convert-public-spaces-to-hospitals/articleshow/82349827.cms||Amrita Didyala

Police suspect that he was murdered by his wife and brother-in-law over property. The deceased was identified as Baskar, 37, the owner of a travels agency and a former ward councillor in Mangadu. He stayed with his wife Usha, 33, and children on West Mada Street, Kovur. Baskar’s mother Mohanambal approached police saying she had been trying to contact her son to no response and filed a missing person complaint. A team went to Baskar’s house only to find it locked from the inside. Upon entry, they found bloodstains on the floors and walls of the house. Police combed through CCTV camera footage from near Baskar’s residence and found Usha and her brother Bhagyaraj dragging a sack out of the house. A search has been launched for Usha and Bhagyaraj. Meanwhile, on Saturday morning, residents of the area informed police about a body floating in the lake near a quarry at Sikkarayapuram close to Mangadu. Upon recovery, police identified it as that of Baskar, with the hands and legs tied. The team also found a bundle of bedsheet and some pillows. Police collected CCTV camera footage from the neighbourhood and found Usha carrying a huge gunny bag on Thursday night. She was then seen dumping the bundle of bedsheet and pillows in the lake. Officers concluded that Usha and Bhagyaraj had conspired together to kill Baskar. They suspect that Baskar was killed at home and his body was driven out to the lake in a car and then dumped. Police sent the body to the Government Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital for postmortem. Police suspect that Baskar may have been murdered for the property and are searching for the suspects. The Mangadu police registered a case and further investigations are on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/ex-councillor-found-dead-in-tamil-nadu-wife-her-brother-suspects/articleshow/82349836.cms||---

The hospital needed an urgent supply of oxygen to support six newborns. In the letter, Care Newborn and Childcare Hospital urged authorities to help them arrange at least six cylinders of oxygen, fearing severe complications in the babies who were in its newborn intensive care unit (NICU) if there was no medical oxygen. “This is to inform you that we have six babies in NICU (two on ventilators and four CPAP with oxygen support) and we are running out of oxygen, which will result in serious consequences for the babies. Our vendor has refused further support of oxygen. We require at least six cylinders of oxygen per day. Kindly help us in procuring them for the sake of babies and mankind,” read the letter. According to the hospital, they raised the alarm 10 hours in advance, aware that oxygen shortage was affecting hospitals across NCR and any help from the administration and people on social media may take several hours. “I couldn’t risk it. I had to take pre-emptive measures to save these newborn babies. Had I waited till the last one or two hours of supply, things would have turned disastrous. I know that many hospitals and people are struggling to arrange even one oxygen cylinder. Hence, I raised an alarm 10 hours before, that too after all our vendors refused to help us,” Dr Sourojit Gupta, head of neonatology at Care Newborn and Childcare Hospital, told TOI. It was only after the hospital took to social media to amplify their request that support started to pour in from all corners. By late evening, their oxygen requirement was met. The hospital said the district administration and police not only helped them with Saturday’s requirements but also assured them of continued support. While the deputy commissioner helped the hospital get three of its cylinders refilled, police helped them with five cylinders. The hospital, however, returned three cylinders stating that they didn’t want to stock them at a time when “everyone is facing a crisis”. “I got a call from a senior IPS officer and they offered five cylinders. We took two and returned three. We needed only five cylinders at that time and three were already getting refilled with the help of the deputy commissioner. So, we humbly asked the cops to give the additional three cylinders to someone who is in dire need. Both the police and the administration have assured that they will ensure that our daily requirement of oxygen is duly met,” added Gupta. He added that the hospital will now be releasing a consent form where it would mention that in case of shortage of oxygen supply, parents should be prepared to take their babies to another hospital. SOSs for oxygen from hospitals have been going out every day to the administration. Besides dedicated Covid hospitals, several other nursing homes are also facing problems in operations because of the uncertainty in oxygen supply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/hospital-pleads-for-oxygen-with-folded-hands-to-support-six-newborns-in-icu/articleshow/82348152.cms||Siddharth Tiwari
---||Gurgaon||Six die in Gurugram hospital, kin say it ran out of oxygen||GURUGRAM: Tragedy struck a city hospital for the second time in less than a week as six Covid-19 patients who were on oxygen support died on Friday night.  The patients’ families alleged the hospital had run out of oxygen and the patients had simply been “abandoned”. There is no official report yet into the cause of the deaths. Deputy commissioner Yash Garg has ordered a probe, which is under way. Kriti Hospital in Sector 56, where the six patients were admitted, is a 40-bed facility but not among the 43 hospitals designated for treatment of Covid-19 patients by the state government. Family members of the patients alleged doctors left the hospitals as soon as they came to know the situation “was out of their hands”. Kaustav Ritwik tweeted, “I lost my grandmother in this incident. And the worst part, dr left the building when they came to kn-ow that nothing can be done. They should have inform-ed us in priority. We could have arranged for O2 on our own (sic).” Around 9pm on Friday, a doctor informed the patients’ families that they had been trying their best to save lives. “The hospital was charging Rs 1.05 lakh per day for a ventilator and Rs 80,000 for an oxygen bed,” said a patient’s family member. After the families came to know about the shortage of oxygen, they protested against the hospital management and police had to be called to prevent an escalation. Talking to TOI later, Kaustav said he had admitted his 76-year-old grandmother on April 29 as they were not able to get an oxygen bed at any other hospital and her SpO2 was hovering around 80-85. “We were told by the hospital staff that they have shifted her to a ventilator as her oxygen levels dipped to 40, despite the fact that her SpO2 had improved to 93 just a few hours back. There was no one at the reception, and no doctor to update us about her condition,” he said, adding the hospital staff asked him to discharge the patient when he confronted them. Sub Inspector Dalip Singh, additional SHO of sector 56 police station, said, “On getting the information, we reached the spot and controlled the crowd and aggrieved family members. No complaint has been filed so far and the cause of death is yet to be ascertained. The investigation is under way.” The hospital administration could not be reached for comment despite repeated attempts. Another patient’s son said, “It was a horrifying scene that unfolded in front of me. Around 10pm on Friday night, every staff member, including doctors and those who run the pharmacy, had left the hospital. Even inside the ICU ward, there was no doctor and no oxygen. My father was there. I tried to give him CPR, but it was too late.” Late in the night, police rushed some oxygen cylinders to the hospital. Deputy commissioner Garg told TOI, “I have ordered a magisterial inquiry. Based on the outcome of the inquiry, we will take action.” On April 25, four patients had died at Kathuria Hospital, allegedly after the hospital ran out of oxygen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/6-patients-die-families-say-hospital-ran-out-of-oxygen/articleshow/82348147.cms||Akanksha Gupta

This is the highest number of deaths recorded in the city till date. Earlier, on April 29, Delhi had recorded 395 deaths due to the viral illness. The total number of deaths due to Covid-19 in the national capital has reached 16,559, which is the second-highest in the country after Maharashtra, where 69,615 people have succumbed to the disease since the beginning of the pandemic.  From April 1 to May 1, Delhi has recorded 6,262 deaths, averaging 202 fatalities daily. In March, the average death reported daily was around four. The number of new cases reported on Saturday was 25,219, which is lower than Friday’s 27,047 cases. This could be due to decrease in testing. In the last 24 hours, data shared by the state health department shows, 79,780 tests were conducted compared to 82,745 tests recorded on Friday. Active cases near a lakh, over half in home isolationIn April second week, the city conducted over one lakh tests, of which nearly 70,000 tests were done using RT-PCR, which is considered the gold standard for testing. The positivity rate of Covid-19 is around 32% meaning one in every three people getting it are positive for the disease. The total number of active cases stands at 96,747. The availability of oxygen and ICU beds remains scarce. Data shared by the state health department shows 52% of the active cases are recuperating under home isolation. The number of patients admitted in various hospitals is 25,146, which is 26% of the total active cases. Despite that, there are very few vacant beds. "ICU beds are difficult to get not just in Delhi but even the neighbouring states. We have expanded our capacity and are working extra hours to save as many lives as possible," Dr Sandip Bhattacharya, director, critical care, at Asian Institute of Medical Sciences Faridabad, said. He added that many young people are also developing serious complications due to the disease. Public health specialists say a strict lockdown is needed in areas with a high positivity rate to reduce the cases and, therefore, the pressure on hospitals. "Our health infrastructure is overstretched. Doctors are facing burnout and mental trauma handling so many cases. But they are still continuing to work to be able to save as many lives as possible," Dr Ritu Arora from Lok Nayak Hospital said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/412-deaths-in-delhi-cumulative-toll-16500-2nd-highest-after-maharashtra/articleshow/82349865.cms||---

Among the deceased, 970 (65.4%) were men and 514 (34.6%) women. Co-morbidities were present in 999 (67.3%) patients who died, while the remaining 485 did not have any underlying illnesses. Comorbidities included diabetes mellitus in 499 cases, hypertension in 459 cases, chronic kidney disease in 111 cases, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in 84 peeople who succumbed to the virus. NHM mission director Dr Nipun Jindal said highest number of 374 deaths had been recorded in Kangra district. He said close to 90% deaths occurred in persons who had attained the age of 45 years. Of the 362 deaths which occurred in the state from April 14 to 30, 67 were of those who received the first dose of Covid vaccine and two deaths of those who had got the second dose. He said in both cases, death after the second dose was reported in Kangra district and the duration between the second dose and death was four and 16 days, respectively. Thus, in both cases, the deceased person had succumbed to the disease before development of effective immunity, he added. He said since more than 90% persons infected with Covid-19 are in home isolation, it is important to know self-care procedures for a patient to improve their condition. He said proning is one such intervention which is beneficial in patients with compromised breathing comfort, especially during home isolation. It improves ventilation and keeps breathing easy. He said that regular monitoring of SpO2, along with other signs liske temperature, blood pressure and blood sugar, is important during home isolation. Proning is required only when the patient feels difficulty in breathing and SpO2 decreases below 94 (less than 94), he said. Walking test for O2 saturation check NHM mission director Dr Nipun Jindal advised a walking test for Covid patients for a through oxygen saturation check. He said a patient should first check their oxygen saturation. Then they should walk non-stop for six minutes, at normal place and on an even surface. After six minutes, the oxygen level is to be rechecked. If SpO2 drops below 94%, the person should immediately inform the mapped medical officer. “However, the test is not advised for those who are suffering from asthma or if the saturation is already less than 94-95%,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/of-362-who-died-of-covid-in-hp-between-april-14-30-2-had-been-vaccinated-twice/articleshow/82348350.cms||---

---||India||SC refuses to defer UP Panchayat vote counting||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Saturday refused to defer counting of votes in the Uttar Pradesh Panchayat elections scheduled for May 2, but added new norms to the stringent Covid protocol with the hope of safe completion of the process for declaration of results in 2,41,451 seats amidst resurgent covid pandemic. All officials and candidates or their agents must show Covid negative report or undergo a rapid antigen test to prove that they are covid negative before allowed entry into the counting Centre. In the alternative, they must possess certificate for double dose vaccination to gain entry into the centre. No crowd gathering around counting centres would be permitted by imposing curfew around it and no victory procession would be allowed. A bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar and Hrishikesh Roy asked the UP government to appoint a nodal officer for each Centre to hold him accountable for scrupulous implementation of each and every norm of the Covid protocol and ordered video recording and their preservation for future hearings before the Allahabad High Court. Holding a special hearing on a court holiday on Saturday, the bench forced the UP government to notify a nodal officer for each of the 829 counting centres, mostly government schools, to ensure that the personnel for counting, candidates and their agents as well as security personnel scrupulously adhered to the specified covid protocols. After hearing counsel Shoeb Alam, who appeared for petitioners seeking deferment of counting amidst rising number of covid cases in UP, and additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati for UP government, the bench said, "We decline to interfere in these petitions and for the same reason also with the fresh writ petition filed before this Court, while recording the assurances given by the UP Government as well as the State Election Commission that necessary measures have been put in place in terms of the guidelines issued from time to time, including the recent Notifications of April 29 and 30 issues by the SEC." Alam had argued that counting would lead to congregations around counting centres, which could prove to be super spreaders. "It will be in the best interest of the citizens to defer counting. News reports stated that nearly 700 teachers deployed for election duties died of coronavirus infection. They are reluctant to take part in the counting process," he said. Bhati cited a parallel and said if an advocate tests positive for covid, can it be said that he contacted the infection in the court? "Similarly, inquiry is going on into the allegations about the death of teachers due to covid during polling. But,mit would be difficult to ascertain whether those died contacted the virus in the polling booth or in a market place," she said, Bhati told the court that the UP government said no congregation of the general public would be allowed around the counting centres. She said that the curfew already imposed in the state would last till Tuesday 7 am and assured the court that it would be extended in the areas where counting is taking place if the counting process rolled beyond Tuesday. SC was informed that though the three-tier panchayat election process was initiated for a total of 8,69,563 seats, actual voting was required in only 2,41,451 seats as rest were either uncontested or no nominations were filed. Bhati said that there are strict norms to restrict the total number of persons at a counting centre to 150, including poll officials, 75 candidates and their agents. "Counting will take place in eight hourly shifts and after each shift the centre will be fully sanitized," she said. The ASG said that no one, not even the election officials and security personnel, would be allowed entry into the counting centres without proving that they are Covid negative or have taken both doses of vaccine. The bench said, "Needless to observe that the norms specified for candidates and authorized representatives of the candidates in Notification dated April 29 to produce RT-PCR or Rapid Antigen Test report or Covid-19 vaccination completion report would also apply to officials deployed or entering at the concerned counting centres as in the case of the candidates and their authorized representatives. Although we dispose of these petitions, it will be open to the parties to make an application before the High Court in the pending proceedings for further directions, as may be required from time to time."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/supreme-court-allows-up-panchayat-vote-counting/articleshow/82349900.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The strategy to increase testing helped GCC track people with the viral infection early, isolate them and prevent further transmission of the infection, said GCC commissioner G Prakash. The reproduction rate (R-naught) of the viral infection (no. of people who can get infected from one confirmed case), officials say, has also been hovering between 1.3 and 1.2. On Friday, the civic agency drew samples from more than 28,304 people. On April 21, the test positivity rate (TPR) — the number of tests that turn positive for every 100 samples tested — was 20.8%. The number of fresh cases recorded in the city on April 21 was 3,750. While the new cases registered on Friday was 5,473 — a close to 50% jump — TPR on Friday was 19.3%. GCC has also increased testing from 18,035 on April 21 to 28,304 on April 30. Around 8-10 contacts per positive case are being traced and tested, a GCC official said. Testing centres have also been publicised more and all the primary contacts of a person who tests positive, including close family members and personal attendants such as drivers and house helps are being tested. The number of active cases has not increased in proportion to the fresh cases as the number of people who recover from Covid-19 has been increasing everyday since April 24. For instance, on April 24, 3,667 people recovered while the fresh cases were 4,086. On April 25, recoveries was more than the fresh cases, causing a dip in active cases. The next day again, the recoveries outnumbered fresh cases by 280, which caused a further decline. On Saturday, there were 31,475 people under treatment for the viral infection in Chennai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tests-up-in-chennai-but-positivity-rate-stable/articleshow/82349964.cms||Siddharth Prabhakar

Pandey sent the communication after Singh alleged the acting DGP offered to mediate in his stand-off with the state government. Singh had telephoned Pandey and recorded the conversation with him in which the acting DGP allegedly offered to mediate between him and the state government. Singh attached the transcripts of the conversation to a petition he filed in the Bombay high court against the government decision to conduct the two inquiries. Singh challenged the two orders passed on April 1 and 20 by the state and which directed a preliminary inquiry by Pandey under service rules and an inquiry into allegations made by a police inspector against him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/maharashtra-dgp-recuses-self-from-both-param-bir-probes/articleshow/82349981.cms||Vijay V Singh

Though there is enough oxygen at the moment in most cities and regions, there is scarcity of cylinders to fill it, crippling the supply chain. Apart from hospitals, there is also a demand from people who have returned home from hospital after treatment. “Medical fraternity has made it clear that oxygen is not required for all Covid-19 patients. But people want to procure one to be on the safer side. If people stop looking for oxygen, the stress on the suppliers and demand for cylinders will come down automatically,” Sivanadian said. Suppliers in Madurai say that demand on the hospital side has gone up after smaller hospitals also started treating Covids-19 patients. In Chennai, an oxygen concentrator, which is generally recommended for patients with mild or moderate symptoms, now costs ₹20,000 a month on rent. The same device, which may cost anywhere between ₹42,000 to ₹45,000 in shops, are now sold at 80,000. “There is an acute shortage of oxygen across the city, whether it is a concentrator or a cylinder. Some patients have started stocking without any logic and some people who are taking advantage of the situation to jack up prices,” Dr Avinash Rajkumar, founder and head, NORMS, told TOI. Sethuraman of Inspiration Medical Systems in Coimbatore, who provides oxygen concentrators for home care, said, “Our demand is mainly for patients who need oxygen post Covid-19 recovery. The demand across western and southern regions has increased 10 times in the last one week,” he said. Dileepan of Covai Air Products said that the demand for oxygen cylinders has gone up abnormally from around 10 tonnes a month to 25 tonnes a month. “We are unable to supply because there is a lack of liquid oxygen and cylinders in the market,”he said. A private oxygen supplier on the Trichy-Thanjavur border said they were supplying 10 metric tonnes of liquid medical oxygen to Mahatma Gandhi memorial GH alone. With the demand up, they have increased the frequency of supply from once in three days to a regular basis. In Salem, private hospitals have started stocking up medical oxygen cylinders expecting a surge in cases. Salem district collector S A Raman has warned of stern action against those selling oxygen in black market. Most multi speciality hospitals in Coimbatore say they have moved to piped oxygen and face no shortage in supply as of now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/rush-to-stock-up-oxygen-grows-across-tamil-nadu/articleshow/82350021.cms||V Devanathan

Of these, 19 were identified and booked under sections of attempt to murder and deterring public servant from discharge of duty of the IPC. Farmers from various districts of Punjab, who had been camping on the roadside near YPS Chowk in Patiala city for over a month, drove their tractors towards the CM’s house on Friday, before the scheduled time of the tractor march, which they had announced earlier. Police claimed that four personnel were injured during a minor scuffle to prevent farmers from gheraoing the CM’s house. SHO, Civil Lines, Patiala police station said 19 farmers were identified while over 100 unidentified were booked under sections 30 (attempt to murder), 353 and 186 of the Indian Penal Code. The farmers removed several police barricades and sat down on the roads near the CM house. They had resolved to stay put till their demands, including higher compensation for their lands, were met. They have been protesting for a few months and had even interrupted public hearings of the Punjab Pollution Control Board. Besides, they got the announcement of compensation awards deferred by protesting in front of the SDM offices in Punjab. “We were demanding that the state government get land acquisition proceedings halted till the issue of the three central farm laws was resolved and farmers agitating on Delhi borders came back. But both the Centre and state governments are not willing to halt acquisition, instead the proceedings were sped up in Punjab. We had gheraoed roads near CM house in Patiala,” said Harmanpreet Singh Jeji, coordinator, Delhi Katra Expressway Kisan Sangharsh Committee (DKEKSC). The organisation was formed a few months back by affected farmers. Later, farmers affected by some other highways in Punjab also joined them, following which the protest was launched under the “Road Sangharsh Committee” banner. This committee joined hands with Bharat Bhumi Bachao Sangharh Committee (BBBSC), under which farmers from five states are protesting against highway land acquisition near Tikri border of Delhi. DKEKSC coordinator H S Jeji, on Saturday, held a meeting with BJP leader Gurtej Singh Dhillon and claimed, “Dhillon called me to get our issue resolved by getting a meeting fixed with Union minister Nitin Gadkari. The state government has not paid any heed to our demands and instead sped up acquisition proceedings in Punjab. Both Capt Amarinder and BJP at the Centre are in connivance. Now, we only demand a valid compensation. After getting compensation, we will join farmers protesting on Delhi borders against the three laws.” BJP’s Gurtej Singh Dhillon said the farmers’ demand for valid compensation was genuine and he would get a meeting fixed with Nitin Gadkari to resolve the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/120-farmers-booked-for-blocking-roads-near-cm-residence/articleshow/82347754.cms||---

Here's all you need to know about the elections and early trends:West BengalTrendsThe ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) is leading in 216 seats while Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is leading in 73 seats as per trends at 6:30 pm. The pollsWest Bengal has a total of 294 assembly seats out of which two did not go to the polls due to the death of two candidates ahead of the seventh phase. Polling in these two seats will be held on May 16. This means that the magic figure that a party or alliance needs to achieve to form the government is 147. Polling was spread over eight phases - the longest electoral exercise in the state's history - and the last round concluded on April 29. The polling was rocked by political violence, which is not unprecedented in the politically volatile state. However, it was the Covid-19 pandemic that dominated the election season this year. The large-scale political campaigning in the state, which is reporting a surge in cases like the rest of India, came under heavy criticism due to the flouting of Covid-appropriate norms. The state recorded an overall voter turnout of 81.87%, less than 83% recorded in 2016. The partiesThis year, the contest in the state was primarily between the ruling Trinamool Congress and the BJP. The TMC, led by chief minister Mamata Banerjee, has been in power since 2011. The BJP, which was for long a marginal player in Bengal, has now taken center stage following a buoyant performance in the 2019 Lok Sabha election and the fading footprint of the once-powerful Left alliance. An alliance between the CPM-led Left, Congress and Indian Secular Front is also in the fray. However, the alliance is not considered to be a significant challenger in 2021. The predictionsExit polls were divided over the election outcome, with a few of them predicting a hung assembly and others giving an edge to either the TMC or BJP. A poll of nine exit polls shows that the state could be headed for a fractured mandate. According to the aggregate, the TMC would bag 141 seats while the BJP 138. The Left alliance will be a distant third with just 13 seats. Whether the predictions hold true or not, it appears that the state is headed for a tight contest. Tamil NaduTrendsAccording to trends at 6:30 pm, the ruling AIADMK is leading in only 68 seats as the opposition DMK tipping the scale leads in 132 seats emerging as a winner. While the Congress is leading in 16 seats and CPI(M) in 2 seats. Meanwhile, MNM party founder and actor Kamal Haasan is leading in Coimbatore (South) constituency. The pollsPolling was held for 234 assembly constituencies of Tamil Nadu in a single phase on April 6. The polling was largely peaceful except for some sporadic incidents of violence. A party has to secure at least 118 seats to form the government in the state. The elections this year were marked by the absence of the two late Dravidian stalwarts J Jayalalithaa and M Karunanidhi. The state recorded an overall voter turnout of 72.81%, less than 74.81% recorded in 2016. The partiesDMK and AIADMK are the two main rivals in Tamil Nadu politics and the 2021 contest was dominated by them. The DMK is led by former chief minister M Karunanidhi's son MK Stalin while the AIADMK is spearheaded by the incumbent CM K Palaniswami and his deputy O Panneerselvam. The Congress and BJP, both of which have limited political presence in the state, are in alliance with DMK and AIADMK respectively. Both Congress and BJP are junior partners in the alliance. Two other fronts - TTV Dhinakaran-led AMMK and actor-turned-politician Kamal Haasan-led MNM - were also in the fray this year. In 2016, AIADMK proved most exit polls wrong after retaining power in the state which is traditionally known not to re-elect the ruling government. The predictionsThe exit polls have unanimously predicted a thumping DMK victory in the state. A poll of five exit polls predicts 174 seats for the DMK and 56 for the ruling AIADMK, which is seeking a third straight term in the state. KeralaTrendsAs per trends at 6:30 pm, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) leading on 57 seats in Kerala Assembly elections as the counting of votes underway in the state. While CPI is leading in 16 seats, Congress is leading in 24 seats and IUML is leading in 17 seats. The pollsElections for the 140 constituencies in the southern state were also held in a single phase on April 6. The two main alliances will be eyeing the majority mark of 71 to be able to form the government in the state. Polling was largely peaceful except for minor skirmishes and allegations of bogus voting reported from a few places. The state recorded an overall voter turnout of 74.57%, nearly 3 percentage points less than the turnout in 2016. The partiesKerala is historically known for the bitter rivalry between the two main fronts CPM-led Left Democratic Front (UDF) and the Congress-led United Democratic Front. This year too, the contest is primarily between the LDF and UDF. The BJP is also confident of garnering more seats this time from the lone seat - Nemom - it had won in 2016. The predictionsThe exit polls have unanimously predicted that Pinarayi Vijayan will stay on as chief minister as his LDF would secure a comfortable victory in the elections. A poll of five exit polls has predicted 88 seats for the ruling LDF and 51 for the UDF. Either alliance's victory would mark an important moment in Kerala politics. An LDF victory would be rare in Kerala as the state has had a record of ousting the ruling alliance for the past 40 years. On the other hand, an LDF loss would be a big setback for communism in India as Kerala is the only state where the Left is in power. AssamTrendsAs per the trends at 6:30 pm Bharatiya Janata Party leading on 61 seats while Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) is leading on 10 seats. Meanwhile, Indian National Congress is leading on 32 seats and while AIUDF is leading on 13 seats. The pollsAssam has a total of 126 seats which went to the polls in three phases. A party or an alliance has to secure at least 64 seats to form a government in the state. A major controversy erupted this year when the Election Commission ordered repolling for a polling station in Ratabari after reports of an EVM being transported in a private vehicle belonging to a BJP candidate. Aside from this, the polling was largely peaceful except for sporadic incidents of violence and reports of EVM malfunctioning. The state witnessed an overall turnout of 82.04%, down over 2% from the previous election's 84.72%. The partiesThe contest in Assam is primarily between the ruling NDA led by the BJP and the rival UPA front led by Congress. Unlike the previous elections, the BJP-led NDA this year comprises just two other parties - Asom Gana Parishad and UPPL. BJP's key ally Bodoland People’s Front (BPF) quit the NDA ahead of polls to join the Congress-led front. The Congress is contesting the elections in alliance with Badruddin Ajmal’s All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF), Bodo People’s Front and three Left parties. The predictionsAll exit polls have predicted that NDA will retain power in the state this year. A poll of four exit polls gave NDA 73 seats and the UPA 52. PuducherryTrendsThe All India NR Congress is leading on 11 seats while the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) is leading on five seats, as per trends at 6:30 pm. The Congress is leading on five seats, the AIADMK is leading on only one seat. The pollsPuducherry is a Union Territory that is entitled by a special constitutional amendment to have an elected legislative assembly and a cabinet of ministers. It has 30 assembly seats in total and the winner of the elections must secure the magic figure of 16 to form the government. Puducherry voted in a single phase on April 6 and the polling was mostly peaceful except for a few minor scuffles. The UT witnessed a voter turnout of 81.88% this year, which was a 3.22% percentage points dip compared to the previous assembly elections. The partiesLike Assam, the main contest here is between the NDA and UPA. The NDA comprises All India NR Congress, BJP and AIADMK while the UPA comprises DMK and Congress. Puducherry hogged the national spotlight just weeks before the assembly elections after the ruling UPA was struck by a spate of defections. This prompted a floor test in the assembly, which the UPA lost. Since then, the UT has been under President's Rule. This year, the NDA is vying to come back in the state under the leadership of the former Chief Minister N Rangaswamy-led AINRC. Former chief minister V Narayanaswamy, who lost power just before the polls, did not contest this year. The predictionsAll exit polls have predicted a clear victory for the NDA. A poll of three exit polls predicted 21 seats for the NDA and just 9 for the UPA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/assembly-elections-in-west-bengal-tamil-nadu-kerala-assam-puducherry-highlights/articleshow/82350039.cms||---

The flour will be given in packings of 25 kilogram each at all farmer protest sites. A few days ago, Ram Singh, 40, started providing water, for which he purchased 11,000 campers. His dhaba, Golden Hut, was closed for commercial purposes when the farmers’ protests started. Thereafter, it was being used to run langar (community kitchen) for protesters. Many of them spend nights on the dhaba premises. Rana used three acres of land to set up eight machines for making flour. His is a rags to riches story, which took another turn when farmers reached Delhi borders. “Despite belonging to a small farming family, I was running a tea kiosk around 16 years ago and somehow set up a small dhaba. Since I was on the highway to Delhi, I started getting good number of customers. Sales reached up to Rs 3 to Rs 4 lakh a day. When the farmers’ protest started I decided to support them and closed the dhaba for customers to start langar,” he said. He added, “Sometime ago, farm leaders Rakesh Tikait, Gurnam Singh Charuni and Abhimanyu Kohad asked me to start water service and I went a step ahead, asking them to ask farmers to bring wheat and I put up a flour mill to turn wheat into aata.” It is learnt he has spent nearly Rs 4 crore on the farmers’ struggle and categrorically denies underlying political ambitions or monetary considerations. Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) leader Abhimanyu Kohad said farm leaders are impressed by the selfless service provided by Rana. He not only preferred to close the dhaba but has been running langar from Day 1 of the protest. “Rana is giving yeoman service to protesting farmers. He never cared for his business and fully devoted himself to the cause of farmers for over five months,” said Charuni.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/after-langar-dhaba-on-delhi-border-starts-flour-mill/articleshow/82347770.cms||Neel Kamal
---||World||North Korea warns US of 'very grave situation' over Biden speech||SEOUL: North Korea on Sunday warned the United States will face "a very grave situation" because President Joe Biden "made a big blunder" in his recent speech by calling the North a security threat and revealing his intent to maintain a hostile policy toward it.  Last week, Biden, in his first address to Congress, called North Korea and Iran's nuclear programs "a serious threat to America's security and world security," and said he'll work with allies to address those problems through diplomacy and stern deterrence.  "His statement clearly reflects his intent to keep enforcing the hostile policy toward the DPRK as it had been done by the US for over half a century," Kwon Jong Gun, a senior North Korean Foreign Ministry official, said in a statement.  "It is certain that the US chief executive made a big blunder in the light of the present-day viewpoint," Kwon said. "Now that the keynote of the US new DPRK policy has become clear, we will be compelled to press for corresponding measures, and with time the US will find itself in a very grave situation."  Kwon still didn't specify what steps North Korea would take, and his statement could be seen as an effort to apply pressure on the the Biden administration as it's shaping up its North Korea policy.  The White House said Friday administration officials had completed a review of US policy toward North Korea, saying Biden plans to veer from the approaches of his two most recent predecessors as he tries to stop North Korea's nuclear program. Press secretary Jen Psaki did not detail findings of the review, but suggested the administration would seek a middle ground between Donald Trump's "grand bargain" and Barack Obama's "strategic patience" approaches.  Kwon's statement didn't mention Psaki's comments.  After performing a series of high-profile nuclear and missile tests in 2016-17, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un launched summit diplomacy with Trump on the future of his growing nuclear arsenal. But that diplomacy remains stalled for about two years over differences in how much sanctions relief North Korea could win in return for limited denuclearization steps.  In January, Kim threatened to enlarge his nuclear arsenal and build more high-tech weapons targeting the US. mainland, saying the fate of bilateral ties would depend on whether it abandons its hostile policy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/north-korea-warns-us-of-very-grave-situation-over-biden-speech/articleshow/82350103.cms||---

While some of them got charred to death, others died of severe asphyxiation caused by smoke when the fire was sparked at around 12:40am in Welfare Hospital on Bharuch-Jambusar Road. Dipak Makhijani, regional fire officer, said the hospital did not have a fire NOC. “The first responders from the hospital said in their statements that the fire started from the ventilators, so we suspect that there could have been a spark in the machine which started the fire,” Makhijani told TOI. The hospital run by Bombay Welfare Trust has been functional since 1995, but the building where the accident occurred was unused and refurbished last year for Covid-19 treatment. Chief Minister Vijay Rupani ordered an inquiry by two senior IAS officers — additional chief secretary, labour and employment, Vipul Mittra and commissioner of municipalities, Raj Kumar Beniwal. There were 57 Covid-19 patients in all, including 23 in the general ward and 12 each in two ICUs. Forty-one patients were shifted to various other hospitals in Bharuch and nearby towns. Policemen broke the glass windows of the building and brought out seven to eight patients. Bharuch district superintendent of police (SP) Rajendrasinh Chudasama said, “It took nearly 90 minutes for the fire brigade teams to bring the flames under control. Many locals from near-by areas rushed to the spot and helped shift other patients to different hospitals.” Barring one from Vadodara’s Karjan taluka, all victims were residents of Bharuch and Ankleshwar. Eleven of the deceased were women. Sarfaraz Patel, a resident of the Jambusar Chowkdi area said, “It was a horrific sight. Many locals who rushed for help broke open the glass doors and windows and brought out many patients. But some of them died.” The rescue operation was also affected due to a sudden power failure in the entire hospital premises while the main oxygen supply line was also damaged. Meanwhile, a team of state-run power distribution company Dakshin Gujarat Vij Company Ltd (DGVCL), fire department, police and forensic teams have initiated a detailed investigation into the cause of fire. Nurses were internsThe blaze snuffed out the lives of two young nurses — Madhvi Padhiyar of Bharuch and Fariga Khatun from Ankleshwar. The 19-year-olds were working as trainee nurses in the hospital. As Fariga’s PPE caught fire, Madhvi tried to save her, but her kit was also caught in the flames. They ran towards the bathroom to douse the fire with water, but it was too late. Rs 4L compensationExpressing grief at the tragedy, chief minister Vijay Rupani announced a compensation of Rs 4 lakh each to the relatives of each victim. The compensation will be given from the CM Relief Fund.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/midnight-horror-18-killed-in-bharuch-covid-hospital-blaze/articleshow/82346879.cms||Jay Pachchigar

At the soft launch in a government hospital here, Yediyurappa said: “We received 3 lakh doses and have a stock balance of about 1 lakh doses returned by private hospitals. We will continue with the drive.’’ However, Sudhakar said: “We’ll start the full-fledged drive only after we get confirmation from manufacturers about when they’ll supply the vaccines. We have over 6,000 vaccination centres and need at least 6 lakh doses before we start with the 18-plus population.” Four hosp branches begin drive for 18-44 categoryCief secretary P Ravi Kumar told STOI: “We’ll announce the date of the full-fledged launch for 18-plus category once we distribute vaccines to government health centres. We’ll then open CoWIN portal for registrations. It may take some days.’’ This comes a day after the government deferred the drive for 18-44 years category citing vaccine shortage and asked people of this group not to throng hospitals until further notification. The drive for those over 45 years will not be affected. Meanwhile, four branches of Apollo Hospitals in the state — Jayanagar, Bannerghatta Road, Seshadripuram (all in Bengaluru) and Mysuru — started the drive for 18-44 category on Saturday. Some other corporate hospitals are also preparing to launch the drive soon. Asked about the urgency for starting the third phase, especially when people above 45 years are worried about getting their second dose, Yediyurappa said the government has made different arrangements for different groups. “In the next few days, another vaccine is entering the Indian market. Vaccines from other countries are being imported. There will be no shortage,” he said. Congress seized the opportunity. “On the one hand, health minister Sudhakar says there is no stock of vaccines. But the CM claims there is no shortage. Who is lying,” asked former KPCC president Dinesh Gunda Rao. On Friday, Yediyurappa said the third phase will begin in stages as there was no confirmation on supply of vaccines. Sudhakar had appealed to those aged 18-44 who registered on CoWin portal not to turn up at vaccination centres. Health department sources said the U-turn came after the Centre asked SII to hand over some stocks to Karnataka to ensure it’s part of the national launch on Saturday.

Police said Vijendra and Praveen Kumar died on the spot, while Vijendra’s friend Neeraj Ahuja suffered serious injuries. The car was being driven by Praveen. The incident, according to the police, happened around 3 am when the three were travelling from Greater Noida to Delhi. The SUV was rammed by a heavy vehicle from behind. Vijendra’s brother Vivek has lodged a complaint with the police. Vijendra worked as a journalist with several newspapers in Lucknow, a police officer said. He was from Haryana’s Panipat. The police officer said the bodies of Vijendra and Praveen were stuck inside the car as its bonnet got crushed in the impact. “The bodies had to be removed using cutters,” sub-inspector Cheda Lal said.

---||Bengaluru||Covid second wave: Bengaluru to test only symptomatics||BENGALURU: With testing laboratories overburdened as the Covid second wave rages in Bengaluru, the state government has tweaked its testing strategy for the techcapital — only symptomatic persons and primary contacts will be subjected to tests. The move, according to officials, is aimed at improving the efficiency of testing laboratories. While laboratories are overloaded with work, the number of people turning up for testing out of fear is compounding the woes of testing personnel. Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta, while interacting with apartments associations on Saturday, said: “Only symptomatic cases (those who have fever, cough and breathlessness, among other symptoms) will be tested and not general cases as there is a heavy load on testing labs.” Concurring with him, a senior BBMP official said: “Given the daily spike in coronavirus cases in the city, it is becoming difficult to test everybody.” Bengaluru’s positivity rate crossed the 20% mark which means around 20 persons of every 100 tested in the city are infected. “The fear of Covid is so high that people without any symptoms are queueing up for testing,” the official said, adding: “This has a ripple effect on testing capacities of laboratories.” The official explained that test results, supposed to come out within 24 hours, do not come on time as testing staff are overburdened. Gupta pointed out: “The publication and uploading of test results also gets delayed.” As a result, those with Covid symptoms are not sure of their status and end up going from one hospital to another in search of beds when their condition deteriorates. Top BBMP officials are to be partially blamed for the delayed test results. “Several testing personnel and data entry operators were not paid for months, so a section quit. The ground-level Covid workers were taken for granted,” an expert said. There have been reports of hospitals shutting the doors on patients for want of test results or designated district numbers (BU number). “So, only the needy, including primary contacts of Covid patients, will be tested,” Gupta added. Data trackers point out that BBMP has reduced testing in four days following a rapid spiral in positive cases. “Bengaluru was testing 1 lakh people per day in the third week of April and it has currently dropped to 60,000,” an independent data analyst said. While the move to test only symptomatic persons is likely to take the spotlight off Covid mismanagement, it has not been endorsed by public health experts and a section of bureaucrats. “The more we test, the more effectively we can contain the virus,” said a member of the state technical advisory committee, while emphasising there was a large community spread in Bengaluru. “Though the incubation period of the virus in the first wave was 14 days, we’re not sure about the aggression levels of the virus in the second wave, especially when young persons land up in ICUs and on ventilators. It is prudent to increase testing than confine it only to those symptomatic,” a pulmonologist said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/covid-second-wave-bengaluru-to-test-only-symptomatics/articleshow/82350178.cms||Rakesh Prakash

Others who had come to the plant claimed he had been waiting for an oxygen cylinder for several hours and looked disturbed. Police, however, said it was a personal relationship issue that had driven him to suicide. Dharmendra (25), originally from Unnao in UP, had allegedly been standing in a queue outside the oxygen plant from 9am and failed to get a cylinder till evening. Around 5.30PM, he went to the adjacent park and hanged himself from a tree. People waiting outside the oxygen plant alerted the cops. Dharmendra was taken to a hospital where doctors declared him dead. DCP (Manesar) Varun Singla said, “We found a suicide note in his pocket and it has no mention of oxygen cylinder. In the note, which is written in broken language, he said he was disturbed due to some relationship issue.” The DCP said no one from his family had approached police so far. He added it was not clear if people in his family had Covid and if that was the reason why he had come to the oxygen plant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/after-waiting-in-o2-queue-youth-hangs-self-from-tree/articleshow/82347875.cms||Bagish Jha
---||Gurgaon||Demand soars, pharmacies run low on basic medicines||Gurgaon: The exponential rise in Covid-19 cases and increased demand for antivirals and antibiotics has thrown pharmacies in the city out of gear. With stocks running out as soon as they arrive, pharmacies said the availability of basic medicines has become a challenge. It is not only Covid drugs like Remdesivir that are not available, even regular medicines such as azithromycin and zincovit, apart from oximeters, are not available. Residents complained that the pharmacies are running out of antibiotics and multivitamin supplements as well, forcing them to call up friends and relatives in different parts of Delhi-NCR for help. “My brother and I developed Covid symptoms a couple of days ago. The doctor asked us to complete a five-day course of antibiotics and antivirals before going for the Covid test. I searched all the stores in my vicinity, but could not find Azithromycin or an oximeter. All the pharmacies said they are running out of stock. A friend drove all the way from Greater Noida to drop the items at our gates,” said Pooja Aggarwal, a resident of New Palam Vihar. Chemists said they are unable to keep pace with the exponential rise in demand as the supply chain is also witnessing hiccups due to localised lockdowns in various parts of Haryana and Delhi-NCR. “Earlier, our stocks would last for months. Now, I’m placing orders every week, and we are out of stock a couple of days after supplies arrive. Also, the demand is ever-increasing, so we are unable to assess how much stock should be ordered. For instance, one day we see a demand for 150 to 200 strips of Azithromycin; the next day, the demand may go to over 300,” said Jatin Jain of Kamla Pharmacy in Sector 24. Meanwhile, pharmaceutical companies said besides the spike in demand and hoarding by many residents, the sharp rise in prices of the raw material, irregular imports of raw materials from China, and ‘irrational’ sealing prices decided under the Drugs Prices Control Order are major impediments in scaling up production. “Pharma companies depend on China for 70% to 80% of the raw materials, but supplies have been hit due to unpleasant relations. Furthermore, prices of raw material have shot up three to four times, while the sealing price remains the same. We are helping in every possible way but we need support from the government to increase production,” RL Sharma, senior vice-president of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, told TOI. He further added that if the proposed pharma park in Karnal had been started, the industry would have been able to deal with the current shortage of basic medicines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/demand-soars-pharmacies-run-low-on-basic-medicines/articleshow/82347882.cms||Siddharth Tiwari
---||Bengaluru||Battle plan: Priority actions for the second wave and beyond||India is reeling under the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. Three potential reasons for rapid surge in cases are related to the agent (virus), host response (immunity) and environment.  Apart from newer variants of concern imported from other countries, B.1.617 (known as double mutant) is the most widely prevalent in India. Initial evidence indicates it’s more infectious, if not more virulent. Apart from this, B.1.618 is prevalent in West Bengal. The genomic epidemiology assessed by scientists at Nimhans suggests that multiple variants are present in Karnataka. In particular, a distinct clade within the B.1.36 lineage was associated with a local outbreak in Bengaluru. The evidence regarding virulence and immune escape properties of variants is under investigation concerning host factors, poor pace and inability to cover wider population coverage. Evidence suggests waning antibodies resulting in a minor proportion of people with reinfection. Environmental factors include continual presence of super-spreader events resulting in faster spread of the virus. The higher circulation is also correlated with higher chances of developing newer variants of concern (VOC). The effective way to contain transmission involves active case detection by a higher and reliable testing strategy. The ministry of health shared data that the risk of Covid-19 infections is almost negligible in vaccinated persons. Also, preliminary evidence suggests that Covaxin is effective against B.1.617 while awaiting peer-reviewed publications. Evidence available from other countries suggests that vaccines offer reasonable protection against newer VOC. Hence, wider and faster vaccine coverage is the most optimistic path ahead, as vaccines offer complete protection against deaths by eliciting a broad immune response involving a range of antibodies and cells. However, there are several challenges. First, the supply chain shortage has to be managed by expanding it to domestic and international vaccine manufacturers. The US President’s offer to provide vaccines should be readily accepted. The country can turn this crisis into an opportunity to reclaim the status of the world’s vaccine powerhouse by inviting more firms with regulatory approvals to manufacture in India. Second, the communication strategy has to improve. While the intent is clear in expanding vaccine coverage to younger age groups, a realistic date of a start based on supply chain distribution could have avoided confusion. Third, till shortage issues are resolved, over the next three weeks, the states should focus on better micro-planning and mobilisation efforts so that the pace can be increased when vaccines are available. Planning should focus on operational issues to reduce crowds at vaccination centres while no eligible person is left out. Fourth, while the private sector is instrumental in ensuring that those who can afford it can get their shots, governments should plan extensively to ensure that people below the poverty line are prioritised. Finally, additional healthcare personnel should be employed by filling existing vacancies so that dedicated human resources are available to administer the vaccine and monitor the cold chain management and follow-up after vaccination. There will be a third wave some time in the winter. Hence, ensuring vaccination coverage is important in preventing deaths and severity of disease in the next wave. From the current share of 8.97% vaccinated of the total population, it would be ideal to completely cover all the vulnerable and as many persons as possible in other age groups. Advance in research is important to cover children and pregnant women. Governments over several decades haven’t been successful in building fit for purpose public health systems in India. The strongest component is its people. Governments should ensure that all vacancies are filled up permanently, so that vaccine coverage and Covid-19 response are balanced with other health services. The vaccination programme should ensure people’s involvement, utilising the experience of elections and universal immunisation programmes.

So far, 12,32,860 samples have been collected. “We have already intensified testing and surveillance activities in large outbreak regions. We are conducting 12,000 to 13,000 tests daily to identify Covid patients and isolate them at the earliest to curb the infection,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurgaon. Asked about when vaccinations for the 18-plus population would commence, Yadav said as of now, Gurgaon doesn’t have vaccines. “Once we receive the doses, we will begin the inoculation process,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/gurgaon-sees-over-4000-new-covid-cases-12-deaths/articleshow/82347900.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Noida||Ghaziabad faces vax shortage, likely to run out of doses soon||Ghaziabad: The district, with only 6,000 vaccine doses available with its health department, is staring at a crisis. The number is not enough to sustain the vaccination drive on most days. With no directions from the Uttar Pradesh government or the administration, the drive to inoculate all over 18 years hangs in limbo. Even the ongoing vaccinations may come to a complete halt by next week. An official from the health department said, “The vaccinations for those in the 18-plus category should have started from Saturday, but Ghaziabad is not one of the seven districts selected by the state government for the drive.” “We are still in the process of collating data on the number of people who have registered for vaccinations. On Saturday, several people turned up at the vaccination centres only to be told that they should not come until they are allotted dates,” added the official. Official data reveals that the number of people in the 60+ and 45+ categories turning up for the jabs has been falling. The government had set a target to inoculate 2,16,000 recipients in April but could meet only 80% of the target. “Leave aside the 18-plus category, with the stock that we have, we will not be able to vaccinate people under the existing category,” said the official. On Saturday, the administration vaccinated only 3,998 people. The vaccinations were not carried out in private centres. “We are also facing a severe manpower crisis. While most of us are busy managing hospitals, a few of us are down with Covid. Under these circumstances, it is getting difficult to maintain the rate of vaccinations,” said the official The vaccination figures were low in Noida too on Saturday. All those in the ‘under-45’ category, were left waiting as they did not get any response for the slots. Also, there were no new registrations during the day. In total, 2,,681 people were vaccinated in Gautam Budh Nagar on Saturday. The private hospitals in the district did not conduct the vaccination drive, following instructions from the administration. A total of 25 government centres gave the jabs on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/ghaziabad-faces-vax-shortage-likely-to-run-out-of-doses-soon/articleshow/82347921.cms||Abhijay Jha
---||Noida||Covid patient dies, records show him ‘an absconder’||Noida: A day after TOI reported about a 33-year-old woman dying outside GIMS hospital, it has come to fore that a Covid patient who was admitted to the hospital was shown to have “escaped” even as his body had been lying in the medical facility’s mortuary as an “unidentified person” for the past eight days. While initially the patients’ kin were told that he had been discharged and a discharge slip was also shown to them, it was only when the former got to know about two bodies lying in the hospital’s mortuary that they insisted they be shown the bodies. According to Amit Kumar, a restaurant owner who was the employer of the deceased Mahesh Singh (47), he got the latter admitted to GIMS on April 20 after much insistence and after raising the matter with the media. “Three days later, Mahesh’s family members got a call from the hospital that the patient needed plasma therapy. Soon, we started preparing for the same. But, on April 25, when the family members tried to talk to Mahesh, they were told that he was doing fine and he had been sent to the centre on the third floor,” Amit said. On April 26, Mahesh’s brother Govind and his two nephews arrived from Champavat in Uttarakhand and tried to meet him but were told to come the next day. “They came the next day too, they were not allowed to meet him,” he said. However, on April 29, when Amit himself went to the hospital, he was allegedly told that the patient was discharged on April 24 and had been “absconding”. “A doctor showed us the discharge summary, dated April 24. Then, somehow one of the doctors mentioned that there were two bodies lying in the mortuary.” After the matter was raised by the media, GIMS issued a statement admitting that the patient had been admitted to the ICU on the third day of the admission and because he became unconscious, the ICU staff could not recognise his name and he was shown as “an unknown patient.” When contacted, GIMS director RK Gupta told TOI,” It was thought that he left the hospital without informing. His vitals were stable earlier but suddenly deteriorated and he was admitted to the ICU. Staff couldn’t get his file and hence, he was treated like an unknown patient.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/covid-patient-dies-records-show-him-an-absconder/articleshow/82347932.cms||Shikha Salaria

But 96% of the beds are occupied and according to the records, there are no ICU/ventilator beds available in the district. The administration, on the other hand, is clamping down on the private hospitals where non-serious and non-Covid patients are occupying beds. “As of now, we have 50 Covid hospitals, with a combined bed capacity of 3,272 in Ghaziabad and 497 vacant normal beds which we are trying to equip with oxygen and ICU facilities,” said an official from the district administration. “As of Saturday, all the 759 ICU/ventilator beds are occupied. We are further working on acquiring more hospitals to enhance the bed capacity to meet up the increasing demands in view of the huge surge in Covid patients,” he added. The administration is also cracking down on the private hospitals where beds are occupied by the non-serious patients. “On Friday, we inspected a couple of private hospitals where we found that few the beds were occupied by those patients not in a serious condition. The hospital management has been warned in this regard,” the official said. Meanwhile, on Saturday, an oxygen refilling initiative was taken up by an administration-approved gas agency, and close to 500 people availed the service. “The service is for those patients who are under home isolation. On Saturday, close to 500 people got their oxygen cylinders refilled. The initiative is to ensure that the home isolation patients, some 4,000 in number, receive the supply of oxygen so that they do not have to visit the hospitals,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/covid-beds-increased-but-gzb-stares-at-crisis/articleshow/82347940.cms||---

Dr Devi Shetty, cardiac surgeon and chairman and founder, Narayana Health, warned that the next big shortage the country would face is that of doctors, nurses and frontline workers. “Based on data from the first Covid wave, positivity rate should remain at 25-30% for 3-4 months. Every day over 3 lakh people are testing positive. Statistically, for every positive patient, there will be at least five more patients who are positive but not tested,” he said. Chief minister BS Yediyurappa had convened a meeting of heads of private hospitals to elicit their opinion on how to manage the pandemic. The meeting decided to increase the incentives being given to doctors and other staff on Covid-19 duty besides bearing the expense of their treatment in case they are infected. Other decisions included setting up an expert panel to suggest ways to face the possible third wave of Covid-19, convert hotels near private hospitals as step-down hospitals with oxygenated beds, convert beds with centralised oxygen supply system as ICU beds, convert beds in medical college hostels as oxygenated beds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/medical-students-may-be-roped-in-for-treatment-in-karnataka/articleshow/82353449.cms||---

Jonathan Altland, 25, was transported to a hospital for unspecified injuries after being taken into custody late Thursday night at a Gilbert auto dealership where Chandler police Officer Christopher Farrar was fatally injured and Gilbert police Officer Rico Aranda suffered a head injury, the Gilbert Police Department said Friday night in a statement.  Police officials did not immediately respond Saturday to telephone and email queries by The Associated Press about Altland's status and background and other information about the incident.  The statement released Friday night said Altland "is facing charges of murder, aggravated assault and auto theft."  Online court records did not contain information about the case and it wasn't immediately known whether Altland had an attorney who could comment on his behalf.  Police said Friday that state and county law enforcement officers shot at Altland at the dealership after he stole a vehicle and crashed it through a closed bay door and attempted to run over officers while trying to flee, the statement said.  Then "the suspect continued his intentional attack on the officers," first striking Farrar with the stolen vehicle and then striking a parked car that struck Aranda, the statement said.  The incident began about 10 p.m. Thursday when a sheriff's deputy in nearby Pinal County tried to pull over a vehicle for speeding.  The deputy reported that shots were fired at him during the pursuit that continued into Chandler and ended in Gilbert. That's where the vehicle being pursued crashed and Altland ran into the dealership and allegedly stole a vehicle inside the business as he tried to get away, according to the police statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/police-man-to-face-murder-other-charges-in-officers-death/articleshow/82350307.cms||---

The Oneida Casino in Green Bay tweeted Saturday there was an active shooter at the casino. Spokeswoman Bobbi Webster said later that ``individuals'' had been shot, but she didn't have information on how many or their conditions, and didn't know whether the shooter was still at large. Attorney General Josh Kaul tweeted shortly before 10pm that the scene "is contained. There is no longer a threat to the community." He gave no other details and an agency spokeswoman didn't immediately respond to a message. Green Bay police and the Brown County Sheriff's Office told The Associated Press they have no details on the casino incident. Webster cited Oneida police and casino security for her information. She said people were being cleared out of the casino and nearby properties. "We do not know where the individual was shooting, or (where) individuals were shot," Webster said. The Oneida Casino is operated by the Oneida Nation. Webster said the casino is connected to a large hotel and conference center, the Radisson, also owned by the Oneida Nation. Gambler Max Westphal said he was standing outside after being evacuated for what he thought was a minor issue. "All of a sudden we hear a massive flurry of gunshots _ 20 to 30 gunshots for sure," Westphal told WBAY-TV. ``We took off running towards the highway ... There had to have been 50 cop cars that came by on the highway. It was honestly insane.'' The Oneida tribe's reservation lies on the west side of the Green Bay area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/spokesperson-people-shot-at-wisconsin-casino/articleshow/82350346.cms||---

The funds, which are part of the share recommended by the 15th finance commission to the states, are being released from the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) The commission had recommended devolution of Rs 8853.60 crore from the SDRF to the states, for the financial year 2021-22, as the first installment. The ministry of home affairs had on April 29 recommended the finance ministry to release the first instalment at the earliest to undertake containment measures. Based on the recommendation of the MHA, the finance ministry asked the RBI to credit the fund to the accounts of the respective state governments urgently. However, in the case of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Assam, the election commission of India (ECI) has instructed that since the model code of conduct is in place, the release of funds should not be publicized or no political functionary should make any reference to the matter in public. As per the recommendation of the MHA, Maharashtra (Rs 1288.80 crore) gets the highest share as the first installment, followed by Uttar Pradesh (Rs 773.20 crore) and Odisha (Rs 641.60 crore). On the basis of the recommendation of the national disaster management authority (NDMA), the MHA has asked the states to urgently undertake containment measures, by assessing the situation, till May 31. The MHA has said that the focus will be on containment measures, including night curfew, restricting inter-mingling among people and also controlling social, political, academic, cultural, and religious festivals and any other type of congregations. As per the instructions, the containment measures listed are only indicative activities, and the states and the union territories should make a careful analysis of the local situation, areas to be covered and probability of transmission and then take an appropriate decision. The MHA has also asked the states to take strong action against anyone violating the containment measures, under the sections from 51 to 60 of the disaster management act, besides legal action under the section 188 of the IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/centre-tells-rbi-to-release-125crore-urgently-to-kerala/articleshow/82349907.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Woman’s body taken to hospital in JCB bucket||KOLAR: The all-pervasive second Covid wave hasn’t been able to eliminate the fear and stigma surrounding the disease, particularly in rural areas. Just about 80km from Bengaluru, the body of a 42-year-old woman who collapsed in front of a shop was carried to hospital in the bucket of an earthmover as fearful villagers refused to lend their vehicle. Chandrakala, 42, who made a living by working in hotels and doing other small jobs, had arrived in Kurutahalli village of Chintamani taluk late Wednesday night along with her 12-year-old daughter. Both were working as labourers in Chintamani and were returning home as Chandrakala had taken ill a few days ago. They sat in front of a shop to pass the night and in the morning, villagers offered them some food. An exhausted Chandrakala soon lay her head on the girl’s lap and dozed off. Around afternoon, as the child tried to wake her mother, she realised Chandrakala had died. No one took mother to hospital, says girlV illagers one dared gathered go near on them hearing . “I don her ’t cries know but what no happened to my mother, she just collapsed. Nobody came forward to take her to the hospital,” the girl said. Police were called and sub-inspector Naresh Naik arrived with his team. They asked villagers to shift the body to Chintamani Hospital for autopsy and left. A scramble began for a vehicle and despite several being available, villagers were not ready to offer theirs to shift the body, fearing Chandrakala had died of Covid. As the 12-year-old waited by her mother’s body outside the shop, a JCB arrived and soon after, the body was placed in the earthmoving bucket and taken to hospital. During the autopsy, it was found that the woman was not Covid-positive. Chandrakala had lost her husband a few years ago and was single-handedly raising her daughter and son, aged around 10. The boy was left behind at the village while Chandrakala and her daughter went to work in Chintamani. A few days ago, Chandrakala fell ill and decided to return to Kurutahalli as there was no one to take care of either of them. “It is unfortunate that the body was shifted in a JCB,” SI Naik said, adding steps would be taken to create awareness among villagers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-womans-body-taken-to-hospital-in-jcb-bucket/articleshow/82350516.cms||Ranganath Krishnaswamy
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Pandemic snuffs out 34 in 24 hours, 3,000 fresh Covid cases||LUCKNOW: The virulent second wave of the Covid-19 claimed 34 lives on Friday and infected 3,125 persons in the past 24 hours. With this, the death toll of the second wave, that started on March 15, reached 649 and the tally rose to 1.2 lakh. The number of patients with active infection now stands at 41,042. Total 2.1 lakh infections and 1,834 casualties have been recorded in 14 months of the pandemic so far, of which 60% cases and 35% deaths have taken place in 46 days of the second wave till date. Streets were deserted due to the three-day-curfew, but hospitals and funeral grounds were packed with people. However, the encouraging part was that 6,189 patients, mostly in home isolation, also recovered, taking the total recoveries during the second wave to over 84,000, about 65% of the total case in the same period. Nevertheless, rise in critical cases continued to overwhelm hospitals. “More deaths are being recorded now because of about 5,000 patients in the hospitals, about 3,000 are serious or critical,” said a senior KGMU professor. Another cause of worry, said a doctor at SGPGIMS, was that an increasing number of healthcare staff is also getting infected across all hospitals in the city due to constant exposure, thus limiting human resources required to cater to a huge number of patients. In KGMU, there was resentment among healthcare workers because of the new order that does not allow any rest period to a staff member after Covid-19 recovery. “We are the biggest Covid hospital with 765 beds for Covid-19 patients. We are also running the Trauma Centre for emergency non-Covid patients. As a result, we have no other option, but to overburdened our staff,” said an officer||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lucknow-pandemic-snuffs-out-34-in-24-hours-3000-fresh-covid-cases/articleshow/82350404.cms||---

Buffett said it can be tough to pick the long-term winners. He pointed out that in 1903 there were more than 2,000 car companies, and nearly all of them failed even though cars have transformed the country since then. "There's a lot more to picking stocks than figuring out what will be an incredible industry in the future," said Buffett, who is known for his remarkably successful investing record. "I just want to tell you that it's not as easy as it sounds." Buffett has said that most people will fare better by owning an S&P 500 index fund instead of betting on individual stocks. He said many of the novice investors who jumped into the market recently and drove up the value of video game retailer GameStop are essentially gambling. Buffett said the stock trading platforms that allow people to buy and sell stocks for free, such as Robinhood, are only encouraging that gambling. Buffett spent several hours answering questions Saturday afternoon at an online version of Berkshire's annual meeting alongside vice chairmen Charlie Munger, Greg Abel and Ajit Jain. The executives opined on a variety of topics at the meeting including: - Buffett said the policies of the Federal Reserve and the stimulus packages passed by Congress have done a tremendous job of propping up the economy and keeping interest rates low. He said the government clearly learned lessons from the Great Recession in 2009 and acted quickly in response to the pandemic, but it's hard to predict the long-term consequences of those policies. "This economy right now 85% of it is running in a super high gear _ and you're seeing some inflation and all that. It has responded in an incredible way," Buffett said. - Munger openly questioned the value of cryptocurrencies. "I don't welcome a currency that is so useful to kidnappers and extortionists and so forth," Munger said. "Nor do I like shoveling out a few extra billions and billions and billions of dollars to somebody who just invented a new financial product out of thin air. I think I should say modestly that I think the whole damn development is disgusting and contrary to the interests of civilization." - Buffett said he doesn't regret selling off Berkshire's $6 billion stake in all the major airlines last year even though those stocks have grown significantly since he sold them last spring. Buffett also said he thinks the airlines might not have been able to secure as much government aid as they have during the pandemic if they still had "a very rich major shareholder like us." Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire is sitting on $145.4 billion in cash and short-term investments because Buffett has struggled to find major acquisitions for the company for several years. Investor Cole Smead said he would love to see the company get more active the next time the market swoons. "We do not question whether Buffett and Munger have patience. That's obvious. The question is do they have any aggression. That's not obvious," Smead said. Buffett said he wants to invest more of Berkshire's cash, but the current competition he faces from private equity and other investment funds has made it difficult for Berkshire to find reasonably priced acquisitions. And the 90-year-old said that a year ago, it was hard to predict how the economy would respond to the pandemic and all the government stimulus. This was the second year in a row that the annual meeting was held online because of the coronavirus pandemic. This year's event was moved outside of Omaha for the first time - to Los Angeles to be near where the 97-year-old Munger lives. The meeting usually draws 40,000 to Omaha, filling a 18,300-seat arena and every nearby overflow room. No other company matches those crowds. Author Bob Miles said he misses "mingling with like-minded and self-selected shareholders" and talking with executives who run Berkshire subsidiaries who routinely spend part of the meeting in their company's booth in the huge exhibit hall that adjoins the arena. Berkshire companies like Geico insurance, See's Candy and Fruit of the Loom sell their products to shareholders each year. The fun of the meeting isn't just for shareholders. Jim Weber, who runs Berkshire's Brooks Running, said he longs for the chance to compare notes with fellow Berkshire managers at the one annual event that brings together the leaders of the decentralized conglomerate's dozens of subsidiaries. "We certainly miss that opportunity to connect with our peers," said Weber. On Saturday morning, Berkshire reported its first-quarter earnings and said it made $11.7 billion as the paper value of its investment portfolio rebounded from the depths of the coronavirus pandemic. A year earlier, Berkshire reported losing $49.7 billion. The conglomerate said that besides the investment gains, profit also improved at all of its major divisions _ including insurance, utility, railroad, manufacturing and retail companies - as the economy continued to recover. CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said she was surprised that Berkshire's many economically sensitive businesses didn't improve more given how much the economy has recovered, but the company controlled costs well. Buffett has long said Berkshire's operating earnings offer a better view of quarterly performance because they exclude investments and derivatives, which can vary widely. By that measure, Berkshire's operating earnings improved to $7.018 billion, or $4,577.10 per Class A share. That's up from $5.87 billion, or $3,617.62 per Class A share a year ago. The four analysts surveyed by FactSet expected Berkshire to report operating earnings of $3,792.36 per Class A share. Berkshire continued its streak of major stock repurchases by investing $6.6 billion in its own stock during the quarter. The company spent $25 billion on repurchases last year. Seifert said investors will applaud the significant buybacks. Berkshire shareholders rejected proposals that would have required the company to publish annual reports on climate change and on the company's efforts to improve diversity throughout Berkshire. Buffett, who controls nearly one-third of Berkshire's stock, and the rest of the board opposed those measures largely because the company is decentralized and allows its subsidiaries to handle those issues themselves. Abel said during the meeting that Berkshire's largest contributors to carbon dioxide emissions - its utilities and BNSF railroad - already publish annual reports on their efforts to reduce climate change and reduce their emissions over time. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. owns more than 90 companies, including the BNSF railroad and insurance, utility, furniture and jewelry businesses. The company also has major investments in such companies as Apple, American Express, Coca-Cola and Bank of America.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/warren-buffett-warns-investors-not-to-gamble-on-stocks/articleshow/82350563.cms||---

Taking a dig at the state government, SAD leader Prem Singh Chandumajra said, “How else can you explain the fact that ventilators which have arrived in the state since months have not been installed till now? Similarly, the government has failed to recruit staff to run more than 300 ventilators, despite having ample time to do so. There cannot be a bigger proof of the complete abdication of responsibility by any chief minister.” Chandumajra claimed that this was a case of criminal negligence of the chief minister and health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu. “The Congress government failed to place orders for Covid vaccine in time due to which there is a severe shortage. Despite having more than one year at its disposal, the government did not make any effort to augment the state’s oxygen-manufacturing capacity,” he said. Akalis hit out at Amarinder-Sidhu slugfest SAD leader Prem Singh Chandumajra said instead of getting together to combat, the top leadership of the state was engaged in a fight. “The chief minister is engaged in a political battle with his bête noir Navjot Sidhu and has no time to tackle the ongoing health emergency in the state.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/recruit-staff-for-unused-ventilators-in-punjab/articleshow/82350530.cms||---

The vehicle, which was heading towards a factory at Kadungalloor, a containment zone, was intercepted at Pathalam bridge. Police said there were eight workers in the mini pickup van. “Usually these kinds of vehicles are not covered. But we found this vehicle covered and got suspicious. They covered the rear part to hide the workers from the notice of others. As the area is a containment zone, two or more people are not allowed to gather at public places. We have registered a case against the driver under the Kerala Epidemic Disease Act,” said Binanipuram police. Meanwhile, more number of guest workers are getting infected with the virus in Ernakulam. As many as 304 guest workers were tested positive for Covid-19 between March 22 and April 23 in the district. But their number started to increase lately with more than 20 cases daily. On some days, it touched over 50. Benoy Peter, executive director of centre for migration and inclusive development, said that if more tests are conducted among guest workers, many will be positive as they share common toilet and accommodation facilities. While labour officials noted that as against the first wave last year, there was no rush among guest workers to return to their native place when Kerala is struggling with the second wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/police-seize-vehicle-for-violating-covid-norms-in-kerala/articleshow/82350550.cms||---

While Assam and West Bengal saw multiple phases of polling, electors in Kerala, Puducherry and Tamil Nadu cast their votes in a single phase on April 6. The exit polls for the four states and a Union Territory predicted a clear victory for DMK-led alliance in Tamil Nadu, LDF retaining power in Kerala and BJP-led NDA in Assam and a tight contest in Bengal with several surveys giving an edge to the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC). In Puducherry, the polls predicted victory for NDA. In Kerala, strict security arrangements have been made at the counting centres for the counting of votes for the assembly elections, Kerala State DGP Lokanath Behera informed on Friday. "Strict security has been put in place in the state in general and at the counting centres in particular for the counting of votes. On counting day, 30,281 policemen, including 3,332 central armed police personnel, will be on duty. This includes 207 DySPs, 611 inspectors and 2,003 sub-inspectors (SIs) or Additional sub-inspectors (ASIs). As many as 49 companies of central police forces have been deployed at 140 counting centres. On Saturday, Chief Election Commissioner Sushil Chandra reviewed counting arrangements with senior officers of the commission and the CEOs of Assam, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal and Puducherry in a virtual meeting. An official release said Chandra directed that all counting halls must be fully Covid-19 guidelines compliant. "Contesting candidates have given details of approximately 1,50,000 counting agents (including substitutes) in five States/UT by the stipulated time. More than 90 per cent of them have already been facilitated RTPCR/RAT tests. The remaining are being provided the test facility today by the DEOs. The Commission has also directed to accept test reports from any authorized lab. This is also being followed in by-poll PCs/ACs," an Election Commission release said. Counting will take place at 2,364 counting halls and 822 returning officers and more than 7,000 assistant returning officers have been designated for the purpose. The commission has deputed approximately 1100 Counting Observers to watch the process of counting. The counting including for seats where bypolls have been held will start at 8 am on Sunday. The EC has made elaborate arrangements for smooth and safe counting in 822 assembly constituencies in five States/UT and for by-polls in 4 parliamentary constituencies and 13 assembly constituencies across 13 states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/assembly-election-results-counting-of-votes-begins-in-4-states-puducherry/articleshow/82350560.cms||---
---||World||Australia's Perth at risk of second snap-lockdown with three new Covid-19 infections||SYDNEY: Australia's fourth-largest city faces prospects of its second snap lockdown in two weeks, officials said on Sunday, after a hotel quarantine security guard in Perth and two of his housemates tested positive for Covid-19.  Western Australia (WA) Premier Mark McGowan said late on Saturday he had yet to decide whether the state's capital city, which last week emerged from a three-day snap lockdown after reporting one Covid-19 infection, would go into lockdown on Sunday.  "Our restrictions in place, and the use of masks, and the ability of our contact tracers and testing give us the ability to hold on a lockdown decision," McGowan told reporters late on Saturday.  "But it is possible that this could change tomorrow, or the day after."  Australia, which has no other community transmissions of the coronavirus, this weekend banned citizens who had been in India within 14 days from returning home, as the world's second-most populous nation contends with a surge in COVID-19 cases and deaths.  The antipodean country has all but stamped out community infections after closing its borders to non-citizens in March 2020, recording just 29,800 cases and 910 deaths.  The infected 20-year old security guard worked at Perth's Pan Pacific Hotel and had already had his first COVID-19 vaccine, McGowan said. He was now quarantining alongside his seven housemates, five of whom had so far tested negative.  State officials are due to provide an update on Sunday afternoon.  New Zealand late on Saturday night paused travel from Western Australia, cancelling two flights due to arrive on Sunday morning. The Pacific nation last month agreed to a quarantine- and Covid-testing free "travel bubble" with Australia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/australias-perth-at-risk-of-second-snap-lockdown-with-three-new-covid-19-infections/articleshow/82350633.cms||---

It was nothing short of a miracle that all 11 of them could be back after their boat was hit by a foreign fishing vessel in mid-sea, about 1,100 kms off Goa a week ago. They had virtually gone missing for four days after that when their relatives even feared the worst could have happened. Recounting the incident, boat owner K Joseph Franklin said they had gone to sleep close to midnight on April 23. There were a few big foreign fishing vessels at a safe distance. “They should be more than twice the length of our boat that is 55 feet long. Their sides were widespread like a bird’s wings extending from their boat’s body,” Joseph said. Around 1 am, they heard a thunderous sound. “The side of a foreign vessel hit our boat’s right. Its protruding side crushed our cabin that is right in the middle of the boat. A plank from my boat hit me and I was thrown into the sea. Six of us were either thrown into the sea or had jumped off the boat fearing for our lives,” he said. Joseph recalled that two men on the vessel realised they hit the boat. “They spoke in their language. For a moment we expected them to extend some help as we were battling for our lives. But they immediately turned off all lights on their vessel and fled,” he said. The cabin of their boat in which important gadgets and support systems are kept was thrown into the sea. “I got on the boat. Five of my men (Freddy, Jegan, John, Jeniston and Yesudhason) were missing. Diesel was leaking from the pipe connecting the tank that was damaged by broken pieces of glass. Priority was to save the men. With only one torch light we rescued four men from the sea by 3 am. Yesudhason was spotted around 7 am clinging to one of the two fibre boats that we brought along,” he said. A Dornier aircraft of ICG spotted them 460 nautical miles (852 kms) away from the accident spot on April 28 as they were heading home. The ICG gave first aid and food to the men and escorted them all the way to Thengapattanam on an interceptor boat. The fishermen were given a hero’s welcome on Saturday as they reached Vallavilai village where a special thanks giving mass was also organised. Those who received them at Vallavilai included Killiyoor MLA S Rajesh Kumar (Congress) and Congress candidate for Kanyakumari Lok Sabha bypoll V Vijayakumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/11-fishers-back-after-surviving-hit-and-run/articleshow/82350652.cms||M K Ananth
---||India||Serum Institute CEO Adar Poonawalla: Will return to India in a few days||MUMBAI: Serum Institute of India CEO Adar Poonawalla has said he will return to India from London in a few days. Poonawalla made the announcement soon after he spoke out about the pressures he was under over the production of Covid-19 vaccines to meet the ever-increasing demand in India as the country battles through a devastating second wave of the coronavirus pandemic. "Had an excellent meeting with all our partners & stakeholders in the UK. Meanwhile, pleased to state that Covishiled's production is in full swing in Pune. I look forward to reviewing operations upon my return in a few days," Poonawalla said in a midnight tweet. In his first comments since he was provided with 'Y' category security by the Indian government earlier this week, Poonawalla had told 'The Times' in an interview about receiving aggressive calls from some of the most powerful people in India, demanding supplies of Covishield -- the Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine that the Serum Institute is producing in India. That pressure was largely behind his decision to fly into London to be with his wife and children, the 40-year-old entrepreneur had said in the interview on Saturday. "I'm staying here (London) for an extended time because I don't want to go back to that situation. Everything falls on my shoulders but I can't do it alone...I don't want to be in a situation where you are just trying to do your job, and just because you can't supply the needs of X, Y or Z you really don't want to guess what they are going to do," Poonawalla had told the newspaper. According to Indian government officials, the protection to Poonawalla has been given in view of "potential threats" to him. Armed commandos of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) will be with him every time he travels to any part of the country, they said and added that the 'Y' security cover will entail a posse of about 4-5 armed commandos. "The level of expectation and aggression is really unprecedented. It's overwhelming. Everyone feels they should get the vaccine. They can't understand why anyone else should get it before them," Poonawalla had said. The businessman had indicated in the interview that his move to London is also linked to business plans to expand vaccine manufacturing to countries outside India, which may include the likes of the UK. "There's going to be an announcement in the next few days," he had said when asked about Britain as one of the production bases outside India. According to the newspaper, by the time the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine was approved in January this year, the Serum Institute of India (SII) had increased its annual production capacity from 1.5 to 2.5 billion doses at a cost of $800 million, and stockpiled 50 million doses of Covishield. The company began exporting to 68 countries, including Britain, as India seemed to have been over the worse, until the situation worsened in recent weeks. "We're really grasping for all the help we can get," Poonawalla had said in the 'Times' interview. "I don't think even God could have forecast it was going to get this bad," he had said. India's daily coronavirus tally crossed the grim milestone of four lakh, while the death toll rose to 2,11,853 with 3,523 fresh fatalities, according to date updated by the Union Health Ministry on Saturday. The infection tally rose to 1,91,64,969 with 4,01,993 new cases, while the active cases crossed the 32-lakh mark, the data updated at 8 am on Saturday showed. Registering a steady increase, the active cases stood at 32,68,710, accounting for 17.06 per cent of the total infections, while the national Covid-19 recovery rate further dropped to 81.84 per cent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/serum-institute-ceo-adar-poonawalla-will-return-to-india-in-a-few-days/articleshow/82350637.cms||---

The bench headed by the chairperson of the state commission K V Manoj Kumar and members K Nazeer and Reni Antony has issued directives to the general education director to authorize an inspection of the schools and prepare a report regarding the expenses for their restoration within a period of two months. A Class IV student of Government LPS in Koonayil, a rural area in Kollam district, had filed a petition pointing out that the school and its classroom walls, which were beautifully decorated with pictures, were defaced with election posters during the recently-concluded assembly polls. The commission said it reflects the irresponsibility of polling officials and the election commission has to take cognizance of it. “It is a gross violation of child rights, guaranteed to the complainant and all the affected children studying in other schools of the state-…This commission must act as a shield, in the event of any attempt to violate their rights. The chief electoral officer must be held legally responsible for the above much condemnable and irresponsible acts on the part of the polling officers. These have been done by them, while on duty, for the state election commission,” the order said. The education director has been asked to issue a notice to the election commission before the inspection and it should be conducted in the presence of election commission officials. The expenses incurred for the restoration of the schools must be met by the election commission and the restoration work shall be done by the education department. The election commission is at liberty to recover the amount spent for the restoration of the walls from the officials responsible for it, the commission said. An action taken report must be filed before the child rights commission within 90 days by both the election commission and education department, the order said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/defacement-of-school-walls-electoral-chief-told-to-pay-up-in-kerala/articleshow/82350653.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Covid survivor shares info online, says there’s hope||BENGALURU: After turning Covid positive, Seema Vikas Gadiya suffered from fever, fatigue and other symptoms before recovering after 11 days — on April 18. But those days of battling the symptoms and quarantining alone made the 39-year old motivational speaker from Basavanagudi realise the mental health implications of the infection as well as misinformation floating around it. That is when she decided to use social media platforms to raise awareness about the second wave of Covid-19. “It was no longer the banana-bread, Dalgona coffee-making 2020 lockdown period, but a more serious phase,” she said. Seema had conducted ‘lockdown recovery’ sessions last year too. From an explainer video on how she dealt with Covid and isolation to posters on finding beds in the city, Seema is building a treasure trove of information. “There are lots of misconceptions, panic and stress among people. It is natural under the present circumstances. So I wanted to put out information that could help people look at the situation with common sense, confidence and optimism — from not stepping out unnecessarily to not blindly relying on information through WhatsApp,” she said. Seema has spoken about plasma donation, addressed myths associated with it and who is eligible to donate. “After that video, I received so many messages from young people,” she said, adding that she has also been working with Mumbai-based group, Plasma Warriors. Seema said she was suggested by some well-wishers not to speak out about being Covid positive as there was still stigma associated with the infection. “But I felt it was my duty to share my story and what I learnt from my journey,” she asserted. She was asked to make some informational posters for an NGO and her young daughters helped her with such Covid-related activities. She says 80% of Covid patients can isolate and recover at home by following all the regulations diligently, while 20% would need hospitalisation. But it all boils down to how one manages the symptoms and stress. “Stress can drastically compromise a person’s immune system. Rather, patients must ensure they are connected with their loved ones through video calls or messages even in isolation. Words of encouragement and family support can go a long way,” she said. However, not all is rosy for her. A few days ago, Seema was depressed when a person she was trying to help with plasma succumbed to Covid. “She was only 25. It hit me emotionally when I got to know she passed away. I broke down but realised I need to keep going on. I composed myself, took inspiration from her and re-started my work,” she said, adding, “There is hope and there is a better tomorrow. In faith, we will all find miracles.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-covid-survivor-shares-info-online-says-theres-hope/articleshow/82350608.cms||Farheen Hussain

The reason, why it's going to be like that is V.V. Prakash, hugely popular Malappuram district Congress Committee president and the party candidate from the Nilambur assembly constituency, passed away after he suffered a cardiac arrest in the wee hours of Thursday. The 56-year-old Prakash, according to many of the exit polls conducted, reveal that he is likely to win and if that be the case, it could be even heart breaking for all. "He left without waiting to know the result," continues to be the general response from all. Incidentally if the sitting legislator P.V. Anwar of the Left is going to be re-elected, then there will be no re-election and should Prakash win, then it will be the first constituency where a by-election will be held, after the 15th Kerala Legislative Assembly will be formed. Two time former Congress Chief Minister Oommen Chandy who returned to his home here, last night after attending the funeral of Prakash said, he is still to come to terms with the passing away of Prakash. Incidentally in the 1996 assembly polls a similar incident took place when P.K. Sreenivasan of the CPI passed away a day before the counting. When votes were counted, he won the polls and in the by-election his son P.S. Supal won the election. --IANS sg/skp/||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/kerala-mood-at-nilambur-will-be-somber-when-votes-will-be-counted/articleshow/82350785.cms||---

For nearly a week, the software professional’s kin ran from pillar to post to find a ventilator, but lost him before they could get one. Nagarabhavi resident Sagar AG, 28, was excited about getting married in June and wanted to keep it a low-key affair with minimal attendance. But the joyous occasion at his home turned tragic in 15 days after Sagar died of Covid-19 complications. When he fell ill on April 12, Sagar gave his reports to a private laboratory and tested negative. But two days later, he had fever and cold. Sagar met his doctor and was told to get himself tested again. This time he tested positive and five days later, BBMP officials called him up to check his health status and suggested home isolation. But his condition worsened and he complained of fatigue and dysentery. “We took him to a nearby hospital and got a CT scan done. Doctors said he was suffering from pneumonia and asked us to immediately shift him to the ICU,” said his younger brother Akshay AG. After several attempts and calls to at least 30 hospitals from April 21, Sagar’s family members were yet to get an ICU bed and ventilator even as his health deteriorated. His friends appealed for help on social media and visited several hospitals to save Sagar. They said in each hospital they saw at least four patients in the waiting list for a ventilator. He succumbed to the virus on April 27.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/month-before-wedding-bengaluru-techie-dies-without-getting-ventilator/articleshow/82350791.cms||Kiran Parashar

The consignment, which was being smuggled to Taiwan, was declared as pavement stones. An official statement released on Saturday said customs had been working in close coordination with another intelligence organisation on specific inputs about smuggling of red sanders to South East Asian countries, from where it ultimately reached China. As part of this major operation, customs’ Special Investigation and Intelligence Branch (SIIB) stepped up surveillance over the Chennai seaport area, Container Freight Stations (CFSs) and nearby places. They were acting on various sources of intelligence and had been on high alert for more than a week. On the basis of risk parameters, various consignments were scanned and data relating to exports were also checked to zero in on the consignment in which the red sanders was being smuggled. Based on analysis of surveillance, intelligence and other measures, a few containers meant for shipping to South East Asian countries, including Taiwan, were targeted for detailed inspection. Simultaneously, officials also ramped up surveillance at container freight stations (CFSs), where loose export consignments were being stuffed. On suspicion, officials detained a specific container with cargo of unusual goods to be exported Taiwan. The container was to be thoroughly verified. Another team zeroed in on a few export packages meant for stuffing in one of the CFSs. Officials found the container filled with small pavement granite stones to camouflage the contraband red sanders. Both the red sanders and cover cargo were seized. Detailed examination of the export cargo revealed that it was fully stuffed with 103 logs, weighing 1 tonne and valued at 60 lakh. Officials seized a total of 7.4 tonnes of logs and valued at 5.6 crore from both the container and export cargo. Customs officials are on the lookout for those involved in the smuggling operation. Further investigations are on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-seaport-customs-officials-seize-5-6-crore-worth-red-sanders-logs/articleshow/82350927.cms||---

A doctor requesting anonymity said the calculations done by preventive and social medicine department of CMCH indicated that cases in Punjab state may start decreasing after touching peak in the May second fortnight (after may 15) or first week of June. Though everywhere cases are high, the most affected districts — Ludhiana, Mohali and even Bathinda — may peak together with other districts, said the doctor who is part of the team that worked on the projections. However, CMCH officials said more intensive actions — such as stricter monitoring of home isolation, micro-containment and containment zone strategies — are prerequisites for the above projections. A senior doctor of CMCH said there is change in the behaviour of the people. “People have started following Covid norms, which is a good sign. Now, there is even a big demand for vaccines, which is a positive sign as well,” said Dr Clarence Samuel, head of preventive and social medicine department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/punjab-cases-to-see-downward-trend-by-may/articleshow/82350881.cms||Shariq Majeed

Amidst shortage of beds, oxygen and lifesaving drugs, increasing cases of Covid-19 raised worries and need to upgrade the health infrastructure along with recruiting medical practitioners. During last month, positive cases constituently increased in Indore from that 13.71% (on March 31) to reaching at the highest level ever of 20.76% (on April 13), before reducing to a bit i.e., 17.49% (on April 30). Indore health department reported as many as 185 deaths in last month but what strikes at the crematorium was too many bodies in PPE cover, which were far too many than the official numbers published. In local crematoriums/graveyards, hundreds of dead bodies were cremated/buried in a day than the daily COVID-19 bulletin’s figure of deaths in single-digit. "Second wave reported in month of April increased number of cases and deaths, prompting the administration to enforce lockdown and taking other restrictions, which also resulted in less number of people coming out from their houses for vaccination" district COVID-19 nodal officer Dr Amit Malakar said, adding that apart from upgrading the health infrastructure, the department is making all required efforts to check spread of the disease. In April, while the positive rate increased at least by 5 %, the number of active cases also increased from 4,208 reported on March 31 to 11,992 on April 30. At the same time, the ongoing vaccination drive, which the home minister Narottam Mishra termed as the only treatment and urged all the eligible persons to get the dose, lost its pace. Even the district administration and the health department’s plan to achieve desired success by covering as many as 50,000 beneficiaries in a day under ‘Vaccination Mahotsav’, between 11th to 14th April, fell flat as they failed to reach even somewhere near to the daily target in the four days of drive. The health department had vaccinated a maximum of 36,000 beneficiaries in one day during the first week of April but thereafter, the number only reduced and concluded at 8,134 vaccinations on March 28. Thereafter, the health department suspended phase-III vaccination scheduled from May 1 along with reducing the number of vaccinations planned for May 1 to only around 4,000. As per Indore health department’s bulletin, Indore on April 30 April reported 1,832 new cases at the rate 17.49% and 8 deaths while the district’s total COVID-19 count of positive cases as reported in last around 1 year reached to 1,12,672 and 1147 deaths.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/cruelest-month-indore-sees-42000-new-cases-in-april/articleshow/82350996.cms||Sagar Choukse

The judge was dealing with a contempt case filed by Aditya Constructions which has entered into a development agreement with native farmers. The single judge earlier passed an interim order prohibiting the registration department from registering any part of the land in favour of Prime Properties or its associates in survey No. 1007. Charging the registration officials with violating this order, Aditya Constructions had filed a contempt case against the managing partner of Prime Properties and four others. Appearing for the petitioner, counsel KS Murthy told the court that despite the interim order, the registration officials allowed registration of two sale deeds over the land and expressed an apprehension that they may now resort to change the nature of the land and transfer it to third parties. Senior counsel Satish Parasaran assured the court that they will not transfer the land to third parties and that they will not change the nature of the land till the court decides the issue. The judge directed Kukatpally sub-registrar to file his counter and posted the case to July 9.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/judge-asks-sub-registrar-to-respond-on-land-registration/articleshow/82351052.cms||---

The demand for Remdesivir injections in Indore is however around 2,000 vials/day but availability and allocation of said drug is very limited. The situation is forcing family members of the patients,who are undergoing treatment in different hospitals and have been prescribed Remdesivir injections, to run pillar to post but to no avail. In one of the cases, family members of a female patient admitted in Shalby Hospital have been approaching their contacts and visiting different medical stores for arrangement of Remdesivir injections as after the death of the infected person’s husband due to COVID, she is only left to take care of her two children. Shalby Hospital is one of the health facilities that failed to get any allocation of Remdesivir injections on Saturday. “We have been waiting for allotment of Remdesivir injections for the last four days while in absence of the same, doctors are looking for alternate drugs to treat the patients” Dr Vivek Joshi, critical care unit head and medical superintendent, Shalby Hospital, said. He added that there are 137 COVID patients admitted in his hospital and about 80 of them have been prescribed Remdesivir injections. “As per WHO’s guideline, six doses of Remdesivir should be administered to a patient, if prescribed by the doctors” Dr Joshi said, adding that if the doses have not started, the doctors look for other drugs that could help in treatment but if a patient has been administered one or two doses, he should complete the course. According to MGM Medical College’s dean Dr Sanjay Dixit, they along with senior administrative officials take a call over allocation of Remdesivir injections based on availability of the same and severity of the patients admitted in different hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/madhya-pradesh-90-private-hospitals-get-444-doses-of-remdesivir-to-cure-critical-patients/articleshow/82351054.cms||---

The assembly voted 64 to 19 with one abstention to oust the five magistrates on the chamber, which had angered Bukele by ruling against some of his tougher measures during the pandemic.  Ruling party lawmakers defended the decision, saying the court had put private interests above the health and welfare of the people, while the opposition called it a power grab by a populist president seeking total control.  "This is an outrage against the Republic and democracy," the conservative opposition National Republican Alliance, or ARENA, said on its Twitter account.  ARENA party president Erick Salguero called the initiative a violation of the constitution and part of Bukele's "search for complete power."  Bukele defended the process, saying the Legislative Assembly's ability to dismiss the court's judges is "an INCONTROVERTIBLE power clearly expressed in article 186 of the Constitution of the Republic."  El Salvador's constitution states that the magistrates of the Supreme Court of Justice may be removed by the Legislative Assembly for specific causes established by law. Both the election and dismissal of its magistrates must have the support of two thirds of the lawmakers.  "We note with concern the proposal by some members of the National Assembly to remove five magistrates of El Salvador's Constitutional Chamber," tweeted Julie Chung, acting assistant secretary for the U.S. State Department's Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs. "An independent judiciary is the foundation of any democracy; no democracy can live without it."  Jose Miguel Vivanco, director of Human Rights Watch's Americas division, wrote on Twitter that "Bukele is breaking with the rule of law and seeks to concentrate all power in his hands."  The 39-year-old Bukele, a populist who has been criticized for having autocratic tendencies, is by far the most popular politician in Central America.  His New Ideas party swept Feb. 28 legislative elections by a landslide last month devastating the two traditional parties who had long ruled the Central American nation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/el-salvadors-new-assembly-votes-to-oust-high-chamber-judges/articleshow/82351290.cms||---

Sources here said Rajewal and Harnam Singh met for over an hour and discussed the farmer’s agitation, role of SAD(B) and the possibility of formation of a political front ahead of the 2022 assembly elections in Punjab. According to sources, there is a growing disenchantment among the leaders of Damdami Taksal with SAD (B) leadership, after the latter did not pay any heed to Taksal’s recommendations regarding promotions, transfers and so on during the last years of Akali government in Punjab. “The meeting would have never taken place if the relations between Taksal and SAD(B) leaders had not been strained,” they said. While not ruling out the possibility of a political front in-making by farmers’ groups, Manjit Singh GK, president of Jag Aasra Guru Ott (Jago), alleged that being close to SAD (B), the image of Damdami Taksal had suffered due to sacrilege cases and the relations between the two had not been cordial for some time now. “The meeting was on expected lines, Rajewal would like to align with non-political groups and the best choice is Sant Samaj, which has significance support in Punjab and can be useful for them,” he said. GK, who was once close to SAD (B) president Sukhbir Singh, said organisations like Damdami Taksal need to have close relations with Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) for organising various religious functions. “Since SGPC is considered part of SAD(B), so institutions close to SGPC cannot keep themselves away from its (SAD) shadow,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/rajewal-damdami-taksal-chief-meet-fuel-talk-of-political-front/articleshow/82351273.cms||Yudhvir Rana
---||Indore||Madhya Pradesh: Demand for packaged meals up in 2nd wave||INDORE: The second wave of coronavirus fast spreading within families has pushed demand for packaged meals and tiffin services, paving way for many households to start a small business model catering food requirement for Covid-19 infected persons. The surge in demand for meals from Covid-19 infected persons and their family members in isolation at home has prompted many households in residential societies to start meal services and cloud kitchens. Simran Sabnani, a house maker residing in a covered campus in Vijay Nagar said, “I saw many families demanding meals in our society groups because everyone in the family has fallen sick or in isolation. I love cooking and had family support so I started taking orders from customers and preparing food of their choice. Initially I was nervous but now gradually I have gained confidence that my meals would be liked by customers.” Many families in residential societies have turned their kitchens into a small eatery and taking orders for lunch and dinner. Respondents said these days messages about requirement of medical help and meals are trending most in phone groups of residential societies. Gourav Panth, a family member of a Covid-19 infected person said, “My wife has tested positive for Covid-19. I have to take care of both my kids and have never tried my hands in kitchen. I posted a message on a few groups inquiring about tiffin service and was lucky enough to get one just two blocks away. I feel safe in ordering from a house rather than from any hotel.” Some tiffin centers take orders on demand while most have set up a weekly menu incorporating diet required for patients tested positive for the infection. Rajveer Sharma, running a tiffin center in Sukhliya said, “I deliver 45 orders in a day mostly to Covid-19 patients and their families. There is huge demand for packaged meals in Indore these days. I started this with the help of my wife, brother and a friend. I do food delivery myself following all safety guidelines.” Another startup owned by Mukul Dubey started since April 14 receives around 200 calls in a day from people in isolation and hospitals for food delivery. Dubey said, “I started this recently with the help of my father and now wish to continue because demand is huge. People are ready to pay as much but need home made food. Supplies are limited and demand is rising day by day. I get calls even from patients in hospitals to deliver them food.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/madhya-pradesh-demand-for-packaged-meals-up-in-2nd-wave/articleshow/82351305.cms||Meenakshi Sharma

Lack of institutional buying in pandemic has dampened demand for dairy products, frozen vegetables and poultry items mostly sourced from farmers and small traders. Hotels, restaurants and mess in companies consume around 60 per cent of frozen vegetables and poultry products, according to traders. Santosh Ahirwar, a farmer from Kanadia in Indore said, “Pandemic has adversely impacted my poultry business. I have been into poultry for the past 5 years but this is the worst year when I have to spend money from my pocket to keep birds alive. Traders have stopped buying, saying lack of market in pandemic. This is such a business that needs feed and care every day.” Daily production and consumption of eggs in Indore including Mhow and Pithampur, in normal days was around 10-12 lakh per day while bird’s placement per month is around 4.5 lakh, according to Indore Poultry Farmers Association. Dr Surendra Kumrawat, president, Indore Poultry Farmers Association said, “Pandemic has hit us hard with negligible business. There are no buyers but a lot of unsold stocks. Hotels, restaurants and food joints were our major buyers and now everything is shut.” Closure of food joints have also impacted sales of frozen vegetables. Hitesh Patidar, owner of a food processing unit said, “We have lost around 80 per cent business this time because our main buyers are not operating. We are now sourcing less because demand has declined in the market. Looking at the current situation, the dull phase in business is likely to extend until positive cases start to drop.” The rise in fuel prices has also increased the cost of logistics for suppliers forced to bear the additional burden due to dampened sentiment in the market. Bharat Mathurawala, president, Indore Dudgh Vikreta Sangh said, “Consumption of milk and dairy products have fallen in pandemic after which we decided to cut down rates of milk by Rs 2 per litre.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/lockdown-dents-demand-farmers-traders-feel-heat-in-indore/articleshow/82351425.cms||---

Many CBSE schools haven’t completed the class 12 externals yet. While some schools have a couple of subjects remaining for externals, some have those candidates remaining who had been down with the virus. “The schools have decided to plan for the remaining externals after May 10 depending on the situation. As the minors have also been getting infested with the virus, parents are also sceptical now,” chairman of Indore Sahodaya School Complex, UK Jha told TOI. The association will run the plan through the district administration and only after the approval from parents that they will continue with their practicals, he added. The schools will have to call students for the externals as it cannot be conducted via virtual mode. Moreover, as per the guidelines of the Board, the students are to be called in small groups to ensure that physical distancing norms are maintained. Despite the fact that the board has given the deadline as June 11 for the externals. The schools want to ensure that the students are not burdened with the externals when the board exams are near. The decision for class 12 board will be taken on June 1. As suggested the date of exam will have a gap of 15 days from the date of announcement, even if the board decides to conduct the exam after a fortnight, i.e, from June 16, there will be less gap between external and boards which will be a tension for many who are already worried about their exams, said Jha. Therefore schools have been wanting to complete the externals of class 12 students latest by the end of this month with all precautionary measures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/cbse-external-exam-may-be-scheduled-after-may-10-in-indore/articleshow/82351490.cms||---

Thousands of workers from different industrial belts of the region have fled to villages to be with their families amid the alarming country wide surge of the second wave of Covid-19. Absence of workers in factories have impacted production capacities, said factory owners claiming over 20 per cent shortage of manpower due to pandemic. To address the concerns of workers and prevent migration, a joint platform of trade unions have sought relief packages and assurance of medical treatment in government hospitals for workers and their families in a pandemic. Shyam Sunder Yadav, general secretary, Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC), Madhya Pradesh said, “This is an alarming situation where everyone is scared of their lives. Workers have gone through a lot of miseries in the last lockdown and fearing the same situation they have started moving out. It is the duty of the government to assure them of proper medical treatment and food in this time of crisis.” The joint platform of trade unions including INTUC, AITUC, HMS, SEWA and CITU among others has asked the government to provide 10 kg free food grains per person per month for the next six months, deposit Rs 7,500 per month for all non-income tax paying families and treatment facility in government hospitals. Trade unions said the four labour codes and three farm laws introduced in the first wave of pandemic should be replaced and the government should conduct dialogue with the stakeholders before framing laws. Rudra Pal Yadav, general secretary, All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC), Indore district said, “Workers will continue to go out of urban hubs because he is scared and has no means to support livelihood or access to medical treatment in case of emergency. They need assurance for proper medical facilities and ration.” Trade unions also strict orders should be passed to restrict employers from cutting wages and eviction of workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/cos-grapple-with-staff-shortage-in-indore/articleshow/82351546.cms||---

At least 46,057 persons from the district are under treatment for coronavirus. Meanwhile, as many as 2,295 persons tested negative on the day. The district collector imposed Section 144 in areas falling under the Kozhikode rural police limits for seven days from Saturday 6 pm. The action is considering the spike in the number of cases and in the wake of the counting of votes for the assembly polls. The district administration has banned any type of gathering or opening of shops in a two-kilometre radius of the centres where votes are counted. Other than those who are on election duty, no one would be allowed within a 1 km radius. No kind of celebrations should happen following the results and crowding is not permitted near party offices either. Establishments, including those providing essential items, should not be opened within the one-kilometre radius of the counting centres. Election results should not be displayed on LED walls. Distribution of sweets or bursting of crackers after the results are also banned by the district administration. Meanwhile, after a meeting of representatives of shopkeepers at the central market with officials of Kozhikode Corporation, it was decided to limit retail sales of fish from 7.30 am to 3 pm and wholesale from 5 am to 7 am. As many as 10 vehicles would be allowed to transport fish to the market every day.

Chief Secy writes to Karnataka counterpart on oxygen supply to WayanadChief Secretary VP Joy on Saturday wrote to Karnataka Chief Secretary P Ravi Kumar requesting that oxygen tankers may be permitted to fill up from liquid oxygen generation plants in Mysore district for transportation to health facilities in Wayanad district. “At this time when a sufficient number of oxygen tankers are not available, a tanker requires between five to six hours to reach health facilities in Wayanad district from oxygen generation plants within Kerala. On the other hand, oxygen tankers require only about two hours to bring oxygen from generation plants in the Mysore district of Karnataka. In this context, I request that oxygen tankers may be permitted to fill oxygen from liquid oxygen generation plants in Mysore district for transportation to health facilities in Wayanad district of Kerala,” the Chief Secretary wrote. The chief secretary further wrote that there has been a significant surge in Covid-19 cases in Kerala recently and the requirement for liquid medical oxygen has increased substantially. "There are serious challenges being experienced in the transportation of liquid medical oxygen to the small hill district of Wayanad through narrow roads, limiting accessibility,” the letter stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kerala-7-day-curfew-imposed-in-kozhikode-rural/articleshow/82351691.cms||---

Tweeting a picture of the statistics of the deaths of journalists, the Congress leader said, "Look at the condition of those who you see 24 hours, at least once!" (roughly translated from Hindi). जो 24 घंटे तुम्हें दिखाते हैं, उनकी हालत एक बार तो देखो! https://t.co/EkJfCHPgra— Rahul Gandhi (@RahulGandhi) 1619922591000The picture tweeted by the Congress MP from a report dated May 1, stated, "165 Indian journalists lost their lives to Covid so far. On an average two journalists succumbed to the virus every day in April." This comes amid widespread demand to treat journalists as frontline workers and give them preference in vaccination. Last month, Uttarakhand chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat had ordered the vaccination of all journalists and representatives of media organisations in the state calling them "frontline workers." On April 14, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had urged the central government to treat journalists as frontline workers and vaccinate them against Covid-19. He had said the Delhi government will write to Centre on the issue. On Saturday, the Editors Guild of India (EGI) had condoled the death of journalists due to Covid-19 in the past year and again called on the government to give them priority in vaccination along with frontline workers. Meanwhile, India reported 3,92,488 new Covid-19 cases, 3,689 deaths and 3,07,865 discharges in the last 24 hours, as per Union health ministry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rahul-gandhi-highlights-plight-of-journalists-amid-covid-19/articleshow/82351767.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kerala: Majority of hospitals postpone elective surgeries amid surge||KOCHI: With active Covid cases crossing 3 lakhs in the state, majority of hospitals, private and public, have stopped or postponed elective surgeries. Government Medical colleges stopped elective surgeries since Saturday as more rooms and doctors are being allocated for treating Covid patients. Even in private hospitals, doctors across specialties are now being posted for Covid duty as ICUs are overflowing with Covid patients. Besides the majority of patients coming to hospitals for non-Covid treatment and surgeries testing Covid positive, the hospitals are postponing elective surgeries. They are also discouraging routine OP consultations. “We have found that a good number of patients coming for elective surgeries on admission test positive and are asymptomatic and spread Covid in the hospital. Another phenomenon is that patients who are admitted to the hospital turning Covid positive on day two or three, which means they were incubating when they came in,” said Dr Rony Mathew Kadavil, cardiologist, Lisie Hospital. “Non-Covid patient load has reduced in most hospitals and they are now apportioning beds for Covid patients. Most private hospitals have set aside nearly 50% of beds for Covid treatment though the government has asked us to set aside only 25% beds,” said Kerala Private Hospital Association (KPHA) secretary Dr Benevan Joseph. But unlike in the first wave when people avoided going to the hospitals due to fear of catching Covid, doctors said that now people are not bothered much and walk into the hospital like even for minor ailments or routine check-ups. “People are suddenly no more scared of Covid and don’t any more consider it as a disease and are coming to hospitals even with minor problems. We are now increasingly asking patients who don’t need immediate medical attention to stay at home for a month. Hospitals and doctors are overburdened with Covid patients,” added Dr Rony. However, in places where district administration has ensured strict containment measures, people are avoiding hospital visits, unless it is important. “In the districts where containment is strictly implemented, people now don’t turn up on the fixed date for elective surgery and request for postponement,” said said Dr Gopikumar P, secretary, IMA, Kerala chapter. But this has led to concerns that non-Covid emergency care may be neglected as all attention, infrastructure and manpower in most hospitals have been diverted to treat Covid patients. “Alternative arrangements have to be made at the district or taluk hospitals or in the periphery. Otherwise, it will lead to increase in mortality and morbidity among non-Covid patients,” said Dr Binoy S, president, Kerala Government Medical College Teachers’ Association (KGMCTA). Meanwhile, the state government has also asked hospitals to cut down on elective surgeries even as they ensure that care is not denied to emergency non -Covid patients too. An order issued by the chief secretary on Friday said, “Hospitalization of elective cases and non-serious, non-Covid cases should be minimized in hospitals treating Covid-19 patients so that not less than 50% of the available resources in these hospitals are spared for treatment of Covid-19 patients during the surge”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/majority-of-hospitals-postpone-elective-surgeries-amid-surge/articleshow/82351758.cms||---

In the Union territory of Puducherry, the AINR Congress-BJP alliance established a lead ahead of its Congress rival. In the Kanyakumari Lok Sabha by-election, Congress candidate Vijay Vasanth, son of H Vasantha Kumar, whose death due to Covid-19 caused the vacancy, was ahead of BJP’s Pon Radhkrishnan. With massive security measures in place and elaborate Covid-19 safety precautions, counting began at 8am across the state. As is customary, counting was taken up for postal ballots first with a slight delay due to minor glitches. Counting after the first hour showed DMK and AIADMK racing almost neck and neck, but as counting picked up pace, the DMK and its allies pushed ahead. Stalin and Palaniswami established early leads in their own constituencies of Kolathur and Edappady. MNM leader Kamal Haasan also remained ahead but with a thin lead. OPS and Stalin’s son Udhayandihi were ahead in their constituencies of Bodinayakkanur in Theni district and Chepauk- Thiruvallikeni in Chennai, respectively. AMMK leader T T V Dhinakaran and NTK leader Seeman were trailing when close to two hours after counting began. Some of the high profile constituencies showed tough fights. Several AIADMK ministers appeared to be registering setbacks. The intensely fought pre-election campaigns of the two main parties in the fray, the DMK and the AIADMK, were marked by some intense strategizing, tall promises and claims of achievements.  Among the key factors that could influence the poll outcome are anti-incumbency against the AIADMK, just completing its longest stint of 10 year-governance, and allegations of corruption. For the DMK, charges of dynasty politics and the reputation of ‘a rowdy party’ as alleged by its adversary could impact its prospects. Campaigns were marked by competitive populism and offers of freebies, as is intrinsic to an election in Tamil Nadu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/tamil-nadu-election-results-early-trends-push-dmk-in-the-lead/articleshow/82351830.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Inter-state gangster with ₹7.5 lakh reward arrested from Delhi airport||CHANDIGARH/GURGAON: The special task force (STF) of Haryana Police on Saturday claimed to have arrested Sube Gurjar, a gangster who carries a reward of Rs 7.5 lakh on his head, from Delhi’s IGI airport as soon as he landed from Mumbai. Gurjar, who was wanted in 11 murders, 12 attempt to murder cases and dozens of extortion-related cases, used a fake identity to travel on the Delhi-bound flight from Mumbai, officials said. Gurjar was absconding since 2016. In the past six months, he killed six people and made extortion calls to some of the leading developers of Delhi-NCR having their projects in Gurgaon, police said. Three to four days ago, the STF got a tip-off that Gurjar would be coming to Delhi from Pune on a flight. But when the STF officials checked with the airlines, they came to know that there were no incoming flights from Pune on that day. “Then we started scanning the entire week’s bookings on Delhi-bound flights from Mumbai and Goa and found a booking in the name of Deepak,” said DIG (STF) Satheesh Balan. “Deepak was the name Gurjar used to check into a Chennai hotel in 2019. Without wasting any time, we dispatched a team to Mumbai that boarded the same flight to Delhi on Saturday. The team members identified Gurjar on board the flight. We arrested him as soon as he landed at Delhi airport,” Balan said, adding that he was produced in a Rewari court and taken on a sixday police remand. Gurjar entered the world of crime in 2004. He started his criminal activities with gangster Kaushal, currently in jail. But after differences with Kaushal, Gurjar formed his own gang two years back and since then he was operating out of southern Haryana. He was involved in a number of contract killings and cases of extortion. In the last one year, he has extorted money from a dozen businessmen and developers. Over the years, police said, Gurjar has recruited several youngsters in his gang and he was managing the gang from his hideout in different states. In the last few years, he has stayed in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Patna, West Bengal, Rajasthan and Nepal. Of the several cases registered against him, he was convicted in only two, including that of a murder in 2006, by a Gurgaon court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/inter-state-gangster-with-7-5-lakh-reward-arrested-from-delhi-airport/articleshow/82351816.cms||---

---||Business||Warren Buffett’s meeting of many mea culpas: From Apple to health care||OHAMA: Warren Buffett just wanted to say sorry. The chief executive officer made a few blunt admissions at his annual meeting of Berkshire Hathaway Inc shareholders on Saturday. Among them were regrets over Apple Inc stock sales, the circumstances surrounding its airline share dump, and a failed healthcare venture. “That was probably a mistake,” Buffett said of its decision to sell some of the iPhone maker’s stock last year. The move was also deemed an error by his business partner Charlie Munger, who had let Buffett know of his view “in his usual low-key way,” Buffett joked at the virtual meeting. Buffett, 90, is no stranger to contrition. A portion of his shareholder letter in February was devoted to explaining his “big” error in overpaying for airplane-parts maker Precision Castparts. But this year’s annual meeting was peppered with the acknowledgment of missteps, even after its businesses posted a strong quarter with earnings hitting the second-highest level in data going back to 2010. “He and Charlie have always tried to admit their mistakes and face their mistakes,” said James Armstrong, who manages assets including Berkshire shares as president of Henry H. Armstrong Associates. Buffett also kept “trying to gently remind us that most of Berkshire’s money is invested well,” he said. Airline Stocks The billionaire faced questions over why Berkshire didn’t seize upon the temporary market downturn starting in late March last year to snap up more stocks at depressed prices. Instead, the conglomerate used the first weeks of the US shutdowns to dump its airlines stocks as the pandemic curbed travel and, later in the year, trimmed its bank holdings. Stocks of Delta Air Lines Inc. and Southwest Airlines Co, two carriers Berkshire owned, had then rallied more than 45% after the end of May through the rest of 2020. “I do not consider it a great moment in Berkshire’s history,” Buffett said of the period, adding that the economic recovery had surpassed their expectations, thanks to government stimulus measures. Buffett also said it would have been hard for those carriers to get the federal aid that rescued them if a rich investor was considered a significant shareholder in those companies. He still wouldn’t invest in airlines given current pressure on travel, he told investors on Saturday. And while Buffett made some deals including a bet on natural gas assets, he didn’t strike any particularly substantial acquisitions despite the pandemic’s pressure on some businesses. For his part, Munger explained that it would be too high a standard to think that money managers can always perfectly time the bottoming of a market to put lots of money to work. There were examples of contrition in Berkshire’s other businesses, too. Ajit Jain, a vice chairman who runs the company’s insurance operations, said that auto insurer Geico had been late to adopt telematics, the devices used to track drivers and reward them for better behavior. “Geico had clearly missed the bus and was late in terms of appreciating the value of telematics,” Jain said. “They have woken up to the fact that telematics plays a big role in matching rate to risk.” In a broader statement on the industry, Jain noted how insurers had underpriced pandemic risks, requiring that they now recalibrate their models. The industry will likely be more sophisticated in thinking about pandemic risk in their entire portfolios, he said. ‘Tape Worm’ Buffett also reflected on the health care venture Berkshire had set up with JPMorgan Chase & Co and Amazon, to attack the “tape worm” of high-costs in the system. The venture ultimately closed this year, and Buffett acknowledged on Saturday the challenges of trying to overhaul an industry with so many stakeholders, and that accounts for a significant part of the country’s gross domestic product. “We were fighting a tapeworm in the American economy and the tapeworm won,” Buffett said. The mea culpas were also accompanied by criticisms and quips from both Munger and Buffett. The boom in SPACs, or special purpose acquisition companies, would probably not last, said Buffett, while Munger took aim at cryptocurrencies and the explosion in retail trading. The pair chided professionals that push people who are just following a natural human instinct to gamble. “That is really waving the red flag at the bull,” Munger said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/warren-buffetts-meeting-of-many-mea-culpas-from-apple-to-health-care/articleshow/82351963.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka bypolls: Parties wait with bated breath on counting day||BENGALURU: The impact of Covid-19 crisis on the state, the sex CD scandal allegedly involving former minister Ramesh Jarkiholi and internal rift in the ruling BJP will be evident when the results of byelections to a Lok Sabha seat and two assembly segments in the state are announced on Sunday. The bypolls for Belagavi Lok Sabha as well as Maski and Basavakalyan assembly constituencies were on April 17 with 30 candidates in the fray — 10 in Belagavi, 12 in Basavakalyan and eight in Maski. While bypolls to Belagavi and Basavakalyan were held following the demise of sitting MP Suresh Angadi (BJP) and B Narayan Rao (Congress) due to Covid, the Maski seat fell vacant due to disqualification of Pratapgouda Patil (Congress). Counting will begin at 8am adhering to strict Covid protocols and early trends will be known around 10am. In Belagavi, KPCC working president and MLA Satish Jarkiholi is locked in a battle with BJP’s Mangala, wife of Angadi. In the reserved Maski constituency, Patil is pitted against Congress nominee Basanagouda Turvihal. In a multi-cornered contest in Basavakalyan, Congress candidate Malamma Rao, wife of Narayana Rao, is pitted against BJP’s Sharanu Salgar. Independent candidate Mallikarjun Kubha, expelled from BJP, is also in the fray. JD(S) has fielded Syed Yasrab Ali Quadri. While Maski in Raichur district recorded the highest turnout of 70% as against 69% in 2018, Basavakalyan constituency in Bidar witnessed 60% polling as against 65% in 2018. The turnout in Belagavi constituency was low at 55% as against 67% in the 2019 general elections. Though the results will not change much of the state’s political equations, it will have an impact on three prominent party faces — B S Yediyurappa, DK Shivakumar and Siddaramaiah. All had aggressively campaigned as they are eager to win seats to prove their stature. Yediyurappa would want to win all three seats to silence his detractors. The pressure is on Shivakumar, hoping to make a strong comeback since his party faced a humiliating defeat in the bypolls for Sira and RR Nagar last year. Siddaramaiah would like to re-emerge as an Ahinda (Kannada acronym for minorities, backward classes, and Dalits) leader. If the Congress wins at least two of three seats in these bypolls, it will get ammunition to attack the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-bypolls-parties-wait-with-bated-breath-on-counting-day/articleshow/82352046.cms||---

Sreedharan was able to bag a sizeable number of postal votes and was able to maintain a lead when the EVMs were opened. Reports coming from Palakkad indicate that Sreedharan was able to garner votes from two wards where Congress won in the December local body polls. Sreedharan on expected grounds got more votes than two of the other candidates from the traditional rivals. Incidentally, the exit polls had predicted a very close fight between the Congress candidate Shafi Parambil and Sreedharan and the Left's candidate placed at third position. In the 2016 Assembly polls, when Parambil won, the then BJP candidate had finished second.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/metroman-e-sreedharan-leads-with-2000-votes/articleshow/82352124.cms||---
