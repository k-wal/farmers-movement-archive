Dhaka will buy another 40 to 50 million doses of the Chinese vaccine.

In recent days, suppliers have been arbitrarily cancelling contracts, sometimes giving 5-litre or 8-litre ones while being paid for 10-litre containers.

Deaths also remained over 4,000 for the second day in a row. Overall, the day saw 3,62,720 cases and 4,136 Deaths. Comparable international data collated by WHO shows that for three consecutive days India has remained the largest contributor of the global caseload of fresh cases. Since May 10 fresh cases reported from India have remained over 50% of the world's total cases. This means that the combined total of fresh cases reported from the rest of the world is now less than fresh cases reported from India. The past three days have also seen over a third of global deaths being reported from India. The data also shows that at present India is by far the world's worst-affected country in both covid cases as well as deaths. While fresh cases touched 3.5 lakh in India, Brazil the world's second-worst in daily cases, reported 25,200 new infections. The tally was 22,261 for the USA and a little over 18,000 for France and Iran. Many Indian states are reporting more cases than these countries. While the daily deaths crossed 4,000 mark for India, the latest 'new deaths' data for any other country has not crossed 1,000 mark. State-wise data shows that Wednesday's tally for both Maharashtra and Kerala crossed 40,000 while cases reported from Karnataka were slightly below that mark. Tamil Nadu also reported a little over 30,000 cases. These four states are reporting more daily cases than any other country. Fresh cases reported from Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal were slightly over 20,000 while UP and Rajasthan reported between 15,000 and 18,000 cases. Overall, 13 states reported over 10,000 cases while the count was between 5,000 and 10,000 for five and 1000 to 5,000 for another six states and UTs. There are twelve states that reported over a hundred deaths on Wednesday. With 816 fatalities in the last 24 hours, Maharashtra is the top contributor in this tally and is followed by Karnataka which reported 517 deaths.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/3-5-lakh-fresh-covid-cases-toll-over-4k-for-2nd-day-in-a-row/articleshow/82590095.cms||---
---||India||In ‘suitable cases’, go for house arrest, not jail: Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday turned down social activist Gautam Navalakha’s plea for grant of default bail in the alleged Elgar Parishad-Maoist link case even as it batted for embracing the international practice of putting accused under house arrest in “deserving and suitable” cases as means to decongest prisons. Navalakha, who approached the apex court after the Bombay high court rejected his plea for bail in the case, had sought default bail on the ground that NIA had failed to file its chargesheet within the prescribed time limit of 90 days. He pleaded that the period for which he was under house arrest should be counted as part of judicial custody while deciding the custody period. NIA, however, contended that the period of 34 days of Navlakha’s house arrest between August 29 and October 1, 2018, cannot be included in the period of detention. A bench of Justices UU Lalit and K M Joseph held that an accused under house arrest should be treated as being under custody for estimating the duration of detention. However, the justices refused to treat Navlakha’s 34 days of house arrest as part of judicial custody on the ground that the orders of the Delhi High Court and Supreme Court pertaining to his house arrest were not passed under Section 167 of the Criminal Procedure Code. But while turning down Navlakha’s plea, the bench made a strong pitch for following the practice followed in many countries of putting the accused under house arrest instead of sending them to jail in “deserving and suitable” cases. “We observe that under Section 167 in appropriate cases, it will be open to courts to order house arrest. As to its employment, without being exhaustive, we may indicate criteria like age, health condition and antecedents of the accused, nature of the crime, need for other forms of custody and the ability to enforce the terms of house arrest. We would also indicate under Section 309 that judicial custody being custody ordered, subject to following the criteria, the courts will be free to employ it in deserving and suitable cases,” the bench said. In India, the concept of house arrest has its roots in laws providing for preventive detention like Section 5 of the National Security Act. But there is no mention of house arrest under Criminal Procedure Code. Referring to advantages of the practice of accused being put under house arrest, the court said it will lead to avoidance of overcrowding of prisons and also save cost of running them. “There is tremendous amount of overcrowding in jails in India. Secondly, a very large sum (Rs 6818.1 crore) was the budget on prisons,” the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/in-suitable-cases-go-for-house-arrest-not-jail-supreme-court/articleshow/82590990.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

The bloc of 12 opposition parties and leaders also urged Modi to repeal the controversial farm laws to save the “annadatas” and free them to grow food for the country — a reference to the ongoing protests which have exposed farmers to infections. They also demanded that the PM stop the Central Vista project and divert its budget to procuring vaccines and oxygen, give all jobless Rs 6,000 per month and provide free foodgrain to the needy. The letter was signed by Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, JD(S) leader H D Deve Gowda, NCP president Sharad Pawar, chief ministers Uddhav Thackeray, Mamata Banerjee, M K Stalin and Hemant Soren, SP leader Akhilesh Yadav, RJD chief Tejashwi Yadav, CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury and CPI leader D Raja. The letter also urged the PM to “invoke compulsory licensing to expand domestic vaccine production, spend budgetary allocation of Rs 35,000 crore for vaccines, release all money held in the unaccounted private trust fund PM Cares to buy more vaccines, oxygen and medical equipment required”. In a caustic jibe, the grouping told Modi, “Though it has not been the practice of your office or government, we would appreciate a response to our suggestions in the interests of India and our people.” It said the opposition had repeatedly suggested to the government various measures to deal with the pandemic but they were rejected or ignored, “compounding the situation to reach such an apocalyptic human tragedy”. Tagging the letter, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh tweeted, “A joint appeal from the opposition to your humanity and democratic spirit (whatever is left of it). United, India can defeat Covid-19. Only if you listen to ‘Kaam ki Baat’, instead of imposing ‘Mann ki Baat’. Also, please ask your ministers to work, not troll."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/get-vax-give-them-free-to-all-oppn/articleshow/82591581.cms||---

Until now, private hospitals had been asking patients and their families to arrange tocilizumab, a drug which is used to bring inflammation markers and cytokine storm under control. Cytokines storm is a auto-immune response where the body starts to attack its own cells and tissues rather than just fighting off the virus But its availability has become a concern in India amid the second wave. Officials told TOI that the highest allocation for states out of 45,000 tocillizumab, each of 80 mg dose, would go towards Maharashtra (6,380). This will be followed by Karnataka (6,150), Kerala (4,500), Uttar Pradesh (2,420) and Rajasthan (2,185). Delhi is getting an additional 980 vials "Earlier, on April 30th, we had allocated 9900 vials of Tocilizumab 200 mg already to various states and UTs. This is a fresh allocation based on demands and acquired through donation," said a senior health official. "The distribution is being done to states looking at the recent case load in the states," he added. Centre would keep 5,000 vials for its disposal for allocation at health instutions under ministry of health and family welfare. 2,500 each would be reserved with pharmaceutical and health ministries. Officials also said that states have been requested to prevent black marketing and also ensure that drug is used judiciously according to treatment protocol in clinical guidance. The Centre also asked state governments to nominate a nodal officer for management of allocated stocks and convey details to a monitoring cell for Tocilizumab under chairperson of National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/private-hospitals-must-source-tocilizumab-from-state-governments/articleshow/82591493.cms||Rohan Dua

BJP’s IT cell head Amit Malviya said that on February 24, Mamata wrote a letter to the Prime Minister seeking that states be allowed to procure vaccines on their own. “Now that the central government has decentralised the process, CMs like her, unnerved by the responsibility, are passing the buck back to the Centre,” he said. Banerjee on Wednesday wrote to the PM, urging to ‘speedily import vaccines’ from global manufacturers. She suggested the PM to ‘encourage world and national players (vaccine manufacturers) to open up franchise operations’. She said her government was ready to provide land and all required support for manufacturing vaccines. After opening up vaccination for the 18-44 years group, state governments are to procure vaccines directly from the manufacturers. About 10 crore people in West Bengal and 140 crore people in the country need vaccination, but only a microscopic percentage has been covered, Banerjee said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bjp-digs-out-mamatas-february-letter-says-shes-passing-the-buck/articleshow/82592396.cms||---

The defence ministry on Wednesday said 1 lakh manual and 50,000 automatic Oxycare systems, along with non-rebreather masks, will be procured under the sanction accorded by the PM Cares Fund. “The Oxycare system delivers supplemental oxygen based on the SpO2 levels and prevents the person from sinking into a state of hypoxia which can be fatal,” said an official. “Developed by the Defence Bio-Engineering & ElectroMedical Laboratory for soldiers posted at extreme high-altitude areas, the system optimises the oxygen consumption to effectively increase the endurance of portable oxygen cylinders,” he added. The robust ‘Oxycare’ system, which has been developed for operation in ‘field area’ conditions, can be used at Covid care centres and hospitals as well as in homes. “DRDO has transferred the technology to multiple industries in India which will be producing the Oxycare systems,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/government-to-buy-1-5-lakh-units-of-drdo-o2-system-for-rs-322-crore/articleshow/82592513.cms||---

Mrs P, a retired bank employee, had to be hospitalised for almost a month under the supervision of a Mumbai psychiatrist. The couple’s next nightmare began after she was discharged. While her bank’s group mediclaim covered a portion of her medical expenses, her own policy continues to reject the Rs 3.5 lakh claim, exposing the confounding absence of clarity and uniformity on mental illness insurance. The ongoing pandemic has catalysed a range of mental disorders — from mild anxiety to suicidal behaviour requiring hospitalisation. As independent insurance agent, Vickram Thakkar says, “Before lockdown, we used to get six-seven claims for mental illness in a year. Now we are getting seven-eight claims in a month.” Several insurers, though, continue to try and get around the 2017 law which establishes parity between physical and mental illness. Already traumatised, families find themselves confronting both stigma and ignorance when it comes to claims approval. Because a mental illness is not as tangible as, say, a heart surgery, insurers might question the need for hospitalisation. “But why on earth would I send my child into a psychiatric hospital just to be able to claim insurance?” asks Natasha M, the mother of a 27-year-old with severe obssessive compulsive disorder (OCD), bordering on psychosis. Her son’s compulsions got exacerbated because of being locked in a small flat, leading to bouts of aggression. He had to be hospitalised. When the patient’s or the family’s safety is at stake, hospitalisation is necessary, say psychiatrists. Insurers though counter that several claimants may not have disclosed pre-existing conditions. “Insurance is a business at the end of the day,” says the head of a private insurance company. “And it’s a business that runs on good faith. But we do give an opportunity to the insured individual to tell the full story and work with that.” Last month, the Delhi high court rapped a national insurance company that refused to honour the claim of a young woman who spent a month in a Gurugram hospital for schizoaffective disorder. In her judgment, Justice Pratibha Singh stated: “The present petition raises issues of grave public importance. In the modern world, mental health is as important as physical health… While physical illnesses are manifested in the human body in some form, mental illnesses do not always have visible physical manifestations. However, mental illnesses can also be debilitating and destructive. The recent pandemic also highlights this beyond any doubt. “Circumstances leading to patients requiring isolation, healthy persons being subjected to lock-downs, work from home conditions, loss of employment leading to lack of confidence for long durations have led to several mental problems... Availability of insurance for mental disabilities or conditions is, therefore, not only important but is an essential need.” “People should know that they can claim, and they should claim,” says Dr Soumitra Pathare, director of Centre for Mental Health Law and Policy in Pune. “This artificial distinction between physical and mental illness needs to go. An illness is an illness. All debates on this are over.” And yet, mental health advocates say much needs to change in the way insurance products are designed in the future. “Because the social ramifications on the person as well as the family are so qualitatively different,” says Dr Nirmala Srinivasan, founder of the Families’ Alliance on Mental Illness. “Practitioners like insurers should also understand this. They should not have such long exemption period for pre-existing conditions.” She suggests they should also cover ongoing treatment, whether it is counselling, therapy or ECT treatments, because sometimes hospitalisation is not required if medication is given early enough.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pandemic-catalyses-mental-disorders-but-insurers-try-to-fight-off-claims/articleshow/82592610.cms||---

Families of the teachers are worried about the pandemic and how it may impact their lives. Tens of teachers are testing positive for the disease on an almost everyday basis. It may not be wise to exclude the teaching community from the list of frontline warriors,” said Simhachalam. “We request the government to give the vaccine to all teachers, considering the risk associated with their duties.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Covid supply logjam pushes up fish price at city markets||KOLKATA: Suspension of local train services has hit the city's fish supply. Majority of fish markets in south Kolkata that depend on supply from Namkhana, Kakdwip, Canning and Diamond Harbour have been badly hit for non-plying of trains. Similarly, north Kolkata markets have been affected as supply from Barasat and Basirhat has become scarce. The results have been obvious. Whatever supply of fish is coming to Kolkata markets by road has made Bengali’s delicate dish dearer. Going by market rates, prices of fishes have gone up by Rs 50-Rs 150 a kg depending on their variety. While prices of katla and rohu have gone up by Rs 50 a kg, other varieties like parse, pabda, tyangra and pomfret have become dearer by Rs 100 per kg. Raja Dutta, a retired government officer and a resident of Regent Estate, has been a regular to Baghajatin wholesale fish market. However, Dutta these days is upset because of a scarcity that has hit this wholesale market that supplies fish to other neighbouring markets. “Firstly, I don’t get the variety that I used to get even a fortnight ago. And then, whatever fish is available, the price is getting out of bounds for us,” Dutta complained. Ajit Maity, a fish trader at Baghajatin market, conceded that scarce supply of fish from various parts of South 24 Parganas has made the price dearer. “The supply was getting disturbed with the rising Covid graph. Now that the train services have been non-functional, the price is bound to rise further,” Maity said. Amar Das, a fish trader at Lake Market, also warned about a further rise in prices of all varieties of fish if the train services were not resumed. “We largely depend on supply of fish from Kakdwip and Canning. Now the supply has been reduced to a great extent for non-plying of trains. Whatever supply is coming by road, we are buying at a premium,” Das said. According to Bijon Maity, the secretary of the Fishermen’s Association (South 24 Parganas), transportation crisis has triggered a major scarcity of supply of fish as there was a temporary ban on fishing due to the existing breeding season. “We need to wait for the train services to resume to bring down the prices of fish in Kolkata markets,” Maity said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cov-supply-logjam-pushes-up-fish-price-at-city-mkts/articleshow/82584993.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Heritage hotel turns into Covid care facility||KOLKATA: The Lalit Great Eastern, one of the oldest luxury hotels in Asia, turned into a Covid care centre on Wednesday. The 100-bed satellite centre attached to AMRI Hospitals will cater to mildly symptomatic Covid-19 patients. Struggling to tide over hospital bed crisis, many hospitals are converting hotels, stadia and community halls into Covid facilities. But this is the first hotel with heritage legacy, which had hosted Queen Elizabeth and American author Mark Twain, to turn into a Covid facility. Patient admission began late Wednesday afternoon with 24X7 nursing care, doctors, oxygen support, Wi-Fi and customised diet plans based on the advice of dieticians. If the need arises, the number of beds can be scaled up. “We are proud to have opened our satellite centre at The Lalit Great Eastern, which is one of the most prestigious and heritage hotels, where mildly symptomatic patients will be able to stay comfortably. The facility is equipped with round-the-clock nursing support and doctors on site, along with all emergency medicines, oxygen support and necessary consumables. This is the fourth hotel that we have converted into a satellite facility as part of our endeavour to fight the virus and treat Covid patients,” said Rupak Barua, Group CEO, AMRI Hospitals. The hotel, during the lockdown last year, had offered its rooms to accommodate doctors at the behest of the state government. This time, while one of the wings have been converted into a Covid care centre, the other wing that has separate entry and exit can continue to cater to guests. “AMRI Hospitals was the first to approach us right after health secretary met the hotel representatives. Looking at the gravity of this unprecedented situation, we readily agreed to support and play our role the way we did by accommodating doctors during the lockdown,” said Dipil Mishra, general manager at The Lalit Great Eastern. At the facility, AMRI Hospitals has also introduced Dozee Pro, the latest in remote patient monitoring system. The Dozee Pro is a mat, connected to sensors and a pulse oximeter, which is installed under the mattress of each bed, and will help monitor the vitals of all the patients. The system notes changes in a patient’s vitals through the patient’s physical vibrations and sends out signals to a laptop at the nursing station, from where nurses and doctors will be able to keep an eye on the condition of a patient.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/heritage-hotel-turns-into-covid-care-facility/articleshow/82585101.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Karwal died on Wednesday, while Kumar breathed his last on Tuesday. The 58-year-old, who featured in the Economic Times India’s Most Powerful CEOs list in 2004 had a successful stint at Onida, LG, Philips and Electrolux before starting Milagrow, which makes Made in India robots with “human tech” to help households and small businesses automate basic daily chores like floor cleaning. An alumnus of IMT Ghaziabad, Karwal is credited with building a strong base for LG Electronics in India after the Korean white goods giant’s previous attempts did not show promising results. He then moved to head Philips and Electrolux Kelvinator. He also had a stint in Reliance Digital as its founder CEO. Karwal, who grew up in Ambala, is survived by his wife Shobha, his former colleague at Onida, where he started his career in the mid-1980s, and children. He started Milagrow in 2007, which started as a management consulting firm, but ventured into tablets and robots. In 2019, he was ready to call it quits but last year’s Covid-induced lockdown resulted in a sales boom for the company, with the demand remaining steady even in subsequent months. Mohan Kumar, the 53-year-old head of Michelin India died of Covid-19 on Tuesday. A graduate from NIT Trichy with a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering, he studied at IIM Bangalore. He joined Michelin India in July 2005 as the head of sales for passenger car tyres and since then had assumed various leadership roles both in Michelin India and Michelin USA. Since December 2017, Mohan had been head of business of Michelin for India and the SAARC countries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/milagrow-ceo-michelin-india-chief-die-of-covid/articleshow/82585832.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Doctors join hands to start Covid facility for underprivileged||KOLKATA: A group of doctors and professionals in south Kolkata is starting a community-level intervention centre to provide immediate relief to patients needing oxygen support and other interventions like antibiotics and steroids. The doctors are in talks with a school in central Kolkata and start a 35-40 bed facility in a couple of days. The centre will provide low-cost care to Covid patients. Apart from safe home services under the supervision of doctors, it will also provide OPD services as well. “The idea came when we started witnessing shortage of medicines and oxygen. Some doctors decided to start intervention services to those suffering from Covid,” said Atanu Saha, senior consultant and cardiac surgeon with Rabindranath Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences. Soon they roped in a team of doctors from different hospitals and nursing homes. “We got in touch with some businessmen who were ready to fund the venture. Since we are catering to the low-income group, we will need to crowdfund the seed money,” said Amit Mukherjee, a healthcare professional attached to the group. According to Diptendra Sarkar, surgeon and one of the founders of Covid Care Network, such facilities run by doctors are need of the hour. “Experts have always cautioned against providing oxygen to a patient indiscriminately without any professional supervision. Any facility that is between a safe home and a support hospital or modified field hospital run under doctors’ supervision can provide relief to patients to a large extent,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/docs-join-hands-to-start-cov-facility-for-underprivileged/articleshow/82585378.cms||Rohit Khanna

Close to 360 deliveries took place at Gosha Hospital in old town area in the past month, of which around 30 women tested positive. The hospital also reported 10 deaths, most of which happened due to shortness of breath before delivery or after the patient was put on ventilator support. “While 15 pregnant women who tested positive were sent to home isolation, another 15 were found to be asymptomatic or having mild symptoms. All of them delivered safely and both mother and child are doing fine,” Gosha hospital superintendent Dr Hemalatha Devi said. She added that no casualties were reported last year during the first wave, but this year around 10 have died while undergoing treatment. The positive cases came to light when tests were conducted on the women at the time of admission. Hospital staff said the mother and child are separated for two weeks in such cases to prevent the baby from getting infected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/many-pregnant-women-test-ve-before-delivery/articleshow/82584782.cms||Siva G
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Dev lends a helping hand to Cov-affected families with free takeaway service||KOLKATA: Rumpa Saha is awaiting her RT-PCR report while her husband Gobinda tested positive last Sunday. On Wednesday afternoon, she was relieved when Biki Saha from an NGO delivered a meal for her husband to their Devendra Nagar residence. Her neighbour Jewel Chakraborty, whose wife succumbed to cardiac arrest 13 days ago, is also Covid positive. He, too, received a free meal. It was later in the day that both came to know that their meals were delivered as part of a unique initiative by Tollywood actor-turned-Ghatal MP Dev. Along with members of the Sardarni Paramjit Kaur Medical Trust, Dev is offering free takeaway service to Covid-positive patients from his own restaurant, Tolly Tales. In the pipeline is a free Oxygen langar service. On Wednesday, the meal delivery was availed by some 70-odd people. Dev’s assistance during the pandemic is not new, however. Last year, he had helped migrant workers from Kashmir and students from Russia and Dubai return home. This year, he has relentlessly been trying to organize medicines and oxygen and helped admit over 100 patients to hospitals. Dev shared his idea of providing free takeaway meal service with friend Gagandeep Singh. “He is the owner of Xrong Place, the restobar and lounge opposite my restaurant. Both Tolly Tales and Xrong Place are shut now. So we are using both these kitchens to prepare the meals. We started the initiative on Tuesday with 50 meals. If needed, we can send out 500 meals a day. We will soon set up a free oxygen langar in association with one of the gurdwaras in Kolkata,” Dev said. According to Singh, who set up a trust in his mother’s name after she passed away a month ago, the free takeaway meal service is a result of the “strength of Dev and his charitable motives”, along with their available infrastructure. The meal being provided is vegetarian as of now and includes rice, lentils, paneer, a vegetable dish and salad. Depending on the demand, tables are being laid outside the restaurants and representatives of patients need to show the Covid-positive reports to collect meals. “My business partners Vikas Parasrampuria and Mahavir Banka have also backed our initiative. On Wednesday, we got calls for 60 meals. But more people turned up and we prepared the meals at Xrong Place too,” Singh said. Biki Saha, the treasurer of an NGO called Active Youth, collected RT-PCR reports of 20 Covid-positive patients from north Kolkata and submitted them on Wednesday. “I collected the reports and personally did the door-to-door deliveries in Rajarhat, Nagerbazar, Baguiati and Dakhinpara,” he said. Chakraborty is relieved to have got the meal. “I lost my wife and am Covid positive. I have isolated myself from my son. My sister-in-law too is Covid positive. This initiative has been helpful,” he said.  Soon, the oxygen langar service will be functional. “When my mother was unwell, I saw how essential oxygen support was for her. It is unfortunate that in a superpower like India, getting something as basic as oxygen is so difficult now. Gurudwaras across Kolkata have space where people can come with their cars and bikes to avail oxygen support under medical supervision. Our oxygen langar will begin within a week,” Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dev-lends-a-helping-hand-to-cov-affected-families-with-free-takeaway-service/articleshow/82585440.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

These cabbies have put a transparent plastic partition between the rear and front seat, and carry out extensive sanitization after completion of each trip. A driver and a helper in PPE kits help the patient, even if s/he is alone. “There has been a slump in the number of commuters. We were looking for a purpose in this altered situation. We realised that people are distressed, but ambulances are only increasing the distress with their hefty demand. There is a demand-supply gap for which ambulance-service gets costlier, particularly for ferrying Covid patients.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Stocking, self-medication trigger antibiotic shortage||KOLKATA: Unchecked stocking and self-medications have led to a scarcity of some drugs like Doxycycline – a common antibiotic – that is now being extensively used in Covid treatment. Although there has been no randomised controlled trial to define the effectiveness of Doxycycline in treating Covid-19, some studies have shown that the drug reduces the replication of the virus inside the body and enhances immunomodulation. “In Covid, there is an inciting of the immune system. Doxycycline helps in immune modulation, reduction in replication of the virus and has a better viral clearance characteristic. It is an old antibiotic that is used in a wide range of spectrum, including treatment of pneumonia,” said Kaushik Chaudhuri, senior pulmonologist at Beliaghata ID Hospital. Doctors said with a number of patients now being treated under home consultation and names of medicines like Doxycyclin, Ivermectin, Remdesivir and Tocilizumab out in public, a number of people have also started stocking these medicines and some have even started home medication, leading to a crisis in the market. The governm-ent had to intervene and now the drugs are only available on production of a doctor’s prescription. “Some people are even taking steroids even before the oxygen saturation drops below 94. Once on early use of steroids and antibiotics, it pulls the temperature down, giving patients a sense of security that they no longer need to visit a hospital. This is leading them to end up at the hospital much later,” said Saswati Sinha, critical care specialist at AMRI Hospitals. Incidentally, Doxycycline has been a primary drug for veterinary doctors over the past several years for treating many diseases like tick fever, anaplasma and Babesia infections. Owing to its current usage in Covid-19 patients, the medicine is being dispensed under doctor’s prescription but most veterinary prescriptions are being turned down by the pharmacies, veterinary doctors claim. “For years, Doxycycline has been our go-to drug to treat a wide range of blood parasitic protozoan disease. Since it has been prescribed for Covid treatment, the drug is almost unavailable across the city,” said Subir Bhattacharya, a veterinarian. Another veterinarian, Kaushik Dutta, also raised a similar concern. In the absence of Doxycycline — a tablet — vets have started prescribing Imidazole, an injection, which vets opine is not as safe as the oral formulation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/stocking-self-medication-trigger-antibiotic-shortage/articleshow/82585467.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

She was saved by three locals who jumped into the water to save her. Archana Devi, a resident of the Kankarbagh area near TPS College in Patna, was brought to the Chowk police station where she told the police that she tried to kill herself after being thrown out of the house by her brother. She alleged that her brother, who is a lawyer, ill-treats her. Sub-inspector Sudeshwar Paswan, who was the first to reach the spot with a patrolling team, said the woman is a divorcee and has a 15-year-old daughter. “The woman’s father is a retired police inspector. She had alleged that she was kicked out of home by her brother and attempted to commit suicide by jumping in the water body in anger,” Paswan said. Chowk police station SHO Gaurishankar Gupta said the Kankarbagh police station was contacted to trace the woman’s house and her family members and inform them about the incident. “Her family members later reached Chowk after which she was handed over to them. It seems the woman is a little mentally unstable,” he said. Gupta said it was not clear how she managed to reach Mangal Talab from Kankarbagh amid the lockdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/thrown-out-of-city-home-woman-tries-to-drown-herself/articleshow/82584117.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Instances have been reported in Vijayawada of corporate hospitals facing oxygen shortage with delay in the arrival of tankers and police having to arrange cylinders. The district administration has deployed seven teams to track oxygen production, demand and transport facility. These teams work round-the-clock and coordinate with hospitals. L Sivashankar, joint collector of Krishna district, said, “The special teams will speak with hospital administrations and enquire about their oxygen demand and track their orders. The teams will coordinate with oxygen manufacturers and ensure supply on time.” Meanwhile, Andhra Pradesh has adopted a multi-pronged approach for oxygen supply chain management, from transportation and storage to local supply and consumption, said principal secretary, health and family welfare department, Anil Kumar Singhal. Speaking to the media on Wednesday, Singhal said oxygen is currently being transported through 78 tankers compared to 54 tankers a month ago. “This has improved the transportation capacity to 590 metric tonnes from 350 MT a month ago. The health department could reduce the turnaround time in oxygen supply to hospitals,” said Singhal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/seven-teams-to-track-o2-supply-in-krishna/articleshow/82584256.cms||Venu Lanka

A Covid care centre maintained by Ramesh Hospitals at the Hotel Swarna Palace was gutted in a fire on August 9, 2020. Altogether 11 Covid-19 patients were killed. In order to ensure there is no repeat of the incident, officials have turned their focus to verifying fire safety at corporate hospitals. Special teams of the fire safety wing of the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) have started inspecting each hospital that is providing inpatient services and testing the efficacy of its fire safety equipment. Teams led by regional fire officer T Uday Kumar have been conducting a series of inspections for the last ten days and initiating action against hospitals found ignoring the fire safety measures. “As Covid-19 cases are increasing, many hospitals have turned their hospitals into Covid-19 special wards. Many hospitals increased the bed strength to provide emergency medical aid. Hospitals are jampacked with patients and this is the time when we have to focus on safety measures. A fire NOC is mandatory for hospitals and they have to maintain devices properly. We are testing extinguishers and water guns in hospitals. Alternate escape route is mandatory as it saves lives during fire accidents. We have noticed a few hospitals are not replacing fire extinguishers after the expiry date and instead taking the safety of patients for granted,” Uday Kumar said. VMC commissioner Prasanna Venkatesh has directed the fire wing to initiate stringent action against hospitals that are ignoring patients’ safety.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/vmc-inspects-fire-safety-systems-in-hosps/articleshow/82584836.cms||Venu Lanka

The decision was taken by the state cabinet on Tuesday in order to increase the availability of ambulances in rural areas amid the Covid-19 pandemic. In every block, two persons belonging to the Scheduled Castes/Tribes or Extremely Backward Classes (EBC) will be provided with the grants to purchase ambulance. Transport minister Sheela Kumari on Wednesday held a meeting with the district transport officers (DTOs) in the presence of department secretary Sanjay Kumar Agarwal to review the ‘special ambulance scheme’. The minister directed the DTOs to implement it in a transparent manner. Agarwal said in the present situation it has become necessary to increase the availability of ambulances in each block, so that the transport facility can be provided to the infected and sick persons living in rural areas to reach the hospitals or health centres for treatment. “Under the scheme, there will be two ambulances in each of the 534 blocks and a total of 1,068 vehicles can be bought with the funds allotted. Applications for this scheme will be filled by May 16 and interested beneficiary can apply online on the transport department’s official website,” he said. He said those who applied earlier are not required to submit fresh applications. “They only have to submit their option in writing to the BDO that they want to avail the benefits under this scheme,” Agarwal said. According to the transport department, all the ambulances will be equipped with oxygen and basic medical facilities like stretcher and first-aid kit. People who avail the ambulance service will pay as per the rates fixed by the health department. Under the MGPY, over 36,000 people have already been provided vehicles such as autorickshaws and e-rickshaws.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/50-subsidy-to-buy-ambulance/articleshow/82584341.cms||Faryal Rumi

The consignment includes 5 lakh Covishiled and 1.14 lakh Covaxin doses. So far, the state has received a total of 9.54 lakhs vaccines for the young population and 2.35 lakh of them have been inoculated in the four days. Pandey also said the state got 92 oxygen concentrators of five litres capacity each from the Centre on Wednesday. So far, 2430 concentrators of five litres and another 1500 concentrators of ten litres have been given to the nine medical college and hospitals in Bihar. IndiGo’s flight (6E-6112) landed at Patna airport at 1.20pm on Wednesday from Pune, carrying 49 boxes of Covishield vaccine, which were carried in refrigerated vans under police escort from the airport to the state vaccine storage centre at the Nalanda Medical College Hospital- Patna (NMCH-P). Earlier on May 6, the airlines brought the Covaxin consignment from Bharat Biotech in Hyderabad. “Today, 42 boxes containing 5,00,000 doses of COVID vaccine arrived at Patna Airport from Pune by Indigo Airlines flight. The consignment was handed over to the state government officials in the quickest possible time (sic),” tweeted the Patna airport official handle on Wednesday.

Owaisi on Wednesday tweeted: “In light of lockdown in Telangana, I appeal to people of Telangana that they offer their Eid prayers at home. I request you all to stay safe and adhere to Covid-19 protocol.” Every year, Muslims offer prayers in huge congregations at idgahs, Mecca Masjid at Charminar and Jama Masjid on the occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr. This time, Eid-ul-Fitr will be celebrated on Friday as the Shawwal crescent was not sighted on Wednesday. In view of the pandemic, congregational Eid prayers were not offered last year too. Owaisi said Muslim Ulema have taken a collective decision that in view of the lockdown and the government order for closure of all the places of worship to check the spread of coronavirus, ‘namaz-e-eid’ should be offered at home. The MP said the lockdown will hit poor hard. “I have been against lockdowns but this is a high court order and the government has also issued a GO,” he said. The MP appealed to the people to make a special supplication during their Eid prayers at home for an end to the pandemic for the sake of humanity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/offer-eid-prayers-at-home-owaisi/articleshow/82587787.cms||Roushan Ali

From video content (including some on YouTube) to e-books, the department’s Bihar Education Project Council (BEPC), in collaboration with the UNICEF, Bihar, has uploaded all study materials accordingly to the syllabus for classes I to XII. The initiative was taken to ensure that the students would continue with their studies even in the lockdown period. Education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary said the e-library has become operational for students and teachers. “Digital books and videos as per the syllabus for children from classes 1 to 12 are available on the website www.bepclots.bihar.gov.in and e-LoTS mobile app. Teachers, parents and children should make the most of e-library and kids should continue their studies,” he said. Sanjay Kumar, additional chief secretary (education), told this newspaper that the e-learning content was uploaded to the public domain on Wednesday, but the proposal for the same was passed by chief minister Nitish Kumar during the review meeting on May 10. “Apart from our own digital contents and videos, some open source materials have been added to the E-LoTS virtual platform to make the learning interesting for the kids,” he said. “Kids who have access to internet would be able to study on the web portal and mobile app. However, the department is finding ways to ensure that the large section of students who do not have the means should not be deprived from their studies owing to the lockdown,” Kumar said. BEPC state project director Sanjay Kumar Singh directed the district education officers and district programme officers to publicise about the digital contents and talk to teachers to help maximise its use among schoolchildren. From May 10, BEPC, in association with UNICEF-Bihar, restarted the educational programme on Doordarshan - ‘Mera Doordarshan Mera Vidyalaya’ for students of classes IX to XII. The decision has been taken to ensure that the students of government schools are not deprived from learning, as internet connectivity and access to e-learning material is a problem in rural and tribal areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/state-edu-dept-releases-digital-study-materials-for-schoolkids/articleshow/82584218.cms||Faryal Rumi

West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education on Wednesday said it is waiting for the state’s decision on holding the Class XII board examinations scheduled in June during the pandemic. The council had earlier announced that the HS exams would be held from June 15 to July 2. “Nothing is more important that children’s lives. We are waiting for the government’s decision on whether the exams can be held according to the scheduled time table or if they have to be pushed back or cancelled,” said Mahua Das, the president of the council. The council had, in April, said exams for Class XII students would be held at their respective schools, in a departure from the norm. Das said the council has taken necessary steps for the exams. “It depends on whether the Class X boards, scheduled to take place before the HS tests, are held or not,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/board-awaits-state-decision-on-conducting-madhyamik-hs/articleshow/82585047.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Nurses renew service-before-self pledge||KOLKATA: Some of them have been down with Covid infection, some have even lost their family members during the pandemic but none has quit the war against novel coronavirus. When the world was celebrating the International Nurses Day, the heroes in PPE kept themselves busy fighting the invisible enemy to protect patients in their care. Tending to gasping patients day in and day out for more than a year now has taken a toll on their physical and mental well-being. But they said they cannot afford to rest when their service is needed the most. Family life has become secondary to most. “I have seen so many patients gasping on hospitals beds in my entire career spanning three decades. While deaths upset me, I try to motivate myself thinking about the next patient we send home. While hours get longer at hospital, I have been sleeping alone in a separate room at home for more than a year now so that I don’t end up infecting my family members,” said Subrata Ghosh, nurse at CMRI. Six to eight hours in the PPE is not an easy job. They drink and eat little so that they will not need to visit the washroom during these long hours. “The PPE is suffocating but the discomfort is nothing compared to the suffering and anxiety Covid patients undergo,” Sutapa Chakraborty, another nurse at CMRI. The likes of Sayantani Banerjee, a nurse at Peerless, survived the infection in June last year. She was back on her toes on the very first day of ending her mandatory quarantine. “It is not only the long hours and the inability to give equal time to the family that has kept many under tremendous stress. But the sight of losing so many patients is a trauma, especially to the young nurses. We try to keep each other motivated by regular counselling,” said Mahua Maity, nursing superintendent at Calcutta Heart Clinic. She herself dons the PPE everyday to lead her team in the Covid ward. On Wednesday, Tripti Ray offered flowers to Florence Nightingale before rushing to the vaccination centre at the Infectious Diseases and Beliaghata General (ID&BG) Hospital. Ray was working at the Covid ward before the vaccination drive began. “Whether it is in the Covid ward or vaccinating people, I will go on doing my bit to defeat the virus,” said Ray.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/nurses-renew-service-before-self-pledge/articleshow/82585146.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

A video that went viral on Wednesday shows a teenage girl beating severely a few boys with slippers at the police outpost. She was being goaded to beat them more for sexually harassing her. As the video went viral, Bhojpur SP Rakesh Kumar Dubey ordered an inquiry. “I had asked the Sadar SDPO to verify the video. It was found to be genuine. I suspended the Dhobahan OP in-charge. After recording the statement of the girl, an FIR would be lodged against the accused,” Dubey said at a press conference. Sources said a minor girl of a village under Dhobahan OP area was returning home on Sunday after shopping when 4 youngsters sexually harassed her. Though some co-villagers saved her from them, the accused reached her home and allegedly threatened the family members not to lodge any complaint. But, later, when the girl’s family members approached the police, they were advised to hold a panchayat to settle the matter. And, on Tuesday, a panchayat was held at Dhobahan OP. Meanwhile, the SP has suspended 8 constables of the cross mobile posted at the Town police station and Nawada police station in Ara for dereliction of duty. They had failed to prevent gambling, betting and guessing games in their respective areas. Dubey said 11 persons were arrested for indulging in gambling activities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bhojpur-sp-suspends-cop-for-asking-a-girl-to-beat-accused/articleshow/82584121.cms||Praveen

---||Business||e-Invoicing driving up digitisation of supply-chain financing: CashFlo||Mumbai: Elevation Capital-backed supply chain finance start-up CashFlo has said that government mandate for small businesses to issue e-invoices under the GST laws has become a big enabler for digitisation of supply-chain financing. Speaking to TOI, CashFlo co-founder Ankur Bhageria said that the Covid restrictions have heightened the need for a digital financing platform and the firm has seen a 400% jump during March 2021 over the previous year. According to Bhageria, most corporates focus on financial support for their top 20-30 vendors, which leaves many of the smaller vendors such as logistics providers outside the scope of formal credit providers like banks. “Currently, vendor financing in India is around Rs 60,000 crore and is not even 10% of the total addressable market for supply chain financing,” said Bhageria. He estimates the total market to be around Rs 18 lakh crore based on the value of invoices raised by suppliers to businesses. “The biggest enabler has been the government mandate for e-invoices,” said Bhageria. The e-invoicing system under GST, which was introduced in October 2020, has been extended to all businesses with a turnover between Rs 50 crore and 100 crore from April 1, 2021. Supply-chain financing involves providing credit based on invoices that suppliers raise on large creditworthy companies. Banks have doing invoice financing for larger suppliers, but the smaller ones are not on their radar. Financing of suppliers enables them to increase their turnover and scale up rapidly. Unlike banks, CashFlo can lend to small businesses as the financing process is undertaken using technology. CashFlo’s platform combines full integration with TReDS — an electronic platform for facilitating the financing / discounting of trade receivables of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) through multiple financiers. It also uses artificial intelligence for facilitating and on-boards vendors digitally. Though it provides financing, CashFlo is not a lender but performs the role of a tech facilitator and enables multiple lenders including banks and corporates to provide credit to small businesses. The credit period ranges from 15 to 120 days. CashFlo works with India’s leading corporates across industries including most of India’s largest business houses such as Tata Group, Aditya Birla Group, Vedanta, Arvind Limited, Haldia Petrochemicals, and over 50,000 small businesses that supply to corporates. In 2019, the firm raised $3.3 million as part of series-A funding from Elevation Capital. The round also saw participation from angel investors. Founded in 2017 by former management consultants with BCG Bhageria and Dushyant Agarwal, the firm does business in 30 cities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/e-invoicing-driving-up-digitisation-of-supply-chain-financing-cashflo/articleshow/82587451.cms||Mayur Shetty

However, he has changed in the past one year. Along with his disproportionate weight gain, he now gets tired very easily, said his worried parents. They voiced their concern to a paediatrician about their child’s physical health. “With negligible exercise, children between 5 years and 15 years have been gaining three to five kilograms weight more than they should normally gain annually,” explained said Dr Bankim Parikh, paediatrician, Vadodara. And there are many others like Saahil who hardly got any physical exercise due to the restrictions imposed both by the government as well as Covid-wary parents. While the virus has not infected the adolescents physically, its ominous presence was enough to wreak havoc on their overall health, claim doctors.Many paediatricians are concerned about children facing health risks due to excessive weight gain during the pandemic period. “During the lockdown last year, the adolescents were stuck in their home for almost two-and-half months. Even after it was lifted, they hardly did any physical activities as the schools were closed and even sports clubs remained shut,” Dr Parikh told TOI.“It’s worrying as many such adolescents are becoming obese and it is going to be a major problem in near future as Covid restrictions won’t go away so soon,” Parikh said, adding that earlier only about 30 percent adolescents were found overweight, which in past one year has almost doubled to anywhere between 50 to 60 per cent. Surat-based paediatrician, Dr Parang Mehta blames the weight gain not only to lack of activity, but also to intermittent unregulated snacking. “Covid-wary parents do not let their children go out and while trying to keep them engaged indoors, they often use food as a lure. So, kids snack inappropriately while their physical activities get reduced — that leads to weight gain,” Mehta said. “While comparing children’s present weight with the one taken six months or a year ago, I observed that many have put on more weight. I have alerted the parents asking them to bring it under control,” he said. “Western lifestyle and food habits were already pushing up adolescents weight over the past few years. But the Covid situation has only accelerated this increase due to serious lack of physical activity . Children as young as 14 or 15 years are weighing 70kg, and if not controlled may lead to serious health complications at a very young age,” Dr Tushar Shah, executive board member, Academy of Paediatrics Gujarat said.(with inputs from Jay Pachchigar)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/kids-putting-on-weight-as-covid-hits-brake-on-exercise/articleshow/82582548.cms||Tushar Tere
---||Surat||Surat positivity rate falls to 2.8%||Surat: Even after it tamed the virus considerably, Surat Municipal Corporation has not given up its fight against the pandemic. Despite fresh cases and positivity rate coming down, the civic body is still aggressively continuing to test samples to break the chain of transmission. Interestingly, when the contagion was at its peak, number of samples that were being tested was not as high as it is now in the city. SMC officials said that the increasing testing is not only helping in identifying positive cases at the earliest but also keeping the positivity rate low. While cases had been consistently rising until April 24, average daily testing was around 28,000. Later, when the peak showed a downward trend and the state government announced partial lockdown, the average daily tests in the city crossed 30,000. “We have intensified testing because more number of people tested makes it easier for us to trace the virus,” said SMC commissioner Banchhanidhi Pani. “It has also helped in quick recovery from the second wave of the virus. Surat is the only city in the country with the least positivity rate of 2.8% and we want to bring it further down to less than 1%,” he claimed. “Our teams are actively surveying and combing vulnerable areas and containment zones and if we find somebody, who was reluctant to go out and test, to be positive during the random testing he or she is quarantined,” said another SMC official, adding that this arrests unknowing transmission of the virus. SMC has been rigorously testing those entering the city, industry workers and handcart owners and has so far conducted over 2.5 lakh rapid antigen test (RAT) at the entry points, of which 7,081 samples tested positive. Doctors in the city too have not let their guards down. “Bed availability has become easy, but ICU beds with ventilators are still occupied. So people should understand the ongoing seriousness and not become lax,” said Dr Nirmal Choraria, convenor of IMA Covid Action Committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/surat-positivity-rate-falls-to-2-8/articleshow/82582889.cms||Jay Pachchigar
---||Nagpur||READY FOR 3RD WAVE?||Nagpur: Warning of Covid-19 third wave in India as predicted by scientists, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Wednesday directed the Maharashtra government to keep its standard operating procedure (SOP) ready to tackle it. Adding that the third wave is likely to hit those in the age groups of 2-18 and 18-45 years, a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Avinash Gharote directed the government to plan strategy accordingly, and keep additional hospital beds with sufficient medicines and oxygen stock ready to meet the eventuality. The preparations should also include creation of neonatal and paediatric wards, jumbo hospitals, and temporary Covid care centres at marriage halls and open spaces, which should preferably be near the existing Covid-19 hospitals. The suggestions included school grounds, Kasturchand Park, Mankapur stadium, along with GMCH, IGGMCH, AIIMS and other hospitals. Similar arrangements should also be set up at various hospitals and public health centres (PHCs) in districts like Wardha, Akola, Bhandara and others along with taluka, gram panchayats and at places like steel plants in Vidarbha, the HC said. “We find that even though the situation regarding supply of essential drugs and oxygen has improved considerably, the authorities together with HC would have to prepare themselves for facing the predicted third wave. We request the government to decide and prepare SOP for treating such Covid patients if a third wave hits the state. Every collector under guidance of divisional commissioner should be ready with the strategy to tackle the pandemic,” the bench said. While hearing a suo motu PIL pleaded by amicus curiae Shreerang Bhandarkar, Bhanudas Kulkari, M Anil Kumar, Tushar Mandlekar, Nidhi Dayani and others, the judges, however, cautioned the authorities not to utilize commercial places as Covid hospitals as it’s likely to worsen the problem. Before adjourning the hearing till May 19, they asked the collector and NMC commissioner to update their website, providing details about availability of beds, oxygen and necessary drugs. “Regarding supply of oxygen, currently there’s no shortage either at Nagpur or in any other district in Vidarbha,” they said. Authorities told to comply with all earlier directives Pointing out that they had issued many directives from April 12 to May 7 in the PIL to fight Covid-19 pandemic, the bench directed the authorities to comply with them and file affidavits. “The respective government departments were asked to place on record their compliance reports in the nature of their affidavits-in-reply during all previous hearings. While some are indeed filed, many have not been filed and, therefore, it is not known whether those directives have been complied with or not till date,” the HC said. City cos added as respondents for CSR fundsThe bench directed adding many city-based companies as respondents in the PIL, along with Chandrapur collector, and issued notices to them through Vidarbha Industries Association (VIA). Their names were submitted by VIA for accessing CSR funds for Covid causes. The companies include Ashok Leyland, Diffusion Engineers, Divyansh Steel, Mecgale Pneumatics, Multi-organics, RC Plasto Tanks and Pipes, Sanvijay Rolling Engineering, SMS Limited, Zim Laboratories, Mahagenco and Mahatranco. Chandrapur collector told to inform on cos, CSR funds While hearing a PIL by former MP Naresh Pugalia, the bench directed Chandrapur collector to get all details of companies, including Mahagenco, which operate super thermal power station there and submit a report before next Wednesday. The details would include their unspent funds under the corporate social responsibility (CSR) head. Earlier, the collector informed about efforts made to tackle Covid pandemic in the district, but the judges told him to file an affidavit in this regard. “For mobilizing the resources for Covid cause from the corporate world, we’ve already made it clear in various orders passed in this PIL (No4/2020) about urgent need in this regard,” the justices said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ready-for-3rd-wave/articleshow/82587832.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

On the other hand, private bus operators are charging Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,500 per person. Many migrant labourers could be seen with their bags and baggage at bus stands of Tricity. Most of them have been complaining that they are out of job due to lockdown. The factories in which they worked are closed and their employers told them that ‘no work, no pay’. However, there are others who been earning from their tea stalls, ice-cream vends and roadside eateries. Ranjit Kmar, a resident of Madhubani in Bihar and living in Hallomajra, left the city last week. He said he used to sell ice-creams in the city, but due to the night curfew and weekend lockdown, he was forced to sit at home. Earlier, the administration imposed one-week night curfew and then extended the same. He had no other option, but to leave the city. He reached his native place by bus. Another person Inder Yadav, a resident of Chapra in Bihar, said he worked as a cook with a contractor, but due to lockdown and restrictions, he is left with no work and he booked bus tickets to his native place and would leave the city on Friday. Bablu Yadav, a private bus operator, said they are sending migrant laborers in a bus every day from Zirakpur and Ambala. The price of tickets for Lucknow is Rs 1,500 and Rs 2,500 for Patna per person. He said most of the passengers are from Bihar. Shahi Shankar Tiwari, president of the Purvanchal Vikas Mahasangh, said, “Private bus operators are looting poor labourers because most of the trains to UP and Bihar have been suspended by the railways, therefore, these bus operators are minting money.” Arvind Singh, a resident of Hallomajra, said he had sent a letter to the Prime Minister’s office and demanded resumption trains and received a reply from the railway ministry. The ministry assured him of introducing train services for stranded passengers and migrant labourers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pvt-bus-operators-in-tricity-fleece-poor-migrants-charge-rs-1500-to-rs-2k-per-person/articleshow/82585600.cms||Pawan Tiwari

In a regulatory filing, the company announced that “revenue and profitability will be impacted in line with the fall in volumes however the company is taking various cost optimisation measures to limit the adverse impact.”The reasons for the volume hit are two-fold. First: “the lockdowns enforced in various states / parts of the country coupled with disruption in the supply of oxygen for industrial use, demand and supply for vehicles and tractors is expected to be impacted, the notification said. This is exacerbated by the ongoing crunch in semiconductor supplies. “Global shortage of micro-processors (semiconductors) used in electronic control units(ECUs) fitted in different components / aggregates for vehicles continues to pose challenges,” the statement added.” Given the current situation, the company is “carefully reviewing the demand & supply situation and re-calibrating its operations to ensure optimal level of inventory at plants & dealerships,” said the statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/expect-volumes-to-be-lower-in-q1-fy22-mm/articleshow/82585986.cms||---

The minister said effective use of oxygen is the need of the hour in view of the shortage of allocation by the Centre. The government will construct 49 mini-oxygen plants across the state to handle the situation in coming months, Nani said. Led by Alla Nani, the Group of Ministers (GoM) on Covid-19 containment took stock of the latest situation in the state here on Wednesday. Senior officials explained to the GoM the measures initiated to handle the increasing number of cases. Speaking to the media, the minister said the oxygen monitoring committee in Nellore had saved about six metric tonnes by preventing unnecessary usage. “We are closely monitoring the situation and taking timely decisions. The government is determined to provide best possible healthcare to Covid-19 patients,” said Nani. He lashed out at TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu for spreading a false campaign with regard to Covid-19 vaccination in the state. He said that the entire allocation of vaccines including those purchased by the state is managed by the Centre and the state government does not have any leverage. Nani said the state government had given an open offer to Chandrababu Naidu to influence Bharat Biotech that is manufacturing Covaxin to get an additional quota. “Naidu depends on falsehood and lies. He never realises that people will not trust him anymore,” Nani said. The minister said the state government has requested both vaccine manufacturers to spare four crore doses for the state on the purchase model and had expressed its willingness to pay the costs fixed by the Centre. The vaccine manufacturers had responded stating that the allocation would be made based on the Centre’s recommendations, Nani said, adding that chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy has requested the Prime Minister to allocate at least 910 metric tonnes of oxygen to the state as its active caseload has touched 1.9 lakh. The minister said that the Centre is giving just 590 MT of oxygen, which is inadequate for its current needs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/govt-plans-mini-oxygen-plants-across-the-state/articleshow/82584190.cms||Samdani MN
---||Vijayawada||GGH to streamline admission system after allegations of bribe||GUNTUR: The district administration has decided to streamline admission and discharge of Covid-19 patients in Government General Hospital (GGH), Guntur, following complaints about the staff seeking bribe for allocation of beds. The district administration has deployed additional teams of data entry operators to GGH to maintain records of patients. The district administration had sacked two employees and one contractual staffer for demanding bribes from patients. Responding to complaints about chaotic conditions prevailing in GGH, in-charge minister Ch Sriranganatha Raju directed district collector Vivek Yadav to take immediate corrective measures. The minister said that he would visit GGH to review the conditions shortly. Subsequently, Yadav deputed joint collector Prasanthi to GGH to set things right. After going through the procedures followed for admissions and discharges, the joint collector expressed serious displeasure at the administration in GGH. The joint collector asked the GGH administration to register every admission, discharge and death with medical reports. “Admissions should be made only through reference from the admission committee. No one should gain entry into the hospital without the committee’s recommendation,” she said. The joint collector also directed junior doctors to interact with patients during their visits to the wards to find out if anyone had to pay bribes to GGH staff. “We will not spare anyone if they are found indulging in corrupt practices,” said the joint collector. The joint collector also asked the superintendent to monitor the situation. The joint collector said medical reports of patients including blood pressure, pulse rate and oxygen levels should be updated to the system every day and linked to the 104 control room. The joint collector said that maintaining records of discharges would help speed up admissions. Superintendent Dr Prabhavathi, assistant collector Subham Bhansal and other senior officials were present during the joint collector’s visit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ggh-to-streamline-admission-system-after-allegations-of-bribe/articleshow/82584298.cms||---

Its new shareholders will be able to voice their opinions only on the board. Bidders would also have to clear the RBI’s ‘fit and proper’ criteria before picking up a stake in the LIC-controlled bank. Speaking to TOI, IDBI Bank MD & CEO Rakesh Sharma said, “While the bank may have new promoters, it will continue to be run by its management and board according to its policies. The new shareholders may have some focus area, but they will have to come through the board.” Last week, the Cabinet had approved strategic disinvestment in the transfer of management control in IDBI Bank. Even as the government has announced its stake sale, IDBI Bank is going ahead with obtaining shareholder approval for raising capital. According to Sharma, this enabling resolution is an annual exercise so that the bank can access markets without delay. “Our capital adequacy is quite comfortable. For the 8-10% growth we have projected, our current capital is adequate for two years. However, Private banks typically have a capital adequacy ratio of 15-16% and our capital adequacy ratio is 15.6% — we have decided to depend on our capital,” said Sharma. The lender is also making any changes to its plans on divestment. “There is no pressure to monetise assets for capital adequacy. The purpose is to make a good profit and where we see a good deal, we will go ahead,” said Sharma. He added that a decision on divestment of subsidiaries would be taken by the board and that will not change unless someone decides to bring in a lot of capital into the subsidiary. IDBI Bank’s board has 14 members — two nominees each from the government and LIC, three whole-time directors from the management and seven independent directors. Despite being indirectly majority government-owned, IDBI Bank is already classified as a private sector entity and Sharma was appointed as CEO based on a recommendation by the board and approval from the RBI. In government banks, the appointment takes place through recommendations from the Banks Board Bureau.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govt-stake-sale-will-not-affect-idbis-plans-ceo/articleshow/82587271.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Patna||Bihar: Shunned by villagers, Saraiya BDO cremates Covid victim||PATNA: At a time when even family members and friends are refusing to perform the last rites of their near and dear ones dying of Covid, the Saraiya block development officer (BDO) in Muzaffarpur and a retired Army jawan not only carried the body of a Covid victim, but also cremated him as no villager extended them a helping hand. Yogendra Singh (50) of Pagahia, an autorickshaw driver, died of Covid on Monday. His wife and two minor sons went around the village of 2,000 people to seek help, but no one was ready to lift the body for cremation. Saraiya BDO B N Singh told TOI on Wednesday that when no one came forward, he, with the help of a retired Army man, the driver and the cleaner of the mortuary van, carried the body and dug a 10X10ft ditch, arranged the wood and cremated Yogendra, whose minor son lit the pyre. "He was a poor man. He went to Gorakhpur to earn a livelihood as there is a lockdown in Bihar. There, he got infected and came back home. He did not tell anyone in the village about his illness out of fear that they would throw him out. However, the villagers knew about his Covid condition," Singh said. Singh said he did not hesitate even for a minute as it was his duty. "I had called the retired Army man Kunal to help after Berua panchayat mukhiya Ashfaq Alam informed me about it Monday night. Someone had also sent a message to the DM, who forwarded it to me," the BDO said. Kunal of Dhanupra under neighbouring Nargi Jivnath panchayat, who retired from the Army last year, and sanitised 35 villages under seven panchayats of Saraiya block during the first wave last year, said around 200 villagers, including the brother-in-law of the deceased, stood as mute spectators even during the cremation. "I myself had tested positive for Covid on April 20. I am a Rajput but have been keeping Roza during Ramzan since 2010 when I had been posted at Ahmednagar in Maharashtra. When I reached Pagahia, no villager was ready to enter Yogendra's house. Everyone was scared. I took out my PPE kit from my car and even offered one to the BDO and took the help of the two mortuary van staff, who were initially reluctant saying it was not their duty. Finally, we dug a ditch with the help of a JCB machine and cremated the body," Kunal told TOI. Berua panchayat mukhiya Ashfaq said I went to Yogendra's place, but no villager came forward to help. "We informed the DM and the BDO and sought the administration's help to cremate the body," he said on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/shunned-by-villagers-saraiya-bdo-cremates-covid-victim/articleshow/82583868.cms||Jai Narain Pandey
---||Ahmedabad||45+ may have to re-book vaccination slots in Ahmedabad||AHMEDABAD: The fresh directives for Covishield vaccine indicates a gap of at least 42 days (six weeks) between the two shots. It put hundreds across the state who had already booked slots for vaccination in 45-plus age group in a fix. Dr Nayan Jani, state immunization officer, said that the update has been made at CoWIN platform level. “So far, people had the choice to get vaccinated after the mandatory window of 29 days. The settings have been changed now. A person will not be able to get the second shot before 42 days,” he said. “Recent studies have proved that increasing the gap will be beneficial for vaccine recipients.” Questioned on whether those who have already booked their slots would have to re-schedule it, Dr Jani said that if the window period (42 days) is not met with, the beneficiaries would not be able to get the shot. “They would have to get a fresh date,” he said. The 45-plus category however can also avail walk-ins, he added. Amit Khatri, a city-based road safety expert, said that the arrangement is sudden for many like him. “I had got a slot near the city as I could not get one within the city. The gap between two shots is 41 days. The change in rule came without warning or time for people like me. The least they could have done was to implement it for new appointments,” he said. Meanwhile, shortage of vaccination marred the drive at various locations, said sources. While sessions were shortened in some centres, at other places the persons were given token numbers and were asked to return the next day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/45-may-have-to-re-book-vax-slots/articleshow/82588040.cms||---

The service started on Wednesday. ADG, UP112, Ashok Kumar Singh, told TOI that the service is part of the crackdown on black markeeting of the stuff needed for Covid patients across the state. People can also seek help or share information with UP 112 via social media as well. “We have held training sessions for Police Response Vehicle (PRV) personnel along with district nodal incharges and they have been told to take action based on the human perception approach,” said Singh. Karuna Shankar, another officer at UP 112, said any person at any point of time can call at UP 112 and inform them about the black markeeting or over pricing of concentrators, cylinders, oximeters, medicines. The caller’s identity will not be disclosed and immediately a PRV will be dispatched to help him. Since April 1, UP 112 has helped over seven lakh people by providing them with emergency assistance during Covid, said Shankar. Shankar said efforts were being made to make available ambulances, medicines and food for needy Covid patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/inform-up-112-if-you-are-overcharged-for-o2-meds/articleshow/82590281.cms||---

Chairperson of PHDCCI and CMH Radico Khaitan, Dr Lalit Khaitan, said his company would set up five oxygen plants in the state, the first of which would be established in Kanpur and the remaining would be set up as per the requirement of the government. The UP chapter of PHDCCI raised several issues with the government which the departments concerned have promised to take up on priority. These include making vaccination of workers mandatory for them to work in industries and factories and allowing private hospitals to administer vaccines. “The government should encourage private companies to manufacture equipment required for Covid treatment. The liquor industry, which contributes about Rs 100 crore per day to the state’s revenues, should be restarted and the government can also look at the possibility of home delivery. Schools, colleges and hotels should be converted into hospitals,” said Khaitan. The other suggestions were related to debt refinancing, planning ahead of potential waves to avoid another shutdown, spending part of the CSR funds on Covid relief, taking support from fourth and fifth year medical students and nurses in their final semester to increase the number of healthcare professionals. Senior advisor, UP PHDCCI, Mukesh Singh said the formula adopted by the Noida Authority for providing oxygen cylinders to patients in home isolation could be adopted in all major districts of the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/khaitan-group-to-set-up-five-oxygen-plants-in-the-state/articleshow/82590231.cms||---
---||Pune||Now, fastest-finger-first trick for vaccination slots on Co-WIN flops||Pune: The fastest-finger-first strategy is no longer working to book vaccination slots on Co-WIN due to recurrent issues on the portal while seeking appointments, several citizens told TOI. Though the vaccination slots have started appearing “green” on the portal for some users, the issues after that are causing many to instantly lose the chances. Anurag Joshi, a resident of Kothrud, said, “When I saw the ‘green’ slot under a particular vaccine site, I clicked on it and was led to the time slots. I was then prompted to fill in the Captcha code. The code is case sensitive and one takes time to type it. By the time a person selects the time slot and fills in the Captcha code, the available slots get booked by other users.” Murtuza Poonawalla, a city-based businessman, said, “After logging in to Co-WIN with my registered cellphone number, I tried to schedule an appointment. But due to some technical glitches on the portal, I got logged out of Co-WIN and had to log in again. I lost a chance to find an open slot trying to log in again.” He added, “When I was finally about to book an appointment after a slot appeared green, I got an error message stating ‘incorrect security code’ even after punching in the correct Captcha. Once again I lost the available slots.” City resident Shailendra Patil said, “We finally saw a ‘green’ slot but lost the appointment after the time it took to fill in the Çaptcha code.” A state health department official told TOI, “Every vaccination site has limited slots, while there are so many registered users in Pune always waiting to book a slot as soon as it is available. The Captcha feature had become a necessity to preclude the possibility of bots used by certain individuals to automatically and wrongfully book slots in bulk. That is why the users are led to fill in the CAPTCHA after the slots appear green, so that it can validate human intervention.” The official said with limited sessions and slots due to few vaccine doses, by the time the user enters the Captcha, the available slot has already been booked by someone else. “After a session is uploaded, slots are getting booked within 20-30 seconds. If the available slots are booked within 30 seconds, those trying to book at the same site after this time period will see the slots fully booked,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/now-fastest-finger-first-trick-for-vaccination-slots-on-co-win-flops/articleshow/82587938.cms||Neha Madaan

Dr Lakhani pointed at possible malpractices in admitting Covid patients at the hospital, and involvement of monetary transactions. ‘We have come to know that some staff members are leveraging their contacts, take money from relatives of the patients to get them admitted. They are first admitted to non-Covid ward, and then shifted to Covid ward. It is wrong and against the provisions of Pandemic Act,’ read the circular. ‘Those who are flouting the norms would face the punitive action.’ Sources close to the development said that the superintendent had to bring the issue on record after multiple complaints of malpractices in admission and demand of money. “It is dangerous to take the Covid positive patient to non-Covid ward in the first place. Further probe is on,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gnagar-civil-superintendent-hints-at-covid-admission-scam/articleshow/82588014.cms||---
---||Dehradun||PIL against ban on slaughterhouses in Haridwar, U’khand HC issues notices||Nainital: Terming the state government’s decision to ban all slaughterhouses in the Haridwar district ‘arbitrary and unconstitutional', a group of locals has filed a petition in the Uttarakhand high court. The plea — filed by Manglaur residents Iftakhar, Mahtab Alam, Saddam Husain and Sarfaraz — says that “denying hygienic and fresh non-vegetarian food to the people of Haridwar district, across the limitations of religion and caste, amounts to hostile discrimination.” While hearing the plea on Wednesday, the HC issued notices to the state government, director of the urban development department, district magistrate Haridwar, and Manglaur municipal board. The court has given the respondents four weeks to file their counter-affidavits. “The government has banned all legal slaughterhouses in the district. Consequently, the non-vegetarian population, which is as high as 90% in some areas, is forced to buy meat that is being supplied from illegal establishments. Therefore, the government’s order is effectively supporting illegal slaughtering,” said Arvind Vashisht, the counsel appearing for petitioners. Earlier in March, the Uttarakhand government had declared all the urban local bodies under Haridwar district as “slaughterhouse free” areas. The state government had also cancelled the No Objection Certificates (NOCs) issued to the slaughterhouses in the district. The petition argues that the state government order on slaughterhouses violates Article 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution by denying hygienic and fresh non-vegetarian food to people of Haridwar, across the limitations of religion and caste. This, the petitioners say, amounts to hostile discrimination and compels locals to obtain meat illegally. “That the order dated 03.03.2021 issued by the government of Uttarakhand is illegal and arbitrary and same is violative of Article 21 of the Constitution of India in as much as the food habits of the citizen are part of their fundamental right of life and liberty and the same cannot be taken away in such an arbitrary manner,” reads the petition. The petition also challenges the constitutional validity of section 237-A which was inserted by the state government into the Uttar Pradesh Municipalities Act. The section gives the power to the state government to declare any area under a municipal corporation, council, or nagar panchayat as a slaughter-free zone. “The constitution provides for the strengthening of municipal bodies and gives them the power to regulate tanneries and slaughterhouses but instead of empowering the urban local bodies, the state government has taken away their powers in violation of Article 243-W and Schedule XII of the Constitution of India,” Vashisht said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/pil-against-ban-on-slaughterhouses-in-haridwar-ukhand-hc-issues-notices/articleshow/82581296.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Goa||Caranzol locals clash with forest dept officials over felling of trees||Valpoi: The villagers of Caranzol, Sattari, clashed with forest officials who had gone to inspect the area where large scale felling of trees has been reported. Caranzol's forest area falls within the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary limits. Tension ran high and the forest official had to fire in the air to disperse the crowd that had gheraoed the team. Locals said they were agitated after an elderly woman was confronted by the team, who tried to confiscate her sickle. “Since the monsoon is approaching I was collecting firewood. Suddenly the forest team arrived and started to ask me about the felling of trees and threatened to beat me. The officials also tried to snatch the sickle from my hand, but I threw it and ran away and informed the villagers about the incident,” the woman said. One villager, Harishchandra Gawas, said that when they confronted the forest team and questioned the officials about their conduct, the officials refused to answer, and instead started arguing. “During the argument, Mhadei wildlife sanctuary range forest officer Narayan Prabhudesai took out his gun and fired three rounds in the air,” Gawas said. Calling for strict action against Prabhudesai, Gawas further said that he must be arrested or else the villagers will teach him a lesson by taking law into their own hands. The villagers later filed a police complaint against Prabhudesai at the Valpoi police station. Prabhudesai, meanwhile, told reporters that the team, along with the senior DCF of the Goa forest department, Tejaswini, had come to Caranzol for an inspection after they witnessed that many trees were cut and kept in the village. He said that when he questioned the villagers about the same, they gheraoed the team and even attacked him on his hand. Stating that people must oppose or agitate in democratic manner to get better results, he said, “Nothing will happen by attacking forest officials. We are just the protective staff, not decision makers.” Three recent incidents of a massive tree felling have already come to light and on Wednesday, forest officials were going for creation of water hole in Kajredhat when they found logs of felled trees. When they went to inquire about the same, agitated villagers blocked them. Since the last few years there have been instances of clashes between forest officials and forest dwellers in Caranzol.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/caranzol-locals-clash-with-forest-dept-officials-over-felling-of-trees/articleshow/82587983.cms||---

An FIR has been registered against the father-son duo at Kotwali police station on the complaint of a businessman from Tilhar, Rajnish Kumar, who was buying medicines from a medical store the doctor had recommended for Rs 7,000 a day whereas the same was available for Rs 1,100 at other chemist shops. When he delved into the matter, he found that “Rs 5,900 was the doctor's commission”. Besides, the medical store was run by the doctor's son and a relative. Giving details, Kumar said he had admitted his father at the medical college hospital in Shahjahanpur and a senior doctor was in charge of his treatment. The doctor prescribed some medicines which were not available in the hospital pharmacy. He asked the man to buy them from a particular medical store. The cost of the medicines was Rs 7,000 for each day. On May 10, his uncle bought the same medicines for Rs 1,100 from another store. It was then he realized that he was being duped. When contacted, the doctor refused to comment over the issue, claiming that he was being framed at the behest of a politician. Pravesh Singh, SHO of Kotwali police station, said, “We have registered an FIR under IPC sections 166 (public servant disobeying law), 168 (public servant unlawfully engaging in trade), 420 (cheating), 504 (intentional insult) and 120b (criminal conspiracy) against the doctor, his son and partner.

---||Nagpur||NMC has highest no. of oxygen beds, ICUs & ventilators per million in Maha||NAGPUR: Just days after chaotic scrambles for beds and oxygen, authorities now say that Nagpur has the state’s highest Covid oxygen beds, Intensive Care Units (ICU) and ventilators per million population. The civic body is now gearing up to improve on these numbers, as it prepares for the predicted third wave. Data regarding Covid infrastructure status of all districts in the state reveals that the city has 2,162 oxygen beds per million population. Apart from this, it also has 610 ICU beds and 217 ventilators per million, the highest in the state. Comparison shows that Mumbai has 1,325 and 332 oxygen and ICU beds per million respectively. On the other hand, Pune has 1,192 and 406 oxygen and ICU beds per million respectively. Mumbai and Pune have 186 and 158 ventilators respectively. Top officials of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) said the high number of beds in Nagpur are not only catering to patients from the city but also from those from nearby districts and adjoining states like Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. “We have never allowed any discrimination between patients coming from anywhere in the country. The reason behind Nagpur having the highest number of beds per million in all categories of Covid beds is the expansion of facilities and beds during the second wave,” said Jalaj Sharma. On the severe crisis faced by citizens due to shortage of beds, oxygen and ventilator facilities during the second wave, Sharma said, “We faced a tough situation in April because the peak of the wave continued for more than a month. But during this entire time, more than 400 admissions and discharges were taking place every day in hospitals. From 66 private hospitals in first wave, we increased to 146 in April. Similarly, beds were increased in all government and NMC hospitals.” He added that due to finite production and refilling capacity of oxygen in Nagpur, the requirement had to be fulfilled from outside sources. “We have not faced critical situation because all the hospitals were ordered to operate within the cylinders allocated to them. Also, a well coordinated system to bring oxygen tankers from outside was started. Tankers filled in Bhilai, Raipur, and Angul were brought and are still coming to Nagpur regularly,” said Sharma. Experts have predicted a third wave will hit the country, which might affect children the most. When asked how the civic body is preparing for it, Sharma told TOI, “We are adding 1,000 more beds in the city. Most importantly, special provisions are being made for paediatric category patients.” NMC is also aiming to make all hospitals with over 100 beds self sufficient in oxygen supply. “We are also working towards making smaller health posts in all areas of city with oxygen concentrators,” he added. According to activists, having the highest number of beds in the state is not really a news to celebrate. “There is still a shortage of ICU beds and ventilators. It can’t be denied that many people died in our city due to non-availability of beds and other facilities,” said social activist Joseph George. He further pointed out that though the number of beds and ventilators is highest in Nagpur, the number of casualties too is higher here than other cities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-has-highest-no-of-o2-beds-icus-ventilators-per-million-in-maha/articleshow/82587968.cms||Manka Behl

Every time a regime change happens, its chosen set of law officers assumes charge the very next day and starts representing the government in courts. It was not to be so this time due to a 2017 GO which was amended and made further stringent on September 4, 2019. The government has to appoint at least 75 law officers for the principal seat of Madras high court, and another 40 for the Madurai bench of the court. These two GOs cover only these law officers, who would include additional public prosecutors, special government pleaders, additional government pleaders and government advocates. The time-consuming selection process mandates notification inviting applications, eligibility norms for aspirants and an interview involving four secretaries of departments such as public and home. “There is no transition arrangement in courts. So, as of now Shanmugasundaram is the one-man army for the DMK government. A few ‘neutral’ law officers from the outgoing AIADMK dispensation have been appearing in some courts,” said a senior law officer demitting office. The GOs are badly drafted, to say the least, as there is no space for any ad hoc appointments to see the transition period through, said advocate-general Shanmugasundaram. A contingency situation has not been foreseen, he said, adding: “I am writing to the government for appointment of an ad hoc team. Public prosecutor, of course, has the discretion to have his own team for time being, and I myself invoked the power when I was holding the post.” While this is the first time such a piquant situation has arisen, jurists say appointment of career law officers would prevent similar deadlock in future. “A separate corps of law officers, appointed perhaps through the state public service commission, on permanent basis can continue to work despite regime changes. While subordinate level posts could be permanent in nature, top posts like advocate-general, additional advocates-general and public prosecutor or government pleader could be given to lawyers handpicked by the new government,” said a senior lawyer. There is also a need to exempt designated senior lawyers, aspiring for posts like additional advocate-general, from making a formal application. “They are designated by the full court meeting of judges, so it makes no sense to expect them to ‘apply’ for these positions,” said a lawyer. Madras high court is not functioning to its capacity at present due to three factors – annual summer recess, virtual hearings and pandemic curbs. Had this situation arisen during normal times, it would have led to serious problems as government’s policies, decisions and bail matters would be too important to be entrusted with members of the outgoing team of law officers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/go-delays-appointment-of-law-officers-by-dmk-govt/articleshow/82587899.cms||A Subramani

Data on tiger/carnivore signs, ungulate encounter rates, habitat status, human presence and pellet/dung counts will help prepare beat level maps indicating the spatial presence/relative abundance of prey/predator species.The Anamalai Tiger Reserve, spread over 958.6 sq km plus a buffer area of 150.5 sq km, has 32 beats in Pollachi division, 21 in Tirupur and 13 in buffer areas. More than 110 transect lines will be covered by foot soldiers. Apart from prey density, 575 sample plots have been earmarked for data on vegetation such as tree density, canopy cover, shrub and weed abundance and ground cover.While the exercise at Mudumalai is expected to begin on Saturday, at the reserves in Sathyamangalam, Kalakkad-Mundanthurai and Srivilliputhur Megamalai, managers are yet to decide on the date, said a senior forest official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/8-day-data-collection-begins-at-anamalai-tiger-reserve/articleshow/82587876.cms||P Oppili

---||Lucknow||UP BJP chief: Didn’t expect second wave to hit rural heartland||LUCKNOW: UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh has expressed concern over the second Covid wave hitting the state’s rural heartland. Speaking to TOI, Singh said, BJP did not anticipate the pandemic’s spread to villages, which were largely untouched by the virus till now. “It’s a hard reality that the virus has crept into rural homes. It is very unfortunate and alarming as well,” he said. Singh said, instructions have been issued to grassroots functionaries to coordinate with the state government in providing medical help to villagers. “Be it medicine or arrangement of plasma, BJP will help people in every possible way,” he said. As a matter of fact, the party has asked its MPs and MLAs to get in touch with villagers in home-isolation and ensure they are provided all possible help. Singh’s directive to the cadre comes even as the ruling party faces mounting criticism over handling of the Covid crisis that has claimed more than 14,000 lives since the pandemic outbreak last year. The UP government has ramped up screening and isolation of patients in rural areas to arrest spread of the pandemic, while also providing them with medical kits. Notably, the state government’s move comes soon after the panchayat elections, which saw BJP facing a tough challenge from Samajwadi Party. A senior BJP leader admitted party workers have been asked to carry out relief operations without much hype. “There could be criticism of the party if relief does not reach beneficiaries,” said the leader. He said, people are being identified by party workers, who will provide help to the affected people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-bjp-chief-didnt-expect-2nd-wave-to-hit-rural-heartland/articleshow/82590311.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Bed Occupancy Down 5% in 3 weeks||AHMEDABAD: The state government has claimed that over the last three weeks, there was a 5% reduction in bed occupancy at designated Covid hospitals (DHCs) across the state. The government’s affidavits filed in the Gujarat high court time to time revealed that bed occupancy was 83% at DHCs on April 18, and reduced to 79% on May 8. With the continuous rise in Covid cases during this period, Gujarat added more beds to its government and private Covid facilities. The increase in the number of beds was from 50,695 to 64,007 in DHCs. The total increase in number of beds in all types of Covid-19 facilities — DCH, designated Covid health centres (DHCH) and Covid care centres (CCC) — was from 79,944 on April 18 to 1,07,702 on May 8, and occupancy was 42,785 and 50,573 beds, respectively. In a report tendered to the HC on Monday, the state government claimed there is a slight reduction in the number of new Covid-19 cases, which has stabilised oxygen demand at about 1,250 metric tonnes per day. However, in its letter written to the Centre requesting an increase in oxygen allocation to Gujarat, the state government mentioned that the disease was spreading fast in rural areas and the test positivity rate was increasing. There are four districts in which beds at CDHs were full. There were no beds empty at hospitals in Porbandar, Patan, Junagadh and Chhota Udepur on May 8. Porbandar district witnessed no change in this situation for three weeks, with only 80 beds available at the lone CDH in the district which has more than 5 lakh people. There are no beds vacant in Porbandar at DCHCs as well. In Surat city, bed availability was 46% and in Ahmedabad city, it was 17% at CDHs. In a city like Jamnagar, bed availability is just 3% at hospitals, the government report said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bed-occupancy-down-5-in-3-weeks/articleshow/82588033.cms||---
---||Goa||HC to state: Ensure no more deaths due to O2 shortage||Panaji: Observing that the oxygen situation at Goa Medical College is “quite grim”, the high court of Bombay at Goa on Wednesday directed the state government to take all steps to ensure there are no more casualties due to oxygen deficit at the state’s premier public hospital. “This is vital because the right to life is a fundamental right guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution,” observed a bench comprising justices M S Sonak and N W Sambre. “There is, therefore, a corresponding duty cast on the state to ensure that this life is not extinguished on account of the inability of the state to supply oxygen to these unfortunate victims of the pandemic,” the bench said. The bench also told the state that this duty can neither be avoided by pleading helplessness, nor by putting forth logistical difficulties in sourcing and supplying oxygen. On Tuesday, health minister Vishwajit Rane said that 26 Covid-19 patients died at GMC in the early hours due to a dip in oxygen supply. However, by late Tuesday night, appeals from relatives again began to show up on social media, pleading for oxygen. The high court, posting the matter for Thursday, expressed the “fond hope” that at least on Wednesday night and thereafter, “there are no casualties at GMC for want of oxygen”. Meanwhile, following an affidavit by GMC dean Dr Shivanand Bandekar, who admitted problems in supply of trolleys and loose cylinders of oxygen that “resulted in casualties”, the high court remarked that the material placed before it establishes that patients are indeed suffering and even in some cases succumbing for want of the supply of oxygen. While the affidavit pointed out that 204 Covid patients died there from May 6 to May 11, it didn’t specify how many of these died due to oxygen shortage. The affidavit also stated that the hospital faced many interruptions in the supply of central oxygen on a daily basis, leading to near-critical fall in several patients’ oxygen saturation. The court was also informed that on May 9, 10, and 11, there was a deficit of 3.6, 5 and 6.5MT at GMC. The court noted that the state officials have repeatedly assured there was enough oxygen, but that the supply chain was the problem. “In any case, we feel that such logistical problems must be got over at the earliest, so that this tragedy of victims gasping for breath in the presence of their near and dear ones, and in several cases, even dying for want of necessary oxygen supply, is arrested at the earliest,” it said. “Therefore, the state will have to and is hereby directed to take all necessary steps to ensure that such logistical difficulties are overcome at the earliest, and there are no casualties for want of a supply of oxygen to the pandemic victims,” the HC said. During the hearing, the court was informed that 1,000 jumbo cylinders and 72 trolleys of oxygen are needed to ensure that no deaths occur for want of oxygen supply. Also, although there are around 700 beds, there are approximately 950 patients admitted at GMC. Health secretary Ravi Dhawan told the court that they have succeeded in organising four dura cylinders from Scoop Industries. Out of these, two are already at GMC. He said these cylinders have the capacity of 28 jumbo cylinders. The court also accepted a statement by Scoop Industries that it would make 55 trolleys and 600 jumbo cylinders of oxygen available to GMC by Wednesday evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hc-to-state-ensure-no-more-deaths-due-to-o2-shortage/articleshow/82587924.cms||---
---||Chennai||NHAI road projects hit by guest workers’ reverse migration||Chennai: Many projects of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) have slowed down as 50% of its workforce has moved out of the state due to the complete lockdown.In all, 22 NHAI road projects worth Rs 17,000 crore are under progress in the state. Apart from shortage of labourers, there is short supply of earth, and other raw material.According to officials, nearly 60% of the total workforce of the contractors engaged by the NHAI in road projects were labourers from Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, and Chhattisgarh. They have gradually moved out of the state in the last one week. “The ongoing projects across the state have slowed down as guest workers are returning to their home states amidst the second wave of the pandemic,” said regional officer of NHAI in Chennai, Pawan Kumar, who is also in charge of Madurai region. Nearly 1,000 labourers were engaged in the four-laning of Thanjavur-Vikravandi road project till 10 days ago. Now, the workforce has reduced to less than 50%. “Among the labourers who stayed back, around 70 were infected with coronavirus and hospitalised. Those who recovered were isolated and taken care of. The contractors have been instructed to take care of the wellbeing of the workforce,” said senior officials in the Coimbatore project implementation unit. Another official supervising the six-laning of the Sriperumbudur-Walajapet stretch of the Chennai-Bengaluru national highway said the government had permitted the ongoing road projects to continue. But, they were unable to keep up the pace of the work as the labourers have reduced to 200 from 450 a week ago. “We have tried our best to convince them to stay back. We assured them of taking care of their needs and encouraged them to continue to work, but they were scared due to the severity of the virus in the second wave of the pandemic. Now, we are managing the work with the available labourers (guest workers). We have also roped in some local work force,” said the official.In the absence of skilled labourers, construction of structures like bridges, flyovers and under passages are hit. “Guest workers are skilled in the shuttering work. Without them, it is not possible to continue flyover and bridge works. We may not be able to meet the deadline. There could be cost escalation too when the project gets delayed,” said a senior official in the Chennai regional office.Short supply of oxygen cylinders for industrial purpose has severely affected supply of many raw material for construction work, said the official. Work has come to a standstill at many sites owing to non-availability of raw material, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/nhai-road-projects-hit-by-guest-workers-reverse-migration/articleshow/82587961.cms||---

This was decided on Wednesday in a meeting chaired by district guardian minister Satej Patil. This decision has been taken to contain the spread of Covid and bring down the mortality rate. District collector Daulat Desai is expected to issue the guidelines for the lockdown on Thursday. It is likely that only milk and medicine supply will be allowed. All essential and non-essential shops will be shut. The vegetable markets are shut as part of the ongoing janata curfew but the vendors are sitting along the roadside in the morning. Patil said, “We are currently facing a shortage of oxygen and medicines such as remdesivir. We are finding alternative sources to make the oxygen supply smooth. However, the authorities need some space to grow the health infrastructure and ensure the infrastructure is relieved to an extent due to the lockdown imposed.” Patil said that 14 oxygen generation plants will be functional in a month,which will add 23 metric tonne of oxygen, daily. He also said the number of ventilator beds will be increased to 400 soon. “We are also planning to set up facilities for children, who are expected to be infected in large numbers in the possible third wave of Covid. We are going to form a team of paediatricians from the city,” said Patil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/strict-curbs-in-kolhapur-dist-from-may-15/articleshow/82581407.cms||---
---||Chennai||K Ragothaman, who probed Rajiv Gandhi case, dies of Covid||CHENNAI: K Ragothaman, a former CBI officer who was part of the investigation into former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi’s assassination, died of Covid-19 here on Wednesday. He was 76. Admitted to a private hospital at Thirumangalam three days ago, he breathed his last around 6am. He is survived by a daughter. His wife died a few years ago. Ragothaman joined the CBI in 1968 as a sub-inspector in Delhi and had a 37-year service. During his stint in Delhi, he was part of the probe teams in the UGC grants scam by various educational institutions in Delhi, the murder abetment case against former Karnataka home minister R L Jalappa and the case against former BCCI president A C Muthiah, accused of defrauding Syndicate Bank of Rs 102.8 crore. Awarded the Police Medal in 1988 and President Medal in 1994, Ragothaman retired in 2005. Later, he produced a documentary, “Human Bomb” and published “Conspiracy to Kill Rajiv Gandhi” in English and Tamil as well as “Third Degree Crime Investigation Management.” Recalling his association with Ragothaman, D Mukherjee, a former DGP, said he was an excellent officer. “I spoke to him two days ago and he inquired about my health. I am shocked by his sudden demise.” S Ramani, a former DGP who was CBI deputy director (Chennai) in 1991, said he preferred Ragothaman as chief investigation officer in the Rajiv assassination case though there were 20 other deputy superintendents of police. “I saw his working pattern in the Jalappa case as I was AIG of CBI in Karnataka.” Raju Rangarajan, a retired superintendent of police in CBI, said he was investigation officer and Ragothaman the supervising officer in a case pertaining to the suspicious death of Shanmugam of Vedaranyam who hanged himself at a park opposite the IB guest house where he was questioned by a DIG rank officer in 1991. “We helped crack the case.” Shanmugam, who was arrested in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, was a boatman who became a businessman after helping the members of the LTTE. He assisted Rajiv Gandhi’s assassin Thanu, the prime conspirator Sivarajan other members of the team after they landed at Vedaranyam, said Raju Rangarajan. The body of Ragothaman, who lived at Joshua Apollo Apartments on 42 Street, 8th Sector, KK Nagar, was handed over to his son-in-law Dr Shanmugavel.  It was later transported to his native village Pondur near Ulundurpet in Kallakurichi district after the required permission was granted by Ambattur health inspector Sahana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/k-ragothaman-who-probed-rajiv-gandhi-case-dies-of-covid/articleshow/82587936.cms||---
---||Thane||Despite falling Covid-19 cases, death figures remain high in Maharashtra||MUMBAI: Though the state continues to report low daily detections, Covid-19 fatalities continue to remain high. The state added 46,781 new cases and 816 deaths on Wednesday, taking the caseload to 52.2 lakh and the toll to 78,007. Mumbai’s consistently rising death rate was highlighted by the state in its weekly Covid status document that is presented to the cabinet. It said that Mumbai’s case fatality rate increased from 0.6% in the period April 14 to April 20 to 1.14% in the period April 21 to April 27. Thereafter, it rose to 2.17% in the period April 28 to May 4 and touched 2.27% in the week ending March 11. The state’s average fatality rate was 1.32%. On Wednesday, deaths jumped to 66 after a slight dip to 51 on Tuesday. Of the deceased, a little over 50% had co-morbidities. Two deaths were of people below 40 years of age, while 27 were between 40 and 60 years of age, and the remaining were above 60 years of age. The city’s overall mortality numbers have reached 13,972. “Deaths will continue to remain high for a minimum of two to three weeks. The ICUs continue to be full. The city still has more than 2,700 patients in critical care. A peculiar presentation seen in several young patients is that young patients will desaturate and die suddenly after seven to eight days. The progression is rapid,” Dr Avinash Supe, who heads the Covid death audit committee for MMR, said. A civic doctor, too, said that while admissions have reduced, the proportion of critical patients remains high. After a two-day lull, Mumbai was also back to reporting over 2,000 cases on Wednesday. The city saw 2,104 cases, after recording 1,782 and 1,717 cases on Monday and Tuesday, respectively. The state’s case tally has now reached 6,81,233. On Wednesday, 33,499 tests were carried out, a jump from 28,258 on Tuesday and 23,061 on Monday. Infectious disease expert Dr Vasant Nagvekar, who is also a member of the state task force, said that people still need to seek treatment early. “Also, young people are hit in this wave and we have seen many suffering from the severe form of the disease,” he said. The state has raised concern regarding the rising death rate in smaller districts like Nandurbar, Nanded, Latur and Osmanbad. Nandurbar and Nanded had a weekly fatality rate of over 5%, while the other two districts had a fatality rate of over 2.3%. Daily discharges in the state were higher than the daily detections and there was a drop in active cases too. On Tuesday, the state had 5.4 lakh active cases, of which 36,595 were in Mumbai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/despite-falling-cases-death-figures-remain-high-in-maharashtra/articleshow/82593434.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Goa||Day after 26 die of O2 dips, supply fails again at Goa hospital||PANAJI: A day after 26 Covid-19 patients died at Goa Medical College (GMC) due to a dip in oxygen supply, its shortage continued to cripple the state’s premier government hospital on Wednesday. After Tuesday’s tragedy, CM Pramod Sawant had said he would “make sure” not a single Covid patient dies due to shortage of oxygen. However, doctors and relatives of patients said that in the early hours of Wednesday, GMC’s wards 122, 113 and private wards ran out of the central flow of oxygen, the eighth consecutive time it has happened. With the doctor to patient ratio already stretched thin, physiologically-compromised patients with severe Covid pneumonia bore the brunt of the desaturation in SpO2 levels. The SOS calls and messages began from 12:20am. “Yesterday’s (Tuesday) situation seems to be repeating again. There is a severe oxygen shortage at GMC right now, wards 113 and 122. Please arrange for oxygen cylinders on time,” said the relative of a patient in a post on social media. One of those who lost their lives is a young woman in her late thirties, who was left gasping for oxygen in ward 122 at around 2:20am. The patient’s brother called up a helpline asking for an oxygen cylinder. “He told me that she was gasping for oxygen. The brother asked for a cylinder from the volunteers, but they were not allowed to refill the cylinders because of the North Goa collector’s directions,” said Goa Velha resident Devsurabhee Yaduvanshi. She said that she felt helpless as they could not help the young lady. “Around 10:45am, he messaged me again and said that she passed away. The lack of oxygen exacerbated her condition even further,” said Yaduvanshi. A doctor told TOI said that an elderly woman’s SpO2 levels dropped after the central line oxygen flow petered out. The other Covid-19 patient in the room, who had an oxygen cylinder, shared the cylinder to stabilise the elderly woman. Interestingly, wards 144 and 145, which reported oxygen shortages over the past few days, faced no such problems. Sawant had interacted with relatives of patients who are admitted in the two wards. GMC dean Dr Shivanand Bandekar admitted before the high court of Bombay at Goa that there is a severe oxygen crunch. Each patient requires two to three oxygen cylinders per day, based on the severity of the infection. So, while GMC requires anywhere between 860 and 930 cylinders per day to sustain patients, it received just 330 to 630 oxygen cylinders per day over the past five days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/day-after-26-die-of-o2-dips-supply-fails-again-at-gmc/articleshow/82587973.cms||---
---||Delhi||HC ends probe against AAP MLA in O2 hoarding case||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Thursday ended its inquiry against Aam Aadmi Party MLA and cabinet minister Imran Hussain after being satisfied about the source of his oxygen cylinders. A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli disposed of a plea alleging that Hussain was hoarding oxygen, after Delhi government clarified that the MLA was not provided the life-saving gas by the state or refillers of the city or from the quota allocated for Covid-19 patients. Amicus curiae and senior advocate Rajshekhar Rao also told the court that the explanation tendered by Hussain, that he refilled the cylinders from a dealer in Faridabad, based on the documents filed, “appears to be credible”. The court recorded the submission that the MLA took 10 cylinders on rent and got them refilled from a refiller, on which invoices were raised. In view of the submissions by both the state government and amicus, the court ended the proceedings, noting that “we are not inclined to proceed any further in the matter.” The stand of Delhi government came in response to the high court’s question “if the MLA was supplied any oxygen by the state or through the refillers from the allocated quota.” Senior advocate Rahul Mehra, appearing for Delhi government, urged the court to penalise the petitioner to deter such “roving and fishing inquiry.” He added that, due to such petitions, the reputation of Hussain, a cabinet minister, was adversely affected, and all the good work he did had to be halted. Mehra said it also deters individuals from doing any such work for the benefit of people in the future, and people filing such petitions, without proper research, had to be discouraged. He also questioned why such pleas were being filed only against one political party. The claims and contentions were disputed by the applicant, Vedansh Sharma, who had accused Hussain of hoarding oxygen. The court, however, did not agree with Mehra’s contention and underlined that it won’t stop people from coming to the court. It added that it did not ask the MLA to stop his distribution if he was not taking oxygen from the quota allocated to Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-ends-probe-against-aap-mla-in-o2-hoarding-case/articleshow/82615708.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Pune||100 hospitals in Pune division to get oxygen plants before July 31||PUNE: Altogether 100 government hospitals in Pune division will have oxygen generation plants before July 31, divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao said on Wednesday. With the demand for the medical gas, essential for the treatment of Covid-19 patients, increasing from all the five districts in the division, orders have been placed for 64 oxygen generation plants for now. The number of such plants will be increased to 100 in the next 10 days. “We are aiming at making these oxygen generation plants operational before July 31 to tide over the current shortfall. Once that happens, we will have to depend less on the current oxygen manufacturers,” Rao said after reviewing the oxygen management for Pune division. Pune division comprises Pune, Kolhapur, Sangli, Satara and Solapur districts. In Pune rural, an order for 24 oxygen generation plants has been placed, Rao said. Besides the oxygen generation plants, the division would soon have 10,000 oxygen concentrators, Rao said, adding that orders have been placed for 2,000 such machines.  “The oxygen concentrators serve as a back-up for many Covid-19 patients. The concentrators will be deployed in all the five districts within a month,” the divisional commissioner said. Rao said the oxygen audit exercise has also helped many hospitals save consumption of the essential gas. “The jumbo health hubs of Pimpri Chinchwad and YCM hospital were consuming about 45 tonnes of oxygen a day. The consumption has reduced to 28 tonnes following the audit. Similarly, the daily oxygen consumption at the Pune Municipal Corporation’s jumbo unit and Sassoon General Hospital has reduced to 15 tonnes from 20 tonnes and to 16 tonnes from 25 tonnes, respectively,” he said. Pune collector Rajesh Deshmukh said the “Oxygen Express” carrying the essential gas from Angul in Odisha to Nagpur was redirected to Pune. This was done after two companies supplying oxygen to Pune division faced electrical issues, impacting the supply of about 100 tonnes of the gas. Pune also received the first consignment of oxygen of 40 tonnes from the French government via Mumbai. France had assured 600 tonnes for India and the first consignment was sent by ship to Mumbai. An official said 40 tonnes of oxygen was brought to Pune from Mumbai by road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/100-hospitals-in-division-to-get-o2-plants-before-july-31/articleshow/82587929.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The state government announced on Wednesday that every CHC will be equipped with between 30 and 50 oxygen beds. Kishor Kanani, the minister of state for health, said: “The state government has initiated a survey in rural areas to assess the need of oxygen beds.” Kanani added: “A Surat-based company will set up an oxygen generation, storage, and bottling plant. The company will provide oxygen to between 30 and 50 beds in each of the 348 CHCs.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/348-chcs-to-get-o2-beds/articleshow/82588025.cms||---
---||Navi-mumbai||Despite falling Covid-19 cases, death figures remain high in Maharashtra||MUMBAI: Though the state continues to report low daily detections, Covid-19 fatalities continue to remain high. The state added 46,781 new cases and 816 deaths on Wednesday, taking the caseload to 52.2 lakh and the toll to 78,007. Mumbai’s consistently rising death rate was highlighted by the state in its weekly Covid status document that is presented to the cabinet. It said that Mumbai’s case fatality rate increased from 0.6% in the period April 14 to April 20 to 1.14% in the period April 21 to April 27. Thereafter, it rose to 2.17% in the period April 28 to May 4 and touched 2.27% in the week ending March 11. The state’s average fatality rate was 1.32%. On Wednesday, deaths jumped to 66 after a slight dip to 51 on Tuesday. Of the deceased, a little over 50% had co-morbidities. Two deaths were of people below 40 years of age, while 27 were between 40 and 60 years of age, and the remaining were above 60 years of age. The city’s overall mortality numbers have reached 13,972. “Deaths will continue to remain high for a minimum of two to three weeks. The ICUs continue to be full. The city still has more than 2,700 patients in critical care. A peculiar presentation seen in several young patients is that young patients will desaturate and die suddenly after seven to eight days. The progression is rapid,” Dr Avinash Supe, who heads the Covid death audit committee for MMR, said. A civic doctor, too, said that while admissions have reduced, the proportion of critical patients remains high. After a two-day lull, Mumbai was also back to reporting over 2,000 cases on Wednesday. The city saw 2,104 cases, after recording 1,782 and 1,717 cases on Monday and Tuesday, respectively. The state’s case tally has now reached 6,81,233. On Wednesday, 33,499 tests were carried out, a jump from 28,258 on Tuesday and 23,061 on Monday. Infectious disease expert Dr Vasant Nagvekar, who is also a member of the state task force, said that people still need to seek treatment early. “Also, young people are hit in this wave and we have seen many suffering from the severe form of the disease,” he said. The state has raised concern regarding the rising death rate in smaller districts like Nandurbar, Nanded, Latur and Osmanbad. Nandurbar and Nanded had a weekly fatality rate of over 5%, while the other two districts had a fatality rate of over 2.3%. Daily discharges in the state were higher than the daily detections and there was a drop in active cases too. On Tuesday, the state had 5.4 lakh active cases, of which 36,595 were in Mumbai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/despite-falling-cases-death-figures-remain-high-in-maharashtra/articleshow/82593435.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Lucknow||Stop rejoicing over WHO pat: Akhilesh to Yogi government||LUCKNOW: Lambasting the BJP government for ‘rejoicing over WHO’s acknowledgment of Yogi model’, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Wednesday said the government has conveniently overlooked images of dead bodies floating in rivers, people dying at hospital gates for lack of medical attention and rising count of deaths in villages. He said the government should stop holding the opposition responsible for lack of hospital beds, oxygen and black markeeting of cylinders. The government should now get its act together and help to bring an end to miseries of people whose family members are fighting Covid-19 all by themselves, he said. “The government is so desperate to cover up its failures that it is resorting to all sorts of gimmicks to shift the focus from real issues like floating dead bodies in river and people dying outside hospitals for lack of medical attention,” Akhilesh said, adding the government can answer the opposition by stopping black marketing of medicines, oxygen cylinders and hospital beds. The former UP CM said the government has made online registration for vaccination mandatory. “The government is either unaware or not concerned how the people in villages register themselves for vaccination. The government should tell the people why there is no vaccine at centres and why free vaccination is not being held across the state. The government is as non-serious about vaccination as it has been about the second wave and results are before everyone to see,” he said. “By the mandatory online registration process the government will only deprive a chunk of the illiterate poor from availing the vaccine,” he said. Akhilesh said the state government should provide free vaccine to all in UP. "If the ruling BJP fails to do that, Samajwadi Party will do it once it forms the government in 2022," he said. The SP government will make sure that the best available vaccine in the world is provided to the people of the state after simplifying the procurement process. The SP government will focus on medical facilities and no one will be left wanting for medical care, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/stop-rejoicing-over-who-pat-akhilesh-to-yogi-govt/articleshow/82590333.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

The woman, after undergoing her Covid test, will take a flight for Sharjah from Oman on Thursday and arrive at the Delhi airport on Friday. “We are in the process of making arrangements to receive the woman at the Delhi airport from where she would be sent to her native place with the help of an NGO,” said DCP (Crime) SalmanTaj Patil. To recall, Kanpur police commissioner Asim Kumar Arun had approached the higher-ups in the ministry of foreign affairs in New Delhi, who pursued the matter with the Indian embassy in Muscat. He also wrote to the Indian embassy in Muscat and the police were in constant touch with the Oman officials. The DCP (Crime) meanwhile, said, “This is the fourth woman whom we had rescued with the help of the ministry of external affairs in the past couple of months. Earlier, three women, including one from UP’s Unnao, one from Karnataka and the other from Punjab were rescued by us. The fourth woman, who too hails from Jalandhar had undergone Covid test and completed all travel related formalities in Oman. Authorities are awaiting her test report. She will probably reach Delhi on Friday and the same day she will head for her native place”. To recall, in the month of April, the commissionerate police had arrested two members of a human trafficking gang, identified as Atiqur and Muzammil, from the city following a complaint filed by a Unnao resident at the Colonelganj police station accusing the duo of cheating. The duo had sent a 40-year-old woman to Oman with a promise of a well paid job. She instead was landed at the house of a ‘kafeel’ (guarantor), who forced her to do household work for a menial salary. Since then, she had been calling her husband to get her back to India. During interrogation, the arrested persons confessed that they were part of a well-organised international human trafficking racket which had sent nearly 19 persons, especially women from across region, including Unnao and other parts of the country, including Punajb and Goa, to foreign countries against a hefty commission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/one-more-woman-rescued-from-human-traffickers/articleshow/82585815.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

As many as 18,125 new cases and 26,712 recoveries were recorded in the past 24 hours. The pattern has also brought the number of active cases in the state to 2.06 lakh — over a lakh cases less than the peak of 3.10 lakh reported on April 30. Meanwhile, UP’s overall Covid-19 tally crossed the 15.5 lakh mark with the addition of new cases. “For almost 12th day in a row now, recoveries have outnumbered the new cases and this is reflected in the state’s recovery rate now. Against a recovery rate of about 73% in the last week of April, the rate now stands at about 85%,” said additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad. A look at the official bulletin indicated that the pandemic activity seems to have shifted to the western UP. While Meerut topped the list of new cases with 1,232 new cases, Gautam Budh Nagar (992), Muzaffarnagar (755), Ghaziabad (743), Moradabad (557) and Saharanpur (330) added nearly 4,600 cases which is about 25% of the total burden of new cases. Health officials expressed concern over the sustained loss of life of people to the pandemic. In the past 24 hours, 309 deaths were reported in the state. This translates into a loss of over 12 lives every hour. With this the total casualties reached 16369. Kanpur Nagar (26), Lucknow (23), Jhansi (17), Moradabad (14), Meerut (11) and Gautam Budh Nagar (11) were the top contributors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/recoveries-surpass-fresh-covid-cases-for-12th-day-in-a-row/articleshow/82590357.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Mumbai||Metro 1 takeover plan: MMRDA appoints consultant for diligence in Mumbai||Mumbai: The executive committee of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) has approved the appointment of a consultant to carry out due diligence of assets of Metro Line 1 (Versova-Andheri-Ghatkopar) before a formal takeover. Last year, industrialist Anil Ambani-owned R-Infra had written to the state government asking to buy its stake in Mumbai Metro One Private Ltd (MMOPL), which runs the 11.5-km Line 1. It is Mumbai’s first Metro line, which was built on a public-private partnership (PPP) model and was commissioned in 2014. R-Infra has a 69% share in MMOPL. The MMRDA owns 26%, and 5% is owned by Transdev. MMRDA commissioner R A Rajeev said that as a shareholder, the authority had the first right to buy R-Infra’s stake. “Since MMRDA is constructing all Metro lines across the region, the acquisition will add synergy to the operation of other lines. Also since it is a public transport infrastructure and MMOPL is unable to run it, it is incumbent upon the government to take over,” he said. Sources said R-Infra has asked for Rs 2,500-2,600 crore for its share in MMOPL. The consultant will visit all the assets created by MMOPL, assess their value and compare against their book value, which will enable MMRDA to decide on the amount to be paid to R-Infra. The consultant’s report is expected in the next four months. The fare structure has been a source of friction between MMRDA and MMOPL, with the latter asking for a fare hike citing an increase of Rs 1,935 crore in project cost over the original cost of Rs 2,356 crore. MMOPL had also cited a daily loss of Rs 90 lakh in operations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/metro-1-takeover-plan-mmrda-appoints-consultant-for-diligence-in-mumbai/articleshow/82590467.cms||Clara Lewis
---||Goa||Oxygen diverted to GMC from pvt hosps, PHCs||Panaji: In a bid to ensure that Goa Medical College gets adequate supply of oxygen, the state government has started throttling down the supply of oxygen to private hospitals and primary health centres. It has issued directions to North Goa collector Ajit Roy to ensure that cylinders of private hospitals and other oxygen suppliers are not refilled unless accompanied by Roy’s permission. The move, which comes at a time when the state is going through the second wave of Covid-19 and an oxygen crunch, has even left cancer patients who are dependent on oxygen in the lurch. Speaking to TOI, a stakeholder said that one of North Goa’s supplier of medical and industrial oxygen has not received sufficient oxygen supplies for days. The supplier – SWAR Gas – reportedly supplies to private hospitals such as Redkar Hospital and Galaxy Hospital aside from most of the PHCs in North Goa. SWAR Gas does not produce any oxygen. It used to purchase it from Scoop Industries and would supply to hospitals, lung, heart and cancer patients, and those with asthma. “Right now, only GMC is being given priority for oxygen. All other cylinders from other suppliers are being asked to wait for two days,” said a government official, who is part of the monitoring team to check on oxygen cylinder refilling. The state government has come under pressure from all quarters for the daily drop in oxygen supply at GMC. Health minister Vishwajit Rane dropped a bombshell on Tuesday by stating that 26 people died on a single day due to the lack of oxygen. On the same day, chief minister Pramod Sawant visited GMC and promised to streamline the flow of oxygen. The High Court of Bombay at Goa has also pulled up the state government and GMC and asked the authorities to ensure that patients at GMC do not die due to shortage of oxygen. Data shows that Redkar Hospital and Galaxy Hospital, which have been declared as Covid-19 hospitals, require 40 oxygen cylinders per day. Scoop used to supply 65 cylinders to SWAR Gas. Sources said that after the chief minister’s office intervened, 50 oxygen cylinders were refilled and handed over to SWAR Gas, suggesting there is a shortfall of 15 cylinders at either the private hospitals or with home quarantined patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/oxygen-diverted-to-gmc-from-pvt-hosps-phcs/articleshow/82588042.cms||Newton Sequeira

The members had paid a visit to the Chhatrapati Pramila Raje Civil Hospital on Wednesday.Currently, the mortality rate here is around 3.5%. Every day, about 50-60 Covid patients are succumbing to the infection. S S More, the CPR Hospital dean, said, “The task force has suggested to stop granting home isolation to all Covid patients. Home-isolated patients are often careless and do not follow the guidelines. The district administration will soon issue an order on this matter. Also, the experts have suggested that there should be no delay on admission of the patients as any delay can make the patients critical.” More said so far, no death has occurred due to shortage of oxygen or medicines in Kolhapur. He said the experts guided the doctors at the CPR Hospital on careful and limited use of remdesivir . 70-year-old contracts mucormycosis A 70-year-old Covid-cured patient has been diagnosed with mucormycosis, a fungal infection. Ajit Lokare, senior ENT surgeon from the hospital, said the patient’s eye is affected. The patient had recently recovered from Covid.

The incident came to light after video footage of buried bodies were widely shared on social media on Wednesday. The bodies were buried at the Rautapur Ganga Ghat in Shuklaganj’s Hajipur area. Local sources told TOI that the people have started burying the dead at the river bank as there is a shortage of wood for the pyre, besides owing to financial constraint. “On Wednesday, of the total 16 bodies that were brought to the ghat, nearly 13 were buried in the sand on the banks of the river,” a local priest preferring anonymity told TOI. The one who is financially sound arranges for a funeral pyre, otherwise most of the bodies are buried in sandbars, he said adding, since the spread of the pandemic, the ghat has witnessed the funeral of nearly 400 bodies. “Majority among the dead, hailing from nearby villages including Pipri, Landapurwa, Mirzapur, Bhatpurwa, Rajepur and Kanikamau, have been buried by their family members at this ghat,” he said and added, “Prior to the pandemic, the ghat on an average used to witness two to three cremation a day.” The bodies were buried in sandbars, which are six-foot deep. “During the rainy season, if the river overflows, then these bodies may be swept by the strong currents downstream in the adjoining villages and spread infection,” rued another villager. ACM Sadar Satyapriya Singh told reporters that the cremation on the banks of river Ganga is an old age custom. “However, if bodies in large numbers are buried, then it would be investigated,” Singh added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/bodies-buried-in-sand-along-ganga-in-unnao/articleshow/82585796.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

According to sources, the trials will be conducted on over 500 kids at multiple sites, including Delhi, Patna and Nagpur. The nod from the subject expert committee (SEC) has been granted for conducting trials to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of Covaxin on kids. The firm will have to submit interim safety data of the proposed phase II trial on children along with recommendations of the Data & Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) to the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) before it will be allowed to proceed to the phase III leg of the study. In fact, Covaxin, was the first Covid-19 vaccine globally to begin testing on children as young as 12 years in September 2020. The phase II trials of Covaxin, which was a double-blinded study on 380 volunteers, included participants in the 12 to 65 years age bracket. Covaxin has been developed along with ICMR-NIV, Pune (Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Virology). The company had initially applied for permission for conducting Phase III clinical trials on children in the 5-18 years age group but in a meeting in late February 2021, the SEC asked the company to revise the study to a Phase II/III and also submit efficacy and safety data of the Phase III study on adults. It was in early January 2021 that Bharat Biotech chairman & managing director Dr Krishna Ella had announced the company’s intent to conduct trials on kids and had said the inactivated virus platform, that has been used for multiple vaccines, was a proven platform and safest to give to children. “The injectable polio vaccine we have given to a newborn baby…it’s a proven platform and the safest to give to children,” Ella had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covaxin-gets-nod-for-phase-ii/iii-trials-on-2-to-18-year-olds/articleshow/82588044.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

Advocate Paresh Jani, who is also the president of Ahmedabad Bar Association, wrote a letter to the chief minister and law minister, requesting financial support for lawyers across the state. He stated, “For more than a year now, court functioning is going on at snail’s pace. Many civil courts are completely closed. Lawyers are facing tremendous financial problems. They are facing many difficulties in maintaining their families, looking after children’s education and providing maintenance to parents.” Jani further mentioned that it has come to the knowledge of the Bar that governments in states like Rajasthan, Goa, Kerala and Delhi have extended substantial financial aid to the bar council. And the lawyers expect similar support from Gujarat’s BJP government. Last year, after imposition of lockdown, the BCG had extended financial aid of Rs 5,000 to young lawyers, who were finding it difficult to sustain their families due to closure of the courts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rs-50cr-govt-aid-sought-for-lawyers/articleshow/82588090.cms||---

The digital divide between urban and rural citizens is depriving the rural beneficiaries of the vaccination so to overcome the challenge, the ZP has roped in teachers. Since the beginning of the vaccination drive for citizens between the age group 18 and 44 years, the beneficiaries from rural areas have been deprived mainly as they lack high-speed internet connectivity and many do not have access to internet-enabled mobile phones. While the people from the urban area are rushing to rural vaccination centres as they registered immediately on the online portal.  The situation is similar for people above the age of 45 years, who now have to register before they turn up for their first dose. Dilip Swami, the chief executive officer of Solapur ZP, has issued a circular detailing the responsibilities given to various staff. The teachers and headmasters of the village level ZP-run schools have to identify the beneficiaries and get them registered. The local Setu Suvidha Kendra operator, which has high-speed internet connectivity, will have to facilitate the registration. He said, “Currently, there is limited vaccine stock. The rural beneficiaries must not be left out merely because they do not have access to the internet. We have asked the gram panchayats to issue slips to the beneficiaries, without which the beneficiaries will not be able to get the jab.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/teachers-to-help-register-for-vaccine/articleshow/82581506.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Covid treatment: HC orders setting up ofDist panels to look into public grievance||Prayagraj: The Allahabad high court on Tuesday directed the Uttar Pradesh government to constitute, within 48 hours, a three-member Pandemic Public Grievance Committee (PPGC) in every district comprising one chief judicial magistrate (CJM) or a judicial officer, professor of a medical college and an administrative officer of the rank of additional district magistrate (ADM) to look into the grievances of the public with regards to difficulties faced in Covid treatment in the state. The court further directed that in rural areas complaints can be made directly to the sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) of concerned tehsil, who shall transmit the same to PPGC. The committee will also take the trouble of looking into all the viral news itself. Earlier, the state government counsel had informed that the government had announced a compensation of Rs 30 lakhs to those who caught Covid infection during panchayat election duty, on which the court asked the state government to rethink about the compensation amount and increase it to Rs 1 crore. The court observed, “It is not a case that somebody volunteered to render his/her services during election but it was all made obligatory to those assigned with election duty to perform their duties during election even while they showed their reluctance.” While hearing a PIL relating to Covid care, a division bench comprising Justice Siddhartha Varma and Justice Ajit Kumar said that the recent surge of the Covid-19 pandemic in the state is engulfing in it the remote rural areas and smaller city and town areas of almost all the districts of Uttar Pradesh. The court went on to observe, “It would be in the fitness of the things that purchase of vaccine is not only expedited but vaccination programme is launched at a war-footing. Even in our last order we had made clear that unless and until everyone was vaccinated, nobody was safe. We hope and trust that the state government would try to purchase as many vials of desired vaccines as possible to vaccinate the maximum number and at least more than 2/3 of the population in 2-3 months time.” Not satisfied with the affidavit filed by Badugu Deva Paulson, secretary (home), Government of Uttar Pradesh, the court said that neither the required information as mandated by its earlier order was given nor compliance was made of its various directions passed earlier. The court was unhappy with the affidavit as no information regarding the number of ambulances in the state or the meal provided to Covid patients of government hospitals were stated in the affidavit. The court directed the state government counsel to apprise it as to how the state is managing Covid hospitals, requirement of oxygen, beds and life saving drugs and gadgets in districts of Bahraich, Barabanki, Bijnor, Jaunpur and Shravasti. The state government was also asked to disclose in its affidavit the number of testing done in these places (urban and rural) and laboratory from where the testing were being performed. The data has to be given from March 31, 2021 to May 10. The bench showed its concern about the vaccination of physically challenged persons and asked the Central government to apprise it as to how it proposes to inoculate such persons who cannot be brought to the vaccination centres and then those who cannot make online registration. Earlier on May 4, 2021, the bench had taken notice of the death of a sitting judge of the high court due to Covid-19. During the course of hearing, records related to his treatment were placed before the court and after going through it, the court directed the state government to constitute, within three days, a committee that will have a secretary level officer as its convener with a senior pulmonologist from SGPGI, Lucknow and a senior advocate to be nominated by the president/ Elders Committee of Awadh Bar Association as its members. The committee will conduct a fact-finding enquiry into the treatment administered to late Justice VK Srivastava and submit the report to the court within two weeks. The court also directed that no coercive measures shall be taken against Lucknow’s Sun Hospital and its staff, pursuant to an FIR lodged by Lucknow administration for allegedly raising “false rumours” about oxygen shortage. The court also said that death in cases of suspected Covid cases shall be treated as Covid death for limited purpose and observed, “If no TrueNat report is there and if antigen turned out negative of a patient, such patient’s case is taken as suspected one only, so no Covid protocol is followed and if he dies, his dead body is handed over to the members of family of the deceased without Covid protocol, which is quite a serious issue.” The court has fixed May 17, 2021 as the next date of hearing in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/covid-treatment-hc-orders-setting-up-ofdist-panels-to-look-into-public-grievance/articleshow/82586008.cms||---

While 3,16,290 beneficiaries had taken the first dose of vaccine, a total of 93,045 recipients had also received the second dose of vaccine. Officials said the health department has currently taken up vaccination exercise of recipients between 18 and 44 which is underway at 20 sites. A total of 25 sessions, including six in urban and 14 in rural areas, are being organised to cover the maximum number of beneficiaries. Besides, beneficiaries above 45 of years are also vaccinated at other centres in both rural and urban pockets. Additional chief medical officer and district immunization officer (DIO) Dr Teerath Lal told TOI, “On an average, we are covering around 7,000 beneficiaries every day of all age groups including above 45 and recipients between 18 and 44 years.” For instance, a total of 7,532 vaccine shots were administered to recipients of all age groups in the past 24 hours which included 6,234 recipients of first dose and 1,298 of second dose, he said adding that more and more people are getting themselves registered on the health department’s portal for vaccination. Interestingly, there has been a steep rise in the number of recipients between 18 and 44 years of age getting them registered with the CoWin portal. The fact is that a long queue of recipients can be spotted at six urban centres including MLN Medical college, Duffrin hospital, Railway hospital, MD Eye hospital, TB Sapru hospital and Urban PHC (Daraganj) waiting for their turn. Similarly, elderly were also lined up to get themselves vaccinated at others centres including MLN Divisional hospital (Colvin hospital). Health officials admitted that “as around 60 percent of district population falls in the age category between 18 and 44 years, the number of such recipients was more compared to elderly group slot. As a result, 20 sites of vaccination have been reserved for them to cover the maximum number of this age group of recipients at the vaccination centres and also to create a database of people in the target age group”. However, getting registered on the CoWIN web portal and taking an appointment to get a Covid-19 vaccine jab has been mandatory for those aged between 18-44 years. Officials, however, made it clear those who have already received the first dose at private or government vaccination centres and want to get the second dose, needn’t get registered as their registration has already been made on portals. They would have to walk in at any government centre to get their second dose. A senior health official said, “There has been an increased demand for vaccination once the vaccination for the age group of 18-44 years is opened. And, for better management and control, registering on the CoWIN portal and taking prior appointments to get the shot has been mandatory for those aged between 18-45 years to tackle the rush of recipients. In the city, more eligible recipients are turning to Covid vaccination centres to get the shots. However, recipients from urban pockets turning up at vaccination centres is more as compared to rural community health centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/over-4-09-lakh-given-covid-vaccine-jab-so-far/articleshow/82585995.cms||---

Vimal Kumar, a senior teacher in the upper primary school of Bisanda block, was deployed in the district’s integrated Covid command & control centre. The suspension came after an audio clip (which is in possession of TOI) of Kumar’s conversation with the attendant of a patient, Geeta Pushpak, went viral on social media. Pushpak was admitted in the district hospital after testing positive for Covid-19. The suspension order from basic shiksha adhikari of Banda, Harishchandra Nath, stated that Kumar had maligned the image of the local administration by giving false and misleading information to the patient’s attendant. Kumar’s behaviour is against teachers’ code of conduct rules, Nath wrote in his order. Nath told TOI that the action followed instructions of the district magistrate. “He (Kumar) has maligned the local administration’s image. The teacher is accused of backbiting. The administration is 100% dedicated and is working round-the-clock to save lives,” Nath said. He added, “The teacher, instead of consoling the attendant, went all the way to support his anti-government stance. All of us are involved 24x7 to help people.” In the audio clip, Kumar is heard saying that senior officers do not listen to anyone and deploy teachers to take calls for feedback from patient’s attendants. The caller also expressed his lack of trust in the Banda administration. On this, Kumar said, “Don’t depend on the administration. As our duty, we call attendants and note down each and everything they say and then forward it to the DM. But what can we do if they don’t act. Everyone I spoke to has complained of lack of facilities and proper care.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/banda-teacher-placed-under-suspension-for-remarks-against-govt/articleshow/82590395.cms||Isha Jain

Kahan se lagwayein vaccines (how will one get vaccinated) when there is none. What is the point of the message,” a bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli told the Centre’s lawyers. “You have been playing that one irritating message on the phone whenever one makes a call, that people should get the vaccination, when you (Centre) don’t have enough vaccines. You should give it to everyone. Even if you are going to take money, give it. That is what even children are saying,” the bench remarked, adding that the government needed to be “innovative” in such things. The court said the government should prepare more messages instead of preparing just one and running it even while the ground situation had changed. “Till like a tape it stops running or starts skipping you will run it for 10 years?” it asked. It also suggested using television anchors or producers to create short programmes on making people aware about use of oxygen concentrators and cylinders or on vaccination, which could be aired on all the channels. On the suggestion floated by some lawyers, it agreed that celebrities, such as Amitabh Bachchan, could also be asked to chip in, but added a caveat that all this “needed to be done soon.” “We are losing time. There should be a sense of urgency,” the bench said and directed the Centre and Delhi government to file their reports by May 18 on what steps were they going to take for disseminating information on Covid management via print, television media and caller tunes. Meanwhile, the AAP government informed the bench that it had not been extensively using the Feluda test for Covid detection as it had a high false positives. It said, while RT-PCR had a longer turnaround time, it could give results of 96 samples, while Feluda gave one sample in half an hour. The bench then asked ICMR to examine the government’s stand and revert, pointing out that Feluda was an ideal test to keep ready when the lockdown ended, and the city reopened. “We can’t remain like this all the time. We must be open and prepared for the future so that immediate samples can yield results. If efficiency is there, cost is less then you can use it in certain areas extensively when the city opens,” the bench said. The court had earlier asked Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) why the Covid tests — Feluda and RAY — developed by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) had not gained popularity like RT-PCR. It also asked ICMR to inform it about the efficacy of both the tests after being informed by amicus curiae and senior advocate Rajshekhar Rao that, not only did both these tests had an efficacy equal to or better than that of the RT-PCR, but they were cheaper and gave faster results in less than an hour. Rao even added that RAY was an improved version of Feluda. The court said all the ICMR-approved tests should be available to the public, especially those that were cheaper and gave accurate and faster results.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-caller-tune-when-no-vax-is-available-hc/articleshow/82615771.cms||Abhinav Garg

Though slots have started appearing “green” on the portal for some users, the issues after that are causing many to lose the slots instantly. Citizen Anurag Joshi said, “When I saw the ‘green’ slot under a particular vaccine site, I clicked on it and was led to the time slots. I was then prompted to fill in the captcha code. The code is case sensitive and one takes time to type it. By the time a person selects the time slot and fills in the Captcha code, the slots get booked by other users.” A state health department official told TOI, “Every vaccination site has limited slots, while there are so many registered users always waiting to book a slot as soon as it is available. The captcha feature had become a necessity to preclude the possibility of bots used by certain individuals to automatically and wrongfully book slots in bulk. That is why the users are led to fill in the captcha after the slots appear green, so that it can validate human intervention.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-fastest-finger-first-trick-on-co-win-flops/articleshow/82588205.cms||Neha Madaan

---||Allahabad||EC, higher courts, Govt failedto see risk of holding polls: HC||Prayagraj: The Allahabad high court has observed that the Election Commission, higher courts and the government has failed to fathom the disastrous consequences of permitting the elections in a few states and panchayat election in the state of Uttar Pradesh. “While the Covid-19 infection had not reached the village population in its first wave last year, it has now spread to the villages,” the court further said. According to the court, the state government is having a tough time in controlling the spread of novel coronavirus in urban areas, and it would be very difficult to carry out tests, detect infections, and treat the population in the villages. “The state lacks preparation and resources for the same at present,” a single judge Bench of Justice Siddharth said in an order allowing an application for anticipatory bail of one Prateek Jain of Ghaziabad on Monday. Prateek was an accused of the offence of cheating. The court observed that on account of the recent panchayat elections in Uttar Pradesh, a large number of FIRs had been lodged in the villages. “Even otherwise the crime rate in the villages is quite high in the state,” it said. “Keeping in view the overall situation of the villages after the panchayat elections, a large number of accused persons may be infected and their infection may not have been detected,” the court said. The court said that “if an accused dies on account of the reasons beyond his control when he could have been protected from death by the court, the grant or refusal of anticipatory bail to him would be an exercise in futility. “Hence, the apprehension of death on account of reasons like the present pandemic of novel coronavirus can certainly be held to be a ground for grant of anticipatory bail to an accused.” There were several ways in which an arrested person could contract the virus, the court said, including from jail inmates, police, and court personnel. “There is no proper testing, treatment and care of the persons confined in jails,” it added. The high court referred to the recent judgment of the Supreme Court permitting journalist Siddique Kappan to be transferred to AIIMS for treatment after he was infected with Covid-19 in Mathura, and added that in this context “the fundamental right to life unconditionally embraces even an undertrial”. In view of these facts and circumstances, and also finding that the apprehension to life in the current scenario is a ground for grant of anticipatory bail to an accused, anticipatory bail is granted to the applicant, the court held. The court gave this decision on May 10.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/ec-higher-courts-govt-failedto-see-risk-of-holding-polls-hc/articleshow/82586027.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||SC stays HC order on bank accounts of defaulters||HYDERABAD: The Supreme Court has stayed the Telangana high court order stopping banks from unilaterally declaring accounts of defaulters as accounts of fraud without hearing them first. A three judge bench comprising Justices Rohinton Fali Nariman, BR Gavai and Hrishikesh Roy heard the appeal of the State Bank of India in the case of Rajesh Agarwal, founder of BS Company, staying a portion of the HC order that made it mandatory for banks to give a personal hearing to the fraud account holders before declaring their accounts as fraud. The bench, however, asked the SBI and other lender banks not to act upon the decision taken by joint lenders’ meet in respect of BS Company till it decides the appeal and posted the hearing to July 13. Following a master circular issued by it in July 2016 asking the banks to be cautious with big loan defaulters, the RBI said banks should declare such accounts as fraud if they find their activities to be suspicious. The RBI contended that banks can prevent further defrauding by the same borrower. Scores of banks are now following this circular and declaring defaulters and their accounts as frauds. BS Company in its plea before the Telangana HC argued that it was unfair on the part of the RBI to prepare a circular that has no space for hearing the version of the borrowers before declaring them as frauds which will have severe consequences on them. “No bank will give us fresh credit facilities,” it said. The HC in its order said that the circular must include provisions that will offer a personal hearing to the aggrieved borrowers. Advocate general BS Prasad, who argued the case of SBI, gave a legal opinion to the SBI to appeal against the relief granted by the HC to Rajesh Agarwal and BS Company. The SBI in its appeal before the apex court contended that a hearing opportunity to the borrower is not required as the identification of account as fraud by the fraud identification committee of the bank is made through a proper in-built mechanism. The books of accounts of the company are audited by the external auditors basing on which the committee makes its decisions as the time is of crucial importance in such cases to prevent further fraud by way of cautioning other banks and financial institutions. They mark such accounts as ‘red flagged accounts’. This is an internal process and the borrower need not be a part of it. The SBI also argued that the RBI has made a distinction between ordinary defaulters and wilful defaulters and laid down a separate process for identification of fraud accounts. The SBI defended the classification made by the RBI circular that made a distinction between chartered accountants and promoter directors of the companies. “Obtaining a loan is not a fundamental right and you have to follow the norms of banks when you avail that facility,” the SBI said in its appeal. The apex court adjourned the case on July 13 for further hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sc-stays-hc-order-on-bank-accounts-of-defaulters/articleshow/82588104.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

There is so much work that When you have the responsibility of transporting 16 to 17 patients to hospitals and taking seven to eight dead bodies to crematoriums each day, you hardly get the time. It was on Monday that I went to my home to see family for two hours after a week,” More, a resident of Fatimanagar, said. More has been working as an ambulance driver for three years. “There are so many people getting infected each day and many are losing their lives. We get calls continuously and we have to be on the move. The work I am doing is dangerous and there is always a chance of getting infected. This is also another reason why I am not going home as I don’t want to endanger my family,” he added. More, manages to rest for a couple of hours either in the driver’s seat or in a corner of any hospital. “The toughest part is carrying the bodies and stopping the grieving relatives from touching them. However, I know that soon after the body is dropped off at the crematorium, I have to rush back, either to a patient desperate to get a hospital bed or transport yet another body,” More said. He added it was the conviction that he was helping people, which kept him going. “I try to convince myself that since I am doing a good job and helping those in need, God will always keep me safe from the virus. It is a way to stay positive and keep working. Being the only earning member in my family, stopping isn’t an option. I hope things improve soon so that I can go home, be with my family and get vaccinated,” More said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/civic-bodys-ambulance-driver-works-without-break-for-7-days/articleshow/82588047.cms||Joy Sengupta

The day after North Goa collector Ajit Roy issued the instruction, relatives were seen running from pillar to post to get a letter from their respective health officer, so that they could procure the much-needed oxygen cylinder before the nightfall. “I don’t know what to do tonight? The health officer from my area has refused to issue a letter stating he has not received any instruction from his seniors. The supplier has already told me that without the authorisation letter, he will not give me cylinders. I’m dreading the night. Even last night patients have died at GMC when oxygen supply from the central line snapped between 2am and 6am,” a patient’s relative told TOI. He was afraid to reveal his identity as his parent is still admitted at the hospital and his family may be targeted for being vocal. For over a fortnight, relatives of patients at GMC, the biggest state-run hospital, have been compelled to make contingency plans by procuring oxygen cylinders privately to make up for the shortage of oxygen supply at the hospital and more so to plug in when the flow from the central line is interrupted. Eyewitnesses, patient attendants, who can be relatives/acquaintances/friends or hired helps — Goa is probably the only state that allows a Covid patient under treatment at a government hospital an attendant — as well doctors on duty, have been informing that the oxygen supply from the hospital’s central line is routinely interrupted between 2am and 6am for the last many days. Health minister Vishwajit Rane on Tuesday had admitted that many deaths have been recorded at the GMC between 2am and 6am. “The last night was no exception. A patient had an argument with the ward sister after he saw a patient next to him die following fluctuations in the oxygen supply. The nurse said she was helpless,” a patient’s relative told TOI. Another patient’s relative said that till late Wednesday evening he was not able to get a letter from the health officer. “Many have been unable to secure cylinders privately today because of this reason. I’m really worried about tonight. There have been 70 Covid deaths today,” she said. Even if they manage to get a letter from a private doctor, she said, it is not sufficient as it needs to be stamped by a government doctor. She said that the spare cylinder they had was utilized last night for a patient next to her mother’s bed. “The patient became ill when the oxygen supply started dipping in the night,” she said. She said her mother was very serious last week, and though she is better now, she still needs oxygen support. “She has seen so many patients dying due to a drop in oxygen level. Her blood pressure fluctuates at night and so we use our oxygen cylinder mostly during nights. I’m keeping my fingers crossed that tonight we don’t have to witness harrowing scenes of patients dying after disruptions in oxygen supply,” she said.  The new dictates of the district collector also affect patients needing to be given oxygen support after being discharged from the hospital as getting a letter or having it stamped by the health officer will only add to their misery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-oxygen-refilling-order-adds-to-patients-woes/articleshow/82588124.cms||Bindiya Chari

Jadhav has also directed the paediatricians to increase the number of beds for children in their hospitals. The civic chief’s instructions came during a meeting of paediatricians held at Rajiv Gandhi Bhavan — headquarters of Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC). There are only 600 beds for children in over 50 paediatric hospitals in the city. The NMC has decided to set up a 100-bed paediatric ward at its new Bytco hospital in the city that will have special ventilators and other facilities for children. The government has projected that the third wave of pandemic is also likely to infect children. Accordingly, the civic administration has started preparations for the same. “We had a meeting with the civic chief about Covid treatment of children during the third wave and the task force of civic and government officials along with paediatricians and other experts,” Hemant Sonanis, president of Indian Medical Association (IMA) Nashik chapter, said. “We were not prepared for the second wave and we had to face various difficulties due to rising cases of Covid-19. We faced shortage of oxygen, remdesivir and availability of beds. Hence, we should be prepared for the third wave with proper management from oxygen to remdesivir and beds for critical patients,” he added. Raj Nagarkar, president of private hospitals owners’ association in Nashik, said this is a positive move by the civic chief. “We should be prepared for treatment of children infected by Covid-19 during the third wave,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/civic-chief-wants-25-bed-reservation-for-children/articleshow/82581564.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Lucknow||‘Akhilesh misleading people on vax drive’||Lucknow: State MSME minister Sidharth Nath Singh on Wednesday accused Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav of misleading people about the vaccination programme and weakening the movement to end coronavirus pandemic. Singh said as Yadav was creating doubts in the minds of people about the vaccine, he would be responsible if people did not take vaccine shots and end up getting infected. “The state has already vaccinated 1.45 crore people. Initially, Yadav said it is a BJP vaccine and spoke against it. Now, he is talking about a policy for vaccination. People have already lost confidence in the SP leader,” he said. Singh said an example of SP’s politicisation of the issue was the fact that they kept asking for free vaccination whereas they were aware that the Centre had declared free vaccination for those above the age of 45 years while the state had announced free vaccination to those in the age group of 18-44 years. “Yadav and other SP leaders are making statements from the comfort of their rooms. They should step out and meet the people and see the work done by chief minister Yogi Adityanath. A party which pushed the state into a mess during the five years of its rule is even now thinking of 2022 elections. In 18 days, we have managed to reduce Covid cases by half and the recovery rate has reached 85% which is better than all states,” Singh said. He added that Yadav should learn from the CM who, despite being Covid positive, continued holding virtual meetings. As soon as he got better, he started touring different parts of the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/akhilesh-misleading-people-on-vax-drive/articleshow/82590433.cms||---

With retail sector taking a major hit due to partial lockdown and other restrictions imposed by the state administration, revenue of store owners at malls have taken a major hit. So much so that mall-owners have begun receiving contract termination requests from various stores. In Ahmedabad, malls were asked to remain shut over weekends since end of March this year. From April 29, they had completely shut down operations in the wake of fresh guidelines issued by the state. “We have begun receiving contract termination notices from a few stores. This is despite offering partial rent waiver after the lockdown last year. Retailers are in a bad shape and brands have laid off quite a bit of their staff members or else have slashed salaries as they are unable to meet operational costs amid declining revenues,” said Aditya Shah, the chief financial officer (CFO) of an Ahmedabad-based mall. After a decent revival in footfalls around January-end, people once again stopped visiting malls from the second half of March. Since then, according to industry estimates, mall footfalls fell by over 50%. “With footfalls going down, business fell to 30% in the month of April. This is because people used to shop during the weekends, but that took a hit. The mall where my store is located witnessed a few shops shut down permanently with effect from April,” said Rakshit Desai, who owns a clothing store at a city-based mall. Most stores which are shutting down are either luxury brand stores or clothing and apparel stores. Retail business taking a hit is indirectly impacting the business. “The fear of getting infected, amid a more severe second wave of Covid-19 infections, is so high that people prefer staying at home. As a consequence, footfalls and, in turn, retail business at malls took a hit. Despite offering lower rentals along with other relief, stores have been giving notices to cancel their contracts,” said Jayesh Kotak, managing director of Iscon Balaji Group, which manages a city-based mall. The situation has left mall-owners in a lurch as managing malls and meeting its operating expenses be it security, staff salaries, maintaining the premises, along with bills and tax payments is not possible without revenue inflows. In fact, many of the mall owners have also declared that they would not be able to honour property tax and other payments in absence of revenue inflow. Discounted rent to the tune of 50% has been offered by many malls to retailers and yet, business has failed to recover.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/revenue-hit-retailers-look-to-shut-shops-in-malls/articleshow/82588222.cms||Niyati Parikh

A South Delhi Municipal municipal corporation-run mother and child care centre’s official address is stated to be MCW Nehru Place primary health care centre. However, it is actually located in Giri Nagar, wasting the time of people allotted the site. Many complaints have been raised in this regard on social media platforms, but to no avail. Complainants said that on reaching South East district’s Nehru Place primary healthcare centre, the address on the vaccination portal, they realise that there is no such centre. In reality, the centre being referred to on the site is located in Giri Nagar near Kalkaji. The Giri Nagar location is around 2.6km away from the Nehru Place and the wrong address is causing much inconvenience to people who are forced to search for the real location. “Wrong and incomplete address of the Covid vaccination centre at MCW Nehru place in South East Delhi has created havoc to the citizens who got appointment online for this centre. Instead of Nehru place it's in Giri nagar. Pincode is also misleading,” said one Vinod Bansal. Many were seen asking for milestones or landmarks near the actual site of the centre. Ranjan Basu said that his 2nd dose of vaccination is allotted to the Nehru Place centre, but he wasn’t able to find the location on Google maps. A municipal official said that the matter can be dealt with by the district immunisation centre. “If the portal states the wrong address, then the district immunisation officer can get it changed,” the official said. The centre is administering the Covishield vaccine and all its slots are booked — still displaying the wrong address on the Co-Win portal — at the time of going to print.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/wrong-address-for-vax-centre-causes-misery/articleshow/82615835.cms||---
---||Delhi||Foreign aid not for central hosps alone: HC||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Wednesday told the Centre it should ensure that foreign aid, in the form of medicines and equipment meant for the capital, don’t just go to hospitals and institutions managed by the central government. A bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli said if aid was being given to the national capital, let the Delhi government distribute it. “When you give to Delhi, you should look beyond institutions and hospitals being managed by the central government. The aid should go where it is most needed and can be most utilised. It should go where it serves the purpose for which it has come — for the benefit of Covid patients,” the bench said. The court’s comments came after senior advocate Rahul Mehra raised the issue. “The problem is in Delhi — both Centre and state think Delhi is theirs,” the bench remarked after the Centre said the aid was “targetted and equitable”, but AAP government alleged discrimination. “We do not want to stoop to this level of quibbling, but if this (distribution problem) continues we will pass orders,” the court added. The central government claimed that initially the distribution was centralised, but now it was being sent to the states, who decide to which institutions they want to give the aid. The court said that till Tuesday aid for Delhi was not being given to the government for distribution and asked the Centre from when the situation has changed. Even the amicus curiae, senior advocate Rajshekhar Rao, told the court that according to certain documents on record, the aid was going to institutions in Delhi and not the Delhi government. The court directed the Centre to give a chart indicating how much aid has been sent to Delhi and to which institutions it has been distributed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/foreign-aid-not-for-central-hosps-alone-hc/articleshow/82585963.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The government also called upon both sides to not do anything to change the status-quo on the ground. India’s Permanent Representative to the UN, Ambassador TS Tirumurti tweeted that in the UN security council meeting on Tuesday on the escalation in east Jerusalem, he said India was “deeply concerned at clashes and violence in Haram Al Sharif/Temple Mount” and “equally concerned about evictions in Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan neighbourhoods.” He said India called on both sides to avoid changing the status-quo on the ground. He added that the old city also houses Al Zawiyya Al Hindiyya — The Indian Hospice. India also condemned rocket fire from Gaza, Tirumurti tweeted. A 30-year-old Indian woman in Israel, Soumya Santosh, was killed in a rocket attack by Palestinian militants from Gaza, as per officials. Junior minister (MEA) V Muraleedharan on Wednesday said he had spoken to the woman’s family members and assured them of all assistance. “We have condemned these attacks and the violence in Jerusalem, and urged restraint by both sides,” he said. India also urged restraint of all parties and to adhere to Security Council resolution 2334, which reaffirms that “the establishment by Israel of settlements in the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967, including east Jerusalem, has no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law and a major obstacle to the achievement of the two-State solution and a just, lasting and comprehensive peace.” The resolution also “reiterates its demand that Israel completely cease all settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territory, including east Jerusalem, and that it fully respect all of its legal obligations in this regard.” Tirumurti also stressed the need to immediately resume direct peace talks and commitment to a two-state solution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/deeply-concerned-over-west-asia-clashes-india/articleshow/82592646.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Two held for Kukatpally ATM robbery, killing guard||HYDERABAD: Cyberabad police arrested the two accused in the sensational armed robbery at HDFC bank ATM in Kukatpally on April 29. A 74-year-old security guard was shot dead by the offenders during the daylight robbery, and with their arrest, the police solved five cases in the city. Before committing the robbery, the accused tested the weapon at Dundigal forest area. The accused have been identified as Ajeet Kumar, 23, a labour contractor at a packaging company in Dundigal, and Mukesh Kumar, 21, from Gandimysamma in Dundigal. The duo followed the ATM cash loading van of Writer Safeguard company on April 29 on a stolen bike, and tried to loot the cash when the staff stopped the vehicle at HDFC bank’s ATM in Vijaya Nagar in Kukatpally to load Rs 12 lakh in the ATM. The security guard of the company, Ali Baig, stood in front of the ATM centre while cash loading officer, Naveen and ATM officer Srinivas entered the ATM centre. Ajeet and Mukesh got down from the bike and went to the ATM centre. “Ali Baig tried stopping them, and when the accused pointed the gun at him, he tried to snatch it and the accused shot him. Naveen and Srinivas then tried to stop the accused but the offenders fired at Srinivas, causing a leg injury,” Cyberabad commissioner VC Sajjanar said. In the scuffle, Ajeet’s helmet fell down and he rushed towards the bike, while instructing, Mukesh to grab a cash bundle from inside the ATM. Mukesh picked up Rs 5 lakh cash bundle and the duo escaped on the bike towards Usha Mullapudi Kaman, the commissioner said. Baig succumbed to bullet injury at a local hospital. The police zeroed in on the suspects through CCTV footage and cell phone analysis. Police identified that the same suspects had committed another armed robbery at Lakshmi Money Transfer services in Quthbullapur on April 16 and had stolen Rs 1.95 lakh cash and a cellphone of the manager by threatening him with pistol. After the robbery, they took shelter at a friend’s house in Toopran for two days and returned to their room in Gandimysamma on April 18. Subsequently they stole two bikes at Dundigal, Keesara and used one of the bikes to commit the robber at Kukatpally on April 29. The duo parked the bike at a temple in Medchal and walked to their room. The police arrested the duo from their room and recovered Rs 6.3 lakh cash, a country-made fire arm, a live round and an empty magazine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/two-held-for-kukatpally-atm-robbery-killing-guard/articleshow/82588241.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Sedition charges slapped on newly elected pradhan||LUCKNOW: Sedition charges were slapped on Wednesday against the newly-elected pradhan of Belauta village, Aslam Khan, and his four associates, who were arrested last week by Sitapur police for allegedly raising anti-India slogans and praising Pakistan. Khan’s family told TOI he was implicated by his rival. Superintendent of police, Sitapur, R P Singh, said a preliminary probe was launched and the video/audio footage of Khan’s remarks were analysed. “He was clearly heard raising pro-Pakistan slogans and the sedition charge was added to the FIR on basis of solid evidence. We had arrested the accused on May 8,” he said. Talking to TOI, the pradhan’s elder brother, Shakeel Khan, alleged the rival candidate had “planted” youngsters in the crowd, who raised pro-Pakistan slogans. “He videographed the procession and used the footage to frame my brother,” he said. Shakeel said, the video circulated on social media showed children raising slogans and neither his brother nor any adult was part of the procession. “A right-wing outfit had mounted pressure on police to add sedition charges in the FIR. He was initially booked only for violating Covid guidelines,” he said. Station house officer, Thanagaon, Anil Singh said, Aslam and his associates, Salman, Atiq, Farid and Arif, had come out on the streets to celebrate the victory. “Beating drums, Aslam and his supporters raised pro-Pakistan slogans, which could have triggered a communal clash. A police team reached the spot after complaints from residents,” Singh said, adding Aslam and his supporters also flouted Covid-19 guidelines. On May 8, Khan and his aides were booked for outraging religious feelings and under sections of Epidemic Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sedition-charges-slapped-on-newly-elected-pradhan/articleshow/82590512.cms||---
---||Delhi||‘No case against Remdesivir for mothers-to-be’||New Delhi: After the death of a Covid-infected pregnant doctor and her unborn child in Faridabad, doctors and experts claimed no medical studies supported the view that administration of Remdesivir adversely affected pregnant women. Professor Neerja Bhatla, head of obstetrics and gynaecology at AIIMS, said both Remdesivir and plasma therapy could be given to pregnant women and added that National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation recommending Covid vaccination for pregnant and lactating mothers was a welcome step. “We have given Remdesivir to pregnant women and it has been fine. Plasma therapy has been undertaken only in select,” said Bhatla. “We have also used steroids like dexymethasone, but in limited quantity, four doses at the most, and in most cases the condition of babies proved good.” Dr Richa Sareen, pulmonology consultant at Fortis Hospital in Vasant Kunj, concurred. “None of the trials in the past have shown any adverse effects of steroids or Remdesivir on pregnant women,” she declared. “Risk totally is from case to case. The only challenge is when a patient’s condition deteriorates during the 7th or 8th month and a call has to be taken whether to carry out a premature delivery or to wait for the patient’s condition to improve. But in Covid patients, especially in the current wave, the patient’s condition dips suddenly, so it is better to take out the baby.” The oxygen level of the pregnant doctor who succumbed to Covid had apparently dropped after being given Remdesivir. TOI also asked doctors if there was a link between the drug and the oxygen level. “There is no clinical evidence to show that administration of Remdesivir causes O2 level to drop,” responded Dr Archana Dhawan Bajaj, obstetrician and gynaecologist, Nurture IVF Delhi. “The drop in oxygen level could be a coincidental effect of the natural progression of the disease. After the use of Remdesivir, what is considered more critical is the rise in transaminase levels. In pregnancy too, there is no rationale to suggest that a fall in O2 levels occurs due to Remdesivir.” However, Bajaj added, the use of Remdesivir in pregnancy has to be done with caution. She also said that use of convalescent plasma in pregnancy has been documented in several cases in medical literature now worldwide. “Significant usage is being done where indicated, but of course, judicially tailored and designed with the Covid team and obstetrics team,” said Bajaj. “It has shown significantly improved outcome with decreasing mortality and morbidity and has decreased use of mechanical ventilation in pregnancy. Importantly, the dosage of convalescent plasma has to be adjusted in pregnancy and the transfusion rate and dose will be different from a non-pregnant woman.” She added that the timing of the plasma infusion was important and early intervention was associated with significantly better outcomes. “Wherever it is used with caution, plasma therapy has shown improved outcomes in the mother and Remdesivir the foetus,” maintained Bajaj. Antiviral injections have had no adverse effects as yet, pointed out Dr Sonia Naik, director and Head of obstetrics and gynaecology at Max Hospital, Saket. While welcoming the recommendation on pregnant and lactating mothers being vaccinated, she said, “Pregnant women vaccinated in pandemics in the past. In the current situation, it’s better to be vaccinated than to get Covid.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-case-against-remdesivir-for-mothers-to-be/articleshow/82615896.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Destination government units for second jabs||KOLKATA: People whose second doses are pending at private Covid vaccination centres (CVC) will have to head to government units. Each private centre has been tagged with one or two government centres where they can send their first dose recipients for the second jab when it is due. Private hospitals have started informing the recipients accordingly. “We have the list of people who would have either got the second doses at one of our three AMRI units. Since the government has asked us to send them to their centres, our responsibility is to inform them where they should go for the second shot. We have started calling our beneficiaries up telling them about the centres tagged with us,” said Rupak Barua, group CEO of AMRI Hospitals. Hospitals, however, said that a clearer communication from the government about the change in vaccination drive could have helped them organise it better for people whose second doses are due. “Information like whether the beneficiaries need to book an appointment, number of people we can send in a day and also if we could send a representative from our hospital to the CVC tagged with us to assist our beneficiaries — these things would have helped us organise it better. But we will start intimating those who have received the first dose from us,” said Sudipta Mitra, CEO of Peerless Hospital. RN Tagore Institute of Cardiac Sciences has decided to use both phone calls and WhatsApp blast to inform its beneficiaries. The hospital has been tagged with two CVCs — one for Covishield and the other for Covaxin. “Even as we inform them about the two centres, we will also tell them that they have the option of choosing any of the 174 government CVCs where they can approach for the second dose depending on the convenience of the locality,” said R Venkatesh, regional director (East) of Narayana Health. The private CVCs have not been getting any vaccine supply since May 1 from the government as they have been told to procure vaccines on their own. People whose second doses are due numbers between 3000 and 15,000 in each private centre. “We have called up people whose second shot is due by May 28 asking where the Covaxin recipients should go and where the Covishield recipients can get their second dose. We are informing them in phases,” said Subhashis Datta, general manager (operations) at Ruby General Hospitals. Meanwhile, the AMRI Hospitals expect to get some vials of Covaxin in the next couple of days. In such a case, the group has plans of using those for the second dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/destination-govt-units-for-2nd-jabs/articleshow/82585935.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Many have claimed that test results are taking over two days to arrive. “My father has several Covid-19 symptoms, including breathlessness and we got him tested but there was delay in getting reports,” said Sai P, a software professional, and added that the doctor advised hospitalisation if the report came back positive. “We frantically searched for oxygen beds and started making arrangements. The report came back positive after two days. Now, they are doing other tests and the doctor says that if symptoms don’t subside, we have to get him tested again,” he said. Families said that it would be better if they can get reports in six to twelve hours so that they can start treatment on time. “We have been hearing that in many cases, patient’s situation is worsening because of delay in treatment. Diagnostic centres should be directed to test a sample in a stipulated time and give results,” said PR Murthy, who lost his brother to Covid-19. In the state, the current price for Covid-19 testing has been capped at Rs 500. For testing and home collection of samples, the price is fixed at Rs 750. However, diagnostics centres are charging anywhere between Rs 1,500 and Rs 2,200 to speed up the process and give results early. Some even took to Twitter to raise the issue. “It has been 48 hours. I am still waiting for my RT-PCR test results,” read a tweet from Sugandh Rakha. Few on social media pointed out that they have been waiting for RT-PCR results for days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/delay-in-rt-pcr-test-results-keeps-patients-on-tenterhooks/articleshow/82588234.cms||---

On Wednesday, the seven-year-old ‘shattered’ it herself, breaking open her piggy bank and donating the Rs 1,516 in it to the chief minister’s Covid-19 relief fund. Pranavika, daughter of Tangedco junior assistant T Palaniswami, said her priorities changed just on Tuesday night when she saw a television advertisement inviting people to donate to the chief minister’s Covid-19 relief fund. Her father was also an inspiration for her - Palaniswami had donated Rs500 to the relief fund last year and received a certificate mentioning his contribution. The Class II student of the city-based PSG Children’s School said she was well-informed about the contagion that has forced the schools to remain closed and people to follow preventive measures like wearing face mask and maintaining social distancing. “I know it’s a virus and spreads from one sick person to another by touch and air. I also know that if we wash our hands and legs, and wear a mask, we can avoid it. People die because of corona,” she says. Her father said Pranavika was fascinated by the certificate that he had received for his contribution to the chief minister’s Covid-19 relief fund. “When I showed it to her, she asked if she could also contribute to the fund. I said she could, but from her own savings or money.” It didn’t take long for Pranavika, who has been saving money for identical silk skirts for her and sister for the next festival, to make up her mind. “I decided to donate my savings to buy medicines and equipment for the Covid patients.” Palaniswami said he had received a WhatsApp message from the Indian Overseas Bank, calling for donations. “So, we went to the bank on Wednesday morning, emptied her entire savings in the piggy bank and deposited that by filling a bank challan.” While they have asked for a certificate for Pranavika’s contribution, hoping the same would inspire her friends and her to take up more such charitable initiatives, the bank officials have asked them to wait until they get back to them. Pranavika said she had saved Rs 4,000 last year from the pocket money she received and by collecting all the change she could find in the house. “I bought a bed for my newborn sister, and some sheets, a net and other items for myself with the amount.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/7-yr-old-girl-donates-money-saved-for-pattu-pavadai-to-relief-fund/articleshow/82588248.cms||---

Yet, amid this crisis, these frontline workers have remained undeterred and have continued to treat patients in the Covid wards of the Nashik Civil Hospital. “Our job is to lessen the pain and suffering of the patients. While on the job, many of our ‘sisters’ have lost their dear ones. But none of them has asked for non-Covid duty fearing the threat of the third wave of Covid,” said Shama Mahulikar, the deputy matron of the civil hospital. On the occasion of International Nursing Day, TOI spoke to the nurses on Covid duty at the 200-bed facility. Pratiksha Patil, one of the nurses, said, “Looking after the patients in a PPE kit — that prohibits one from consuming anything for the next eight to 12 hours and using the washroom — is a very tough job. But that hardly matters once we don the protective gear our only aim is to ensure the well being of the patients.” The nurses have been working hard for the wellness of the patients. “For each of us, every patient is important. When we lose a patient to Covid or a natural cause, it pains us as well. We understand the value of a person in a family. We also have one,” said Puja Pawar, a nurse who is also the president of the district association of nurses. Meanwhile, the deputy matron expressed the need to increase the number of nurses and attendants. “The norm says one nurse is required for three beds, but currently, we have one nurse per nine to 11 beds depending on the situation. More than 20 nurses have tested positive and hence we are grossly overworked. This is the situation all through the year,” Mahulikar said. The nurses only hope people follow the Covid norms to protect themselves so that there is less pressure on hospitals. “We are here to serve you. But we are humans too. There is a limit to mental stress. By the time we complete our shift and go home, we are so tired that we become oblivious to any issues and we fall asleep. We are unable to meet our family commitments as well,” said Mahulikar urging the citizens to wear masks Collector’s appeal Collector Suraj Mandhare has also appealed to the citizens to follow Covid appropriate behaviour and contribute to the fight against Covid that these nurses are waging bravely. “Their service to humanity is unparalleled,” said Mandhare.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nurses-put-up-strong-fight-amid-covid-crisis/articleshow/82581649.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Mumbai||Court rejects bail plea of Mumbai woman who ‘sold infants’||MUMBAI: Observing that trafficking a new born is a serious offence, a sessions court on Tuesday rejected the bail plea of a Mumbai woman, who is accused of selling two infants. The woman, Nisha Ahire, was arrested along with several others after an alleged illegal adoption racket was busted by the crime branch in January. It was alleged that while baby girls were sold for Rs 60,000, a baby boy was sold for Rs 1.50 lakh. The chargesheet in the case has been submitted against the accused on March 17. It was alleged that Ahire sold the new born male child to a Pune resident and the girl to someone from Dadar. The woman denied the allegations and said that at most, proper procedure for adoption was not followed and there was no monetary transaction between the parties. The defence also sought parity with two other accused, Mohan Suryavanshi and Sanjay Pandam, who were granted bail on May 3. The prosecution opposed the bail plea and said that this was not the case of a simple adoption. Calling the woman the main accused, it said that the woman had taken the help of hospital staff and other accused and sold the infants. The prosecution said that if released on bail, the possibility cannot be ruled out that she may sell children again. It also submitted that the woman’s role was bigger than that of the other accused. The investigating officer also told the court that the woman had trafficked eight babies and a supplementary chargesheet would be submitted in the case soon. Rejecting Ahire’s plea for bail, the court said, “I have gone through the charge sheet along with the application. The role of the present accused is of selling the new born child along with the co-accused. The ground of parity for her release because the co-accused are released is not applicable to her, considering her role in the crime,” the court said. The court further said that the the prosecution’s apprehension about her tampering evidence, cannot be ruled out. “The nature of offence i.e human trafficking that too of a new born child is serious,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-court-rejects-bail-plea-of-woman-who-sold-infants/articleshow/82590657.cms||Rebecca Samervel

The plant will cater to the requirement of 35 beds out of the 100 beds with oxygen support, including six ventilator bed at the hospital, which is a dedicated Covid health centre (DCHC). Nashik MP Hemant Godse, who inaugurated the plant, said the plant has been raised through the CSR funds and the efforts are on to ensure the district has proper oxygen back up before the third wave of Covid, if and when it hits the region. “We are all fighting Covid and oxygen happens to be the main key in the battle against the infection. This is the reason that we appealed to various business houses to donate for such equipment. We have received one PSA and that has been installed at Sinnar,” Godse said. Varsha Lohade, the medical superintendent said it was a much-needed support and well in time. Sinnar is one the most affected towns in Nashik rural areas and this DCHC is one of the biggest in the district, she said. Of the 150 beds in the DCHC, 50 are general beds for patients who do not need oxygen but require to be hospitalised. The officer pointed out that the dura cylinders and jumbo cylinders were available in ample numbers. But the PSA has fortified the hospital as far as the need for oxygen is concerned. She also said since the burden of supplying oxygen for about 35 beds was shared by the plant, the same number of cylinders would be helpful in other cases and other hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/sinnar-rural-hospital-sets-up-psa-oxygen-plant/articleshow/82581662.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Doctors and national guidelines suggest that people who had mild infection and did not have to be hospitalised, should not go for retesting. However, this has not deterred many from taking medications on their own. “Once I tested positive, I had to shift my mother to my cousin’s house. I was confident that I had recovered but my retest showed that I was positive even after 15 days. After checking with a few friends, I restarted my medication. On the second day when my online consultation was confirmed, my doctor immediately told me to stop taking the medicines,” said Srikanth, a young patient who has not tested negative even after a month now. Read AlsoIt may now take up to five days for testing &amp; results in MumbaiWith a rapid rise in Covid-19 cases, the wait for RT-PCR test results now stretches over two days. Many laboratories take 24-48 hours to schedule appointments for home collection of samples.“There is no reason to panic if a retest shows a positive. It could be due to the residual RNA in the nasal mucosa or it might even be a false positive. In any case, medication is not required as infectivity beyond two weeks is highly unlikely. Testing and retesting is actually leading to wastage of resources. There are also harmful side-effects like digestive issues seen in patients who take antibiotics or steroids on their own,” said Dr Rahul Agarwal, consultant for internal medicine at Medicover Hospitals.

---||Delhi||Abrupt transfer of Army Base Hosp commandant raises eyebrows||New Delhi: In a move that has raised eyebrows in military circles, the commandant of the Army Base Hospital in Delhi Cantonment, which has been converted into a large Covid facility for soldiers, has been abruptly transferred out barely three months before his retirement. The Army, however, called the posting of Major General Vasu Vardhan as “an additional officer” to the Army Hospital (R&R) “a routine transfer” after an 18-month tenure as the Base Hospital commandant. Major General S K Singh, who was posted as the deputy commandant of the Army Medical Corps Centre & College in Lucknow, has been appointed the new commandant of the Base Hospital, as per the order issued on May 10. Maj Gen Vardhan, a respected respiratory medicine specialist who was at the forefront of the battle against the Covid-19 pandemic, lost his mother just a few days ago and was back on duty on the same day. “There is speculation the transfer order was issued after Maj Gen Vardhan refused to entertain some calls for admission or Remdesivir injections from the office of a VVIP,” said a doctor. Maj Gen Singh takes over as the commandant of the Base Hospital at a time when it is being expanded to a 1,000-bed Covid-19 facility from the initial 450-bed one. The Base Hospital, like other military hospitals in the country, is currently overwhelmed with patients. Chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat on Wednesday, incidentally, visited the Base Hospital and the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel hospital, which was set by DRDO, to review their overall functioning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/abrupt-transfer-of-army-base-hosp-commandant-raises-eyebrows/articleshow/82586047.cms||---

Currently, they are excluded from the Covid-19 vaccination drive because of lack of clinical trial data on the effect of the vaccine on them. DCPCR has advised the government to categorise pregnant and lactating mothers as high-risk groups and create a registry for their vaccination so that a continuous monitoring mechanism can exist to see if there are any adverse effects. In his letter, Kundu wrote, “Each year, 2.6 crore women deliver children...add another 2.6 lactating mothers and we have close to 5.2 crore women left out of the programme. Clearly, this is a critical population, both in number and vulnerability.” Kundu added that Centre for Disease Control (CDC) classifies pregnant women as being “at increased risk of severe illness from Covid-19 when compared with non-pregnant people”, and has recommended their vaccination. “India administers a different set of vaccines and not the MRNA ones on which the CDC data is based. So, impact of the vaccines here is still not known due to lack of clinical trial data,” Kundu said. DCPCR has advised the government to form a working committee to look into the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/vaccinate-pregnant-women-dcpcr/articleshow/82615937.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Doctors want vaccine safety for kids as third wave fears loom||KOLKATA: With the US Food and Drug Administration having allowed Pfizer to inoculate12 to15 year-olds from this Monday and India’s very-own Covaxin having received the nod for trials on a vaccine for those aged between 2 and 18 years, expectations are high among city paediatricians about an effective vaccine that will help curb Covid among youngsters — thousands of whom have been afflicted in the last one month. Even though the severity of cases has been moderate, the growing number is a worry, they say, pointing out that in case a third wave strikes, infants and children could turn out to be most vulnerable since they remain the only group out of the inoculation fold. Number of deaths could be higher, they warn. Unlike the first wave, pediatricians are alarmed at the rising number of youngsters affected with Covid this time and have made a strong plea for vaccinating for those aged 12 and above as soon as possible. While the elderly and the middle-aged were most affected in 2020, this time the young adults and children have tested positive most frequently, said paediatrician Santanu Ray. “Almost every family with an adult Covid patient now has a young member who is affected. Their immunity has been breached more frequently this time, fortunately, though, cases have been less serious,” said Ray. But he warned that children with co-morbidities — especially juvenile diabetes or congenital heart problems — have been suffering just as much as adults. “I have 16 children under my treatment now and though a few are in hospital, they happen to be pretty serious. One has a very serious lung condition and the other is suffering from a cardiac ailment that make them vulnerable,” he said. RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) chief consultant, paediatrician and neonatologist Indraneel Roy Choudhury agreed. “Along with younger population, children have been affected in large numbers this time. While the intensity of illness is low and hospitalization is less than1%, we can’t leave them out of the vaccination fold. It’s good that efforts are on to design a vaccine for them. Children could be the most affected group next,” said Roy Choudhury. The vaccine for children should be introduced within the next 2-3 moths if possible, felt Roy Choudhury. “Initially, we had seen a lot of apprehensions about adult vaccines but they are gone now. So, in emergency any vaccine will help to save children’s lives,” he said. Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education & Research professor Diptendra Sarkar, however, felt that the third wave seemed inevitable and teenagers could turn out to be the largest affected group. “It should be a race against time to get the vaccine ready for those aged two and above,” said Sarkar. Institute of Child Health director Apurba Ghosh felt a child vaccine will emerge soon, but it was still more important to save the elderly and the middle-aged. “We haven’t yet been able to inoculate the majority of the population. So, my priority will still be an adult vaccine than a juvenile one,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/docs-want-vax-safety-for-kids-as-3rd-wave-fears-loom/articleshow/82586026.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

Manorama Mohanty, head of the IMD Gujarat, said that the possible cyclonic activity in the Arabian Sea would bring light thunderstorm and surface wind gusting up to 30 to 40 kmph at isolated places in coastal districts of Gujarat, including those in Saurashtra and south Gujarat region, for the next two-three days. “We are keeping a close eye on the development of cyclone, and would be issuing periodic alerts,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-braces-for-possible-cyclone-authorities-take-stock/articleshow/82588379.cms||---

Delhi Jal Board (DJB) officials say 5% of the operations have been impacted in two water treatment plants, Bhagirathi and Sonia Vuhar WTPs, fed by Upper Ganga Canal. DJB has already been facing 50-60MGD shortage in raw water supply for the past two weeks in the Yamuna-fed Wazirabad pond. J P Sandhu of Ashok Vihar said the residents of Bunkar Colony were facing severe shortage for the past many days. “The situation is too grim,” he said. Priyanka Chadha from Paschim Vihar reported no supply in the area. “During this pandemic, where will we go with our kids? We appeal to the authorities with folded hands,” she said. Pankaj Sharma of L block in Mahipalpur said they had also been facing a crisis for several days. “We have visited DJB offices, but nobody is responding,” he said. Aman Zafar of Wazirabad village said their area had shortage since the past two weeks. “DJB puts up a notice after every few days that supply will be affected. The authorities should think about people who are suffering without water.” According to DJB, the supply in east, northeast and parts of south Delhi had been affected. Delhi has been facing issues such as an increase in industrial pollutants and ammonia, shortage of raw water supply and rise in debris and silt for the past one month. To supply 930-940MGD water daily, DJB sources 612MGD water from Haryana and 254MGD from Uttar Pradesh while the rest comes from subsurface sources like tubewells and ranney wells. DJB gets around 375MGD water through the Yamuna and the two canals from Haryana. Additionally, 220MGD comes through Bhakra Nangal storage. There is a supply-demand gap of 250-260MGD, which worsens during summers. Senior officials say Covid 19 has led to additional water demand pressure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/increase-in-silt-in-upper-ganga-canal-hits-water-supply/articleshow/82586205.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Meerut||Meerut: How can shrouds that go inside grave or burnt on pyres be stolen, asks Jain community as police look for answers||MEERUT: Days after seven persons, including the father-son duo belonging to the Jain community, were arrested for allegedly stealing 'kafans' from dead bodies in graveyards and cremation grounds, the Jain community of Baraut area of Baghpat has protested the “police excesses”. On Sunday, police had arrested a local shopkeeper Praveen Kumar Jain, his son Ashish Jain and nephew Rishabh Jain and their four accomplices — Shravan Sharma, Raju, Babloo Kashyap and Shahrukh Khan. According to local sources, the trader has a 40-year-old business of buying used clothes, including those from crematoriums and graveyards, to be sold again. The clothes included dhotis, shirts and sheets spread above the shroud and were discarded after the burial or cremation. Additional SP Manish Mishra said, “We’ll conduct an inquiry, but reselling clothes used in the last rights during the Covid time is itself a crime. It could help spread infection.” According to Amit Rai Jain, president of the UP Jain Conference, “It is customary for the relatives of the deceased to donate sheets and sarees at the time of cremation, which is sold in the market. This is not a crime. The trader was involved in this business for the past 40 years. It’s just the high-handedness of police that brought bad name to the entire community. This is a conspiracy.” On Wednesday, various trade organisations in Baghpat expressed solidarity with the imprisoned businessman and demanded quashing the charges levelled against them. “Police are treating the trader as if he was a gangster. Police called them ‘kafan chor’, even as they have no substantial evidence. We demand immediate release of the trader from jail and withdrawal of the cases against them,” said Yogesh Jindal, district president, Industries and traders welfare association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/how-can-shrouds-that-go-inside-grave-or-burnt-on-pyres-be-stolen-asks-jain-community-as-police-look-for-answers/articleshow/82583764.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Nagpur||1.25 lakh people due for second dose, district gets 63,000 doses||NAGPUR: Covid-19 vaccination was almost at a standstill in the city on Wednesday, for the ninth time in last 12 days, due to lack of vaccine stock. The situation is unlikely to improve much, as 1,25,310 people are due for their second dose, and on Wednesday the district received 63,270 doses for first and second dose of 45+ category people. Following directives of the state government, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) on Wednesday stopped inoculation of 18-44 year age group and diverted all doses of Covaxin for second dose of 45+ category. By days end, 912 people had been give the jab. The centre set up for Indian Air Force continued for its staff, where 51 were administered the vaccine. Vaccination did not happen at 94 centres as NMC had no doses. In rural areas, Zilla Parishad (ZP) continued inoculation of 18-44 year age group, and 262 took the jab on Wednesday. Inoculation continued in rural areas due to fewer beneficiaries, and distribution of as many doses as those in the city. The district on Wednesday received 63,270 doses, 62,200 of Covishield and 1,070 of Covaxin. Some 1,25,310 people are due for second dose in the district if one considers six weeks wait after first dose. The number will be more if one considers four weeks wait from first dose, which is also permissible. Of total 1,25,310 awaiting second dose, 92,848 are from 60+ and 45+ with comorbidities categories, healthcare workers (HCWs) 17,666 and frontline workers (FLW) 14,796 categories. Thus, the doses received on Wednesday will be enough only for 50.49% of those due for second dose. Though the civic body announced priority for second dose, 45+ people in large numbers are turning up at the centres for first dose. Thus, the shortage of doses is high in the district. As per state’s public health department, 2,40,511 people, including 1,85,533 of 60+ and 54,978 from 45+ with comorbidities, had taken first dose in the district as on March 31. Vaccine was rolled out for these age-appropriate groups from March 1. Also, 1,47,663 (61.4%) of these have taken second dose till May 11. Thus, 92,848 (38.6%) beneficiaries are due for second dose. Inoculation of HCWs started from January 16. By March 31, 54,413 had taken first dose, and 36,747 (67.53%) had taken second dose by May 11. Thus, 17,666 (32.47%) are due for second dose. Similarly, 44,472 FLWs took first dose by March 31. By May 11, 29,676 (66.73%) had their second dose and 14,796 (33.27%) are due for second dose. NMC on Wednesday said vaccination will resume for 45+ at 92 centres on Thursday. “Preference will be given for second dose as directed by the government,” the civic body said. Activist Narayan Ahuja told TOI, “Many senior citizens are arriving at centres, going to other centres and returning without jab for last 13 days. They are due for second dose. This problem is being caused due to interruptions in supply and vaccination. Inoculation of 45+ should continue regularly and vaccination of 18-44 years should be resumed after receipt of enough doses.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/1-25-lakh-people-due-for-2nd-dose-dist-gets-63k-doses/articleshow/82588501.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Though tests in the state dropped approximately by 15,000 to 20,000 between May 4 and May 12, the number of positive cases hasn’t fallen. On May 4, 99,418 tests were conducted in the state, out of which 16,974 samples tested positive. The test positivity rate (TPR) was 17% . In comparison, 77,032 people were tested on May 12 and the TPR touched 21.6 per cent as the state saw the spike of 16,384 cases. Despite the health department’s tall claims that 1-lakh tests will be done per day in May, just 41,619 patients were tested on May 10. The test positivity rate (TPR) was 40%, highest this week, as 16,487 samples tested positive. After analysisng the data, a source said, “The fall in the number of new cases can also be attributed to less testing. Since May 4, testing above 90,000 occurred only three times on May 4, 5 and 6. If the department had tested more people, the rate would have been much more higher.” Across the state, the highest number of tests were done in the Jaipur. On an average 16,000 samples are tested per day. Even on May 12, 14,406 tests were conducted in the state capital. On the contrary, least number of tests were done in Pratapgarh district. In the last 9 days, only 1,040 tests were conducted in the district with an average of 190 cases being reported. A source said, “The health department should not have reduced testing. Eighty per cent of the people are anyway asymptomatic and actual contact tracing on the ground is very poor.” Sources further said, “Testing capacity of RT-PCR, considered to be the gold standard for Covid, has reached its peak. Considering the fact the state government has allowed rapid antigen tests, which give faster results, but have lower sensitivity and can throw up false results. It is still better as it will detect many positive cases early.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ajmer/no-dip-in-covid-positivity-rate-despite-fewer-tests/articleshow/82593912.cms||---

It also gave BMC time till Monday to submit its plan on starting vaccination camps in every city ward. A bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni observed that if the door-to-door policy had been implemented, it could have saved lives and benefitted many. “More particularly considering some of the recent deaths,” said the bench. Justice Kulkarni mentioned lawyers got the “sad news” of the death of assistant government pleader G W Mattos on Wednesday morning. The high court is hearing a PIL by two city lawyers, Dhruti Kapadia and Kunal Tiwari, seeking doorstep jabs for the elderly, unwell or physically challenged, as well as assistance to register on Co-WIN and relaxation of the need for ID for the homeless and transgenders. “What has the BMC done about the homeless people sleeping under flyover bridges? They are a significant number…” said the bench. Chief Justice Datta recalled civic chief Iqbal Chahal had said BMC plans to start ward-wise camps to ease crowding in a meeting with the HC administration on Tuesday. Responding to the HC, additional solicitor general Anil Singh, appearing for the Centre, said there is a PIL on the door-to-door policy before the Supreme Court and the government has filed a detailed affidavit. In the May 9 affidavit, the Centre expressed reservations about door-step vaccination on the grounds of difficulty in managing any possible adverse effects, and avoiding ‘vaccine wastage’. The bench asked why he was citing the Centre’s affidavit before the SC when the government had assured the HC it would reconsider its policy on door-to-door jabs not being allowed at this stage. Justice Kulkarni said Kapadia has placed literature on door-to-door vaccination in the US. “Why not have a proactive and well considered approach… for senior citizens?” said the bench. “We have not said that it will never be done… we said at this stage,” said Singh. In the earlier hearing, the HC had said it “regretfully records that elderly citizens are literally being asked to choose between the devil and the deep sea” at present, referring to the huge rush at vaccination centres. It had also prima facie expressed dissatisfaction with the reasons being cited by the Centre in disallowing door-step jabs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/door-step-vax-drive-couldve-saved-lives-says-bombay-hc-bench/articleshow/82588505.cms||---

He also suggested to set up an oxygen plant in every assembly constituency. Mishra was addressing an online all-party meeting on Wednesday. He suggested to all the major political parties to form separate task forces of their cadres in each district so that they could provide necessary support to the district administration at the local level in case the third Covid wave hits the state. The governor said Covid infection was spreading fast in rural areas and a large number of people who are getting infected do not have separate rooms for isolation at home. He said isolation facilities for such people should be provided at community centres to prevent the spread of infection to other family members. The governor emphasised that vaccination along with rescue measures were also very important. He said in view of the demand at the central government level, efforts were being made to bring new vaccines in India. He called upon the representatives of political parties to motivate all voluntary organisations, trusts, NGOs and Bhamashahas in their respective areas to work together in this hour of crisis and support the administration in every way possible. Minister of state for education and Congress state president Govind Singh Dotasara said chief minister had also approved the proposal to provide Rs 3 crore from MLA fund for free Covid vaccination. An amount of Rs 1 crore from MLA fund will be used for strengthening the medical infrastructure in the Vidhan Sabha constituencies. In addition, an amount of Rs 25 lakh from the MLA fund could be used for supply of food items to the needy. BJP state president and MLA Satish Poonia said he was in constant contact with the central government to ensure adequate supply of essential medicines including oxygen and Ramdeviser in the state. He said the spread of the virus in rural areas was fast and so there was an urgent need for strengthening at the primary and community health centres. He suggested that action should be taken to stop black marketing of essential medicines and oxygen. Bahujan Samaj Party's Bhagwan Singh Bawa suggested increasing vigil along the interstate borders and providing financial assistance to poor families during lockdown. Ravindra Shukla of the CPM talked about ensuring availability of oxygen, Ramdevir injection and necessary medicines to Rajasthan as per the requirement of the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/prepare-in-advance-for-the-third-wave-governor/articleshow/82586201.cms||---

PCC president Govind Singh Dotasra on Wednesday slammed the BJP on the project. He tweeted, “During the pandemic when the central government is unable to provide vaccines, oxygen and medicines on time, BJP national president @JPNadda justifying the Prime Minister’s Housing and Central Vista Project is a cruel joke with the people of the country.”  The Modi government had granted the ambitious Rs 20,000 crore Central Vista project, a new parliament building with offices and residences of important government functionaries as an essential service during Covid. After Congress president Sonia Gandhi attacked the ruling party for the project, BJP president returned the favour by accusing the Congress of practising double standards. Dotasra said the Rs 20,000 crore used for the project could fetch 62 crore vaccine doses, 22 crore Remdesivir injections and 3.10 crore litre of oxygen and could create12,000 beds in various AIIMS. The charges assumes importance as the central government put the burden of vaccination on the state governments after it announced vaccination of the 18-44 age group from May1. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot also in a tweet said, “Due to lack of Covid vaccine in the country, many states are issuing global tenders to get vaccines from other countries. It would have been better if the central government had taken out the global tender and bought the vaccine and distributed it in the states and later adjusted cost from the state governments.” He added that, “The demand of the countrymen is that the vaccine of this deadly epidemic, like other vaccines, should be provided completely free of cost by the central government. This would create a system of one stop procurement which would be better for all states.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cong-attacks-jp-nadda-for-justifying-central-vista-project-amid-pandemic/articleshow/82586164.cms||---

Unavailability of ICU beds in Delhi, Ghaziabad and Noida is forcing people to explore options in nearby districts. Rahul Singh, 25, who was in a Faridabad hospital, was on Monday brought to the Meerut’s MSY Medical College on promise of better treatment. Rahul got a bed, again, but not in the ICU. He died on Tuesday morning. His father, Satpal Singh, went straight away to police after consigning his son’s body to flames. Bases on his complaint, Meerut police arrested both the accused, Harender Singh and Rajesh Kumar. According to sources, Satpal was promised an ICU bed for Rs 1.5lakh in the hospital. He had given Rs 40,000 as an advance payment. “My son was taken to the Faridabad hospital on May 6. But there was no improvement in his condition. Later, a contact of my daughter-in-law’s brother introduced me to the two men who assured me an ICU bed. They even took away Rs 40,000 in advance. But my son never got an ICU bed and he died there,” Satpal said. Sanjay Sharma, SHO of Meerut’s Kharkhoda police station, said, “The two men have been booked under avrious IPC sections.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/man-shells-out-rs-40k-for-dying-sons-icu-bed-cheated-by-frauds/articleshow/82583806.cms||Sandeep Rai

The traders’ body, however, met the police commissioner on Wednesday requesting him to allow them to open shops for a few hours to wind up the pending work. The request was turned down by the police commissioner. “Not all shops would have opened had the permission been granted. Many traders’ goods are stuck and there is a question of its security, so we had made the request,” said Manoj Agarwal, president of FOSTTA. Incidentally, when the district collector had allowed the Southern Gujarat of Chamber of Commerce and Industry to let shops in textile markets open for four hours on Tuesday, FOSTTA had opposed the move. Later, citing administrative reasons the collector withdrew the permission within a few hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/traders-plea-for-relaxation-turned-down/articleshow/82582984.cms||---
---||Meerut||Police officer with MBBS degree heads Covid centre for cops||Bijnor: Ganesh Kumar Gupta’s father, a humble street vendor in UP’s Gorakhpur, wanted to see him as a doctor. But Ganesh’s heart was somewhere else. He wanted to become a police officer. So last week, when Ganesh took over the charge of a big Covid-19 centre in Bijnor district, he was both -- a police officer treating patients. An MBBS degree holder, Ganesh had cracked the Provincial Police Service (PPS) exam in 2018. Now a DSP-rank officer, he is serving training period in Bijnor city as circle officer (trainee). And when the Covid-19 struck and hundreds of policemen started falling ill, Ganesh couldn’t resist dusting off his stethoscope he had packed and forgotten. After permission from his seniors, he took charge of a new Covid-19 facility where scores of policemen were being treated. According to sources, at least 162 policemen have tested positive for Covid-19 after returning from panchayat election duty in Bijnor district alone. And over 40 have the symptoms and their report is awaited. With no beds in hospitals, the department opened a new ward to treat the affected policemen. There are 2,611 Covid-19 positive patients in Bijnor and just 160 beds in the district. And most private doctors have shut their clinics out of fear. “In such circumstances, circle officer Ganesh Gupta has come as a boon. He is looking after all the policemen at the quarantine centre. Without him things would have been difficult for us. We all are proud of our officer,” said Dharamveer Singh, superintendent of police, Bijnor. Ganesh is happy wearing a PPE kit on the uniform. Recalling his journey to Bijnor Police Lines, he says, “My father, Om Prakash Gupta, had a shop on a street in Gorakhpur. He wanted to see me as a doctor. So due to my family’s financial condition and father’s wish, I had left the preparation for the police services midway. After clinching a good rank in NEET, I had joined Lucknow’s prestigious King George Medical university for the MBBS programme.” “After the graduation, I served as a medical officer in Delhi for 18 months. Later, between 2012 and 2018, I served as senior medical officer in UP’s Deoria district.” In 2018, Ganesh saw his dream come true. “I cracked the UPPSC exam in 2018 and joined as a PPS officer. I am under training as a DSP in Bijnor now. Two months of my training is left here,” Ganesh said. But the extent of the pandemic forced him to don the doctor's hat. “I contacted SP Singh and told him about my experience in the medical field. He asked me to take over the quarantine centre. My wife and younger sister are also doctors. I consult them too.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/police-officer-with-mbbs-degree-heads-covid-centre-for-cops/articleshow/82583814.cms||Harveer Dabas

---||Delhi||Ivermectin: Wonder drug? Not really, say experts||NEW DELHI: An increasing number of Delhiites infected by Covid-19 are now being put on Ivermectin – an orally administered drug that is generally used to treat parasitic infections. While the World Health Organization has warned against its usage for treating Covid, citing the lack of evidence about its effectiveness against the coronavirus, Goa announced on Monday that the drug would be given to every adult in the state, either as medicine for Covid or to build immunity against the virus. Experts and doctors in Delhi said that Ivermectin might be useful for people with mild Covid symptoms, but using it to build immunity was riskier. They felt that to build immunity, Ivermectin would have to be used over a number of days, but this could have side-effects. Dr Suneela Garg, member, Covid-India Task Force of Lancet Commission, said the May 5 guidelines issued by the Union health ministry were clear about Ivermectin's usage for mild Covid. “We only recommend its use in mild cases, like other drugs that have been used,” Garg reiterated. “Indiscriminate use of any drug, however, is not beneficial, particularly evidence backing its efficacy.” Also warning against Ivermectin's general use, Dr Soumya Swanithanan, chief scientist, WHO, tweeted on Tuesday, “Safety and efficacy are important when using any drug for a new indication. WHO recommends against the use of Ivermectin for Covid-19 except within clinical trials.” Dr JC Suri, director and head of pulmonary department at Fortis Hospital, pointed out that people took to chloroquine in the same way last year. However, the larger evidence did not suggest that either chloroquine or Ivermectin helped build immunity. He told TOI, “We have very little evidence to support that and the larger evidence, including global studies, suggests it may not actually be very effective. Chloroquine was tried out last year and discarded when found it wasn't effective.” Dr Suri cautioned, “If you use an anti-parasitic drugs over an extended period, there are bound to be some side-effects and we are not sure at the moment what these may be.” There was little justification in using Ivermectin, asserted Dr S.K Sarin, director, Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, noting that clinical trials held around the world by WHO pointed towards its limited efficacy in fighting Covid. “First, it does not help build immunity," Sarin said. “Then, it is also not protective in nature, in the sense that if someone has Covid, it cannot prevent the person from infecting others. Thirdly, even for an infected person, Ivermectin's efficacy is fairly limited, which is why WHO removed it from its recommended drugs.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/wonder-drug-not-really-say-experts/articleshow/82586292.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

He said there were no words to laud the nurses for their dedication and compassionate service to the Covid-19 patients for the past one-and-half years. Speaking at the event, Raveendran recollected how Florence Nightingale came from a rich family and travelled to care for the sick and wounded soldiers in the Crimean War. Looking at all the senior nurses holding candles, which was how Florence Nightingale used to visit her patients every night, he thanked them for their wonderful service during the pandemic. “Your service has been written about in the press and by patients. All the good name that the institution has received for Covid-19 care is only because of the contribution of the nurses, lab technicians and paramedicals,” said the dean, as he became emotional. In a pleasant surprise to them, he later knelt down before the nurses and the Florence Nightingale’s portrait. The nurses thanked him for his kind words. The day was also celebrated in the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital, where dean Dr A Nirmala thanked the nurses for their service during both the Covid-19 waves.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/esi-hospital-dean-honours-nurses-by-kneeling-down/articleshow/82588565.cms||---
---||Bareilly||Ambulance owner, 2 others sent to jail for overcharging Covid-19 patient in UP||BAREILLY: An ambulance owner along with two others were booked and sent to jail for overcharging a Covid-19 patient in Uttar Pradesh on Wednesday. The ambulance took Rs 15,000 - five times more as per the official guidelines - from the patient's kin for a distance of 40km, shifting from one hospital to another in Bareilly district. The complainant's father was admitted to a private medical college in a rural part of the district. With no sign of improvement in his father's health, the man decided to shift him to another health facility. So, he hired an ambulance and took his father to a city hospital. To his surprise, the ambulance driver demanded Rs 15,000 and the owner refused to reduce the amount. As per the district administration's 'fare chart', it cannot be more than Rs 3,500. The man paid the amount and got his father admitted first. Then, he informed the police. A police team soon met him and the ambulance was traced. Ambulance driver Mannu Kulkshrestra, technician Javed and owner Chandrashekhar were picked up and taken to Kotwali police station. Their ambulance was seized and they were booked under IPC section 420 (cheating) and section 27 of the Epidemic Diseases Act. Additional SP (rural) Rajkumar Agarwal said, “The man informed us that he was charged Rs 15,000 for shifting his father from one hospital to another. As per the rules, the amount should not be more than Rs 3,500. So, we arrested three persons and sent them to jail.” "People should inform us on '112' or on social media platforms if they come across any such cases of overcharging. Strict action will be taken against the perpetrators," Agarwal added. This is the second such complaint where people associated with health facilities have been booked by police for overcharging. A prominent businessman of Bareilly was earlier booked for demanding Rs 40,000 for an oxygen cylinder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/ambulance-owner-2-others-sent-to-jail-for-overcharging-covid-19-patient-in-up/articleshow/82581887.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Animal rights groups Amma Care Foundation and Plant and Animals Welfare Society had earlier written to senior police officials about the mysterious death of the exotic Red-eared slider turtle near Coral building, Highland Haven Complex, in Balkum Pada. “The turtle had fallen down from a great height in the concretised compound, but there was no clue as to who its owner was. Pieces of its shattered shell were removed from the spot,” said activist Sunish Subramanian of PAWS-Mumbai. “We wrote to the Thane police to inquire.” The police enquired with residents and identified the pet’s owner as Pratik Uttam Chaure on the 20th floor, and filed the FIR against him. “While the owner has said that it accidentally fell down while they were cleaning its water tank, it is surprising he did not come forward all these days when residents were asking one other about who owned it,” said Subramanian.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-turtle-falls-off-20th-floor-dies-owner-booked/articleshow/82590803.cms||Vijay Singh

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu plans global tenders to buy shots for 18+ inoculation drive||CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu government will float global tenders soon for buying Covid-19 vaccines to inoculate more than 3.65 crore people in the 18-45 age group in the state, chief minister M K Stalin said on Wednesday after a review meeting with senior ministers and officials. Nearly 45% of the state’s population belongs to this age group. The Centre allowed states to start vaccination for adults below 44 years from May 1 but said supply of shots must come from the states’ side. On May 1, Tamil Nadu did not start the drive as it did not have adequate vaccine stock. However, with increasing number of cases and death among healthy people below 40 years, the state has decided to vaccinate people for free from this age group on “high priority.” Many states, including Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka, are also floating global tenders, making way for Pfizer and Moderna to supply their jabs in the country. “The chief minister has been continuously reiterating the need for a universal vaccination programme,” a release from the state government said. “The government will expedite Covid-19 inoculation programme by floating short-term global tenders,” it added. On May 9, the state received its first batch of supply from manufacturers Serum Institute of India (3.5 lakh doses of Covishield) and Bharat Biotech (1.6 lakh doses of Covaxin) based on orders from Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation. “These vaccines will not be enough. Both the manufacturers have a combined monthly capacity of 7.5 crore vaccines. We had to go for a global tender,” a senior official said. Since January, vaccines purchased by the Union government at Rs 150 per vial have been used for vaccinating people above 45 years of age. “These vaccines are used only in GHs. Supply from all private hospitals have been withdrawn,” said joint director immunization Dr K Vinay Kumar. “Private hospitals have to buy the vaccine from the manufacturers directly,” he said. In Chennai, two hospitals – Apollo Hospitals and Gleneagles Global – offer vaccines for adults. The statement further referred to poor oxygen allocation for Tamil Nadu as compared to those allotted for other states. “Chief minister Stalin had represented to the PM seeking enhancement of oxygen allocation. In response to the request, oxygen allocation for Tamil Nadu was increased from 280 tonnes to 419 tonnes,” it said, adding that the state still had shortfall in its oxygen requirement. In view of this shortage, Stalin directed industries and medical and public health department to immediately install oxygen manufacturing units and to take steps to bring oxygen from steel plants located in other states. The departments must take immediate steps to bring oxygen by train and to distribute to hospital in needs without any hitches, Stalin said. Industries minister Thangam Thennarasu, medical and public health minister Ma Subramanian, and finance and human resources management minister Palanivel Thyagarahan were among those present in the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tn-plans-global-tenders-to-buy-shots-for-18-inoculation-drive/articleshow/82586230.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan to float global tenders to procure one crore vaccine doses||JAIPUR: The state council of ministers met on Wednesday and unanimously decided to procure vaccines from foreign countries by floating global tenders. Initially, one crore doses of vaccine will be procured. The national health mission has been made the nodal agency to invite expressions of interest (EOIs). The meeting, chaired by chief minister Ashok Gehlot, expressed concern over the rapid spread of corona infection and the large number of deaths happening across the country. But the vaccination drive has slowed down due to the lack of adequate supply of vaccines from the central government, the meeting noted. The vaccination for the 18-44 age group could be launched only in a few districts due to vaccine shortage even though this category has been the most affected in the second wave of the pandemic. The meeting noted that intense vaccination was key to saving the lives of people. The meeting gave the green signal to simplify the process of procuring life saving medicines, oxygen condensers, medical equipment and transport for medical oxygen. Instead of buying essential medicines from the market, it was decided to purchase them directly from pharma companies. On the occasion of the International Nurses Day and considering their contribution in fighting the pandemic, the meeting decided to redesignate nurse grade II as nursing officers and nurse grade I as senior nursing officers. Ministers in-charge of districts will regularly review relief provided by checking the infection situation and making adequate arrangements. They will be in constant touch with district administration through video conferencing, telephone and will coordinate to help the needy, raise resources with the help of philanthropists, and voluntary organisations. They will activate village-level committees for effective implementation of protocols and lockdowns with the participation of public representatives up to the panchayat level and take feedback from them. It was also decided to make the state self-sufficient in the production of medical oxygen, essential medicines, medical equipment and other resources to fight Covid as, according to experts, it was difficult to say when this pandemic would end. The meeting was also informed about a work order issued by the urban development department to set up 105 oxygen plants in 62 urban body areas. The ministers also appealed to the Muslim community to observe prayers at home during Eid due to the lockdown. Any kind of gathering would defeat the purpose of lockdown and the fight against corona, they observed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-to-float-global-tenders-to-procure-one-crore-vax-doses/articleshow/82588600.cms||---

Two such modified three-wheelers were flagged off from Mussoorie diversion by SSP Dehradun Yogendra Singh Rawat. These autorickshaw-turned-ambulances are equipped with an oxygen cylinder and sanitisers, according to the SSP Dehradun, who added that the auto ambulances will come in handy in emergencies when the regular ambulance services are not available. Significantly, the drivers of both auto ambulances have also been trained in medical emergency response by doctors, as per police officials. Initially, the auto ambulance service has been made available in the Rajpur police station area. They will operate 24x7 to take Covid patients to hospitals. After reviewing the response and its functioning, the service will be extended to other parts of the district, SSP Rawat said. It is to be noted that Uttarakhand police had launched Mission Housala on May 7. Under the initiative, police are going beyond their call of duty and conducting home delivery of oxygen cylinders, medicines as well as food for those who are infected with Covid-19 and unable to get any help.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/auto-ambulance-service-with-oxygen-support-launched-by-doon-police/articleshow/82583810.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Decision on easing curfew on May 18||GANDHINAGAR: Asserting that limited lockdown has been yielding encouraging results with the number of daily Covid-19 positive cases decreasing steadily, minister of state for home Pradipsinh Jadeja said that an appropriate decision on relaxation will be taken by May 18. The state government on Tuesday extended the limited lockdown — restrictions on commercial activity and night curfew — for a week until May 18 in 36 cities, including all municipal corporation areas of the state. “Traders have made representations to the government, seeking relaxation in restrictions. The limited lockdown has yielded good results and we have received cooperation from traders. The government will review the situation before May 18 and take an appropriate decision,” the minister said. Speaking of a complete lockdown, the minister said that Delhi, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and a few other states have clamped a lockdown to control Covid-19 spread. “But we have experienced earlier that a full lockdown triggered a large-scale exodus of migrant workers. At the moment, industries and factories are functional and workers are getting paid,” Jadeja said. “Considering the possibility of a third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, a high-level taskforce headed by the chief minister has started planning to meet the challenge,’’ the minister added. The minister said that while the state government has already held meetings to finalise pre-monsoon action plan, the meteorological department has forecast the possibility of low pressure in the Arabian Sea, which is likely to turn into a cyclonic storm by May 16. “The collectors of Kutch and all coastal districts of Saurashtra have been asked to activate the cyclone preparedness plan with full Covid-19 protocol adherence,” Jadeja said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/decision-on-easing-curfew-on-may-18/articleshow/82586247.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Cops to get tough on lockdown violators, fine them from today||Coimbatore: Getting tough on lockdown violators, police have warned of strict action against the people stepping out to the streets for trivial matters. City police commissioner (in charge) A Amalraj said the number of people stepping out of their houses and roaming around the city without any purposes has increased on the third day of the lockdown. “They will be fined and their vehicles will be seized,” he warned. While grocery, vegetable, fish and meat shops, and confectioneries are allowed to function till noon, police have advised the public to buy the essentials from the shops near to their residences, instead of venturing out far. People going to hospitals or buy medicines should produce the prescription before police during the vehicle check. Also, there are no restrictions on construction workers and employees of bakeries, fish and vegetable markets, and hotels for travelling to work. “Most of the daily wage labourers, including construction workers, don’t have any identity cards. They can go to their workplace. However, people from Vadavalli, Thudiyalur, Kavundampalayam and other areas are visiting Range Gowder Street to buy grocery items. They should buy the essentials from the shops in their localities and avoid traveling,” Amalraj said. Pointing out that they were just warning the people who were roaming the city without any purpose so far during the total lockdown, he said the situation would be different henceforth. “From Thursday, we will stop all the motorists to find the ones roaming in the city unnecessarily. Besides penalizing them, we will also seize their motorcycles. People should cooperate with us to ensure total lockdown.” G Stalin, deputy city police commissioner (law & order), called on the people to stay at their houses. “To buy groceries, people should go to a nearby shop. Only a person from a family should step out and it is advisable to buy grocery items for a week together. People should not come out often in the name of buying essential commodities.” In the neighbouring Tirupur, 400 people were fined on the day for not wearing face masks. The city had witnessed heavy traffic jams in all the three days of the lockdown, with thousands of workers stepping out of their houses to report for duty at the textile mills. Tirupur city police commissioner G Karthikeyan said the vehicle movement would come down from Saturday morning, as textile firms had decided to down their shutters from the night of May 14 to 24. “We have placed barricades in various places and that is the main reason for the traffic snarls. Police are stopping the vehicles and inquiring with the motorists, before allowing them to enter the city. Most of the textile workers come out for work in the morning on their two-wheelers. We stop them as well for verification and this also adds to the traffic congestion. We are also booking people not wearing face masks,” he told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/cops-to-get-tough-on-lockdown-violators-fine-them-from-today/articleshow/82588608.cms||A Subburaj

---||Jodhpur||Jodhpur to set up 15 oxygen plants||JODHPUR: Amid the aggression of the killer second wave, the district administration has started gearing up for the third wave by taking steps to boost its oxygen capacity. Sources said 15 oxygen generation plants are coming up in different hospitals here with support from the government and public representatives. All these plants are expected to be set up and made functional this month itself, thereby reducing dependency of oxygen supply from plants outside the city. Repeated attempts to seek details of these plants with regard to sources, places, capacities and costs failed to yield any results. Sources claimed that the key hospitals which have so far been earmarked for establishment of these plants are MDM Hospital, MG Hospital, Umaid Hospital, KN Chest hospital, 3 satellite hospitals and 3 dispensaries/district hospitals across the city. District magistrate Indrajeet Singh, who reviewed the preparations for establishment of these plants, visited all these spots and said it was imperative that essential resources like oxygen are arranged in abundance as a run-up to the third wave. It may be noted that two main Covid hospitals of Jodhpur, MDM and MG, are expected to have oxygen plants by next week. The plant at MDM, to be set up under NRHM with central support, is said to be the largest. The plant at MG Hospital, however, is being set up with support of Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat through Rs. 1.5 crore aid arranged by him through CSR funds of corporate. Besides this, the rural areas of the district have also been considered for self-dependence on oxygen, which till now are entirely dependent on city hospitals for oxygen requirement, thereby causing a huge burden on the already crumbling resources of these hospitals. Singh said one oxygen generation plant at either the PHC or CHC in each of the 11 subdivisions of Jodhpur would be set up shortly with the help of MLA LAD funds. It may be noted that the current requirement of oxygen for Jodhpur is hovering around 48 MT per day, against which, the city has been receiving 35-37 MT per day from the states like Odisha, Gujarat, Haryana and West Bengal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/jodhpur-gears-up-for-3d-wave-of-covid-19-to-set-up-15-o2-plants/articleshow/82586207.cms||---

It further said the number of Covid cases requiring hospitalisation is rising constantly, but oxygen supply for treating such cases was not increasing in a proportionate manner and because of that certain hospitals and medical institutions have started sending warnings that they will be unable to take any further admissions of patients. Thw affidavit said oxygen requiremnt will be 849MT by May 18. Mahatma Gandhi Medical College and Hospital in Jaipur, one of the leading facilities engaged in treating Covid patients, has stopped admitting patients on May 6 because of severe shortage of LMO and is struggling to take care of the needs of patients already under its care. It was only after reallocating resources from one hospital to another, it started readmitting patients late on the night of May 6.The state is increasing daily availability of oxygen to required consumption of 345 MT per day. Further, 43 oxygen generation plants have been established at the district and sub-district hospitals with a capacity for generating 25 MT oxygen per day. Around 125-140 MT of oxygen per day is being generated by commercial air separation oxygen preparation plants.It reiterated that no tankers of INOX were detained by the state and it was requisitioned under the provisions of Disaster Management Act, 2005. In fact, the tankers that were requisitioned were nitrogen tankers which were converted into oxygen tankers, said the affidavit.It further said there are 2,416 cryogenic tankers in India, out of which 35 (32 functional tankers) have been allocated to Rajasthan, which is 1.3% of the entire available resources despite the state having the largest geographical boundary and on account of which it has to lift oxygen from Bhiwadi, Jamnagar, Panipat, Burnpur (1,347 km ) in Bengal and Kalinganagar (1,746km) in Odisha.To lift 270 MT from these locations, Rajasthan requires tanker capacity of 1,100 MT as otherwise the allocated 100MT from eastern India can not be lifted. It is also pertinent to mention that INOX has a declared fleet of 565 tankers.At present, Rajasthan is managing its oxygen supply with only 32 tankers that are engaged round-the-clock with workers and drivers (including additional driver for each tanker) employed in shifts and on rotation basis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-affidavit-in-sc-says-oxygen-supply-not-meeting-demand-849mt-needed-by-may-18/articleshow/82586243.cms||Joychen Joseph

A pregnant Covid positive woman in her 30s was admitted in the Covid ICU for respiratory distress and was put on BiPAP (a method of breathing support). Doctors performed a lower (uterine) segment caesarean section (LSCS) to help the woman give birth to the baby. The baby had respiratory distress (breathing difficulty) soon after birth. Doctors immediately put the baby on CPAP (a form of non-invasive ventilation). His RT-PCR test later came positive. “Septic profile was sent and prophylactic antibiotic, IV fluid and other supportive management was started. The newborn had CPAP dependency so 2DECHO was done to rule out any cardiac issue, 2D-ECHO showed mild neonatal PAH. Gradually breathing settled with treatment,” said Dr SD Sharma, director and head department of paediatrics & neonatology of EHCC Hospital, Jaipur. He said the newborn tested Covid negative before being discharged. Currently the newborn is on room air and has no breathing difficulties is it is maintaining SPO2-99% and accepting and tolerating top feeds as mother is on ventilator due to Covid complications.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/city-docs-treat-covid-newborn-successfully/articleshow/82586249.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Rs 6 crore set aside by Maharashtra for Ajit Pawar’s social media handlers||MUMBAI: The cash-starved Maharashtra government has earmarked nearly Rs 6 crore for handling of the social media accounts of deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, who also holds the finance and planning portfolios. The general administration department on Wednesday promulgated an order signed by under-secretary R N Musale on the modalities for appointment of an external agency for handling the social media accounts as well as the task of ensuring that decisions taken by Ajit Pawar reach the common people. As per Musale’s order, the external agency will handle Ajit Pawar’s Twitter handle and accounts on Facebook, Blogger, YouTube, Instagram. Other things to be handled are sound cloud, WhatsApp bulletin, Telegram channel and SMS. The external agency will be appointed in consultation with the deputy CM’s secretariat and Directorate General of Information and Public Relations. The order mentioned that the DGIPR lacks professional and technical competence to deal with social media, so it was felt that it would be appropriate if an external agency was hired for the purpose. “It will be the responsibility of the external agency to ensure that key decisions and messages reach the people and that they are able to communicate with the DCM on his Twitter handle, Facebook, Blogger, YouTube, Instagram, sound cloud, WhatsApp and Telegram channel,” Musale stated in his order. The GAD has directed that the external agency should be selected from among the agencies which are already on the DGIPR’s panel, and it will be the responsibility of the DGIPR to ensure that messages on social media are flawless. If there is a need, DGIPR can provide more money to the agency which is already working for the CMO. It will be ensured that there will be no duplication of messages generated from the CMO and DCM’s office. Incidentally, the CMO has already appointed an external agency in July 2020 for handling its social media account. “Due process of e-tendering was followed while appointed the agency,” a senior official told TOI. A bureaucrat questioned the appointment of an external agency for the image makeover of Ajit Pawar. “We have a full- fledged DGIPR with a total staff of nearly 1,200 and an annual budget of Rs 150 crore. Then why do we need an external agency for the promotion of the deputy CM?” he asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/rs-6cr-set-aside-by-state-for-ajits-social-media-handlers-in-mumbai/articleshow/82590933.cms||---

The development comes a couple of days after Indian drug makers Cipla, Sun Pharmaceuticals entered into royalty-free, non-exclusive licencing agreements with Lilly for the drug. Dr Reddy’s said the partnership with Lilly comes at a critical juncture in the fight against the pandemic in India, and adds to the company’s existing range of Covid-19 therapeutics covering the full spectrum from mild to moderate and severe conditions of the disease in addition to a vaccine. Deepak Sapra, chief executive officer, API and Services, Dr Reddy’s, said in a statement: “From the start, we have been determined to explore every possible avenue against Covid-19. Our collaboration with Lilly will help us make yet another treatment option available to patients in India.” Baricitinib, which is a rheumatoid arthritis drug repurposed for Covid-19, has received restricted emergency use approval from the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) for use in combination with Remdesivir for the treatment of suspected or laboratory confirmed Covid-19 in hospitalised adults requiring supplemental oxygen, invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/dr-reddys-ties-up-with-eli-lilly-for-covid-19-drug/articleshow/82588649.cms||---

He was admitted in the same ward where she was working. Kamla, who was serving each and every patient in the ward, was never biased towards her husband and took care of everyone in the same way as she was taking care of her husband, but she failed to save him. Sister Anjali Chauhan, continued working even after losing her sister-in-law to Covid, who was admitted in the same ward where she was working. Many nurses like Kamla and Anjali, who have both been infected with Covid, in Doon hospital are working round the clock, leaving their kids and families behind. Talking to TOI, Kamla said that she will soon join back after taking some time off for her husband’s last rites. The hospital needs her just as much as her two children, aged 20 and 23, she added. “My kids have lost their father, I have lost my husband but I can save many people who will be someone’s father, someone’s husband,” said Kamla with tears in her eyes. For Anjali, the pandemic is testing time and she will not let her profession down. “It’s pandemic and I am required the most in hospital. This is not the time to cry or hold back for any reason. We have been trained like this and I am happy that I am able to serve people,” said Anjali. Deeksha Gania who is barely 23 hasn’t been to her home in Chamoli since last March as she didn’t want to risk infecting her family. “We sometimes have to do double shifts. My parents ask me to come home but right now I cannot do anything else apart from serving the people,” Deeksha said. Sister Bharti Juyal leaves her kids with her relatives and meets them once a week. “I see women struggle for oxygen, gasping. I know they too have children. Many leave the world. It’s depressing at times but I cannot be depressed. We sing songs and crack jokes to maintain our sanity. It’s tough but we will win the war against Covid,” said Bharti. Dr Ashutosh Sayana, principal GDMC, praised the work of nurses who he generally calls ‘sisters’. “They are actually like sisters to the patients. They try hard to save them. They have no less a role to play in patients’ welfare than family and a doctor,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/beacons-of-hope-nurses-in-doon-hospital-are-staying-away-from-family-and-putting-in-long-hours-to-serve-covid-patients/articleshow/82583819.cms||Ishita Mishra

Usgaonkar also denied that the panchayat had brought objections to the final rites. “Allegations made against the panchayat were false and baseless,” he said, adding that, “The family had some misunderstanding with the crematorium caretaker, who had merely stated that he did not have the keys to the place.” Two days ago, relatives of a Bastora resident who had died of Covid-19, were forced to conduct the cremation at Mapusa after they were denied permission to perform the last rites at the crematorium. The panchayat had convened an urgent meeting on Monday wherein a decision was taken that the crematorium will be managed by the panchayat till the new committee is formed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-backlash-new-crematorium-committee-in-bastora-to-be-formed/articleshow/82588634.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Show money or risk losing MIG project, DB Realty told||Mumbai: Show the money by June 30 or risk losing the project, a Bombay high court-appointed arbitrator has told builder D B Realty, redeveloping one of Mumbai’s largest housing society projects, Ten BKC, in Bandra (East). The redevelopment of Middle-Income Group I (MIG) Colony at Kalanagar offers new, larger homes to the 176 society members and an additional 800 apartments to the builder to sell in the open market. The project is roughly valued at Rs 3,000 crore. But redevelopment has been jinxed for over a decade from the time its members first decided to rebuild the colony situated on a 5-acre property touching the Western Express Highway. Last year, the developer stopped work on the project and failed to pay their rents for alternate accommodation (hardship allowance), forcing the society to terminate the agreement. The builder termed it “illegal” and challenged the society’s decision in HC, which appointed the arbitrator. The arbitrator, S J Vazifdar, ordered D B Realty (MIG Bandra Realtors) to furnish bank guarantees, fixed deposits and arrears towards rent by June 30. Vazifdar, ex-chief justice of Punjab and Haryana HC, ordered the builder to furnish three bank guarantees totalling over Rs 87 crore by June 30. The developer was also directed to furnish fixed deposits of Rs 18 crore in a nationalized bank, which will be in the joint names of builder and society. The arbitrator directed the builder to deposit Rs 5 crore to the society towards liquidated damages by June 30. DB will also have to deposit Rs 28 crore as arrears of hardship compensation to society members for the period June 6, 2020 to June 30, 2021. From July 1, 2021, the builder will have to deposit Rs 3 crore every month as hardship compensation to society. “If the builder fails to comply, the stay against the respondents (society) shall be vacated,” said the order. After rehousing 176 society members in new buildings free of cost, the builder will be able to construct around 800 flats to be sold in the open market. Of these, around 600 flats have already been mortgaged to HDFC, which has provided Rs 1,500 crore funding to the project. According to the MahaRera website, 363 apartments in the free sale component have already been booked. The builder is believed to have received 70% of the payment from flat buyers. DB, which claimed it spent Rs 1,200 crore on the project, later partnered with Radius Group to execute it. But Radius got a setback recently before National Company Law Tribunal, Mumbai. NCLT ordered “commencement of corporate insolvency resolution process” against Radius after it failed to pay back Rs 65 crore raised for this project from its financial creditor, Beacon Trusteeship Ltd. “We are settling this issue with Beacon before the NCLT,” said a Radius spokesperson, adding the project will restart soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-show-money-or-risk-losing-mig-project-db-realty-told/articleshow/82588727.cms||Nauzer Bharucha

A senior bureaucrat questioned the appointment of an external agency for the image makeover of Ajit Pawar. “We have a full- fledged DGIPR with a total staff of nearly 1,200 and an annual budget of Rs 150 crore. Then why do we need an external agency for the promotion of the deputy CM?” the bureaucrat asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maharashtra-to-pay-rs6-crore-to-handle-ajit-pawars-social-media-accounts/articleshow/82593032.cms||Prafulla Marapakwar

The usually bustling markets are deserted and the food stalls that sprang to frenetic activity after sundown during Ramzan are cold and empty. With Covid casting a gloom over the city, many Muslim families feel they shouldn’t indulge themselves, perhaps explaining why Jama Masjid’s Matia Mahal, considered a food and shopping hotspot during the holy month, is today so forlorn. Kallan Sweets opposite the Mughal-era mosque is known for its Ramzan fares such as khoya samosa, keema samosa and paneer jalebi. There were none of these this year. The nearly 80-year-old establishment saw a dip of “around 90% of customers”. Mohammad Shaan, co-owner of the iconic shop, explained, “Matia Mahal was almost fully shut. Because of the Covid lockdown, there were no shoppers from the city, only a few from the neighbourhood.” Ameenuddin, who runs a clothing store, too hasn't got the usual crush of festive apparel buyers. “For two years now, our business has been badly affected," he said in a low voice. "This is the most lucrative selling season, but we have missed out on two years due to the pandemic.” In fact, the jewellers at Chitli Qabar had announced the closure of the market from the first day of Ramzan when the city lockdown hadn't yet been announced. Ornaments shop owner Saeem said, “Customers often call to enquire whether we are open for the day, but we tell them it is better to be safe and at home.” Staying at home is also the plan for many on Eid. Shah Umair, who runs a social media digital agency, will not go home to Kolkata for Eid. He isn't feeling too enthusiastic about celebrating the festival. “I lost a few close people due to the pandemic and it would be irresponsible to have a celebration this year. As a token, I will order something good to eat,” Umair said, adding that the Ramzan-ending Eid is about meeting friends and family but that is not possible this year. Anas Tanwir, a Supreme Court lawyer, too lives alone in the city. “I want to continue my Covid assistance efforts as part of Eid,” he said determinedly. He has been providing help to people through his Indian Civil Liberties Union. Mufti Mukarram, imam of Fatehpuri Masjid in Chandni Chowk, suggested it would be prudent for people to "stay at home and pray for the well-being of the country's citizens". He added, "I will also pray for the central and Delhi governments so they can fight the pandemic.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-eclipses-ramzan-pall-of-gloom-descends-on-markets-in-walled-city/articleshow/82586411.cms||Mohammad Ibrar
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Set up oxygen plants, get 100-150% money back, says Govt||Mumbai: The Maha Vikas Aghadi government will return 100% to 150% of the investment of companies that set up oxygen generating plants in the state in the next couple of months, said industry minister Subhash Desai on Wednesday. The same incentive will be offered for expansion of existing oxygen plants as well as for erecting tanks, filling and refilling processes. The state cabinet on Wednesday approved Mission Oxygen Independence to set up more oxygen plants in the state, especially with the aim of attracting investments in 14 districts where there is not a single oxygen plant. This is to ensure the state is fully prepared for the onslaught of the third wave of the Covid pandemic. “At present, we have a deficit of liquid medical oxygen and we are dependent on other states for our needs. We want to change that and for this, the government will return the full investment by refunding the State Goods and Services (SGST) tax. We are also offering exemptions in stamp duty, electricity duty, besides a concession in power tariff of Rs 2 per unit for the next five years,” said Desai. The 150% waiver is being offered in districts such as Solapur, Bhandara, Gondia which are some of the 14 districts where there is a critical requirement for oxygen as they have not a single plant. “We have guaranteed assurance for setting up plants for an additional 800 metric tonnes. We want to increase it to 2,000 metric tonnes. While we want to encourage expansion of existing plants since the companies already have the technical knowhow, we want new plants in districts where there is a critical gap,” said Desai. Setting up of new plants would take some time as companies would first need to identify land. As part of ease of doing business, the government will ensure that all permissions and clearances are granted within 15 days of receipt of an application. A government press release said the state is currently generating 1,300 metric tonnes daily while the requirement is around 1,800 metric tonnes daily. Under Mission Oxygen Independence, the state plans to increase its generation capacity to 2,300 metric tonnes per day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-set-up-oxygen-plants-get-100-150-money-back-says-govt/articleshow/82588767.cms||Clara Lewis
---||Agra||Tractors, trucks on radar, sand smugglers use camels; 12 held||AGRA: After police started seizing tractor-trolleys and trucks carrying illegal sand, the mafia seem to have changed tack by using camels for ferrying it from the National Chambal Sanctuary in Madhya Pradesh’s Morena district to Agra in UP. Avoiding roads, the camels are being used to cross the now shriveled up river Chambal. Police came to know about the modus operandi after a video of camels laden with sand crossing the river went viral on social media. Twelve people were arrested. According to police, the camel owners were smuggling the sand from Morena to Agra’s Karkauli village through the river. Talking with TOI, superintendent of police (East) K Venkat Ashok said each camel was carrying two quintals of sand and it was meant for sale to local people. As the Chambal sand is of fine quality, it costs three times more than the Yamuna sand. “It costs Rs 6,000 for one trolley (around 20 quintals) as compared to Rs 2,000 for sand from Yamuna,” he said. Police are trying to trace the network of these people. Deputy conservator of Forest, National Chambal Sanctuary project (Agra), Diwakar Srivastava, said the department will also take action in the matter. He said, “This is a nesting season of gharials and turtles and hatchlings could have been crushed by the camels carrying sand across the river.” An FIR has been registered against the 12 suspects under IPC section 379 (punishment for theft) and provisions of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, Mines and Mineral (Regulations and Development) Act and Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act at Mansukhpura police station. We will increase patrolling in the area and immediate action will be taken, Srivastava added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/tractors-trucks-on-radar-sand-smugglers-use-camels-12-held/articleshow/82583881.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Dehradun||Dehradun: Rains block Naini-Almora road, rescue operations on in Devprayag||NAINITAL/DEHRADUN: Following a severe bout of rain on Wednesday, several scattered incidents of landslides and rubble damaging roads were reported from across Nainital district. The worst affected was the shrine of Kainchi Dham which was deluged and the Nainital-Almora national highway which was blocked for several hours. Sources said that two priests were inside the Kainchi Dham shrine, which draws thousands of devotees of mystic seer Neem Karori Baba. Both of them escaped unhurt. “It had been raining since noon and by evening, rubble entered the temple. The national highway was badly damaged and scores of vehicles were stuck on both sides of the highway,” said a local resident. The district disaster management officials meanwhile informed that similar incidents have also been reported from places like Mukteshwar, Bhowali and Ramgarh. “We have reports from these places that rubble has damaged some roads. We have asked our officials to reach the spot and present a report. However till now, there hasn’t been any loss of life or any significant damage to human habitations,” said district disaster management officer Shailesh Kumar. He added that work was ongoing to clear the highway. Meanwhile, search and relief operations continued in Devprayag which was hit by a cloudburst on Tuesday, felling buildings, bridges and damaging electricity and water supply lines. Several shops, houses and the building of an Industrial Training Institute (ITI) at Devprayag market were also washed away. No casualties had been reported, as no one was present in the market due to the lockdown. CM Tirath Singh Rawat also visited the disaster-hit areas on Wednesday and took stock of the search operation. Meanwhile, the regional meteorological centre on Wednesday issued an orange alert of heavy rainfall and thunderstorms at many places, particularly in the hill districts of Garhwal region. "Heavy rainfall is likely to occur at isolated places in Uttarkashi, Tehri, Rudraprayag and Chamoli districts of Uttarakhand. The activity will cover the districts of Kumaon region on Thursday with several places likely to witness heavy rainfall," said Rohit Thapliyal, senior scientist at Met centre. Besides, hailstorm is also expected to lash isolated places of Dehradun, Tehri, Pauri, Almora, Champawat and Nainital districts of Uttarakhand on May 13, according to the Met office forecast.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/heavy-rains-block-nainital-almora-highway-rescue-ops-continue-in-cloudburst-hit-devprayag/articleshow/82581973.cms||---
---||Nagpur||SECR neglects historic wells, paying lakhs to NMC for water||Nagpur: The South East Central Railway (SECR) is ignoring its historic traditional water harvesting structures by turning them into dumping wells. There were nine huge carpet wells but now only three survive. Of them, two wells are in dire straits. These historic wells were constructed in Motibagh in 1905 by the Britishers to cater to steam engines then. There wells, which apart from use by the railways, used to supply water to adjoining colonies. Social workers and volunteers in Motibagh have demanded the SECR to revive these wells and save money towards water bills. As per official figures, the SECR pays lakhs of rupees towards water bills to the NMC for procuring 65 lakh litres of water needed for the colony and railway establishments. The summer is at its peak and the water crisis is looming large, they said. “If these wells are revived this money can be saved, especially when the railways is facing funds crunch,” says Pravin Dabli who is working for Motibagh’s welfare. These giant wells of 60x60 diameter once supplied water to the Bhoslewadi village near Indora as well as the British stables, including the gun factory. The narrow gauge was established in 1905 and steam engines consumed huge water. Of the three wells in Motibagh Colony, only one is in use while the other two are fast turning into garbage dumps. Other wells have disappeared due to the construction of big buildings. One of the wells located at the pump house is currently live and still supplies water when there is a crisis. Dabli said, “Considering the future water woes in the city, why railway administration is ignorant about reviving these wells?” “On the lines of narrow gauge museum, these wells can also be showcased as tourism hotspots. The area falls in the constituency of guardian minister Nitin Raut and he needs to pay attention to this issue. These wells if revived will not only save money for the SECR but will also solve water woes of nearby colonies,” said Dabli. Senior divisional engineer Akshay Kumar said he was unaware about these well and will look into it. “Off-hand I don’t have figures how much we pay to the NMC towards water bills,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/secr-neglects-historic-wells-paying-lakhs-to-nmc-for-water/articleshow/82588722.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Chandigarh||Panel sniffs O2 hoarding by some pvt hospitals||Mohali: Many private hospitals are consuming oxygen beyond their requirement and could be hoarding or selling it at higher prices, according to a report of the oxygen management committee following a survey. “We have sent an oxygen audit team to verify the facts at all such hospitals. Warnings have been issued to hospitals indulging in consuming excess oxygen as per their bed capacity,” said deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan after receiving the report. He said, “We came to know that a private hospital with 70-bed capacity is consuming 4.2 MT of oxygen per day, whereas another private hospital with 140-bed capacity is consuming 2.7 MT of oxygen per day.” “If a hospital with higher bed capacity is consuming less oxygen than a hospital with lower bed capacity, something is suspicious. This is to be verified and action will be taken as per law,” he added. The committee had earlier concluded that Mohali requires 26 MT of oxygen daily to meet its the requirement. However, data provided by the administration mentions that oxygen consumption for last 24 hours was 37.45 MT in Mohali, out of which 32.95 MT was consumed at Covid hospitals and 4.51 MT at non-Covid hospitals. The requirement for next 24 hours is predicted at 24.27 MT. None of the three primary care hospitals in the district --- civil hospital, Phase VI; civil hospital, Kharar; and civil hospital, Derabassi --- has an in-house oxygen producing plant. The civil hospital, Phase VI, does not have L-3 category bed capacity too. Recently, state government has given five ventilators to the hospital but they were yet to be installed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/panel-sniffs-o2-hoarding-by-some-pvt-hospitals/articleshow/82550888.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

At the state-run Gandhi Hospital, the nodal centre for Covid-19, 1,236 patients were undergoing treatment and nearly 100 new admissions took place. “The footfalls are by and large same. There were 76 discharges and nearly 100 admissions,” said a source. Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences and Research (TIMS) and King Koti Hospital too were overstretched for beds as usual. “Since movement of patients has been allowed, there was not much of an impact felt on Wednesday,” said an official. Meanwhile, private hospitals also saw a heavy rush of patients, primarily Covid-19 patients. “Both our diagnostic services and Covid-19 emergency saw a lot of patients. Since there has been a shortage of beds in the last two weeks, the trend continued even on Wednesday,” admitted an official from a corporate hospital in Gachibowli.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/heavy-rush-of-patients-at-city-hospitals-continues/articleshow/82588732.cms||---

We need to conduct a strict drive against this rampant power theft,” Hakim said. Investigation into the electrocution of Rishab Mondal (25), an engineer of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation, on a flooded pavement in Dalhousie has pointed prima facie that electricity theft by some hawkers appeared to have claimed the youth’s life.  The Hare Street police, who registered an unnatural death case in this incident, started probing all angles, said DC (central) Rupesh Kumar. A forensic team examined the spot on Wednesday. Cops are also taking inputs from CESC engineers. “Going by preliminary evidence, we believe that a gang drawing electricity from our poles illegally by using hooks to run their makeshift stalls in various areas of BBD Bag was active there,” said a KMC electrical department official. Hakim on Wednesday sent condolences to the bereaved family and offered Rs 2 lakh as compensation. Mantu Mondal, father of the deceased engineer, refused to accept the compensation. “We won’t accept the compensation because it won’t return our son. Rather, we will be happy if the government ensures that none has to become a victim of electrocution like our son in the future,” he said. The city’s electricity provider CESC said its entire cable network in Dalhousie and the rest of central business district was underground. “We do not have overhead cables and wires. Both LT and HT cables are laid underground,” said CESC vice-president (distribution), Avijit Ghosh. Meanwhile, several areas of central and north Kolkata, including Ram Mandir-Mukhtaram Babu Street crossing on Central Avenue, Amherst Street, College Street and Sukeas Street, remained waterlogged on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/power-tap-loose-wires-led-to-death/articleshow/82586374.cms||---

Tourism minister Satpal Maharaj thanked the Centre for the approval which would expedite completion of a “major tourist attraction in Mussoorie”. The infrastructure project “Aerial Passenger Ropeway System” will reduce travel time between Dehradun and Mussoorie to 16 minutes from the current one hour, decongest the Doon-Mussoorie road and ferry 1,000 passengers in a single direction in an hour. The mono-cable ropeway will work under a Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode. The lower terminal in Doon will be situated at 958.20 meters and the upper terminal at 1,996 meters. The project is being constructed at an estimated cost of Rs 285 crore. The project will directly employ 350 people and give indirect employment to 1,500 people. Uttarakhand tourism minister Satpal Maharaj said, “This project will be a huge attraction for tourists which in turn will boost the state’s tourism industry and create employment opportunities.” Secretary (tourism) Dilip Jawalkar said, “The Dehradun-Mussoorie ropeway will be one of the fifth longest mono-cable detachable passenger ropeways in the world. This ropeway will be suitable for all seasons and attract both domestic and foreign tourists.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/centre-approves-transfer-of-land-for-doon-mussoorie-ropeway/articleshow/82583873.cms||Ishita Mishra

The government officials found seven patients admitted to the doctor's clinic for Covid-19 treatment. Among them, five have tested positive for the virus and the other two are complaining of symptoms. The officials sealed a section of the clinic at Avas Vikas in Roorkee to prevent the accused, Dr ND Arora, from running his OPD. The raid was led by the additional sub-divisional magistrate and additional chief medical officer. The action comes after the officials received a tip-off. It has also been learnt that the accused maintained oxygen supply with cylinders that he procured through black marketing. “We were the part of the team that raided the illegal Covid care centre. The patients will be shifted from there. We will take strict action against the accused doctor,” sub-inspector Devraj Sharma from Gangnahar police station told TOI.

Officials said the mill had become a Covid-19 hotspot because of noncompliance to the standard operating procedures to keep the virus away. Two other mills were sealed on Tuesday for similar violations after several of their employees contracted the virus. Based on the instructions of the district administration, officials were visiting all the mills and garment units in Tirupur to check for adherence to the Covid norms. The officials were also collecting swab samples from the workers and testing them. When the results came, 27 of the 64 employees of a mill at Senapathipalayam at Vellakoil were found to be positive for the viral infection on Wednesday. Inquiries revealed that the mill authorities had not ensured face mask etiquette and physical distancing at the workplace. Subsequently, a team comprising Kangeyam tahsildar, deputy tahsildar and the village administrative officer, sealed the mill.Similarly, a garment export unit in Tirupur city limits, where 18 of the 140 employees tested positive for Covid, was sealed on Tuesday. At Andipalayam, another unit was sealed the same day after more than two dozen workers contracted Covid-19. All the three places have been cordoned off and made containment zones.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/spinning-mill-sealed-in-tirupur-as-27-of-64-workers-test-positive-for-virus/articleshow/82588702.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Bagmari burial ground running out of space, KMC searches for new plot for Covid victims||KOLKATA: The Kolkata Municipal Corporation is searching for a large patch of werland, possibly in the East Kolkata Wetlands, to serve as a burial ground for Muslims who die of Covid-19. The KMC board of administrators’ chairman, Firhad Hakim, who also heads the civic body’s Mohammedan Burial Board, has asked the district magistrates of South 24 Parganas and North 24 Parganas to identify a suitable plot, preferably in the wetlands. The search has gained urgency as the biggest Muslim burial ground in the city at Bagmari, designated for Covid victims, has almost run out of space. With over 1,300 Covid bodies buried in the past one year, community leaders reached out to Hakim for a solution. The KMC had identified a large plot in Bantala to set up a new burial ground for Covid patients. But the place was rejected because of its inundation during rain. “The situation is serious. The Bagmari burial ground has little space left and we are looking for space in the wetlands to come up with a new burial ground because it will not be used for any construction or development activity,” he said. In 2020, 840 Covid victims had been buried in Bagmari. Since February this year, over 500 people have been buried, said Ishtiyak Ahmed (Raju), a member of the board. “The Bagmari burial ground is spread over 152 bighas but it is filling up fast. Since the Bantala plot is not working out for us, we have to act fast to identify another one,” he added. The general rule is that every grave can be reused after two years when a fresh burial can take place there. However, this cannot be done with Covid victims. “The bodies are wrapped in plastic bags and these are not bio degradable. We don’t know after how long it will take to re-use these graves. So, we are looking for a Covid only graveyard,” Hakim added. The KMC is counselling hospitals to use biodegradable cloth bags for Covid patients. The community has five other burial grounds that are smaller. Three of them are in Tiljala while the rest are in Behala and Kidderpore. All non-Covid burials are currently happening at these grounds. Community members welcomed KMC search for a new burial ground for Covid patients. “On the one hand people are worried about the uncertainties over receiving the body of near ones and on the other, if they don’t have space to give the person a decent burial, it can be traumatising,” said Zahid Khan, an exporter, who lost his childhood friend to Covid. “Most Covid deaths are sudden and leave families traumatised. The last thing one wants is that there should not be any worry over burial,” said Murad S Mehmud, a prominent member of the community.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bagmari-burial-ground-running-out-of-space-kmc-searches-for-new-plot-for-covid-victims/articleshow/82586418.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Medical faculty members resume their protests||AHMEDABAD: Teachers of six government medical colleges and eight GMERS-run colleges seem firm on their demands as they again began their protests on Wednesday, pressing their long-pending demands from the state government. The Gujarat Medical Teachers Association (GTMA), which represents about 1,700 professors and lecturers of six government medical colleges called for a hunger strike on Wednesday. If their demands are not met immediately, they have threatened to strike work for non-Covid patients beginning Thursday. Thereafter, the association plans to stop work for Covid-19 patients as well. “This time we are firm in our resolve. Unless the government meets all our demands, we will continue with our protests,” said Dr Rajnish Patel, president, GMTA. GMERS Faculty Association, which represents 700 doctors, on Wednesday went on strike to press their demands. Dr Sanjay Jhadav, vice-president of the association, said they had a meeting wit Jayanti Ravi, principal secretary for health, to discuss their demands, but it was not fruitful. The Junior Doctors Association (JDU) has also decided to join the protests. The demands of the medical teachers include higher non-practising allowance in line with the 7th Pay Commission recommendations. Another demand is the abolition of contract appointments. As medical college teachers are barred from private practice, an allowance is paid to them as compensation. GMTA had also demanded that medical college teachers be allowed to start private practice after 10 years of regular service. Citing a government resolution of 2017, GMTA also sought an increase in the cap on maximum monthly salary. Promotions of faculty members at GMERS colleges have been pending for many faculty members for a long time, too. The protest comes when the state is in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic and healthcare infrastructure and trained medical manpower is a challenge. New temporary Covid hospitals are unable to function at full capacity due to the lack of trained doctors and paramedical staff. Last week GTMA and GMERS Faculty Association had called off their protest after getting assurances from the state government. This time they are seeking written assurance from the state government before calling off their protests, said sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/medical-faculty-members-resume-their-protests/articleshow/82586388.cms||---

---||Agra||MSY, others donate Rs 1.1 crore for setting up oxygen plant in Mainpuri||AGRA: A group of politicians, including former chief minister and MP Mulayam Singh Yadav, cabinet minister Ramnaresh Agnihotri and MLA Rajkumar Yadav, have donated Rs 1.10 crore from their respective MP and legislative funds for setting up a medical oxygen generator plant in UP’s Mainpuri, as the district has no plant of its own. The move will bring relief to the district authorities who have been managing oxygen cylinders from neighbouring districts including Agra, Firozabad and Noida on a daily basis amid the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. The daily consumption in the district is about 3,500 litres and it’s entirely met depending on supplies from the neighbouring districts. District magistrate Mahendra Bahadur Singh said, “Samajwadi party patriarch and MP from the district Mulayam Singh Yadav has donated Rs 30 lakh from his MP fund and cabinet minister Ramnaresh Agnihotri and MLA from Mainpuri Rajkumar Yadav have donated Rs 40 lakh each from their legislative funds so far. Other MLAs have also assured of help if needed.” DM Singh further said, “We are dependent on other districts and sometimes, they deny refilling our cylinders due to shortage in their own hospitals. Though the district has an L2 facility, but in the absence of an L3 facility, critical patients have to travel to Agra or Tundla (Firozabad) for treatment.” In fact, the district doesn’t have any private hospital, said officials, adding that they are now going to start a 50-bed L1 facility in Bhogaon, as poor people don’t have home isolation facility. Chief development officer (CDO) Eesha Priya said that the plant will have a capacity of filling 60-100 cylinders per day. “The exact figure will be finalised in a day or two. It will be functional within a week if everything goes well,” CDO said. “The plant will be installed within the premises of district hospital, Mainpuri. At present, 45 cylinders with a capacity of 46 litres each and 100 cylinders with a capacity of 10 litres each are being used in the district.,” sub-divisional magistrate (Sadar) Rishiraj said. So far, 110 Covid deaths have been recorded by the health department. In the past 24 hours, 102 persons have tested positive for the disease and one person succumbed to it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/msy-others-donate-rs-1-10-crore-for-setting-up-oxygen-plant-in-mainpuri/articleshow/82583918.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Strict checking is being done to ensure that only those having Covid negative certificates are allowed. Those not possessing negative certificates are sent back from the borders,” South Goa SP Pankaj Kumar Singh told TOI. The high court of Bombay at Goa had castigated the state government for exempting certain categories of people from having to produce Covid negative certificate to enter Goa. It had directed the state administration to ensure that no person is permitted entry without possessing such certificate from the intervening midnight of May 11 and 12. The court, however, had made an exception for those entering the state for medical emergencies, those coming in ambulances, and those bringing essential services. Dy SP Quepem Kiran Poduval visited the border checkpost at Pollem, Canacona, and reviewed the security arrangements with Canacona police station and Chittakula police station, Karwar, concerning entry of vehicles and persons into Goa. Poduval, it is learnt, emphasised on the need for a medical team to be deployed at the border checkpost, Pollem, round the clock to check the exempted category (vehicles carrying essentials) for temperature and symptoms, as also to check the veracity of the Covid negative and vaccination certificates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/security-beefed-up-at-borders-to-check-covid-ve-certificates/articleshow/82588830.cms||---

The direction has been issued following the severe shortage of oxygen for Covid-19 patients. The state is regularly reporting over 160 Covid deaths daily and there's a huge rush of patients with low oxygen saturation seeking admissions in hospitals. They have been directed to establish oxygen generation plant for the purpose in two months. A special package for setting up oxygen plants has also been released by the industry department. On Wednesday, the state reported 164 deaths, with 16,384 persons testing positive for the virus. The overall tally now stands at 8,05,658. With today's fatalities, the state’s toll rose to 6,158. Directions have been issued to hospitals, especially children's hospitals, to prepare for the third wave which is likely to affect children. Amid spiraling cases, the health department has also clarified that some of the samples from Rajasthan had tested positive for the UK strain. “We have received the report from a lab in Delhi that some samples have tested positive for the UK strain. The lab did genome sequencing of the samples and the report was received two days ago. We are also trying to develop the genome sequencing facility at the SMS Medical College to identify that variant to find out if it's double or triple mutant so that treatment can be provided accordingly to patients,” said health minister Raghu Sharma. The state's active cases are, meanwhile, above the two-lakh mark and it is among the five states in the country which have more than two lakh cases. The other four states are Karnataka, Maharashtra, Kerala and Uttar Pradesh.

MAT member A P Kurhekar passed an order to reinstate Nayak to the Juhu unit of the ATS, where he was posted. Nayak, through his advocate Makrand Lonkar, had submitted that the transfer order issued by the DGP was void since the Establishment Board-II has no power and authority to transfer the petitioner as he was not due for transfer, he had not completed his tenure of three years in the present posting and his performance has been outstanding.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-tribunal-stays-transfer-of-daya-nayak-to-gondia/articleshow/82590988.cms||Ahmed Ali

The CM should have immediately suspended the person responsible for upkeep of the centralised oxygen pipeline at GMC, BJP’s Santa Cruz MLA Antonio Fernandes said. “MLAs are all sleeping in their homes when they should have been attending to Goans suffering from Covid-19. They will learn only when their own family members will get affected,” he said on Wednesday. “When the pandemic first appeared on the scene, we had brought the issue of corroded pipeline for oxygen supply at GMC to the notice of the authorities. We weren’t prepared, resulting in the present grave situation. And today a blame game is on following rising deaths. It makes me cry the manner in which GMC doctors and other staff are stressed out and running around to keep patients alive,” said Fernandes. He said the hospital is overloaded with 80 persons packed in a ward meant for 30 to 40. “The oxygen pipeline is 30 years old. Shouldn’t someone have looked into this? Not just Covid patients, major operations are on hold because there is no oxygen supply available. A young boy brought in by Glenn Ticlo has injured his spine but cannot be operated at present and runs the risk of being paralysed,” said Fernandes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tony-people-dying-but-mlas-will-wake-up-when-kin-are-hit/articleshow/82588783.cms||---

The advisory dated May 10 had created confusion among graduates who had already started registering with colleges. The March 31 advisory had allowed graduates to intern from any NMC-approved medical college. An official from a government college said, “In the May 10 order, however, they said internship should be completed in medical colleges where the students graduated. Additionally, they said that mutual transfer of internship is possible under exceptional situations only between government colleges or only between private colleges and that no interns can exchange between private and government colleges or vice-versa.” An official from Maharashtra University of Health Sciences said that they got an email withdrawing the May 10 advisory on Wednesday evening. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-national-med-forum-revokes-order-on-mbbs-grad-internship/articleshow/82588927.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC questions state’s claim of a dip in cases, cites med demand||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Wednesday questioned the state government’s claim that Covid-19 cases had reduced when its daily requirement of Remdesivir injection has increased.  “You are saying active cases have reduced and on the other hand Remdesivir demand has increased. You have not informed us about short supply in certain places,” said a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni during the day-long hearing of PILs related to Covid-19 management. The state’s reply said dexamethasone is a steroid and cannot be an alternative drug to Remdesivir, which is an anti-viral and reduces hospital stay. To the judge’s query on the position of Remdesivir in Maharashtra, the state’s advocate Akshay Shinde replied that the state’s requirement is 70,000 vials per day, but it received 45,000 vials. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh said the state’s requirement was 51,000 vials per day last week. He said Centre has increased Remdesivir allocation by over 2 lakh vials to Maharashtra in view of the demand. “What is the basis for claiming 70,000 vials per day?” the CJ asked, seeking the state’s explanation. The judges questioned if Remdesivir is prescribed only in the second wave. They pointed out that ICMR had considered Remdesivir in July 2020 as part of investigational therapy. “Why did we lower our guard? We should have procured Remdesivir in sufficient quantity. Now there is shortage of Remdesivir also,” the CJ said. Shinde informed that the state’s proposal to import Remdesivir is pending Centre’s nod. Advocate Rajesh Inamdar said when there is shortage of Remdesivir, a celebrity procured it for those appealing to him on social media. “Certain groups like politicians and celebrities are distributing it to people arbitrarily. Patients in hospitals are told to get it,” he said. The CJ reacted, “Why don’t you (state) appoint nodal officers for celebrities and politicians?” The judges said they won’t come in the way of those helping, but “let it (Remdesivir) be available to all and not selective people.” The judges cautioned about Covid-19’s spread to villages. Justice Kulkarni referred to a channel report on Palghar and how there are “no beds, no facilities, patients are lying on the floor.” “Palghar was an eye-opener. If this is the situation in Palghar which is close to Mumbai, what about rural and adivasi areas?” he wondered. The CJ added, “You (state) have to stop infection at the threshold. It should not go to the rural areas. You have to focus on villages so that villagers don’t get affected.” The judges enquired about pediatric Covid-19 cases in view of the third wave. Senior advocate Anil Sakhare, for BMC, said the civic body is gearing up with special children’s wards. “Once you keep children in hospital, you have to make arrangements for their mothers to stay,” said the Chief Justice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-questions-states-claim-of-a-dip-in-cases-cites-med-demand/articleshow/82588823.cms||Rosy Sequeira

Adding that the third wave is likely to hit those in the age-groups of 2-18 and 18-45 years, a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Avinash Gharote directed the government to plan its strategy accordingly, and keep additional hospital beds with sufficient medicines and oxygen stock ready. The preparations should also include creation of neo-natal and paediatric wards, jumbo hospitals, and temporary Covid care centres at marriage halls and open spaces, which should preferably be near existing Covid-19 hospitals. The suggestions included school grounds, Kasturchand Park, Mankapur stadium, along with GMCH, IGGMCH, AIIMS and other hospitals. Similar arrangements should also be made at various hospitals and public health centres (PHCs) in districts like Wardha, Akola, Bhandara and others along with taluka, gram panchayats and at places like steel plants in Vidarbha, the HC said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/prepare-sop-for-third-wave-hc-tells-maharashtra/articleshow/82588880.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The national capital may receive light to very light rain from Thursday to Saturday and is likely to see cloudy sky on the weekend. On Wednesday, Safdarjung observatory, which is the city’s base station, recorded ‘trace’ rainfall till 8.30 am. The maximum temperature was 36.8 degrees Celsius, which was three degrees below normal. The minimum temperature settled at 23.5 degrees Celsius, two notches below normal. The relative humidity oscillated between 68% and 27%. According to IMD’s forecast, there would be generally cloudy sky on Thursday with the possibility of light rain or thundershowers. However, very light rain is expected on Friday and Saturday. Though there are chances of formation of thundery development on Sunday and Monday, Delhi may experience very light rain on Tuesday. For the next three days, the day temperature is likely to remain around 36-37 degrees Celsius. Meanwhile, Delhi’s Air Quality Index (AQI) was 115 on Wednesday in ‘moderate’ category. Experts said the air of the national capital was likely to improve. System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research, the forecasting body under the Union ministry of earth sciences, stated: “Isolated thunderstorms with gusty winds are likely on Thursday, which may lead to isolated dust spike at a few locations for one or two hours.

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Cops with medical degrees aid 2,200 active cases in force||AHMEDABAD: Dr Karanraj Vaghela, DCP Zone II of Vadodara city, was at SSG Hospital on Wednesday morning. “One of our staff members is admitted here with Covid complications. The family was worried, but we assured them that he is on the path of recovery. We also witnessed a case of mucormycosis in a constable, for which arrangements were made,” said the NHL Municipal Medical College graduate. “In all, I am overseeing about 220 cases of Covid-19 in the units assigned to me. It’s like being back in the medical field, albeit in a different role!” In the past one year, over 10,000 officers and personnel were infected with Covid-19 out of the 1 lakh strong force. The state police have also witnessed deaths of about 50 members including senior officers like Dr M K Nayak due to the pandemic. Of 2,200 active cases in the police force, 58 are hospitalized, said senior state police officials. Ashish Bhatia, state DGP, told TOI that the idea was to utilize the backgrounds of these senior officers to help the force. “The initial project started with handholding and guiding the personnel and also disseminating right information on preventive aspects. But it took a formal shape with 18 officers with medical degrees being assigned different districts, cities and SRP groups recently,” he said. “Each officer daily takes stock of the cases, visits the hospitals and interacts with family members. They work as a bridge between the medical system and families,” For the IPS officers, it’s like living dual lives. “We got trained as medical professionals, and I surely kept myself updated on Covid-19,” said Dr Leena Patil, SP of Panchmahal-Godhra. “Families often don’t understand some terms or their implications. We then try to simplify it for them and remain in touch with the treating doctors.” Dr Ravindra Patel, DCP Zone I of Ahmedabad city, had recovered from Covid himself. “The experience comes handy when we explain it to the staff members, or when we talk about the procedures to be followed. The personnel also have questions on certain procedures and they can also panic when they test positive. We thus use our training as doctors to take them through the test scores and results,” he said. “It’s a great opportunity for us to utilize our background in medicine to help our police families. We were proactive earlier too in terms of disseminating information and ensuring that our units remain Covid-free. But the current role is more formal where we are touching hundreds of lives,” said Dr Sudhir Desai, SP of Vadodara Rural. Dr Rajdeepsinh Zala, SP Valsad, agrees. “We have carried out health check-up camps, created isolation facilities and have also inculcated Covid-appropriate habits in our staff,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cops-with-medical-degrees-aid-2-2k-active-cases-in-force/articleshow/82586465.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Agra||Covid-19: Over 11-time increase in death certificates issued by AMC||AGRA: There has been a whopping 11-time increase in the number of death certificates issued by the civic body in the city of Taj. Last year, 86 death certificates were issued in April. During the second wave of Covid-19, it rose to 995, in April this year. According to the Agra Municipal Corporation (AMC) records, the number of deaths increased by more than 900 as compared to last year. At the birth and death registration office in Agra, 35 applications are being received on a daily basis. Last year, the number was 3 to 4. Even though health department records suggest 87 Covid patients died last month, the rush at Agra crematoriums tells a different story. According to an estimate, 2,500 cremations took place at Agra's five major crematoriums. Out of these, 1,700 were at Tajganj crematorium. Senior councillor Ravi Bihari Mathur said, “Family members of several Covid patients who died in April were also infected. They were in home isolation and applied for the death certificate in May. Many people didn’t apply for death certificates as well. The actual number of people dying is much higher than what the government records suggest.” Caretaker of the Tajganj crematorium, Sanjeev Gupta, said, “A total of 1,700 cremations took place in April - five times higher as compared to average conducted in a month. As many as 685 cremations occurred at the electric furnace, while 1,015 last rites were performed in the traditional way. Covid protocol was followed in most cases." On April 28, overheating and too much load caused by continuous burning of the dead had resulted in a major disruption at Agra's only electric crematorium in Tajganj. All the four platforms became non-operational. Only two platforms are functional at present. “Since the second week of April, more cremations are taking place. Usually, 15 bodies are cremated, but in the last 24 hours, over 50 bodies have arrived here. We have asked the family members of the deceased to wait as there is no vacant space as of now,” the caretaker added. Family members of the deceased are not being allowed to enter the cremation compound. They are asked to stand at a distance and mourn their loved ones from far. Cremations are usually not conducted after sunset. But, the last rites are continuing round the clock. “The district administration has ordered night cremation due to the workload," the caretaker said. The burial grounds are overwhelmed as well. Secretary of Agra’s Panchkuian Kabarstan Babar Alam said, “The number of burials increased significantly over the month. On an average, there used to be six burials earlier. Now, it is 20. We are digging graves in advance. There are around 20 graveyards in the district." When contacted, chief medical officer of Agra district Dr RC Pandey said, “Since March last year, a total of 309 Covid patients had passed away in Agra district. Out of these 87 succumbed in April. Covid cannot be the cause of all the deaths in the district."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/covid-19-over-11-time-increase-in-death-certificates-issued-by-amc/articleshow/82584004.cms||Deepak Lavania

Sardesai told reporters that the hearing in the high court over a public interest litigation (PIL) on Covid deaths has proved that those who died at Goa Medical College (GMC) and Hospital, Bambolim post midnight during the last two days, “died not of Covid but owing to oxygen shortage.” “It has been proven in the high court hearing today that people have died of oxygen shortage. People have died not of Covid, but because of oxygen shortage from midnight to dawn at GMC. This shows there is also a shortage of oxygen accountability. It is directionless leadership that is causing deaths in Goa,” Sardesai said. Pointing out that the state government had appointed a nodal officer to look after oxygen supply in all hospitals, Sardesai held the officer responsible for the delay and deficit of oxygen leading to deaths in hospitals. The Fatorda MLA also said that the chief minister’s visit to the Covid ward at GMC on Tuesday and the South Goa district hospital Margao on Wednesday has served no purpose. Pointing out that the government still has no plans to utilise the upper two floors of the South Goa district hospital for Covid patients, Sardesai questioned the delay and demanded that they be put to use immediately. “It is because of the government’s negligence that people are dying,” he said. He also made a pitch for Goan officers be appointed in place of Indian administrative service (IAS) officers. “The government should bring in good Goan officers capable of taking quick decisions to tackle this war-like situation,” he said. He also questioned the government’s failure in starting vaccination for the 18-44 age group from May 1 as was assured earlier.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/directionless-leadership-causing-covid-deaths-gfp/articleshow/82588864.cms||---

Rao, along with Pune collector Rajesh Deshmukh, visited the site on Wednesday and held discussions with Bharat Biotech officials. The Bombay high court has allowed Biovet to manufacture its the vaccines at a fully operational and ready vaccine plant on the 12-hectares site in Manjari Khurd. “Pune district, with the Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat Biotech, is surely going to become the vaccine capital of India. We have assured full cooperation to the company top officials (of Bharat Biotech) who were here to discuss and chart out the road map ahead. They are to give us a detailed plan in a week’s time,” the Pune divisional commissioner said. He said once the facility was fully operational, the company would be able to manufacture 15-20 million doses per month. The local administration would assist the company for ensuring water availability, security, approach roads and deployment of manpower. Collector Rajesh Deshmukh too said the district administration had extended all its support to the company. “From water to electricity supply, logistics, security and licences, we have extended all cooperation and will help the company on all fronts to speed up production,” the collector said, adding that the detailed plan would be ready within the next few days. “It will give us a clear idea on how the company plans to operate in Pune,” he said. Bharat Biotech, the parent company of Biovet, declined to comment on the development when approached by TOI. Biovet is headquartered and registered in Bengaluru. It was recently allowed by the Bombay high court to manufacture Covaxin at the Manjari Khurd plant. Biovet is primarily focused on veterinary vaccines, including the foot and mouth disease shots. It promoted by Bharat Biotech, the maker of Covaxin. The plot where Biovet plans to produce the vaccines already has an operational veterinary vaccine unit, which was run by a subsidiary of the global drugmaker Merck.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/first-batch-of-covaxin-to-be-out-from-manjari-khurd-unit-in-100-days-rao/articleshow/82588844.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The bench of Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma said the government’s policy regulating the functioning of stone crushers lacks focus. The bench also said that the state is not taking its responsibilities seriously and “it seems to be permitting stone crushers to mushroom anywhere”. During the hearing, the bench asked the chief standing counsel, CS Rawat, about illegal stone crushers in the state. To which, Rawat said that there are no illegal stone crushers in Uttarakhand, according to the reports received from the district magistrates across the state. Subsequently, the court stated that if it finds even a single illegally operated stone-crusher in the state, it will haul the person responsible for filing "false affidavit" over charcoal. The bench said that if the stone crushers are allowed to function in violation of environmental norms, it would wreak havoc on the climate and asked the government to be more serious over the issue of rivers and the environment. The court has now directed the chief secretary as well as secretary (industries) to be present before the court through video-conferencing on May 27 and explain the government’s policy on stone crushers. Also, the officials have been directed to detail the court about the steps taken to demarcate the agriculture, residential as well as industrial and silent zones in compliance with The Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules of 2000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhands-stone-crushing-policy-lacks-focus-hc/articleshow/82584002.cms||Prashant Jha

The CM also asked for the nod to use 50% of the State Disaster Response Funds for works related to fighting Covid-19 pandemic. Rawat said that a nod for 100% utilisation of the funds would vastly help the state in meeting the required oxygen supply in hospitals and in making other necessary arrangements. The CM further said that the state was allotted 60 metric tonnes of oxygen from Jharkhand and West Bengal despite the Himalayan state having three oxygen manufacturing plants at Dehradun, Kashipur and Roorkee. The CM claimed that allocating oxygen supply from these plants would help save time for Uttarakhand. The CM added that the state government is focussing on the treatment of Covid-19 patients and constant efforts are being made to increase the number of oxygen beds, ICU beds and ventilators. Rawat did not fail to mention that the state government has approved a budget of more than Rs 400 crore for the vaccination of people in the age group of 18-to-44 years. Meanwhile, Dr Harsh Vardhan said that special focus needs to be given on testing, tracking, tracing and setting up micro containment zones. He added that the state must ensure that the second dose is timely administered to people. He also asked the CM to focus on bringing down the case fatality rate. Besides, the Union minister assured the CM of all possible assistance from the Centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-cm-requests-union-health-minister-for-10k-oxygen-concentrators/articleshow/82583969.cms||Kautilya Singh

The two are “speaking in contradiction” said Rao, pointing out that it is difficult to know what the truth is. He also questioned the basis on which Rane has recommended that Ivermectin should be prescribed to all persons in Goa as a prophylactic for Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sack-sawant-health-min-for-deaths-cong/articleshow/82588897.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Quoting scientists, HC says plasma therapy leading to new viral strains, fuelling pandemic||NAGPUR: In an observation, Nagpur bench of Bombay high court quoted scientists to state that convalescent plasma therapy is possibly leading to new Covid-19 viral strains and thus fuelling the pandemic. Quoting researchers from the University of Basel in Switzerland, a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Avinash Gharote added that their (scientists’) observations led to concerns over use of this therapy, although no scientific or conclusive research was conducted on this finding. The bench directed city-based National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri) to conduct research on use of plasma therapy and its side effects, including claims of acceleration of coronavirus mutations in patients. “We request the Neeri director to submit a report by next hearing in this regard. The registry should dispatch a copy of today’s order to his office.” They noted that there’s divergence of opinion world over on use of this therapy on critical patients. Some said it was beneficial only on mild and moderate patients. “We’ve received a copy of a report from the University of Basel, which says that the use of plasma therapy doesn’t appear to improve the condition of patients.” Citing an open letter sent by medical experts to the Government of India’s principal scientific advisor Vijay Raghavan, Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR), and All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), the bench said they expressed serious reservations on using the plasma treatment for Covid patients. “These experts quoted earlier evidence that there was a possible association between emergence of variants with “lower susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies in immunosuppressed” people who were given plasma therapy. They have expressed their anxiety by saying that there is a possibility of more virulent strains developing due to irrational use of plasma therapy, which can fuel the pandemic,” the judges said. These experts include clinicians and public health professionals like Dr Yogesh Jain, Dr Vivekanand Jha and others. They quoted three studies; the ICMR-PLACID Trial, the Recovery Trial conducted by the University of Oxford, and Argentina's PlasmAr Trial, to press their claims. The convalescent plasma therapy is being increasingly used in India to treat serious Covid-19 patients, who need hospitalization. Since the last couple of months social media is flooded with messages for recuperated Covid patients to donate their plasma for terminally ill patients. In the city, the world's largest plasma therapy trial-cum-treatment project titled ‘Project Platina’ was launched on June 30, 2020, at the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH). It was inaugurated through a video link by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. Lawyers told TOI that ICMR had also conducted its own study on benefits of plasma therapy and found that it wasn’t useful in improving the patients’ condition and reducing their mortality. The apex body also warned doctors against its indiscriminate use.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/quoting-scientists-hc-says-plasma-therapy-leading-to-new-viral-strains-fuelling-pandemic/articleshow/82588907.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Going by the 1% share allotted to Uttarakhand, we can expect 17 lakh doses in the two months, which will be far less than the demand. Now, with the Centre asking the state to prioritise those who need the second shot, we will have to reserve 70% of the shots for those beneficiaries. As a result, for a very limited number of vaccines will be available for the 18-44 age group. To remedy this shortage, we have decided to import the vaccine and will approach the authorities concerned.” Prakash added that the state was in touch with the Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech (manufacturers of Covishield and Covaxin respectively) to allot Uttarakhand more than its share. Meanwhile, he added that the state required 60 metric tons of oxygen each day. “We have received two 20 MT oxygen containers on Wednesday and require a total of 12 such containers. Another six are likely to reach us by Friday.” Prakash added that the state was firm on preventing blackmarketing and selling of spurious and fake medicines. Two days ago, the high court had told the state those selling fake Remdesivir should be booked for murder. “There is a provision of life imprisonment for the illegal act and we will take swift and stringent measures to catch those involved in the shameful act,” said the chief secretary. IG Amit Sinha informed that so far, raids had been conducted at 136 places to prevent black marketing, a total of 24 FIRs had been filed so far, 35 had been arrested. “Also, a total of 587 people have been issued challans for not wearing masks, 6,057 people have been challaned for violation of social distancing on Tuesday. Till date, Rs 4.26 crore has been recovered as penalty and as many as 2.61 lakh people issued challan for violating norms.” Secretary Pankaj Kumar Pandey said that the experts of a technical committee have advised ivermectin tablets to reduce the severity of the impact of Covid-19 for all adults, barring pregnant women.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-to-import-20-lakh-sputnik-doses-in-next-2-months-state-to-get-17-lakh-doses-of-covisheild-covaxin-in-may-and-june/articleshow/82584030.cms||Kautilya Singh

It has been two weeks since the centre has opened and six patients have already been discharged. Currently, 18 beds are occupied. “We have patients on ventilators and Bi-PAP. We also have a step-down facility with oxygen beds,” said Dr Shailendra Nanaware who is in-charge of the centre. “Most of our patients are senior citizens who could not find ICU beds in hospitals.” BMC officials said they will soon expand the capacity of the centre. Assistant municipal commissioner of T ward and local BJP MLA Mihir Kotecha set up the centre at the defunct octroi naka within a week as the Mulund-Bhandup belt was facing an acute shortage of ICU beds. “This ICU centre is proving to be a game-changer for Mulund and neighbouring areas,” said Kotecha. “The BMC must focus on building such small ICU units and not just jumbo centres that take months to set up,” he added. Appreciating BMC’s support, Dr Nanware said: “Three doctors monitor the patients in each of the three shifts. The BMC has provided equipment, medicines, pathology and oxygen supply.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-icu-centre-at-mulund-octroi-naka-eases-patient-load/articleshow/82588961.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Delhi||Only 3 states generated more Covid biomedical waste than Delhi in May||NEW DELHI: Delhi generated 18.8 tonnes of Covid-19 biomedical waste per day in May (till May 10) — the fourth highest in the country — according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). With 23.7 tonnes per day (TPD), Kerala generated the maximum. A recent CPCB report stated that the average Covid-related biomedical waste generation during May was about 203TPD in the country. The pollution board compiled the data after considering information received from the state pollution control boards, pollution control committees and daily data received from ‘COVID19BWM’ waste tracking app. According to CPCB, the peak generation of 250TPD was reported on May 10. However, the peak in 2020 across the country was in the range of 180-220TPD. “Despite a greater number of patients, there is no proportional growth in the quantity of Covid biomedical waste being generated. This is mainly due to proper segregation of waste. Common facilities have reported that, unlike last year, hospitals and isolation wards are not mixing food with Covid waste,” said CPCB. However, there has been a gradual increase in quantity of Covid biomedical waste generation since February 2021. The waste generation was 53TPD in February in the country, which rose to 75TPD in March, 139TPD in April and 203TPD in May (till May 10). “Chairman of CPCB conducted a virtual meeting with chairmen and member secretaries of SPCBs and PCCs on May 3 to review the status of Covid waste management. At the meeting, SPCBs/PCCs reported that the existing arrangement in states is adequate to dispose of Covid waste safely. About 198 common biomedical waste treatment plant facilities (CBWTFs) are involved in the treatment and disposal of such waste,” said the report. The CPCB data showed the second highest Covid waste was generated in Gujarat at 21.98TPD followed by Maharashtra at 19.02 TPD in May. The 18.8TPD waste generated in Delhi was disposed of at two CBWTFs. DPCC has invited expression of interest for setting additional two CBWTFs in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/only-3-states-generated-more-covid-biomedical-waste-than-delhi-in-may/articleshow/82586553.cms||---

But experts on Wednesday said the supply is still not enough for hospitals that are treating Covid-19 in the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR). On Wednesday, the district received 6,530 vials; on Tuesday, it got 4,797 vials. Daily requirement, however, is 17,000 vials. Doctors said families are now blaming hospitals for admitting patients without enough remdesivir in stock. “They believe treatment is incomplete without remdesivir. There’s now too much pressure on doctors to use the drug,” said Sanjay Patil, chairman of the IMA's Hospital Board of India. Shyam Pratapwar, assistant commissioner (drug), Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said, “We distribute what we get from the state government. There is complete transparency.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/11327-remdesivir-vials-land-but-doctors-say-supply-is-not-enough/articleshow/82588916.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Since it is difficult for the elderly to stand in long queues since early morning and wait for their turn, we are standing on their behalf and also dropping them home after the vaccination Like Kelkar, many youths have come forward to help senior citizens. Piyush Soni, another youth from Shivajinagar, said he is helping the elderly find less-crowded vaccination centres. “Many senior citizens prefer walk-ins as they are finding it difficult to book online slots. We are helping them identify suitable locations and are standing in the queues on their behalf,” Soni said. A Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) employee, working at different vaccination centres in Shivajinagar, said getting the vaccine has become a huge task and youths have been helping senior citizens since the last month to minimize their hardships. “I have been visiting the vaccination centres in the area almost every day. All of them are attracting huge crowds of senior citizens. We cannot arrange for chairs for all of them. So, the youths have been really helpful,” he said. Samrat Jadhav, who recently helped a group of senior citizens get their second doses, said, “All we do is provide basic support like waiting in queues, getting tokens for them, arranging for water bottles or even biscuits. Civic activist Sandeep Khardekar said his group has provided wheelchairs and other facilities to vaccination centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/youths-extend-helping-hand-to-senior-citizens-during-inoculation-process/articleshow/82588950.cms||Sarang Dastane

The matter came to light after their bodies were spotted in Haldia dam near Bhaur village under Rajauli police station area of the Nawada district on Wednesday morning. Rajauli police station SHO Darbari Choudhary said the deceased were identified as Nirmala Devi (30) and her children Neetu Kumari (12), Nisha Kumari (10), Chandni Kumari (8) and Rupesh Kumar (8). Chaudhary said they hailed from Kasiyadih of Bandhi panchayat under Sirdalla police station area in Nawada district. He said prima facie it seems the woman first fed poison-laced snacks to her children. “When it started showing effect, she threw them one by one in the dam and later committed suicide by consuming the same poison and jumping into the water,” the SHO said. He said Nirmala with her children had left home by wearing new clothes after having a fight with her mother-in-law. “Police have come to know that both used to fight on petty issues. Her husband Sunil Kumar is a truck driver and is in Odisha. Sunil’s unmarried younger brother is also a truck driver. They mostly remain outside and the woman used to live with the two elderly persons at home,” he said. Choudhary said that except Neetu’s body, the rest four were spotted by the villagers. He said the bodies were identified only after a cellphone was recovered from Nirmala's blouse. Police later located her home but her in-laws were not there. A villager, Nand Kishore Saw, said the woman along with her children had left home around 9am on Tuesday. “When some of her neighbours asked where they were going, Nirmala told them that there was a marriage in her sister’s family and they were going there to attend it,” he said. Saw said her sister lives at Amjhari, which is hardly 6km from Kasiyadih. He said the dam is around 14km from Kasiyadih.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/woman-kills-four-kids-self-in-nawada-village/articleshow/82584066.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Sisters join suit for share after brothers get preliminary decree||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court has permitted five women to join litigation initiated by their brothers for share in ancestral property after a civil court passed preliminary decree for distribution of three equal shares among male heirs. Last week, Justice Bhargav Karia directed the civil court to pass final decree after giving opportunity of hearing to five sisters and “if need be preliminary decree be altered, modified or amended in accordance with law”. The HC said that the equal right to inheritance in the amended Hindu succession laws for women can allow the court to permit female heirs to join the litigation without challenging the preliminary decree, which has been already passed by the court. In this case, three brothers from Nanakwada village of Valsad district had filed a suit in local civil court for a decree for equal share from ancestral property among themselves. The court had passed a preliminary decree giving equal share to the three. However, when five sisters came to know about the suit, they also approached the court and requested that they be heard and their shares also be decided. When the civic court rejected their request to allow them to join the litigation and claim their share on the ground that preliminary decree had already been passed, the women moved the high court in 2016, said advocate Chaitanya Joshi in a statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/sisters-join-suit-for-share-after-brothers-get-preliminary-decree/articleshow/82586564.cms||---

---||Pune||Pupils’ tests conducted via messaging app, home visits||Pune: A majority of secondary schools in Maharashtra have conducted students’ assessments for standards VIII to X during the year on WhatsApp. There were schools that also conducted assessments by going to the residence of students and in some cases on the schools’ premises when the Covid-19 restrictions were relaxed. Nearly 26,000 schools submitted their reports to the state education department regarding their assessments of which 12,000 conducted them through WhatsApp. The Maharashtra State Council of Educational Research and Training (MSCERT) conducted this survey on evaluation practices in secondary schools for 2020-2021. Of the total 25,927 secondary schools in Maharashtra, about 13,000 responded. The schools stated that the assessments were conducted through online tests, WhatsApp questionnaires, online viva, offline test, house visit and also workbooks. Deputy director of MSCERT, Vikas Garad, said that, “We had made provision to document the methods of teaching and assessment to schools. They had to report about the various methods they were utilising for the process and we got to know that WhatsApp was most commonly used by the schools.” The MSCERT had introduced several methods of online teaching during lockdown as schools were shut. “We had informed the schools that they should not depend on any one method and all possible means to reach out to students should be utilised. Some schools also used the brief period in November, December when they were allowed to reopen to assess the students.” The state launched the messaging-based assessment in November 2020. Students had to register their mobile numbers. A questionnaire was sent on their numbers every Saturday. Students had to answer the 10-mark questionnaire, which included topics covered during the week. The assessment report was given the same day. “Aided and government schools found it easier to go with the messaging app assessment. Private schools followed the offline timetable and focused on video communication apps,” said a principal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pupils-tests-conducted-via-messaging-app-home-visits/articleshow/82586542.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

This would result in movement of people during restricted hours and crowding at mandal offices, which would not be in accordance with lockdown restrictions. Citizens who have booked a slot on Dharani during May 12 and May 21, the slots would be rescheduled.

---||Pune||Wadgaonsheri resident scales Mount Everest||PUNE: Wadgaonsheri resident Jitendra Gaware scaled Mt Everest, the world’s tallest mountain, on Wednesday at 7.30am. This was his successful attempt of two eight-thousander (8,000 metre) mountains in a span of 25 days. On April 16, Gaware had successfully climbed the Mt Annapurna, which is the 10th tallest mountain in the world. The lockdown had slowed down business for Garware, a real estate consultant. But, he shifted his focus on his climbing activity. He was training with the Giripremi institute for the past six years, but since last year, he trained rigorously and was extremely determined, said Umesh Zirpe, the founder of Giripremi. “Successfully scaling two eight thousanders in a span of just a month is a very difficult task, but Gaware’s sheer determination enabled him to climb the mountains. His fitness has also played an important role in his success and his efforts for a year have paid off,” Zirpe said. Gaware started his climb to the peak on May 11 at 8pm along with sherpa Pasang Zarok to scale the mountain. He reached Mt Everest at 7.30am, within 12 hours. Zirpe said it was a major achievement by Gaware. After scaling Mt Annapurna on April 16 along with some other mountaineers of Giripremi, Gaware and the mountaineers came to Kathmandu and rested there till April 20. On April 25, they started again from Kathmandu to the Everest base camp and reached on April 29. Zirpe said that, “Gaware started training very late. He is 42-years-old now. He had joined us for training around six years ago. During our first few sessions we saw how spirited and dedicated he was regarding mountaineering. We encouraged him and are seeing the results now.” Gaware is a fitness freak and spends nearly seven to eight hours a day on exercising and fitness activities. He practised in the Sahyadri ranges before he started attempting to climb the Himalayas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/wadgaonsheri-resident-scales-mount-everest/articleshow/82586566.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Goa||GoaMiles launches Covid service cabs to ferry patients in Goa||PANAJI: Stepping up to do their bit during the second Covid wave, GTDC’s GoaMiles has set aside a separate pool of their vehicles to provide 24x7 service to transport emergency patients to hospitals.  The service has created a hotline number that citizens can call. Another set of cabs have also been set aside to ferry people for vaccination. “Anyone in need of transportation during this crisis can reach out to us on our helpline. Based on the customer requirement, the call will be routed to the designated person in the Covid category of taxis. This way, rather than mixing the vehicles of Covid and non-Covid patients, we are trying to segregate them during transportation,” founder and CEO of GoaMiles Utkarsh Dabhade said. Going a step further, GoaMiles is also willing to ferry Covid patients who are unable to pay for the taxi fare. “People can put a request to us through the date slot even for vaccination. Even here, if they are not able to pay, we will take the passenger,” he said, adding that there are three NGOs as well that are coordinating with GoaMiles to help execute the task. Besides transporting Covid passengers, we are also receiving requests to transport oxygen cylinders by patients’ families, Dabhade said. On dialing the toll free number, the caller is given three options to chose from depending on whether he or she is a driver, customer, or calling for Covid service. However, calls made by TOI went through only after a couple attempts. After selecting the ‘number three’ option for Covid service, the call was connected after a three-and-a-half-minute wait time. The call was not attended to despite several rings and a call time that exceeded four minutes. It was only on the third attempt that TOI was able to connect with the service only to be told that the cabs set aside for the service are in Margao and will take some time to reach Panaji. Senior manager, GoaMiles, Hemant Prabhu attributed the issues to the volume of calls coming in vis-à-vis the number of cabs. “We have a pool of 20-25 vehicles and fulfilling the demand depends on availability. If there is a provision, we can allocate the nearest vehicle. It’s a real time issue and we cannot keep vehicles on hold hoping a call will come from Panaji in ten minutes. The vehicle has to be on the move,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goamiles-launches-covid-service-cabs-to-ferry-patients/articleshow/82588969.cms||---

In India so far, 24,275 such people took the vaccine. There are only six states, including Maharashtra, where the highest number of cases are being reported, had more than 1,000 third gender people taking the Covid-19 shot. Telangana trails these six states in administering the jab to the ‘others.’ LGBT rights activists said that there are about 40,000 third gender people in Telangana, while as per the official records their population is 10,000. “There is no awareness among the third gender on vaccination. Most of them don’t even know where they can get the vaccine or walk into any vaccination centre,” Rachana Mudraboyina, acting director for LGBT rights group, Human Rights Law Network, said. According to her, many third gender people got infected by the virus and some of them recovered also. Since most transgenders live in closed settings with many people sharing single rooms, there is every chance of infection spreading if one person is infected. “Vaccination has to be done fast and many are ready to get their doses. There is no vaccine hesitancy among us,” Rachana said. She urged the government to make efforts to bring more awareness on vaccine for the third gender people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/906-transgenders-inoculated-in-state/articleshow/82589024.cms||---

The 13-year-old, who was staying with his two siblings at their aunt’s house in Haryana, was told on Monday that their mother wanted to see them. He made drawings for her, little knowing that she had already succumbed to Covid-19 at a city hospital. Since then, he has mostly kept silent. With the current wave of Covid-19, every school in the city has quite a few cases of students losing either of their parents. Schools are trying to extend a helping hand, with class teachers constantly being in touch with these children, counsellors monitoring them and even principals talking to them. Sharma’s school is dealing with five such students. Ravi’s cousin, who herself is in Class XI, said, “He has stopped talking, time to time he cries, we are trying to cheer him up. For 22 days, she was in hospital as her oxygen level was fluctuating and every night we used to talk over video calls.” She was 40 years old. The school has a Home Room period to reach out to students. “The well-being period is helping kids. The teachers have been of great support to them when the adults in the family are busy saving lives. Their friends and grandparents have also been helping a lot,” said the mother of two siblings, 11 and 13 years old, who lost their father on April 27. He was just 43. Several principals say such cases were rare during the first wave, but the situation is bad this time. Tagore International School, Vasant Vihar, has three such cases — two students lost their father and another, the mother. At MM Public School in Pitampura, two Class XII students have lost their fathers. Madhulika Sen, senior adviser at Tagore International, said, “We have asked the counsellors to talk to these children. The class teachers are in constant touch with them. We have also given a fee reduction a parent who had approached us. Till they get back on their feet, the school is helping them.” The Indian School has students of both primary and middle sections losing either of their parents. Tania Joshi, its principal, said, “The other day I was talking to a child who has just lost his mother. I asked him what he was doing. He told me he was now cuddling his father. It was just so sad.” At Mount Abu Public School, Rohini, six students have lost either of their parents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/after-covid-snatches-kids-parents-schools-pitch-in/articleshow/82586649.cms||Shradha Chettri

The rejoinder was filed in response to an affidavit submitted by the government in public interest litigations filed by South Goa Advocates Association (SGAA) and others over the high positivity rate of Covid-19 cases in Goa. Antonio Clovis da Costa, president of SGAA, proposed that a special task force or any committee be appointed by the high court headed by a retired judge of the high court along with medical professionals to ascertain the problem of oxygen supply plaguing the hospitals and to find solution to the problem immediately. He also proposed that the committee may also look into the other aspects raised in the petition pertaining to the supply of life-saving medicines as well as the vaccination programme. Explaining the position of supply of oxygen at the South Goa, North Goa District Hospital as also the Sub-District Hospital, Ponda, Dr Jose D'Sa, director of health services filed an affidavit and stated that no casualties have taken place in these hospitals for want of oxygen supply since there has been no shortage of oxygen at the hospitals. Dr Pratik Savant, president of the Goa Association of Resident Doctors (GARD), in his affidavit submitted that constitution of a Covid-19 task force, which could include representatives of GARD to monitor the situation, would go far in alleviating such difficulties, permitting greater focus on effective treatment of patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/form-task-force-to-pinpoint-o2-supply-woes/articleshow/82589015.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The EoI, officials said, was floated in a record time of 24 hours after the civic body got a green signal from the state government to buy its own vaccines. The BMC has said vaccines must be supplied in three weeks after it places the order. Companies from across the world, except those from countries sharing a border with India, can take part in the process. This means Chinese vaccine-makers are barred. While several state governments such as those in Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha and Karnataka have taken an in-principle decision to invite global tenders and procure vaccines, so far no tender or EoI has been floated by any of them. The BMC, the richest municipal corporation in Asia, is the first local body in India to float a global EoI to buy vaccines. Officials said interested suppliers will have to submit their bids by May 18, and they will be opened the same evening. ‘City needs fewer doses, will get quicker response’BMC officials said they are open to a deal with any approved vaccine manufacturer that comes forward to provide the 1 crore doses for which a global expression of interest has been floated. Apart from Covaxin and Covishield, the civic body will consider Sputnik V, which was developed in Russia and accorded emergency use authorisation in India, and vaccines developed by Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson. BMC’s decision to float an EoI may seem at odds with the state’s own plans, but officials said Mumbai’s needs being fewer, the chances of getting a quicker response from manufacturers were higher. While the state may seek supplies of up to 4 crore doses, BMC chief I S Chahal said Mumbai could do with1crore doses to ensure vaccination for all. More than 25 lakh doses have been given in the metropolis so far to various sections, including healthcare workers, senior citizens and thosein the18+ age-group. “The applicant should have a valid licence to manufacture/ export Covid–19 vaccine to India as per specifications mentioned in the EoI from the Competent Authority and/or Food and Drug Administration, government of India. The vaccine to be supplied must be as per the guidelines issued by Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR). DCGI approval for supply of the vaccines in India (is also needed). The applicant, besides having own manufacturing licence, should hold a valid WHO GMP certificate issued by the licensing authorities for all the premises from where vaccine is being manufactured,” the EoI stated, outlining the eligibility criteria.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-city-needs-fewer-doses-will-get-quicker-response/articleshow/82589055.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Real estate observers said these two cities, being among the most affected due to the Covid-19 pandemic, would also serve as a bellwether for the commercial real estate market in the years to come.“The worry is about a market like Mumbai, where the commercial spaces are largely being taken up by financial institutions or boutique start-ups. Over time, their requirement of spaces will be nowhere near that of IT or ITeS firms,” said a real estate observer from the region.Despite the high volume of leases up for renewal, Anarock said a slight upward trajectory in the rents might occur in the IT and ITeS-heavy cities like Pune and Bengaluru due to various factors.“The large IT companies had hired very well in the last fiscal, and they have good hiring plans in the ongoing fiscal too. These companies are moving towards a hybrid system of working over the coming year as vaccinations increase. These are the companies where management-level staff would work from office or home, but entry-level staff may have to travel to office regularly. Over the next year, these firms would also start to de-densify the offices that they have now. Besides, there has been a disruption in the supply of commercial real estate due to the slowing down of construction activity due to the lockdown and shortage of raw material. That is why we have projected that lease rents may rise in some cities where the spaces are predominantly taken up by IT or ITeS firms,” said Prashant Thakur, head of research at Anarock.The rise is expected to be around 5-10% in the second half of 2022, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/90m-sqft-office-space-up-for-renewal-in-6-cities-report/articleshow/82586613.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

Many such cases are coming to us where people have lost their entire family, children have lost both their parents. The situation of family members/children is very sensitive during this critical time. There is a need to take care of their feelings and mood at the moment, so that they can be gradually brought out of the sorrow/trauma of losing their parents,” said Dapinder Singh. During this epidemic, the 30-day limit period for claims in Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY), has been an issue with peope among many other things. PMJJBY was launched on May 9, 2015, and provides an insurance cover of Rs 2 lakh to bank account holders aged 18 to 50 years.The time limit is only 30 days for submission of documents such as claim form, discharge receipt, death certificate and cancelled cheques. Not only is it difficult to present these within 30 days a difficult task, it will also increase the risk of virus spread, the activists said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/activists-write-to-prez-requesting-pmjjby-claim-extention/articleshow/82586672.cms||---

---||Kolhapur||Kolhapur needs additional 600 oxygen, 150 ICU beds||Kolhapur: The Kolhapur health administration, anticipating further rise in cases of Covid-19, has estimated a requirement of additional 600 oxygen beds, 150 ICU beds and 200 ventilator beds. Currently, the district is witnessing highest ever mortality rate. On Monday, the mortality rate had gone up to 3.45% and has been hovering above 3% in last few days which is a cause of concern. The authorities, however, claimed the high mortality rate is not due to the shortage of beds, but due to other reasons. At present, Kolhapur has 2,356 oxygen beds, 244 ventilator beds and 529 ICU beds. Yogesh Sale, district health officer, said, “Major reason for deaths is delay in admission. Many also go for treatment in private hospitals which is not as per guidelines. The only way for good treatment is to get admitted to public or private Covid-designated hospitals. We have also found that due to rapid progression in infection, the patients are dying within days after admission to the hospitals. It may be due to comorbidity or any other underlying condition that the patients are not aware of.” Sale said though there are no deaths due to shortage of oxygen, the administration has asked medical officers of primary health centres to keep a tab on use of oxygen. “We are planning to add 300 beds with oxygen support and 125 ventilator beds. We have limited staff to manage ventilator beds. We have asked medical officers to ensure the patients are not occupying the oxygen or ventilator beds if they do not them.” he said. Currently, no ventilator beds are available in the district. There are only five ICU beds and around 224 oxygen beds that are vacant as per the dashboard. For ventilator beds, most of which are in private facilities, patients have to wait for several hours and need to register at all facilities for their turn.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-needs-additional-600-oxygen-150-icu-beds/articleshow/82555685.cms||---

Mayor Jai Prakash said, “It has been seen that novel coronavirus in the second wave is also infecting children in large numbers, which is a matter of concern. Mrs. Girdhar Lal Maternity Hospital is a small facility where a separate and a dedicated Covid facility for children can be developed to deal with future requirements. We are making arrangements for regular supply of oxygen here.” Meanwhile, the civic body has decided to put on hold its plan to add 25 beds to the Covid facility at Balak Ram Hospital. Officials said that unlike Hindu Rao and Rajan Babu hospitals where all beds at Covid wards were occupied on the day of the launch of these facilities, only 10 out of the 25 beds at Balak Ram Hospital had been occupied since Monday, the first day of the services. The corporation has no provision for pipeline oxygen supply or refilling cylinders at Balak Ram and is using oxygen concentrators. The hospital admitting only those patients whose oxygen saturation level is not below 90. “We have a facility with 35 concentrators here. Anyone coming with the oxygen saturation level below 90 are being referred to Hindu Rao and Rajan Babu. There are 117 cylinders, too, but arranging for their regular refilling is a difficult task,” said the mayor. As of now, the corporation has 280 Covid beds at Hindu Rao, 100 at Rajan Babu and 25 at Balak Ram hospitals. Jai Prakash confirmed that all these facilities would remain intact so that the corporation could deal with the third wave, if any.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/n-corpn-to-ready-100-bed-covid-ward-for-kids-as-city-braces-for-third-wave/articleshow/82586707.cms||Vibha Sharma

The price of a litre of diesel increased to Rs88.08.  Dattatray Mahadev Mehta, a transporter who owns five trucks and transports essentials like food grains and vegetables from different parts of the state to Market Yard in Pune, is in two minds about increasing the transportation charges for fear of losing whatever business he is getting in these trying times even though fuel prices are rising frequently. Mehta, however, said he was helpless and has been forced to absorb the losses to continue getting business. “Very few of us have been getting any business and every transporter is ready to slash their rates rather than lose business and stay at home. If I increase my transportation cost, I will be replaced by another transporter who is desperate to get business. Our condition is pathetic,” Mehta, who is the convenor of the Pune district motor goods transport association, told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/fuel-cost-rises-again-transporters-worried/articleshow/82586656.cms||Joy Sengupta

The Supreme Court in its order dated February 11 directed DEPwD of the ministry of social justice and empowerment to formulate norms after public consultation. Although the government has norms for those with disability of 40% and above, SC has sought the same for less than 40% disability where the nature of disability poses a barrier to the candidate in writing an examination. It also sought that these guidelines should also prescribe appropriate norms to ensure that condition of the candidate is duly certified by such competent medical authority as may be prescribed so as to ensure that only genuine candidates in need of the facility are able to avail it. The department has developed draft guidelines on the basis of the recommendation of a committee headed by secretary, DEPwD. They provide criteria for availing the facility for scribe/compensatory time for such candidates while taking written examination, including composition of the medical authority for certifying requirement of scribe. The expert committee in DEPwD is of the view that even if the person does not have disability of 40% or more, there are various types of clinical problems that can affect the writing capacity in cases such as congenital anomaly, post traumatic deformity and amputations, Hansens and other paralysis, arthritic hand and Parkinsonism. The draft norms recommend that the basis for grant of scribe and compensatory time should be the assessment of the capability of a person to read, write and with that of normal speed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/exam-scribes-for-disabled-government-seeks-inputs/articleshow/82593141.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Fees not paid, school blocks students from online classes||JAIPUR: District Education Officer (DEO) of Jaipur has questioned city’s Jayshree Periwal High School for blocking students from online classes. Parents have alleged that the school authorities, without any information or warning, blocked many students from online classes although the Supreme Court had allowed that fee of 2020-21 could be paid by August. There are few cases where parents have paid the fees, but the students were still blocked from online classes, . Ram Chandra Pilaniya, DEO, Jaipur, said, “We received a complaint that even after paying the fee, the school has debarred many students from online classes. This is violation of Supreme Court guidelines and we have asked the school authorities to let students attend the classes.” Rishikesh Maharishi, a parent whose two children are studying in JPHS said, “I have deposited the fees for 2021-22 first quarter and had planned to submit fees for the last session, as per SC guidelines, till August 5. But still, my children’s online classes have been blocked by the school authorities. We were not given any warning notice or message. We have called up every source in the school but no response.” Jaswant Chaudhary was in the hospital after being infected from Covid-19 when he got a call from the school authorities for fees to which he said he will pay after being discharged from hospital. His child has also been barred from online classes, he claimed. JPHS principal Madhu Maini told TOI that these were false allegations and no student had ever been barred from online classes and neither such a thing would be done in future. Sunil Yadav, president of All Rajasthan Parents Forum, said, “This is sheer misuse of power on part of the school authorities. If we can pay the fees till August 5 as per Supreme Court order then on what grounds has school blocked the students? As per the court’s order school cannot prevent anyone from classes. Administration should take action against the school.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/fees-no-paid-city-school-blocks-students-from-online-classes/articleshow/82586693.cms||---

In fact, now there are no vaccines. More shocking is the fact that while the first dose has been administered to 17 crore people, most of them are facing a precarious situation owing to non-availability of the second dose. The NDA government has no strategy to provide a second dose. There is complete lack of consistency and planning across the country,” Patole said. The former speaker of the assembly said Modi had promised free vaccines against Covid-19 for all, but in the absence of a strategy the plan has failed to take off. “The central government is misleading even the Supreme Court. The NDA government has questioned the wisdom of the apex court, saying the court is not a Covid expert and as such it should not interfere in government administration,” Patole said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/patole-need-a-natl-policy-on-vaccination-in-mumbai/articleshow/82589169.cms||---

Rao, along with Pune collector Rajesh Deshmukh, visited the site on Wednesday and held discussions with Bharat Biotech officials. The Bombay high court recently allowed Biovet to manufacture Covaxin vials at the fully operational and ready vaccine plant on the 12-hectare site in Manjari Khurd village. “Pune district, with the Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech, is surely going to become the vaccine capital of India. We have assured full cooperation to the company top officials [of Bharat Biotech] who were here to discuss and chart out the road map ahead. They are to give us a detailed plan in a week’s time,” Rao said. He added that once the facility is fully operational, the company would be able to manufacture 15-20 million doses per month. The local administration would assist the company for ensuring water availability, security, approach roads and deployment of manpower. “From water to electricity supply, logistics, security and licences, we have extended all cooperation and will help the company on all fronts to speed up production,” Deshmukh said, adding that the detailed plan would be ready within the next few days. “It will give us a clear idea on how the company plans to operate in Pune,” he added.

Once you have sanctioned, is it not your duty to fill up the posts?” said the bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni while hearing a suo motu PIL on measures to tackle rise of Covid cases among inmates of the 47 prisons across the state. “Amravati central prison has only one medical officer… ,” the high court said. There are 63 posts vacant still out of 112 sanctioned posts of medical officers. The HC asked public prosecutor Deepak Thakare what their eligibility was. He said for some it was MBBS and for others even Bachelor of Ayurveda Sciences. The court found the state’s reply silent on the staffing of prisons. It was informed that only two doctors of the 32 had MBBS degree. The HC asked the state what it was doing about vaccination to inmates who do not have Aadhar cards. Senior counsel Mihir Desai for intervenor, an NGO, said Centre’s new SOP of May 6 allows for vaccination to inmates and other categories to get the jabs without Aadhar but based on other IDs, including prisoner ID. The state said over 10,000 inmates aged over 18 have Aadhar cards. Prof Vijay Raghavan of TISS asked the HC to consider vaccination camps in prisons to ensure safety of inmates and staff. The state had earlier said it was considering such camps. State counsel Akshay Shinde submitted a detailed note to the HC which said that there was a detailed meeting via video-conferencing of all deputy inspector general and superintendents of prisons in the state on May 1. He said 40 temporary prisons have been set up, 24,250 additional masks distributed among inmates and 50 smart phones made available for communication with family or lawyers. Desai said the HC had last month permitted such meeting twice a week but sought better, more uniform compliance. The high-powered committee in a meeting on May 11 has recommended that 12,751 applications for interim bail pending before various courts are to be decided within 10 days by May 20. All pending applications for emergency parole, too, are to be decided by May 20.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/at-least-fill-sanctioned-posts-of-docs-in-state-jails-says-bombay-hc/articleshow/82589162.cms||---

Bhagalpur SSP Natasha Gudia had formed a three-member probe team , which contacted the victim over the phone in Patna and registered an FIR at Bhagalpur Mahila Thana. The Bhagalpur SSP, when contacted, said Jyoti was produced at the Bhagalpur court and forwarded to jail. Further investigation is underway, the SSP added. Raushan, who was later shifted to a private hospital in Patna, succumbed to Covid-19 infection. The woman had come to her mother’s place at Kahalgaon on Holi and her husband got infected with coronavirus. Several videos of Ruchi, alleging her molestation and harassment at the Bhagalpur hospital and misbehaviour at another private hospital in Patna besides negligence in treatment of her husband, had gone viral on social media on Monday. When contacted on Wednesday, the woman sent a video urging the owners to investigate the mismanagement at their respective private hospitals and indulgence of the employees in corrupt practices. She said her fight is against the employees and hospitals management who damage the system. In her heartbreaking video, Ruchi alleged that some other videos explaining the excuse of private hospitals were released today. She urged the police and hospital management to trust her statement only as she is the eyewitness and it is she who had to suffer the ordeal. Demanding an in-depth inquiry by the hospital authorities/owners and the state government so that she gets justice, Ruchi said she stands by her statements given to the media.

According to the sanitation staff, especially working for the contractor, they have not been provided with any gloves, masks, or sanitizers due to which 15 people have died within a month. Sanitation staff working under JMC, Greater and Heritage have also alleged that the gloves provided to them are not sufficient.

The PIL was filed by NGO Fight for Right. The notice had to be responded by May18. Vijay Pathak, counsel for the petitioner, told the court that the pandemic had taken a drastic form and private hospitals were brimming with Covid patients. He added that taking advantage of the situation, many private hospitals were fleecing patients, on which the state government or medical department have no effective control. Recently, there have been reports in the media that a private hospital based in Jaipur informed that beds are available, which were allotted at a pemium. Similarly, life-saving medicines and oxygen were being sold in black market. The petition said the state government has given duty to some officers in private hospitals, but since the hospital is in the private management there is not control over them. Recently, two private hospitals in Jaipur stopped admission due lack of oxygen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/hc-notice-on-petition-seeking-govt-take-over-pvt-hopitals/articleshow/82586743.cms||---

The government may give approval to it any moment. Looking at the surge in Covid cases in rural areas, the state government suspended NREGA work, which is the only means of livelihood for people in the villages. “The government has received many petitions requesting it to resume NREGA work. Hence, it is under consideration,” said an official. “People in the villages are averse to taking medicines for Covid or undergoing any treatment. Efforts are being made by the government to create awareness about the disease among them,” the official added. Meena Devi, a MGNREGA worker from Kotra gram panchayat in Jawaja panchayat samiti (Ajmer), said, “My husband, who works in a hotel in Ahmedabad, is sitting at home now. There’s no work there so he returned home (in Ajmer). He used to earn Rs 12,000 per month, but he is jobless now. How will we manage two square meals a day if we do not get NREGA work?” “I urge the government to resume NREGA work. We have four children and my mother-in-law at home. It is becoming difficult to sustain a living without NREGA work,” added Devi, who has been working under the employment guarantee scheme for the past two years. Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan (MKSS) member Kartik, who is in-charge of Ajmer division, said, “There are thousands of workers in Jawaja tehsil who are demanding NREGA work. The employment guarantee scheme is the only means through which people in the village can earn money. Many workers, who work in Ahmedabad and Jaipur hotels, have come back to the villages (due to the lockdown) and are demanding NREGA work.

He’s laid to rest over 50,000 in 20 years||MUMBAI: Tiptoeing into his Chembur home well past midnight, his uniform drenched in perspiration, constable Dnyandeo Ware sinks into a chair. He has had a rough day, having laid to rest over a dozen unidentified people who died of various causes in a span of 24 hours. Ware has worked on the Police department’s hearse for two decades and has witnessed every major tragedy during this time that cost Mumbaikars their lives. But nothing has been as relentless as the Covid-19 pandemic. His family is understandably worried about his going to work during the second wave, given his co-morbidities. But Ware, who has cremated 50000 unidentified individuals in his career so far, says it’s his life’s mission to give dignity to those who don’t have their kin around to perform last rites. “Mee punya kamavto aahe (I’m earning virtues),” he says, explaining why he won’t stop working, even though about 50 bodies that the hearse ferried since last year tested positive for Covid. Ware adds that he finds the job more satisfying than routine police station duties. The Police department used to have 12 hearses, one for each police zone. Gradually, the number of vehicles shrunk and only three are operational now. Ware drives the hearse that covers some of the busiest public hospitals such as Sion, JJ, Nair, GT, St George and the Tuberculosis Hospital at Sewri. When an unidentified individual is found dead in south or central Mumbai, the police station staff summon Ware. He steers the hearse to the location accompanied by two workers appointed for carrying bodies. After being ferried to a hospital, a policeman conducts a panchnama on the deceased and the body is moved to a morgue. If the relatives of the deceased cannot be located within 15 days, then Ware is summoned again. This time, he ferries the body to the crematorium. “If the deceased individual’s faith is known, then his last rites are carried out in accordance to his customs,” said Ware who performs all duties a family member would have, including lighting the pyre and praying for the soul of the departed. Typically, constables posted as a hearse drivers are transferred after five years of service. But Ware, who joined the police department in 1995, has been on hearse driving duty since 2001 and is keen to continue till he retires. “The job is challenging.... I have to check paperwork and ensure that bodies don’t get swapped at the hospital,” he said. He was recently felicitated by joint police commissioner (law and order) Vishwas Nangre Patil. What do his folks at home think of his job? His wife, who ensures he carries a tiffin of her home cooked meals every day, says she is "very proud" of him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-soulful-duty-hes-laid-to-rest-over-50000-in-20-yrs/articleshow/82589196.cms||Nitasha Natu

The municipal office was shifted to a spacious, multi-storey building in Khar West on May 1. By May 7, a vaccination centre went operational in its former premises. Vinayak Vispute, assistant municipal commissioner, said it was an apt space to be converted into a vaccination centre as it already had all the required facilities such as a waiting area, rooms for citizens to be administered the jab, washrooms and drinking water. “We are vaccinating around 200 persons daily for now. There was a crowd on the first two days but thereafter the system was streamlined, as only those with prior appointments were being allowed in,” he said. Vispute further said other than starting a vaccination centre in every corporator ward in H-West, they also plan to set up a drive-in facility in Bandra West shortly on a ground near Hotel Rangsharda. Local corporator Asif Zakeria said the BMC was already scouting for a location to start a centre and what better than to use one that belongs to the BMC. Zakeria said the BMC has tied up with Bhabha Hospital in the vicinity in case of an adverse event following immunisation (AEFI). “The old ward office was frequented by residents considering that it was around for decades and therefore we felt it would be apt to start a centre within it.” BJP corporator Swapna Mhatre from H-West Ward said currently with many awaiting their second vaccination dose, the priority is to start a centre wherever they can. “New centres would ensure crowds spread out.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmcs-former-bandra-ward-office-turns-into-vax-centre/articleshow/82582573.cms||Richa Pinto

Claiming there was no dearth of medicines in Telangana, industries minister KT Rama Rao said the state has three-month reserve of medicines and there was no need to panic. The task force, headed by KTR and comprising senior officials, including chief secretary Somesh Kumar and principal secretary Jayesh Ranjan, at its first meeting on Wednesday took stock of Covid 19 situation in the state — cases, supply of medicines and oxygen. The task force said about 1.5 lakh remdesivir injections and other drugs, including those to treat black fungus infection (mucormycosis), were available in the state and more were being procured. The government would hold meetings with vaccine and remdesivir manufacturers soon, he said. “It has come to our notice that some hospitals are giving remdesivir injections and oxygen to some patients though they don’t require. This is leading to artificial scarcity and black marketing. The director of health has been directed to issue an advisory to hospitals not to use medicines unnecessarily. Some people involved in black marketing of remdesiviir have been arrested,” the minister said, after the task force meeting. The Centre on Wednesday said that Telangana was one among the states where the curve was flattening, he revealed.“The government is conducting fever survey and 60 lakh houses were covered. The needy persons are being given medical kits. With this, we could able to save the lives of many people and avoid hospitalisation,” KTR said. The TRS working president said the task force would soon take a decision on global tenders for procuring vaccines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/stop-indiscriminate-o2-remdesivir-use-govt-tells-hospitals/articleshow/82588810.cms||Koride Mahesh

Holding their belongings, many were seen at railway stations and bus stops during the morning hours, figuring out ways to leave. Several opted for private transportation, buses and vans to leave the city immediately. Even after the daily relaxations between 6 am and 10 am got over, most migrants waited at footpaths near the Secunderabad railway station, hoping to catch a train back home. “I was working in Hyderabad for the past few months. But now that the government has declared a lockdown, we are not sure as to how long it will go on. Hence, I am heading back to my hometown near Jhansi,” said Vivek Lal, a mason. Even before the lockdown commenced in Telangana, many started leaving the city fearing that a country-wide lockdown will be imposed again. Quite a few left the city before the West Bengal elections while many others left ahead of Ramzan and wedding season. However, those at the labour camps in the city, continued with the work as the state has exempted all constructions and project activities, where workers are available in-situ or in secured labour camps. “Today, there is no disruption in construction work as all labourers reported to work as usual,” said a contractor manning one of the largest labour camps in the city, which houses about 2,500 migrant workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/migrants-begin-to-leave-city-in-numbers/articleshow/82588518.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

---||Mumbai||Covid-19: Pandemic triggers mental disorders but insurance eludes many||MUMBAI: When 66-year-old Pritam P tested positive for Covid late last year, it triggered a far more debilitating illness in his wife—her underlying depression and suicidal tendencies surfaced. Mrs P, a retired bank employee, had to be hospitalised for almost a month under the supervision of a Mumbai psychiatrist.  The couple’s next nightmare began after she was discharged.  While her bank’s group mediclaim covered a portion of her medical expenses, her own policy continues to reject the Rs 3.5 lakh claim, exposing the confounding absence of clarity and uniformity with regards to mental illness insurance. The ongoing pandemic has catalyzed a range of mental disorders—from mild anxiety to suicidal behaviour requiring hospitalisation. As independent insurance agent Vickram Thakkar says, “Before lockdown, we used to get six-seven claims for mental illness in a year. Now we are getting seven-eight claims in a month.” Several insurers, though, continue to try and get around the 2017 law which establishes parity between physical and mental illness. Already traumatised, families find themselves confronting both stigma and ignorance when it comes to claims approval. Because a mental illness is not as tangible as, say, a heart surgery, insurers might question the need for hospitalisation. “But why on earth would I send my child into a psychiatric hospital just to be able to claim insurance?” asks Natasha M, the mother of a 27-year-old with severe obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), bordering on psychosis. Her son’s compulsions got exacerbated because of the discomfort of being locked in a small apartment, leading to bouts of aggression. He had to be sedated and admitted to a hospital where he gradually stabilised. When the patient’s or the family’s safety is at stake, hospitalisation is necessary, say psychiatrists. Insurers though counter that several claimants may not have disclosed pre-existing conditions. “Insurance is a business at the end of the day,” says the head of a private insurance company. “And it’s a business that runs on good faith. But we do give an opportunity to the insured individual to tell the full story and work with that.” Last month, the Delhi high court rapped a national insurance company that refused to honour the claim of a young woman who spent a month in a Gurugram hospital for schizoaffective disorder.  In her judgement, Justice Pratibha Singh stated: “The present petition raises issues of grave public importance. In the modern world, mental health is as important as physical health... While physical illnesses are manifested in the human body in some form, mental illnesses do not always have visible physical manifestations. However, mental illnesses can also be debilitating and destructive. The recent pandemic also highlights this beyond any doubt. Circumstances leading to patients requiring isolation, healthy persons being subjected to lockdowns, work from home conditions, loss of employment leading to lack of confidence for long durations have led to several mental problems. Such mental conditions need to be dealt with immediately. Availability of insurance for mental disabilities or conditions is, therefore, not only important but is an essential need.” “People should know that they can claim, and they should claim,” says Dr Soumitra Pathare, director of Centre for Mental Health Law and Policy in Pune. “This artificial distinction between physical and mental illness needs to go. An illness is an illness. All debates on this are over.” And yet, mental health advocates point out that you can compare physical and mental illness only up to a point and much needs to change in the way insurance products are designed in the future. “Because the social ramifications on the person as well as the family are so qualitatively different,” says Dr Nirmala Srinivasan, founder of the Families’ Alliance on Mental Illness. “Practitioners like insurers should also understand this. They should not have such a long exemption period for pre-existing conditions.” She suggests they should also cover ongoing treatment, whether it is counselling, therapy or ECT treatments, because sometimes hospitalisation is not required if medication is given early enough. According to a report published by the ministry of health in December 2019, even before the country got besieged with Covid and its multiple fallouts, one in every seven people in India had a mental disorder, ranging from mild to severe. The most cases were caused by depressive and anxiety disorders—with 45 to 46 million suffering from each—followed by schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. “Their prevalence is increasing across India and is relatively higher in the southern states and in females,” the report stated. Recognising the enormity of the burden of mental disorders, the Mental Health Act of 2017 clearly established parity between physical and mental illness.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/pandemic-triggers-mental-disorders-but-insurance-eludes-many/articleshow/82582393.cms||Namita Devidayal

Passengers were worried about reaching their destinations. Following queries, Hyderabad police commissioner Anjani Kumar clarified that passengers will be allowed to travel in cab during lockdown hours. “Passengers will have to produce their tickets/boarding pass following which they will be allowed to cross the check posts,” said Kumar. Airport authorities said authorised cab operators to and from the airport will run round the clock. A similar confusion was seen among many travelling to and from the railway station. “I had a planned journey on May 15 from Hyderabad to Tirupati.

---||Hyderabad||Send 13 lakh vax immediately, Telangana urges Centre||HYDERABAD: The Telangana government has urged the Centre to allocate 13 lakh Covid-19 vaccine doses immediately to meet the state’s requirements. The government said allocations of medicines, oxygen and ventilators should be made to the state considering the surge in the positive cases and patients belonging to other states coming down to Telangana for Covid-19 treatment. “The state needs 10 lakh Covishield and three lakh Covaxin doses by the end of this month. A total of 1.29 crore vaccine doses are required — 33 lakh for second dose and 96 lakh for first dose — to cover 100 per cent in the state,” state finance minister T Harish Rao said during a video-conference with Union health minister Harsh Vardhan on Wednesday. He also asked Centre to send 2,000 ventilators to the state immediately. The Union minister, while expressing satisfaction over measures being taken up by Telangana to check spike in Covid-19 cases, assured to supply more vaccines, Remdesivir, testing kits and oxygen to the state. Harish sought 20,000 Remdesivir injections every day, 1,500 Tocilizumab injections and scale up oxygen supplies from 450 MTs to 600 MTs a day. He also asked for two lakh testing kits to ramp up Covid-19 tests. Instead of allocating oxygen cryogenic tankers from like Odisha, the Centre should allot oxygen from neighbouring Maharashtra and AP which would reduce transportation time, Harish Rao said. “Since people from neighbouring states like Maharashtra, Karnataka, AP and Chhattisgarh are coming to Hyderabad for Covid-19 treatment, there is a scarcity of medicines like Remdesivir. Instead of going by the population of the state, the Centre should consider positive cases from other states and those getting treatment in Hyderabad while allocating medicines and oxygen to the state,” Harish Rao said. The minister informed that the state government has improved medical infrastructure in the past one year. “In the first wave, only 18,232 beds were available in government hospitals, which has now increased to 53,755 beds. Similarly, oxygen and ICU beds have increased three times.” He further said, “Following instructions from CM K Chandrasekhar Rao, a door-to-door fever survey was taken up by pressing 27,039 teams and providing health kits to suspected Covid-19 patients to prevent deaths. So far, 60 lakhs have been covered in the state.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/send-13l-vax-immediately-telangana-urges-centre/articleshow/82588599.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Several workers stranded in uncertainty||HYDERABAD: The announcement of a lockdown has jolted many migrant workers, many of whom don’t have enough money to go back to their home states. Many said that unless someone comes to their rescue, they won’t be able to survive for the next ten days or go back to their villages, without earnings. “I moved to the city with my husband, four children, and brother sometime back. Even if we want to go back, we need money for tickets. To stay here, we need Rs 5, 500 for rent and more money for essentials,” said Moslema S, a migrant worker from West Bengal residing in Banjara Hills. Moslema, who earns a meagre salary said that if the lockdown had been announced much in advance, her family would have at least stocked up ration by borrowing money, but now they are now left in the lurch. Similar is the case with Shashi Kumar from Bihar, who returned to the city about a month back. “Now, the state has again announced lockdown. I am planning to somehow manage for the next 10 days and hoping that I can go back to work thereafter,” said Kumar, who stays at Hafeezpet. He said that he has ration left for two more days. “Soon after the state announced the lockdown, my employer left for his village. Now, I don’t even know whom to approach for money,” said Kumar, who earns Rs 250 per day. Many said that they don’t mind going to work even during the pandemic or lockdown, as it was the only means for them to feed their families “But our owners have asked us not to report to work during the lockdown period,” a migrant worker said.  SCR officials said it is hard to asceratin if there is an increase in number of people leaving the city as all trains being operated are reserved. They said people waiting outside the station may have a reserved ticket for an evening or night train or might be hopeful they would get a ticket to their hometowns for a future date.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/several-workers-stranded-in-uncertainty/articleshow/82588411.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

The SLBC said that staff at branches and administrative offices may be allowed to work on rotational basis. However, banks would have to take decisions in this regard for effective implementation at the ground-level without affecting services. The arrangement would be implemented from May 13 to May 20. Meanwhile, all back-office services of the banks like currency chests, ATM cash loading vendors, core banking solution projects, offices in data centre, data recovery centres offices, forex back offices and SWIFT centres will function as per the normal routine.

While the exact figures are yet to be ascertained, an estimated Rs 100 crore worth of liquor was picked from Telangana Beverages Corporation Limited (TSBCL) depots by shops. Several shop owners said that sales were dull and that it would take time to adjust to the new timings. It may be mentioned that stocks picked by shops are not equivalent to liquor sales over the counter. In March, the state netted over Rs 2,473 crore in liquor sales. Now, many shopkeepers have said the new operation timings for depots under lockdown are inconvenient for them to lift stocks. On the consumer front, many have already picked up their requisite stocks to tide over the coming days fearing a closure of shops. “One person purchased liquor worth over Rs 8,000 and like him many stocked up for the near future,” said KV Ravi, owner and manager of a liquor shop in Narayanguda. Some said the new timings could be another reason behind the slow sales. “Some may find it embarrassing to be seen outside a liquor store early in the morning,” said another store owner. Some stores on the outskirts did see a rush and a video has gone viral showing a store owner taking to a loudspeaker, urging customers to maintain social distance to avoid being infected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/slow-business-for-liquor-stores-owners-cite-logistical-troubles/articleshow/82589010.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Traffic on city roads became sparse after 11 am. Several passengers who had booked train tickets reached the station early in anticipation of a lack of public transport. Crowds at vaccination centres also thinned out after lockdown came into effect. City police commissioners personally supervised lockdown enforcement in the morning. “Essential services have been exempted from lockdown. Essential service operators need not obtain e-passes and they can put up an A4 size sheet on the windshield mentioning the essential items they are transporting and it will work like a pass. Others who need to travel during lockdown due to various reasons can apply for e-pass through police website, https://policeportal.tspolice.gov.in...,” Hyderabad CP Anjani Kumar said. Cyberabad CP VC Sajjanar and Rachakonda CP Mahesh Bhagwat also visited various spots to monitor enforcement. “We observed that only those who have to go to work or travel to airport, railway stations or for medical purposes or for personal emergencies are coming on to the roads. We will book cases under IPC and Disaster Management Act against lockdown violators and seize vehicles,” Sajjanar said. In all, around 1,100 e-passes were issued in three commissionerates. Low turnout for jabsAt Khairatabad UPHC, around 90 people took vaccine on Tuesday but the number dropped to 30 on Wednesday. On-duty medical officer P Suvarna said most people who took the shot, came before lockdown. “The low turnout could be due to lack of proper information...,” the doctor said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/streets-sparse-as-cps-oversee-enforcement/articleshow/82589046.cms||Mahesh Buddi

---||Delhi||Covid effect: Akshay Tritiya loses glitter for jewellers, a damp squib for pandits||New Delhi: While Akshay Tritiya is considered one of the most auspicious occasions for wedding, the Covid-19 lockdown in Delhi-NCR means almost no income for those in related businesses this season. Jewellers report that more than half of their orders have been cancelled. Online pandit booking portals and startups say they are hardly receiving any booking. Almost 90% of the wedding bookings, which were scheduled on May 14, have been cancelled while a few are doing it digitally to stay safe. The unorganised nature of the sector, however, makes it hard to assess the real numbers. A portal, mypanditg.com, reports that while it used to get 150-200 marriage bookings on Akshay Tritya before the pandemic, the number this time is just 25-20. “Very few people are going ahead with their plans due to the pandemic and new curbs,” said Mukesh Singh, its founder. According to Arun Kumar of harivara.com, “There is over 90% drop in wedding bookings. In the whole of Delhi-NCR, we have received just five-six bookings this Akshay Tritya. We are also witnessing many cancellations. In many cases, people have postponed it for another three months.” Officials of key temples at Kalkaji, Chhatarpur and Jhadewalan said they weren’t carrying out any marriage services. Under the more stringent lockdown guidelines, no wedding function is permitted at public places, banquet halls or hotels. A gathering of maximum 20 people has been permitted just for ceremonies at court or home. No other facilities, such as DJ sound system, tents and catering services, is permitted. While Akshay Tritya is considered auspicious, the safety of people is important, said Pandit Pyarelal of Najafgarh. “I know about just two-three weddings. It is the same story all over Delhi.” Yogesh Singhal of Bullion and Jewellers Association from Kuncha Mahajani in Chandni Chowk said they usually did maximum business this season, but not since last year. All over Delhi, a loss of Rs 300 crore has been estimated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-effect-akshay-tritiya-loses-glitter-for-jewellers-a-damp-squib-for-pandits/articleshow/82586768.cms||Paras Singh

After the 24 hours ultimatum given by it to the state government ended on Wednesday, the GMERS Faculty Association, the body of faculty members of all the eight GMERS Medical Colleges of the state, boycotted Covid-19 duties from Wednesday noon. On International Nurses Day, the GMERS Nurses Association at GMERS Medical College and Hospital, Gotri too joined the doctors of the hospital in their strike to press for their long pending demands. The United Nurses Forum (UNF) at state-run SSG Hospital on the other hand has threatened to go on strike from May 18. With both doctors and nurses at Gotri medical college going on strike and abstaining from Covid-19 duties, most of the work was performed by resident doctors, interns and nursing students. “Despite our continuous representations, the state government has taken no concrete steps to end our woes. We have been hearing assurances since the last ten years,” said Dr Hiren Prajapati, president of GMERS Faculty Association. Doctors and nurses of GMERS are demanding proper promotion policy, government contribution to PF, allowances as given to government employees and arrears that they have not received even after the implementation of seventh pay commission. They are also demanding that the state government should fill up the vacant posts and increase the strength of permanent staff members to ensure that GMERS medical colleges run smoothly. The nursing staff at SSG Hospital wore black ribbons and staged a demonstration outside the office of medical superintendent. “We have already given a memorandum to the chief minister and deputy chief minister with demand to provide us central government pay scale and specific allowances. We have also demanded that the government should stop outsourcing and contractual system and we should be paid at least Rs 30,000 to Rs 35,000 per month. We have also demanded an increase in the stipend of nursing students,” said Deepkamal Vyas, president of UNF.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/doctors-nurses-boycott-covid-19-duties-at-gmers/articleshow/82582678.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Police on alert to check for ‘wedding violations’ on May 14||Jaipur: The state government has beefed up its intel network to crack down on marriages that were to take place on May 14, the most auspicious day known as ‘Akhateej.’ Despite strict lockdown that restricts the limit of people attending a wedding to 11, several local administrations are on a watchout for violators. The day is marked with lakhs of marriages in the state every year, especially child marriages in the rural areas.Rahul Prakash, additional commissioner of police, Jaipur Police Commissionerate, says that all police stations have been asked to keep a tab on marriages violating the revised norms. “All agencies are providing information on marriages which are taking place on May 14. It is being passed to the concerned police stations to verify and to ensure that no violation takes place,” said Prakash, who cleared that police is following zero-tolerance policy and those found violating will face action. Nagaur district administration has adopted a social engineering approach by honouring those who have postponed their marriage. “Marriage is a social event based on customs and traditions. We have been trying to urge everyone that marriage can take place with pomp and gaiety once we defeat the pandemic and motivating the people to postpone it on their own,” said Jitendra Soni, district collector Nagaur. The bordering districts like Dholpur, Karauli and Bharatpur in the east and Chittorgarh, Pratapgarh, Dungarpur and Banswara in the south have made elaborate arrangements to ensure that marriage parties shouldn’t travel interstate. Police in Dholpur has increased patrolling of areas that provides safe passage to Agra or UP.

Farmers, who had reason to celebrate the bumper production early in the season, are now apprehensive of losses with the sudden drop in prices. Mangoes from Nuzivid have a global market. As many as 34 varieties that include Banginapalli, Thotapur, Chinna Rasalu and Pedda Rasalu are grown here and exported from the Nunna mango market, Asia’s largest. With sufficient rainfall and suitable climatic conditions, farmers expected the crop to fetch solid profits this season. The cost of one tonne of fine quality Chinna Rasalu was Rs 48,000 in the last week of March and farmers hoped the price would stay in the same range. With the rapid surge in Covid-19 cases, however, traders from Punjab, Haryana and Delhi stopped coming to the local markets. “Covid-19 has affected us badly for two consecutive years. We distributed fruits free of cost in 2020 due to the Covid-19 lockdown. Similarly, we are unable to export the crop with the partial lockdown this year. Price in the market fell to Rs 18,000 per tonne. Government should provide a transport facility and help us overcome this crisis,” said Manne Ragu Ram Babu, a farmer from Aagiripalli village of Krishna district. Meanwhile, many farmers are directly selling mangoes to consumers through makeshift stalls along the main roads of Vijayawada city. “I have invested Rs 3 lakh on my four-acre mango garden. I received a huge crop and expected profits. But Covid-19 changed the situation. We have decided to sell mangoes door-to-door to avoid losses. There has been a good response from the public,” said Vema Reddy, a farmer from Nunna.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/mango-farmers-stare-at-losses-2-years-in-a-row/articleshow/82584209.cms||Venu Lanka

---||Ahmedabad||Show parking space proof, then buy car: Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation||AHMEDABAD: Under the new parking policy finalized by the AMC, people will have to furnish proof that they have parking space before buying vehicles. The policy also envisages discouraging people from buying multiple cars. The corporation has also decided to deter parking for extended periods in public areas. The policy was released in the last week of April and the details were made available on Wednesday.  Under the policy, monthly and annual permits will be given for common parking plots. The AMC plans to give parking permits covering streets around residential societies. As for owning several cars, the AMC has said: “[possessing] multiple cars is broadly a luxury which needs to be discouraged and the next step is to have progressively upwards tax for the second, third and fourth car.” Central and state governments in 2017 had declared their intention to frame new rules that would make it mandatory for new vehicle owners to give proof that a parking area is available to them. The AMC will frame rules, regulations, and guidelines to demand proof of parking space. The new parking policy encourages sharing of parking space. It states that due to the scarcity of parking space in Ahmedabad and the uneven distribution of parking facilities, the available space must be used effectively. “Areas such as CG Road, Ashram Road, Paldi, and other CBD areas often face a peak rise in parking demand during office hours, whereas the demand reduces on weekends,” the policy says. “The parking spaces of office buildings, schools, banks and business parks, malls and parks also depict a variable use of their parking spaces during weekdays and weekends.” Other vehicles of that area are unable to use that parking due to ownership and jurisdiction issues, the policy says. It says the disparity between supply and demand of parking space can be dealt with by sharing of parking spaces. Also, the new policy makes provisions to encourage sharing of parking space among several buildings and facilities close to each other. However, the chairpersons or office-bearers concerned will have to give a no-objection certificate for vehicles. To address the use of intermediate public transport (IPTS), the corporation will designate free on-street spots for parking taxis and autorickshaws. Other vehicles cannot park at these spots. The city traffic department has already identified 3,955 parking spots for autorickshaws. POINTERS: Towing away chaos *Private buildings can share parking spaces and lend a part of their space to other vehicles * Parking on the streets at nights will now come with a charge. Residential streets to be identified as parking zones *Common parking plots in commercial establishments: 40% for members and 60% for the general public *Commercial establishments can buy slots in AMC parking zones *Separate parking cells to implement the policy *Taxi and auto drivers can park only at designated stands; parking won’t be allowed on roads *Parking charges at public transport facilities like metro rail stations will be rationalized *Traders requiring the movement of heavy vehicles will be encouraged with incentives to move away from the centre of the city||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/show-parking-space-proof-then-buy-car-amc/articleshow/82586827.cms||Himanshu Kaushik
---||Mumbai||Ex-partner and cops framed me in Mumbai: Chhabria||Mumbai: Car designer Dilip Chhabria, who was recently released on bail in the alleged dual car registration racket, has claimed that his former partner in DC Designs Pvt Ltd had connived with police, including former police commissioner Param Bir Singh and suspended API Sachin Waze, and framed him in the false case. Chhabria has claimed that extortion demands were made by Waze and Riyaz Kazi; both have been arrested in the bomb scare outside Ambani’s residence and Mansukh Hiran murder cases. In January, the crime branch arrested Chhabria in the dual registration racket based on the complaint filed by Chennai based businessman Indermal Ramani. Chhabria in his statement said, “These people roped in a noted comedian and turned his contractual dispute with me into a criminal case to aggravate the propagation of scandal so that my downfall is accelerated and I bow down to their illegal demands in the shortest period. However, I decided to surrender myself to destiny rather than playing in the hands of these extortionists.” “All this turmoil came with a high cost. Due to my incarceration, my family members were threatened with arrest. Extortion demands were made by Waze and Kazi...for Rs 10-25 crore which was negotiated again and again with me. My workshop was illegally seized, which was opened after I filed a writ petition in the Bombay high court,” he added. —S Ahmed Ali||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/ex-partner-and-cops-framed-me-in-mumbai-chhabria/articleshow/82589446.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Ahmedabad||AMC proposes local area parking plan for city||Ahmedabad: The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has proposed a local area parking plan for the entire city. It has also proposed to set up a traffic and parking cell (T&PC) cell to implement the parking policy. The policy makes it mandatory to have a local area level parking plan in vision with the Ahmedabad parking policy and give right of way to motorised and non-motorised vehicles. The local area plan has to identify parking strategies, define desirable outcomes, identify sets of strategy-mix to achieve the outcomes of parking plan, conduct traffic and parking surveys, identify area with parking demand based on the analysis of the data, identify parking zones and bring about a change in parking behaviour. The parking policy documents state that public dissatisfaction at strict imposition of parking rules in the beginning is expected. Meanwhile, the T&PC will have officers from various departments such as city traffic police, estate or TDO, traffic engineering, city planning, and regional transport office. The cell will be responsible for effective management and implementation of the parking policy, by-laws which include jurisdiction, duties and responsibilities of officers, standards, procedures, and charges among others. It will be empowered to manage all public parking facilities within the city. It will also be able to take decisions regarding all aspects of parking with the approval of the municipal commissioner. BOXES MAILED: Managing off-street parking Off-street public parking includes public parking plots and multilevel parking structures. These must be strategically located near public transit stations to incentivise commuters to park their vehicles and use public transit. Off-street private parking includes parking provided on individually owned plots with commercial and residential uses. The policy aims to introduce an incentive scheme to encourage owners of vacant plots to lease their plots to the local body for off-street parking for a mutually agreed period. The scheme will have exit clauses that facilitate an owner of the plot to opt out of such arrangements as and when he requires the land for construction. BOX II Pay and park * Base parking rate will depend on the type of vehicle * Parking charge will vary in different zones * Charges will be directly proportional to parking demand * Short-term parking will be encouraged in order to encourage high turnover * Charges will vary on peak hours and off-peak hours, on weekdays and weekends * Night parking charges will be kept at discounted rates * On-street parking will attract higher charges than off-street parking BOX III Park and Ride scheme Park and Ride — a system in which drivers leave their cars in car parks on the outskirts of a city and travel to the city centre on public transport — has proved very popular as a means of tackling traffic congestion. The idea behind P&R is that they seek to divert traffic which is bound for the city centre off radial routes and into parking spot where designated public transport is available to complete the journey. * It is a frequent, reliable and fast service * Access to P&R site will be relatively easy * The cost, as perceived by vehicle drivers, has to be lower than the cost of fuel and parking in the city centre * Real-time parking information and use of CCTVs * Valet parking facility shall be provided at large parking spaces and multilevel parking complexes * Shuttle services may be provided at parking lots far away from markets * Cycling is healthy and sustainable mode to travel for short to moderate distances * AMC shall facilitate transit users especially around the congested core walled city areas and near BRTS and MRTS stations by fulfilling their first- and last-mile connectivity via public e-bike and bicycle share system. BOX IV: Freight traffic management Comprehensive Freight Movement Plan for city has to be prepared to avoid conflict between local and regional freight. This plan shall be prepared by the city traffic police. It may include specific routes and timings to allow freight traffic in the city. It will also identify regulations for freight parking. The policy also mentions listing trades that need to be located within the walled city and to incentivise relocation by providing additional FSI in the current location for development of alternate facilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amc-proposes-local-area-parking-plan-for-city/articleshow/82586845.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Rush at vaccination centres may turn them into hotspots of Covid-19, fear health-watchers||Rudrapur/Nainital/Dehradun: Vaccination centres in various parts of the state are witnessing a heavy rush for the past three days after the government announced vaccine jabs for people over 18 years of age. This is only making the task of doctors and observers at government and private vaccination centres more difficult as social distancing is going for a toss at the centres, making health-watchers apprehensive that these places may also emerge as hotspots for the transmission of the infection. On Wednesday, several people were spotted at the vaccination centre in the Rudrapur Medical College (RMC). Consequently, the mandatory rule of staying at the centre for 30 minutes after vaccination could not be followed as too many people had gathered. After the administration of vaccination doses, the individuals were told to leave the premises as the large crowd led to a space crunch at the medical facility. “We are helpless, we have limited staff and there were too many people. They need not wait in the observation room as almost nobody reports any immediate side effects. We tell patients to take paracetamol in case they have any side effects,” said Dr Rajesh Sinha, the nodal officer for Covid-19 at the RMC. In Nainital, too, the social distancing norm was violated at the DSA Ground vaccination centre. As soon as the officials started distributing tokens for vaccination, locals started pushing and shoving to be among the first recipients. “The chief minister himself had inaugurated the vaccination programme for the youth in Nainital on Tuesday. A day after, tents were put up where dozens of people had gathered. However, people threw caution to the wind as soon as the nurse started distributing tokens. When some people pointed this out, the process was stopped,” said a local. The official in-charge has now asked people to come according to their time slots so that social distancing norms are followed. “We have made all the arrangements to ensure social distancing and are urging people to come and visit the hospital according to the slots allotted,” said Sanjeev Kharkwal, the doctor in-charge of Covid vaccination in Nainital. “It is good to see awareness among the public to get vaccinated but they should follow social distancing and wear masks as it is not possible for the government to discipline them. Nurses and other staff have been warning them to follow the queue but no one is taking the instructions seriously,” said Sushil Gava, a local who had come to the medical college to get his first Covid-19 vaccine jab. In state capital Dehradun, the vaccination drive went smoothly for people above 18 years of age but the officials said they suspected some malfunctioning with the website being used to register vaccination slots. “We have found that all the slots for Covaxin got filled within three seconds. We have changed the password for the interface and have initiated a probe into this,” said Dr RK Dixit, district surveillance officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/rush-at-vaccination-centres-may-turn-them-into-hotspots-of-covid-19-fear-health-watchers/articleshow/82582505.cms||---

---||Dehradun||All vaccinations halted at pvt hospitals in state since May 1 due to lack of clarity in procurement||Dehradun: With the Centre asking asked private hospitals to procure their own vaccines directly from manufacturers post May 1 as they would no longer get stocks from the government, vaccination for all age groups has come to a halt at all non-government healthcare facilities. Further, in the absence of proper guidelines, private hospitals in Uttarakhand are yet to start the vaccine procurement process. “We still don’t know how we will vaccinate people as our names are not there in the list of hospitals where vaccination is happening. We have no clear guidelines from the government as to what prices we can charge per dose, if the state will support us in any way, if we will have to arrange for storage and transportation etc. Without knowing these, we cannot even start the procurement process,” said Dr Atish Sinha, chief medical superintendent (CMS) of Kailash Hospital, one of the biggest private hospitals in Dehradun. Dr Rahul Prashad,CMS, Max hospital said, for the next phase of vaccination, the responsibility of procurement and inoculation by Private hospitals is entirely on them itself. “For Max hospital, we are procuring the vaccination for all Max Hospitals centrally which should be available in this region shortly. Presently Primary challenge of Second wave is being addressed by the Govt and Vaccination is secondary but is being done only at the Govt Hospitals.” A senior health department official told TOI on the condition of anonymity that Uttarakhand had stopped vaccinations in private hospitals on orders of the Centre and that “all the full and final settlements for vaccines has been initiated”. “We were asked by the Centre last week to take back the stock of vaccines given to private healthcare facilities for the inoculation of the 60 plus and the 45 plus age groups. We have already informed them to initiate the process of procurement of vaccines directly from vendors. We will pay them the money they have already paid to the state to procure the vaccines that have been taken back,” added the official. Chief secretary Om Prakash meanwhile said on Wednesday that the state was mulling letting private hospitals directly contact foreign manufacturers for vaccines. Repeated attempts to contact secretary (health) Amit Negi on the issue did not elicit a response. Meanwhile, director of National Health Mission (NHM) Dr Saroj Naithani said that Uttarakhand had received 1 lakh doses of Covishield and 40,000 doses of Covaxin on Wednesday. “The Serum Institute of India has assured to send another 1 lakh doses early next week,” she added.

Speaking to TOI, deputy collector Mormugao Sachin Desai said, “We have received three private vehicles and another 2-3 will join the fleet soon.” Health officials had reported that the 108 ambulances attached to the Chicalim Sub District hospital were overburdened with calls from across Mormugaa taluka. Hence, patients had to wait for hours for the vehicles to arrive. Responding to the request, deputy sarpanch of Chicalim Kamla Prasad Yadav deputed his SUV to the hospital along with the driver. An advanced life support ambulance was sponsored by Sierra Circuits (India) Pvt Ltd following a special request from SMRC hospital’s chief operating officer Sangeeta Jain. “A cabbie, Baba Al-Baksh, approached us saying that he operates a taxi business and is ready to provide 2-3 taxis along with fuel and driver. The vehicles will be dedicated for Covid-19 patients till the end of the pandemic. We have called him to chalk out further details. People are also offering drivers and cost of fuel as charity from their side,” Desai said.

---||Chandigarh||Badnore turns down MC house’s resolution to lower water charges||Chandigarh: In a jolt to the Chandigarh BJP, UT administrator VP Singh Badnore has turned down MC general house’s resolution to lower the water charges. The Chandigarh administration has now categorically asked the general house to reconsider its decision, keeping the revenue loss and related financial aspects in mind.Sources in the Chandigarh administration said after going through the resolution, the administrator had discussed the matter with the senior UT officers, who pointed out the financial aspects. Since municipal commissioner KK Yadav also raised his objection, citing the financial loss of Rs 38 crore, it was decided to ask the MC to reconsider it.Earlier, Yadav had given the option to the members of the house to stop the afternoon supply to reduce the loss, but BJP councillors had set aside the commissioner's suggestion and passed the resolution.This is the second consecutive time when the UT administration has turned down the plea of the BJP-led general house to reduce water charges. The move is not only disappointing for the BJP, but politically damaging too as almost all its top leaders had promised people that they had met the senior UT officers and the administrator and the charges would be reduced. The opposition Congress has been targeting the BJP over the issue for the past many months.The revision of water charges would lead to a financial loss of around Rs 38 crore. The engineering department of the civic body had calculated the gap between the current income from water and sewage charges and the revised one and submitted it to the Chandigarh administration to take the final call.MC said currently it was getting a revenue of around Rs 158 crore from water tariff and sewage cess and after the decision of the general house of the MC, it will be reduced to around Rs 120 crore. As per records, at present the MC is spending around Rs 215 crore annually to generate and supply water to the residents of the city, but gets Rs 158 crore from water tariff.

Lorena’s complaint states that the deaths of Covid-19 patients at GMC due to lack of proper supply of oxygen took place as a result of a criminal conspiracy. “The large number of deaths have occasioned on account of shortage of supply of oxygen which has been solely on account of the act of Rane and officials who knew that there was acute shortage of supply of oxygen to cater to the needs in case of any pandemic like situation, as a result of which large number of deaths occurred,” Lorena said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/plaint-against-rane-by-ccp-corporator/articleshow/82589401.cms||---

The authorities found that some 30 to 40 specimens collected daily did not contain the special code which is mandatory for the RT-PCR test.MB Hospital superintendent Dr R L Suman said, “We had been getting complaints of doubtful samples being found in the IPT collection drop box which collects samples from all wards and the specimens received are registered at the OPD for the RT-PCR tests. Some of the samples did not have the numbers. We also were informed that some technicians are collecting samples from homes. We changed the sample collection team members, too, but the suspicious activities continued. RT-PCR registration requires login on the ICMR site as details of the samples have to be updated and technicians are authorised for it,” Suman said.It is unfortunate that MB hospital, which is the largest in the division, and the team have been working relentlessly to serve the people, but some wrong persons are blemishing the image of the institution, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/mb-hosp-gets-dubious-samples-for-rt-pcr-authorities-file-police-complaint/articleshow/82586905.cms||---

It is sending messages to all taxpayers to contribute to the cause and help others by donating their plasma. It has also shared details related to plasma donation on its official website and is using WhatsApp groups to spread awareness among its staff. An EDMC official said that those who have recovered from coronavirus and aged between 18 and 60 can donate plasma for Covid-19 patients. “Though we have come out with a contact number—011-22581036—to help those who are eligible and willing to donate plasma, there has not been much response and hence, we have started sending bulk messages and promoting the concept through different mediums of communication.” The civic body is also approaching its employees, who have recovered from Covid-19, urging them to voluntarily come forward for plasma donation. Officials, meanwhile, claimed that the demand for plasma was going up. EDMC had recently received a nod from the central government to set up the facility at its blood bank in Swami Dayanand Hospital in Dilshad Garden.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/edmc-sending-bulk-messages-to-draw-donors-for-plasma/articleshow/82586923.cms||Vibha Sharma

People say the police and the hospitals are turning deaf ears to their appeals of distress. The police are penalising people seen on roads after 11am irrespective of genuinity of cases while the hospitals are returning them claiming that they are running at full capacity.One of the commuters who was penalised for movement during the lockdown said that he was going to the hospital to attend a patient but the cops didn’t pay heed to his requests. A factory worker in Sukher said that despite having relaxation under the exempted category, he has to face problems in daily commutation.On Wednesday, a long queue was witnessed outside the Pratapnagar police station where people had been brought for movement during the lockdown. People said police are acting insensitively and not even sparing people going for vaccinations, hospitals or to attend corona patients in hospitals. Police officials said commuters having genuine causes and valid documents for movement are being permitted but, in many cases, people are using hospitals or vaccinations as mere excuses to move around unnecessarily. “During the checking on Wednesday, around 40 vehicles were seized for lack of documents. Vehicles can carry only 50% of their capacity but many cars were found overloaded,” Vivek Singh Rao, SHO Pratap Nagar police station, told TOI.“If a factory worker is commuting, he has to carry a document. Similarly, if someone is going for vaccination, he cannot carry his entire family in the car. If we are stopping people from moving unnecessarily, it is for their own safety and general good, public should cooperate with the police," the police officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/commuters-have-tough-time-moving-amid-lockdown-in-udaipur/articleshow/82586889.cms||---

The administration acted on the basis of a news report, ‘No caregiver for kids of orphaned by virus, activists seek government support’ published by TOI on Wednesday. Considering the condition of children who lost both parents in the pandemic, activists had raised their voices and asked the state government to provide aid to such children. Kushal Singh Rawat, district coordinator of Child Line, said visit by their teams to two families to check their financial condition found that they were living with their relatives. While one case was in Rajiyawas village of Beawar where two children were orphaned, the other was in Dholabhata where the child’s father died last year and mother died recently. “We found that they do not need groceries from government and they are well with their relatives. The team completed the documentation on the spot so that these children will get financial aid under Palanhar Yogna of state government,” said Kushal Singh. Child Line appealed that people should come forward and call 1098 Child Helpline if they found any such cases or any instances of child abuse. Former Congress corporator Lalit Verma said society should come forward to identify such children so that the state government could help them. Meanwhile, several organisations and NGOs also came up to help such children and offered their aid to officials of the district administration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ajmer/palanhar-yojana-aid-reaches-kids-orphaned-by-virus/articleshow/82586882.cms||---

Police had announced a cash reward of Rs 50,000 for information leading to four accused—Arvind Singla, Saurabh Gupta, Gurmeet Singh and Khalendra Singh Kadian. So far, the SIT has not received any leads.Cops said the last cellphone location of Gurmeet Singh of Mohali was Amravati. Police teams were sent there, but he remained elusive.Posing as property owner Rahul Mehta, Gurmeet allegedly had executed the sale deed of the 14-marla house in the office of sub-registrar at Estate Office in 2019.The last cellphone location of Khalendra Kadiyan was Bareilly, but he too was not found there.The third police raid too came to a naught when they went to Bathinda in search of Saurabh Gupta.“Arvind Singla’s mobile number was found active in Elante Mall in March, but since then, it is switched off,” a cop said.Police have already arrested four accused: former scribe Sanjeev Mahajan, ex-SHO Rajdeep Singh, Satpal Dagar, who is brother of DSP Ramgopal, and property dealer Manish Gupta.The FIR alleged the accused had confined Mehta in a room for a few days and “tortured” him. “The accused took his signatures on blank cheques and papers. A general power of attorney was executed in favour of Arvind Singla and Khalendra Singh,” the FIR added.In July 2017, Surjit Singh allegedly took Mehta to his friend Abdul Karim in Bhuj, Gujarat.

However, chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy is yet to take a call on this. Sources in the chief minister office (CMO) said that consultations were held among the cabinet ministers and the senior officials on holding the 2021-22 budget session. The session was initially scheduled to be held in the last week of February. However, it was deferred due to the local body elections. The government planned the budget session in the first week of April, after the local body elections, but could not hold it due to the spike in the Covid-19 positive cases in the state. Subsequently, the government imposed day curfew and is busy with the Covid-19 operations. The Governor had issued an Ordinance giving three-month budget for the state, which is scheduled to expire in June. The state government wants to have a full budget giving relief to the finance ministry to release budgets to various departments. Keeping the emergency in view, the state government is planning to hold the one-day session on May 20 and get the budget approved by both the Houses. Consultations were also held with Assembly speaker Thammineni Sitharam, Council chairman M A Shariff and Assembly secretary P Balakrishnamacharyulu on the possibilities of holding the session and completing the finance business on a single day. The CMO also enquired about the health condition of Assembly speaker Sitharam, who was discharged from a private hospital in Srikakulam after recovering from Covid-19. The CMO enquired whether the Speaker would be able to attend the session on May 20, in case the House is to be convened for the budget. The speaker is said to have given his nod for the session. A decision is likely to be taken in a day or two, sources in the CMO said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/day-long-budget-session-on-may-20/articleshow/82584374.cms||Gopi Dara
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Muslims to observe quiet Eid at home, extend help to those in need||KOLKATA: Eid this year will not only be a quiet affair at home with a private namaz and a prayer to Allah for mercy, but it will be devoid of the celebratory mood that brings on the festivities after a month long fasting. From saying prayers on one’s terrace to just cooking biriyani at home for the immediate family and saying no to new clothes, this time Eid will be a call for better times to come. It will also be a rush of memories of past celebrations with family and friends who have lost their lives to Covid. In some households even children are pledging to give up Eidee or the money that they get from elders as blessings, to buy ration for the poor. “My children are 12 and seven but looking at the misery all they have asked me not to give them the money but to buy rice and dal for the people on the streets,” said Sara Chishty, celebrity chef who will not be cooking an elaborate lunch this time. “We will just spend the day without any decorations or celebrations, in prayer. The situation has taught us to return to the basics,” said Ghazala Quasimuddin, media educator at Aliah University. People will see a repeat of last year this time too. Many will sit at home, design e-greetings and send them out asking friends and the extended family to give as much as they can because this Eid, is about giving and standing by those who don’t have enough. “So many are in shrouds, how can I wear new clothes? I will be offering my Eid Salah on the terrace and stay close to the family,” said social philanthropist, Imran Zaki. Many will spend the day packing dry ration for the poor and sending them out. Some said that they are even scared of asking their parents to come home. “Perhaps the virtual calls are our only lifeline now, but somehow all of us are getting fatigued,” said Shabana Ahmed a UK trained image consultant. Rehan Waris an event manager, will stay at home and pray but he is sad that he will miss the fervour of the congregational prayers. “But we are adjusting to this new normal. Humans have always adjusted through catastrophes,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-muslims-to-observe-quiet-eid-at-home-extend-help-to-those-in-need/articleshow/82586928.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

The police have claimed that a few of these SIM cards — procured in bulk ever since the lockdown last year — are now being used (since the end of last month) to trap innocent kin of Covid patients and force them to pay up with the hope that they would be provided with oxygen, Remdesivir or hospital beds. The accused have been identified as Sourav Saha and Pintu Pal and they have been taken to Delhi on a three day transit remand granted by a local court. The cops allege that the two dealers of SIM cards had sold out bulk cards to cyber gangs based in Jharkhand and Rajasthan over the last one year. “Recently these gangs have been penetrating the social media, posing as self help groups and are using Whatsapp to cheat people by offering Covid medicines, oxygen, and hospital beds. In Kolkata alone, bed offers were made for Rs 1.5 lakh. It finally boiled down to Rs 10,000 for an oxygen cylinder and Rs 40,000 for a bed,” said an officer.

Often, these mistakes resulted in the pleas getting rejected, despite the applicant genuinely having an emergency or essential purpose. Failure to attach IDs of other travelers in a vehicle, not attaching Covid RT-PCR negative test or medical fitness certificate, not attaching supporting documents such as death certificates or medical certificates, not attaching flight tickets, providing incomplete reason for travel and not attaching documents with the plea in a PDF format were the most common mistakes, the police said. The Pune city police issues e-passes to people, who want to travel in and out of the city to places within Maharashtra and outside the state for various emergency situations such as death in the family, medical reasons, to catch a flight, wedding ceremony, among others. However, a study conducted by the crime branch officials revealed that many people did not get passes, despite their reasons being genuine because they made errors while applying for the e-pass. Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta ordered the crime branch officials to conduct the study after listening to some of citizens’ pleas. The Pune city police started issuing travel e-passes to citizens on April 23. Since then, the police have received 1.11 lakh applications for e-passes and issued e-passes to 28,698 of them. “It was found that many times the requests were rejected by the police officers, despite the citizens having a genuine reason to travel during an emergency situaton,” an officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/of-more-than-1-lakh-e-pass-requests-pune-police-approve-only-28698/articleshow/82587066.cms||---

Natasha Asani runs Doggypur on Dhanori-Lohegaon Road and said people have reached out to her when they needed help taking care of their pets. “I call a trusted pet taxi owner who picks up the dog. He wears a PPE, sanitizes the vehicle and drops the canine at the facility. I have taken in 13 dogs whose owners are either home quarantined or hospitalised.” Animal welfare worker Vandana Patwardhan runs a homestay for pets called Crazy Paws in Bavdhan. She has been taking them in from Covid-infected households since last year. She said such requests have drastically increased in the second wave. “We cannot take in pets who have temperamental issues as they have to live with other dogs in the facility, and all their vaccinations have to be up-to-date, including one for kennel cough. As soon as we pick up the pet from their home, we bathe and dry them before releasing them with the other pets. Currently, we have 12 dogs from Covid-infected homes,” she said. Many people who volunteer for fostering have also offered their help to Covid positive pet parents. “When I saw posts on social media of people seeking help for their pets, I offered help. We take in two dogs at a time so it is manageable,” Rishi Adhikari from Nigdi said. Rishita Bannerjee from Vimannagar, who lost her dog to old-age last year, provides a temporary home for these pets too. “I have taken in seven dogs, three of them have gone back after their owners recovered,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pet-dogs-find-shelter-in-homestays-as-volunteers-step-up-in-pandemic/articleshow/82587042.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Nurses keep spirit high despite mental & physical exhaustion||Chandigarh: Preetika Katiyar, PGI nursing officer, was posted at the Covid hospital in October last year when she had a month-old baby. She used to breastfeed her with all caution. Now, Preetika is again set to join Covid duty. And this time, the situation is more dreadful with over 400 Covid patients admitted in the institute.Meenakshi Vyas, a nursing officer who had been working both in patient care and in the administration since last year in the Covid hospital, had to move her children to their grandparents’ house as she could not take care of them due to long duty hours. Ajad Khan, another PGI nursing officer, who turned positive during Covid duty, does not hold his newborn as a precaution. Mona Sharma, another nursing officer working long hours in the Covid ward, feels guilty as her 10-year-old son contracted the virus. The common thread that binds them together is their motto: Responsibilities increase abilities. Meenakshi says, “I have been working with a hope that the flu will end soon despite the surge in cases. In my 18 years of experience, I have never faced such mental stress. I have been trained in the PGI, but this Covid experience is beyond all training.”Walking in heavy PPE suits with N95 masks and other protective gears, the nurses have learned how to manage body rashes and nasal sores. But more than the physical discomfort, there is mental exhaustion and anxiety. “I have resuscitated patients along with a team of healthcare workers. There is a sense of satisfaction when such patients survive. However, as we are short of manpower and many of our colleagues have turned positive, we are unable to take care of all the patients who cry for help. It is a terrifying situation,” says Ajad. Despite the crisis, the nurses try to wear a smile. “Staying positive is what makes me going. The patients are alone and away from their families. We have also experienced this virus at home, so we tend to the patients as their kin would,” says Mona.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/nurses-keep-spirit-high-despite-mental-physical-exhaustion/articleshow/82587030.cms||Shimona Kanwar

Meanwhile, the Centre has submitted before the court that the request for 5MT of oxygen quota exclusively for PGI will be processed expeditiously.During the resumed hearing of the case related to Covid management in Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh, amicus curiae Rupinder Khosla submitted that only six ventilators were functional at the moment and the GMH-16 was facing difficulty in view of the large number of patients pouring in.After Khosla’s submission, the high court, in its order, said, “The government of India may examine the possibility of providing more ventilators to GMH-16 as it is centrally located and patients normally approach it in the first instance. As regards the need for supporting staff, the issue may be examined by the secretary, health. If it is found that more staff is required in this emergency situation, he is at liberty to recruit on contract basis, in case a provision exists in the rules.”On UT administration’s demand of providing 5MT exclusive quota of oxygen to PGI, additional solicitor general of India Satya Pal Jain submitted that a sufficient number of PSA oxygen generators have been supplied to various government hospitals in Chandigarh, which were all functional now.“The request of 5MT of oxygen for PGIMER exclusively will also be processed expeditiously,” Jain submitted before the high court.During the hearing, UT standing counsel Pankaj Jain submitted that a common strategy has been drawn up by the UT administration for Chandigarh, Panchkula and Mohali, in which all the three deputy commissioners and directors, health services, will hold meetings twice a week to review the situation and to take measures accordingly.Cooperate to ensure PGI’s smooth functioning: HCAs PGI is facing an oxygen crisis, the high court, in its order, said, “All the states, being aware of the critical care PGIMER is providing keeping in view its advanced medical expertise, may cooperate in every respect in order to ensure that its functioning remains smooth and efficient. All the three states (Chandigarh, Punjab and Haryana) may impress upon the private diagnostic centres to reasonably slash their rates for CT scan for Covid patients”. Earlier, senior advocate Anupam Gupta had highlighted that the PGIMER, being a premier medical institute, was also catering to the needs of nearby states of Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir, so it should be ensured that it does not face any problem.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/try-to-give-more-ventilators-to-gmh-16-hc-tells-centre/articleshow/82587096.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

The matter was examined and it was informed that the present chemist shop at GMH-16 is being run by a private entity and there was no government-controlled or government-run chemist shop in Sector 16.”The affidavit further said, “The control and supply of Remdesivir and Tocilizumab is being looked after by the health department in order to curb hoarding and black-marketing… it was discussed that the present system, where the UT health department distributes these medicines to the government and private hospitals on a cost-to-cost basis should continue.”About the procedure, the DHS said the private hospitals could make an application to director, health and family welfare, through an email and Remdesivir injection would be supplied rationally, based on stock available. The respective hospital would daily send a report of patients to whom Remdesivir injection has been administered. This system would ensure transparency and also check hoarding. Additionally, the hospitals could also email the nodal officer for Remdesivir at nrhmchd@gmail.com, the DHS submitted before the court.Email for supplyUT standing counsel Pankaj Jain submitted that regarding supply of drugs, such as Remdesivir and Tocilizumab, a private hospital can send an application to the director, health and family welfare, on email address: dhsut@yahoo.co.in.

---||Delhi||At Heart Of Covid Fight, Nurses Keep Hope Running In Veins||New Delhi: Nursing attendant Neha’s mother and younger siblings were down with Covid-19, but she continued reporting for duty at Shanti Mukund Hospital in Karkardooma after giving them primary care at home. “My patients at the hospital needed me more because my family is doing fine,” smiled Neha. Like her, other nursing staffers have been managing work and home even as the risk of infection hangs over their heads. “My father and I woke up earlier than usual to look after my Covid-positive mother, sister and brother,” said Neha, 25. “Yes, it did get hectic for me, but the hospital staff was supportive, as was my father.” Neha takes precautions to ensure she doesn't get infected. Her routine in hospital involves her donning a PPE suit, visiting the ICU and keeping any eye on the patients and their medications. Recently, a 31-year old man with two infant daughters was admitted to the ICU. “He was such a jovial person and lightened everyone’s mood with his conversations. Two days before he passed away, he told me he did not want to die,” said Neha softly. “When he died, many of us cried. We became quite emotional when we handed over his body.” On International Nurses' Day, Roshni Dhakal's story also inspires like Neha's does. Dhakal, 40, an infection control nurse at the AIIMS Trauma Centre, which is now a Covid facility, has not hugged her 14-year-old daughter for months now. Dhakal’s husband, Subash Chawan, a baker, has been taking care of the house. “I stay in a separate room, my husband takes care of the house and our daughter,” said the nurse. “My daughter often stands near the door and sings. I also join in, but can’t hold her.” Dhakal can be seen in the video made by AIIMS about how to wear and remove a PPE suit. “I feel the government should take care of the families of nurses who lost their lives due to Covid,” she said. In a profession where women are dominant, Shone K Thomas is a male nurse at Indian Spinal Injuries Centre. He contracted Covid but soon returned to work. Then his wife, a nurse at Holy Family Hospital, also tested positive for Covid. The couple had judiciously left their children, aged 6 and 4 years, at their parents’ house in Kerala when the pandemic began. “Both of us work with Covid patients and felt the safest option was to leave the kids at their grandparents house,” said Thomas. Recalling a recent incident, Thomas said, “A couple from north-east India was undergoing treatment at the hospital. The wife succumbed to Covid and her husband couldn't even go for her funeral. Such patients need emotional and psychological support, and we try to give them the best care possible.” Shinu Varghese, 46, chief of nursing services at Batra Hospital, strongly believes that the nurses in India should get the respect and monetary benefits their counterparts do abroad. “India is losing nurses to the West because of this. We love our job, but more respect and better salaries will help us,” said Varghese. She oversees the duties of the nurses and also takes care of those who get infected. Her husband, Santhosh, ferries her to and from work every day. “We can’t use public transport and expose ourselves to the coronavirus. So my husband transports me. My 21-year-old daughter is in college,” she added. Shiby Raju, 39, OT nurse at AIIMS Trauma Centre has balanced home and work efficiently. “My kids, one in Class XII, the the other in Class V, have been managing on their own, which is a relief. Since my parents and husband are also at home, I have to take precautions,” said Raju. “I take a bath twice, once at hospital and then after reaching home. I immediately wash my clothes too.” As for how patients need nurses, Raju said, “They have several queries and want to have conversations too. We speak to them and often calm them down, at times even listen to them to confiding their personal problems. We also help them use the arrangements in the hospital that allow them to make video calls to family and relatives.” Smiling, she revealed, “Our names are written on our PPE suits, so they know who they are talking to.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/at-heart-of-covid-fight-nurses-keep-hope-running-in-veins/articleshow/82587087.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Polls to six MLC seats in Telangana to be delayed||HYDERABAD: Elections to fill up six member of legislative council (MLC) seats in Telangana are unlikely to be held due to the prevailing pandemic and lockdown. The Election Commission of India (ECI) should have issued a notification by now as the term of six TRS MLCs, including five seats to be filled under the MLA quota and one under the governor’s quota, will come to an end on June 3. “We have not received any communication from the ECI either on election schedule or deferment of polls till now,” Shashank Goel, chief electoral officer, told TOI on Wednesday. Government sources said if the ECI has to conduct the election, a minimum of 23 days is required for issuing the notification, accepting nominations, withdrawal and conducting the polls.  The ECI had postponed the MLC election for Nizamabad local authority constituency last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The MLCs whose term will end on June 3 include legislative council chairman Gutha Sukender Reddy, deputy chairperson Neti Vidyasagar, former deputy CM Kadiyam Srihari, chief whip Bodukuti Venkateshwarlu, Fareeduddn and Akula Lalitha. Officials recall that the ECI had postponed byelections to fill three Lok Sabha seats and eight assembly seats in various states after issuing a notification. If the ECI wants it can go ahead with the polls as only 120 MLAs are voters in the polls under the MLAs quota, whereas for elections from the graduates’ constituency and local authorities, the voters are huge in numbers. Sources in the TRS said the state government is also not in a hurry as it has to pick up candidates while replacing the existing members. Apart from six MLCs, another MLC’s M Srinivas Reddy, who was elected under the governor quota, term ends on June 17. But, it does not require any election as members under the governor quota are generally nominated on the recommendation of the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/polls-to-six-mlc-seats-in-telangana-to-be-delayed/articleshow/82587133.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Delhi||Delhi govt planning to cap O2 cylinder prices, up storage capacity||NEW DELHI: Delhi government is considering capping prices of oxygen cylinders in the city and a draft plan is being prepared. The capital, which doesn’t have oxygen plants of its own and has been facing an acute shortage of medical oxygen, will see the storage capacity for reserve or buffer stock going up soon. Principal secretary transport and OSD health Ashish Kundra on Wednesday said that under chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi government is working 24x7 to curb all the obstacles in the oxygen chain management. Kundra said that price capping is under active consideration, but it is not necessary that every patient in home isolation needs to keep oxygen cylinders at home. He said that medical oxygen prices are regulated by the central government, but there are additional costs like transportation, profit of dealers etc. “Views are being taken and a draft will be put before the government,” he said. He said that a common pool of 1,245 oxygen cylinders has been created apart from strengthening the private network of dealers. Patients in home isolation can get locations for oxygen cylinders based on doctor’s prescription at www.oxygen.jantasamvad.org. “Delhi doesn’t have oxygen production and no storage capacity at a large scale. We have now seen enhancement in allocation and have posted officers in facilities,” he said. “District magistrates have been made directly responsible so that there is no mismanagement in distribution and the oxygen reaches its destination,” he said. Kundra said the health department is drafting a complete plan to create and increase storage capacity of oxygen within Delhi, apart from tapping possibilities for private storage outside the city. “Indraprastha Gas Limited has committed to add storage in Delhi under their CSR. Argon and nitrogen storages are also roped in the city,” he said. He said that Delhi is getting 579.2 MT oxygen on average daily and with 42% of supply coming through railways, reliability has increased and the situation has improved. “Compared with 49 SOS calls for oxygen on May 4, only 3 SOS calls were received on May 11,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-planning-to-cap-o2-cylinder-prices-up-storage-capacity/articleshow/82587122.cms||Sidharatha Roy

In a letter, Yashpal Garg, nodal officer of oxygen supplies in Chandigarh, informed the UT SSP about the four incidents that were reported on May 6, 9, 10 and 11. Garg said on May 11 night, some persons tried to force the workers of M/s Super Agencies to refill their cylinders. “There was a scuffle with the workers and at that time no police personnel were present there. Immediately, the local police were called and those persons did not succeed in getting their cylinders refilled. The workers deployed at the plant seem quite frightened and any possible resentment may prove disastrous. Considering that any shortage of oxygen to hospitals in Chandigarh may lead to serious crisis and loss of human lives, it is requested to take strict action against those involved in the incident.” Garg said the reason for the absence of police personnel at the time should be looked into and arrangements made for round-the-clock security at the oxygen generation plant. On the request of the UT health department, the Chandigarh director general of police (DGP) has already provided police escort facility to tankers carrying liquid medical oxygen from Inox, Barotiwala, (Baddi) plant to Chandigarh. Besides, UT administration has deployed its officials at the Baddi plant and on the premises of the oxygen generation plant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/4-attacks-on-oxygen-plant-in-a-week-ut-again-writes-to-ssp/articleshow/82587108.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: NCP min blames CS for irrigation projects’ ‘delay’||Mumbai: Water resources minister from NCP Jayant Patil on Wednesday targeted chief secretary Sitaram Kunte over the ‘prolonged’ delay in issuing government resolutions for irrigation projects approved by the state cabinet. Patil did not respond to TOI’s message, but a senior cabinet member said the NCP minister has told the cabinet, presided over by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, that revised administrative approvals for 70 projects are long-pending and government resoulations (GR) for three projects approved on March 24 have not yet been issued. Patil’s contention was that he was facing such a situation despite him being a cabinet member for more than 15 years. On March 23, the water resources department forwarded the proposal for Katepurna, Pandhari and Garga irrigation projects, but found massive cost escalations. The next day, the cabinet approved all three projects, but said it seek the opinion of the finance and planning department on the costs. As several flaws and cost overruns were detected in the three projects, the GRs were not issued. Patil blamed Kunte for the delay and said that he can’t forward cabinet decisions to the finance and planning department. The cabinet member, however, disagreed. “It is Patil’s responsibility to ensure the cabinet’s approval and that of the department secretary to ensure the GR is issued. The chief secretary can’t follow it up as his top priority is to tackle the pandemic situation,” the member said. Patil has been under fire ever since he appointed retired bureaucrat Vijay Kumar Gautam as officer on special duty in the irrigation department a week after an inquiry was proposed against him for alleged irregularities in awarding of contracts for the Commonwealth Games in Delhi in 2010. The Centre’s department of personnel and training has initiated a probe against Gautam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ncp-min-blames-cs-for-irrigation-projects-delay/articleshow/82589674.cms||---
---||Delhi||‘Can’t turn a blind eye to overcharging by hospitals’||New Delhi: Exorbitant charges by city nursing homes and hospitals came under scanner of the Delhi high court on Wednesday. The court said it cannot “turn a blind eye” to overcharging of Covid-19 patients and asked the AAP government’s health secretary to meet the association of hospital and nursing home owners and administrators in the city, and discuss a way out so that a rational capping of price can be done. “We want this on top priority. If hospitals are having a Covid package then why charge separately for BiPap or under different heads when they must form part of the package itself. They can’t be so exorbitant,” a bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli observed, after advocate Abhay Gupta alleged certain hospitals are fleecing patients, but there are no complaints because patients are scared. “Merely because there were no complaints, the situation on the ground cannot be ignored. We have asked you to again speak to all stakeholders. That exercise should have been done. You could have seen the condition on the ground, spoken to all the stakeholders and then arrived at a reasonable figure so that people are not fleeced,” the bench said. The bench said based on what transpires in the meeting, Delhi government will issue an order capping the amounts to be charged by private healthcare institutions for treatment of Covid-19 patients. “But then you should come up with a realistic figure,” the bench said, saying it does not want to pass an order saying that all private hospitals and nursing homes have to adhere to the rates fixed by Delhi government last year (Rs 18,000) as then they would be “up in arms” and may not provide services. The court referred to a hospital bill placed by Gupta in which the ICU package price was Rs 30,000, but the charges for Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP) machine, oxygen, monitors, etc were additional and to the tune of thousands of rupees per day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cant-turn-a-blind-eye-to-overcharging-by-hospitals/articleshow/82587141.cms||Abhinav Garg

In case of residential buildings on such land, developers are expected to hand over 5% of the flats to the government which it would then disburse through the discretionary quota. After a PIL in the Bombay high court, the government had stayed all such disbursements. It has now decided to transfer these flats to Mhada.

The ward is to come up at civil hospital in Phase VI, Mohali, which was recently declared a Covid special facility. For it, the OPD has been shifted to ESI Hospital, Industrial Area, Phase VII, Mohali.Mohali civil surgeon Dr Adarshpal Kaur said, “We are waiting for the inspection. Also, we are yet to arrange additional staff to operate the ward. We have sent the demand to the state.” The Army is setting up the ward on the third floor of civil hospital and will first make 50 beds operational. As Covid cases surge in Mohali, the recovery rate has fallen to the lowest of the year at 76.42% With this, Mohali is struggling to keep beds empty.DC Girish Dayalan said, “All Covid beds in private hospitals are occupied. We are waiting for Army’s 100-bed facility at government hospital to become operational. We already have 200 beds at Chandigarh University, which can be upgraded to 1,000 as per the requirement. So, we have ample of facilities to cater to the increasing cases. There are sufficient number of doctors, healthcare workers and paramedics. We hope the state will provide us with extra staff to set up new wards.

---||Delhi||On the credit side: Group of CAs provides free O2, meds||NEW DELHI: Leaving balance sheets and tax audits behind, over 200 chartered accountants from across Delhi-NCR, calling themselves the CA Parivaar, are providing free services, including ambulances, oxygen cylinders, plasma and medicines such as Remdesivir. The cost for these is borne by the members, with donations also being collected. In addition, the group provides food to Covid-affected families too. CA Parivaar, which started as an informal group in 2018, is now a registered NGO and was founded by Sanjeev Singhal, central council member at the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. Singhal says pre-Covid, the group largely considered professional problems, but expanded their ambit when the pandemic hit the country. “Last year, during the first lockdown, we gathered funds and mobilised members to distribute PPE kits, food packets and reusable masks to municipal corporation workers. We also distributed hand sanitisers and dry rations. The current needs are completely different,” says Singhal, "requiring a shift in our focus to the oxygen scarcity, the problem of ambulances overcharging people and the shortage of medicine." Singhal explained that the first step was taken when a CA had problems getting an ambulance. The lawyers thought they would buy ambulances but discovered the paperwork would be time-consuming. "We, therefore, decided on a tie-up with a company that can provide us up to five ambulances at any time in any part of NCR,” said Singhal. “We take a security deposit when oxygen concentrators and cylinders are given to make sure people return these after use. Otherwise, everything else is free,” Singhal said. CA Parivaar has also tied up with a medicine manufacturer and guide people on how to procure drugs like Remdesivir. “Once people have a prescription, we ask them to go to the manufacturer, who provides the drugs to them at the market rate, sometimes at a discount,” said Singhal. The group also provides free yoga sessions, with six online instructors providing advice via video calls or phone calls, they say. Anil Kumar Gupta, member of CA Parivaar, said all coordination takes place through WhatsApp. Each request from a patient is verified before assistance is provided. The group can be contacted through WhatsApp on 9811565606 and 9810120222. “There is a core group and then sub-groups on plasma, food, oxygen and ambulances. Volunteers man the helplines relating to food, blood plasma and oxygen cylinder refills. We ask requesters to fill a form to ensure there is no misuse of our free services,” added Gupta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/on-the-credit-side-group-of-cas-provides-free-o2-meds/articleshow/82587153.cms||---

Suman Verma (name changed) fell ill just a day after her wedding to Rohit Katiyar (name changed). She was admitted to a local hospital and died while being treated there. Her husband who was looking after her also developed Covid-like symptoms and is now admitted in the same hospital and is critical. After her wedding, Suman came to her husband’s house in Isanagar area on May 1, but developed fever and body ache. Around 50 guests had attended the wedding ceremony, and she may have contracted the infection when she had to remove her mask during the rituals. The family initially assumed that she's tired after the marriage ceremony and gave her medicines prescribed by a quack in their village. But her condition started to deteriorate. She was taken to a private hospital from where she was referred to a Covid facility. After doing an antigen test, she was admitted in the non-Covid ward on oxygen support while the result of RTPCR test was awaited. She was immediately put on Covid treatment. Her husband stood by her and looked after her throughout her stay in the hospital. After her RTPCR report confirmed that she had contracted Covid, she was shifted to the Covid ward on May 7 where she died during treatment on May 11. In the meanwhile, her husband also developed Covid-like complications and was admitted at the same hospital. His Covid test report is awaited. Rohit’s elder brother said, “We all are very shocked and my brother, in particular, is very upset. I am constantly in touch with him over the phone and giving him courage. Suman must have contracted the virus sometime during the marriage in her village. She was quite happy when she came to our house. God has been very cruel to her as she had just started a new life.” He further added: “We would have postponed the marriage if we knew that Covid can be fatal. In our village, four people have died in the past few days after panchayat elections. People were fearlessly walking in the village but now most of them are scared and wearing masks.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/woman-falls-ill-with-covid-a-day-after-her-wedding-dies-she-was-made-to-take-off-her-mask-during-rituals/articleshow/82579979.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Delhi||Delhi: These lawyer friends join hands in a different court||NEW DELHI: When a group of lawyers lost some friends and relatives to Covid-19, they realised the acute need for medical support for infected individuals. The group is now on track to open a 50-bed Covid care centre in a school in southeast Delhi’s Jamia Nagar. Likely to become operational by the weekend, it will have oxygen cylinders, oxygen concentrators and other medical equipment. One of the lawyers in the group, Karan Chandhiok, had to search for 16 hours to find an ICU bed for a member of his family. Yet, when a bed was finally located, it was a case of too little, too late. It was this and similar shared experiences with other lawyers that motivated them to launch this initiative. When the coronavirus raised its head for the second time this year, Chandhiok began by verifying leads for hospital beds, oxygen cylinders and medicines. “But only a few days into the surge, we realised that there was no medical infrastructure in place. Foremost, people needed oxygen, but supply was severely limited. We then decided to pool funds to augment oxygen supply and import oxygen concentrators,” said Chandhiok. Very soon, it was clear that there was a dearth of medical facilities for the Covid-positive patients. “Many people can employ social media to get assistance or to help others. But what about the daily labourers who could not afford home care or who could not get leads on Twitter?” asked the lawyers. The lawyers — Chandhiok, Vaibhav Kakkar, Pooja Mahajan and Akshay Jain, all from different law firms — started their project in collaboration with Aster DM Healthcare, which runs Alshifa Hospital in Okhla and other hospitals and medical centres in India and West Asia. Said Chandhiok: “Aster suggested that we start a field hospital on the lines of a similar project it was running in Kozhikode, Kerala. Aster has an MoU with Alshifa Hospital, which gave it access to The Scholar School that it also runs.” Through the combined efforts, orders have been placed for oxygen cylinders, oxygen concentrators, BiPAP ventilator machines, high-flow oxygen therapy units and ECG machines. The field hospital will be managed by Alshifa, which will provide the medical and nursing staff. The plan is to make the field hospital functional over three months. Funds are being collected through crowd-funding on Milaap online platform. Chandhiok added, “Once the medical equipment is delivered, we will approach Delhi government’s health department and initiate the setup with 25 beds and eventually increase the capacity to 50.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/these-lawyer-friends-join-hands-in-a-different-court/articleshow/82587206.cms||Mohammad Ibrar

It hit the 7,000-kg peak on February 28, April 28 and 30 this year,” an official from the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) said. But the official added that waste generation has fallen since May 1. On May 11, it fell to 6,400kg. Last year, peak Covid waste generation in PMC limits was 5,000-6,000kg. This figure excluded patients’ food waste, which is longer considered bio waste. Sunil Dandawate, a director at Passco Environmental Solutions, which is treating biomedical waste from Pune’s hospitals, said, “Volume shot up to 7,000kg per day this year. But over the last few days, it is down by about 800-1,000kg due to a drop in Covid cases,” Dandawate said. He added that last year, Covid waste from the city had at one point hit 10,000kg. “But that was when food waste was being treated as biomedical waste,” he said. The load from Pune is still being sent to the Taloja incinerator in Raigad district. The city’s own incinerator has been unable to handle the load as it cannot process PPE kits, which have a high calorific value. An MPCB official said Pune’s Covid biomedical waste has been adding to the incineration burden as the city’s installed capacity is still inadequate. But Dandawate said the city may soon be able to start treating its own Covid waste as Passco Environmental is working to expand incinerator capacity. “When it’s done, biomedical waste from PMC limits will be treated at this facility instead of being sent to Taloja. We hope to complete the expansion by July-end,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/covid-biomedical-waste-goes-past-last-years-peak/articleshow/82587181.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Delhi||High time Centre fixed MRP of concentrators, says Delhi HC||NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Wednesday said it is “high time” the Centre fixes the MRP of oxygen concentrators and other equipment much in demand for Covid treatment. This will put an immediate end to hoarding and black marketing, it noted, while hearing submissions relating to cases slapped for alleged hoarding and black marketing of medicines and equipment. A bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli passed the direction after it was found that the last meeting on the issue was held by the Centre as early as June last year, but no follow up was done to take a decision. “The concentrators fall within the definition of drugs and apparatus,” the court said. During the hearing, advocate Sanjeev Sagar also informed the court that in the hearings before the trial courts in connection with the cases, public prosecutors as well as the judges appeared to be unaware of the May 2 order of the bench to book those engaged in hoarding and black marketing. The high court in its May 2 order had also said that such individuals, booked for black marketing and hoarding be brought before it for taking contempt of court action against them. Sagar submitted media reports which said that the concerned trial court, while hearing the anticipatory bail filed by businessman Navneet Kalra in connection with the seizure of oxygen concentrators from his upscale restaurants, had said that first a law has to be made to regulate the prices and people cannot be penalised in a hurry. Amicus curiae and senior advocate Rajshekhar Rao said the trial court cannot be blamed as MRP has not yet been fixed for a majority of the imported equipment and the central government has to inform the high court what steps it has taken. Rao said a lot of people will escape prosecution in the long run as no maximum retail price has been fixed for the imported medicines and equipment for Covid treatment. The lawyer for the central government said the issue was under consideration and sought time to inform the bench as to what decision has been taken. The court also asked Sagar to prepare a note on the issue of price fixation, for informing public prosecutors and judicial officers in the subordinate courts, and said it will be circulated by Delhi government. In other directions to the Centre, the bench asked it to “encourage” domestic manufacturers of key drug Remdesivir to apply for clearances, since there is a ban on exporting abroad. “It is a half-baked exercise to stop exports, when the material can’t be diverted to domestic market,” the bench pointed out, after the Centre said firms need a separate set of clearances for domestic supply than from export. “So far, as consignments already pending for export if this can’t be diverted, then export them so that it can reach targeted countries and it goes to those who need it,” the bench added, asking the Centre to take a decision swiftly. Additional solicitor general Chetan Sharma informed the court that production of Remdesivir has gone up from 38lacs to 1 crore vials now and seven more manufacturers have been cleared to produce it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/high-time-centre-fixed-mrp-of-concentrators-says-hc/articleshow/82587189.cms||Abhinav Garg

Currently, The hospital has 200 mucormycosis patients with doctors having to perform around ten surgeries daily. Medical Superintendent of Rajkot Civil Hospital, Dr Radheshyam Trivedi, said that owing to rising case of the disease they are planning to devote more resources to it. “A mucormycosis patient requires 22-25 days of hospitalization. Looking at the current trend we are expecting around 500 more cases in next week. So, we have planned to convert our hospital’s trauma and OPD building into a dedicated mucormycosis wing,” Trivedi told TOI. Struggling with rising Covid-19 cases, mucormycosis has become the new challenge for the already strained medical infrastructure. Recently, the civil hospital procured mucormycosis drugs worth Rs 2.50 crore from the market. Now, Gujarat Medical Services Corporation Limited (GMSCL) is providing the drugs as per the number of patients admitted to the hospital. The hospital currently has three ENT faculty members, including one doctor who has been called from Bhavnagar. Also, there are six senior resident doctors and ten junior residents doctors deputed in the ENT department. The private ENT practitioners of Rajkot have agreed to extend their help and examine patients at the Civil Hospital and also perform surgery if required. “There were very few cases of mucormycosis in the first wave and the requirement of surgery was also rare. In this wave there is a flood of patients suffering from the disease and many of them require surgeries. Also, most of the patients are of the young age.” Dr Trivedi added. The hospital is shifting its stable Covid patients to Samras and Cancer Hospital so as to accommodate mucormycosis patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/mucormycosis-centre-set-up/articleshow/82584769.cms||---

Though the state government is procuring paddy from the farmers and has set a target of purchasing 80 lakh metric tonnes of it through procurement centres, the government has not made any announcement on procuring other crops this season. During the lockdown in 2020, the TRS government had procured paddy, maize, jowar, sun flower among other crops from the farmers. This season maize has been cultivated in 4.66 lakh acres and jowar crop was raised in 1.19 lakh acres. Traders in the open market were not offering more than Rs 1,500 per quintal for maize and Rs 1,600 per quintal for jowar. Farmers have urged the government to start procuring even these two agricultural products keeping in view the present market conditions at Rs 1,850 per quintal maize and Rs 2,620 per quintal jowar. All India Kisan Congress state president Anvesh Reddy said farmers were a worried lot as there was no word from the government on procuring maize and jowar. These two crops were harvested by the farmers a month back. “Last season, the government said it would not purchase maize as it had discouraged farmers not to cultivate it. However, the farmers had cultivated maize in two lakh acres and following agitations by the farmers, the government procured only 50% of the total produce,” Anvesh Reddy added. Officials of the agriculture and marketing department said the state government had clearly told the farmers that none of the crops other than paddy would be procured. The issue would be taken to the notice of the chief minister, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/farmers-worried-over-govts-silence-on-procurement/articleshow/82587170.cms||Roushan Ali

The party high command in Delhi is in no mood to look into this issue and has given directions to all the state units, including the Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee, to focus on helping Covid-19 patients.  Even the  of All India Congress Committee (AICC) president, which was to be held on Junde 23, was put off until the pandemic subsides. Also, there is no urgency for a change of guard in Telangana as there are no scheduled elections or bypolls in near future. Though election activity has taken a back seat, there is only a remote possibility of bypolls being held to Huzurabad and Vemulawada assembly constituencies. This may happen only if former minister and TRS MLA Eatala Rajender resigns as legislator and Vemulawada TRS MLA Chennamaneni Ramesh fails to win the Indian citizenship case in his favour in the high court. AICC incharge of Telangana affairs Manickam Tagore said they are all busy in helping the Covid-19 patients by setting up control rooms in the party’s state and district offices. “I have not taken up the matter of change of guard in TPCC with the high command,” he said. Uttam Kumar Reddy resigned as TPCC president after the party faltered in the GHMC elections in December, 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-cong-rejig-may-be-delayed/articleshow/82587196.cms||---

---||Trichy||Now, docs prescribe plasma therapy too||Trichy: Plasma therapy is not recommended by the government for Covid treatment, but social media and instant messaging platforms are now flooded with requests for plasma donation from those cured of the disease. A section of doctors are still prescribing it as they consider it to be effective in managing the early stage of infection. P Vijayasankar, a resident of Trichy, was one among those who circulated a message on WhatsApp seeking plasma donation from recently cured Covid-19 patients for his 31-year-old friend admitted to a private hospital in the city. He said doctors suggested plasma therapy for him. “It is difficult to get a donor. Some aged cured people are interested but they are afraid of visiting the labs and hospitals fearing infection,” he said. Another request was for a 73-year-old-man undergoing treatment at a private hospital. “After posting the requests, we got responses from three people from known circles. They don’t demand money but we offer to take care of their transportation cost,” said the patient’s attendant. Plasma therapy is aimed at creating antibodies in Covid-19 patients by injecting the plasma separated from the blood of those cured of Covid-19. Doctors prefer to try it on patients in the early stage of infection, but there has been a general hesitancy from those eligible to donate blood. Former state president of Tamil Nadu Medical Council, Dr M S Ashraf, said plasma was harmless but it had its limitations. State president of Indian Medical Association (IMA) Dr P Ramakrishnan said, “IMA is not endorsing plasma therapy because the government also does not recommend it as of now.” Managing director of Uyirthuli blood bank Dr S Prabakaran said if the patient gets treatment within a week, plasma therapy will be very effective. Quoting government of India protocol, he urged those who overcame Covid-19 to donate plasma once in 15 days. The attendants can bring the donors to the blood bank or it can also arrange the plasma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/now-docs-prescribe-plasma-therapy-too/articleshow/82587267.cms||Gokul Rajendran

The post has been remaining vacant ever since the 50th Jeeyar passed away in July 2018. The protest erupted after the notification dated May 6 by the HR & CE joint commissioner and board of trustees was published on the temple website and newspapers. Sthalathargal, who were traditionally entrusted with various duties in the temple by Saint Ramanuja, opposed it saying that HR&CE had infringed on their centuries-old right to choose the pontiff. Badri Bhattar, who spearheads the protest, said the administration can manage the temple’s assets but not religious affairs. “Jeeyar is the person supervising the religious activities of the temple. He is vested with powers to control and monitor religious affairs of the temple,” he said. However, the temple administration cited precedents to justify its decision. It pointed to the appointment of the 50th Srirangam Narayana Jeeyar by the temple executive officer in consultation with the Thakkar, Sthalathar and trustees on December 1, 1989. HR & CE also recalled the removal of the 49th Srirangam Narayana Jeeyar from the post by them citing the shortcomings in his duties in 1986 after which it had appointed the 50th Jeeyar. “The process of choosing the right person to the top religious post in the mutt involves a lot of process. With some issues yet to be solved in the temple, it is getting delayed. Taking the right to appoint a Jeeyar on their hands citing the delay is tantamount to shaking religious freedom. We expect the state government to look into the issue,” said Badri citing Article 26 of the Constitution of India. “The notification has been suspended temporarily. We have been advised to put the process on hold citing the Covid-19 pandemic,” joint commissioner (JC) of the temple S Marimuthu told TOI adding that HR&CE has all rights to call for applications to the post.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/srirangam-temple-suspends-jeeyar-selection/articleshow/82587245.cms||---

Zakat is one of the Five Pillars of Islam, and requires all Muslims to pay 2.5% of their wealth or savings to charity. Hussain, who hails from Sasaram in Bihar, said his family usually gave money to a madrassa. “Because this year, the situation is tougher, my brother and I contributed to multiple foundations working for Covid relief. I don’t consider it obligatory, but as a means to help people in these times of trouble.” Salim Ahmed, a resident of Zakir Nagar, also took the same path. “Many organisations are providing food, rations and medicines for free to those affected by Covid. I wanted to help them out; so, I decided to give my zakat to them.” Several organisations extending help to the Covid-hit have invited zakat. This has prompted many people to step forward and fulfil their religious duties and, at the same time, support a cause. Delhi Youth Welfare Association (DYWA), an old Delhi-based NGO actively distributing ration kit to 100 families in the Walled City, is one such organisation. “We did something similar last year, but we used the zakat money for the education of students from the marginal sections of the society. This year, however, people are under huge stress and it is necessary to ensure that every one is fed,” said Mohammad Naeem, DYWA president. Abu Sufyan, an entrepreneur who started a Covid relief fundraiser two weeks ago, said: “Many people want to help with Covid relief, but they also have to give zakat. Now, they can do both." Jamia Nagar’s Alshifa hospital has also taken zakat money this year for Covid relief. Margoob Zaidi, PRO, said: “Many locals have given zakat. We will use this money for treatment of patients and improving the infrastructure.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/when-religious-duty-and-urge-to-help-come-together/articleshow/82587294.cms||---

Mahatma Gandhi memorial government hospital (MGMGH) attached to KAP Viswanatham government medical college (KAPVGMC) in Trichy had no time to celebrate the day as the nurses along with doctors and other frontline health workers were occupied with handling the surge of Covid-19 patients. “We are in no mood to celebrate the day because every one of us is focussed only on the treatment to the Covid-19 patients,” said state secretary of Tamil Nadu government nurses association S N Jayabarathi attached to MGMGH. Some nurses also decided not to celebrate as a precautionary measure. “Celebration means getting together. If some of us are infected due to the event, we will be occupying the beds which are supposed to be given to patients,” said Jayabarathi. While appreciating the Tamil Nadu government for providing the nurses in the government hospitals the necessary facilities to safeguard them, the nurses’ association president put forth a demand to the newly elected government to create the new posts for nurses in the old medical college hospitals. “MGMGH requires more than 1000 nurses but we manage with 200 plus nurses. Our association appeals to the government to act on our demand,” she said adding that 15 of their nurses were already infected. Nurses on duty for seven day in a row have been given hotel quarantine facility in Trichy like the last season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/nursing-warriors-have-no-time-to-celebrate-their-day/articleshow/82587273.cms||---
---||India||UP BJP chief: Didn’t anticipate 2nd wave would hit villages||LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh told TOI on Wednesday that BJP had not anticipated the pandemic’s spread to villages in the rural heartland, which were largely untouched by the virus till now. “It’s a hard reality that the virus has crept into rural homes. It is unfortunate and alarming,” he said. Singh said instructions have been issued to grassroots functionaries to coordinate with the state government to provide medical help to villagers. “Be it medicine or arrangement of plasma, BJP will help people in every possible way,” he said. The party has asked its MPs and MLAs to get in touch with villagers in home isolation and ensure they are provided all possible help. Singh’s directive to the party cadre comes even as the ruling party faces mounting criticism over its handling of the Covid crisis, which has claimed more than 14,000 lives in UP. The UP government has ramped up screening and isolation of patients in rural areas to arrest the spread of Covid-19, while also providing them with medical kits. Notably, the state government’s move comes soon after the panchayat elections, which saw BJP facing a tough challenge from Samajwadi Party. A BJP politician admitted party workers have been asked to carry out relief operations without hype. “There could be criticism of the party if relief does not reach beneficiaries,” the politician said, adding that workers were identifying people who would provide help to infected people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/up-bjp-chief-didnt-anticipate-2nd-wave-would-hit-villages/articleshow/82593238.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Cong leaders seek to meet CM over scrapping of promotion quota slots||Mumbai: Senior Congress leaders have sought an appointment with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to discuss their grievance over the MVA government’s decision on Friday to scrap the vacancies set aside to accommodate reservation in promotions. In April 2021, the state government had decided to keep 33% posts vacant so that they can be filled by promotion of candidates from backward classes, subject to the Supreme Court’s final verdict. Though the issue is hanging fire, the general administration department head by Thackeray has ordered that all posts be filled by promoting candidates only on the basis of seniority. Now, minister for energy Nitin Raut and state Congress president Nana Patole have written to Thackeray seeking an appointment. Not only Congress, several other ministers in the cabinet and backward classes leaders are upset with the decision as well, said an official. They feel the step was taken to mollify Marathas after a quota for them was struck down. They are also taking issue that deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, a Maratha, heads the cabinet sub-committee on the issue of reservation in promotions. The Congress leaders are likely to put forward a demand to replace Pawar as the chairperson of the sub-committee. “It would be unfair towards the backward classes as the committee should be headed by a person belonging to one of those who are impacted. So, the demand may arise to replace the chairperson with one from the backward classes,” said a senior official. There are over 30,000 employees in the state whose promotions have been put on hold after Bombay HC struck down the government resolution granting reservation in promotions to the state employees. A 2004 GR provided 33% reservation in promotion for backward classes such as Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Vimukta Jati and Nomadic Tribes (VJTI) and the special backward classes at the under-secretary, deputy secretary and secretary levels in the state establishments and in local bodies too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cong-leaders-seek-to-meet-cm-over-scrapping-of-promotion-quota-slots/articleshow/82589907.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

Four Class XII students are organising a video game-based competition, titled “Game for a Change” , to raise money to support those affected by the pandemic. The first, ongoing tournament — “FIFA 21” — has already collected Rs 36,000 and the amount has been donated to Hemkunt Foundation, an NGO that is providing oxygen support to Covid patients. In this competition, the participants directly transfer Rs 500 (entry fee) to Hemkunt Foundation and get to compete with others online. Hemkunt Foundation recently started an ‘Oxygen Centre’ in Gurgaon with 200 beds. Eighteen-year-old Sabeer Bhullar, along with his three friends Ishan Wahi, Ansh Mehta and Aarush Shah, started the competition with an idea to use the online gaming platform for a specific cause. “For participating in the tournament, a person should have an active playstation. They need to transfer Rs 500 to Hemkunt Foundation’s account and share the screenshot of the same to start playing,” Bhullar told TOI. He added, “Though the entry fee is set at Rs 500, many participants have donated a higher amount. Through the first tournament, which will continue till Saturday, we have raised Rs 36,000. We will organise more such tournaments.” Shah said due to the pandemic, many students had been confined to their houses for nearly a year. “As we cannot go out and meet each other, most of us are feeling bored and spending time playing video games. After the second wave of Covid affected so many people, we decided to use the gaming platform to raise money to help the needy.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/games-youngsters-play-to-save-lives/articleshow/82587370.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

Police arrested Sanjay Paswan, 40, a native of Bihar on Wednesday. According to police, Sangeeta Rathod, 35, a resident of Madhapar near Rajkot, had filed a complaint with the Gandhigram police on Monday after her husband went missing on May 3. The police, who were trying to establish a murder victim’s identity, showed her the dead body which Sangeeta identified as that of her husband’s.The victim was identified as Sagar Rathod, 55, a native of Dhulia in Maharashtra. Rathod’s body was found near IOC depot on Jamnagar Road and postmortem revealed that he was brutally murdered. Sagar was a tailor and was living with his wife and two children — daughter Kavya and son Jay.“When Sangeeta came to the police to lodge the missing complaint of her husband, we suspected her of cooking up a story. Her husband had gone missing on May 3 and she approached the police on May 10, which was unusual. So we grilled Sangeeta and her sister and they spilled the beans. “Sangeeta told police that her husband was murdered by her paramour Sanjay alias Chhotu Paswan. Paswan lives in Madhapar and they were in love and wanted to get married. So, Paswan decided to eliminate her husband,” a police official said on Wednesday.Paswan works as mason in Rajkot. “We are also probing the role, if any, of Sangeeta in this murder case. She told us that she was threatened by Paswan that if she tells anyone about the murder case, he would kill her and her children,” police added.Man kills wife’s paramour in MorbiRajkot: Morbi police on Wednesday arrested Iqbal Makrani, a resident of Rajkot city, in connection with the murder of Vijay Kotak, a resident of Gujarat Housing Board in Morbi town.

---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Heart-lung device saves life of serious Covid patient||LUCKNOW: The use of ECMO (Extra corporeal membrane oxygenators) — an artificial heart-lung machine that provides oxygen rich blood to a patient by bypassing the lungs — helped in saving the life of a 37-yearold Covid-19 patient at a private hospital in the city. Sharing the case here on Wednesday, hospital authorities believed that the option has opened a new management modality of Covid-19 positive patients. “The example makes us believe that use of ECMO can help in checking the progression of the multi-organ dysfunction which is inevitable in the advanced stages of the Covid-19 infection,” explained Dr Farrukh Ansari, medical director, Chandan Hospital which took the lead in the procedure. He added that the procedure was undertaken on a 37-year-old patient who came with the severe breathlessness and was not responding well to the conventional ventilator management. Accordingly, he was put on veno-venous ECMO on the second day of admission. The team, led by head of CTVS Dr Jigar Shah, included senior consultant critical care Dr Amit Tyagi, perfusionist Virendra Yadav along with other support staff. Dr Ansari added that the intervention paid off well as the patient recovered with no end organ damage. “The patient was discharged after 40-day stay in the hospital without any complication,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/heart-lung-device-saves-life-of-serious-covid-patient/articleshow/82589808.cms||---
---||Patna||Pandemic padlocks Bihar’s ‘roti-beti’ relations with Nepal||BETTIAH: Where traffic used to be a crawl, the road to the Nepalese metropolis of Birgunj, past the Indian Customs and Immigration offices at the Raxaul border, now lies deserted. The pandemic has taken away livelihoods. "Hundreds of labourers from villages on our side who worked in factories dotting the Parsa-Bara industrial corridor in Nepal have been rendered jobless by the lockdown on both sides of the border," Mahesh Agarwal, Bihar President of the Seema Jagran Manch told TOI on Wednesday. "Not only the daily wagers who trekked across the border but the other sectors of the economy, too, have been badly hit. Cross-border weddings have been hit, our roti-beti relationship with Nepal has been padlocked," Agarwal, whose grocery outlet on the border has seen an 80% fall in sales with cross-border customers locked out, rued. "People are facing a double threat-- to save their lives from the Coronavirus as well as from dipped or no incomes," he said, adding, that small retailers are the worst hit. "Banks must bail them out,’ he pleaded. Across the border, banking has taken a hit too. "Banks in Lumbini have been closed due to the Covid upsurge, resulting in the breakdown of commercial transactions," Madhav Rajpal, Vice President of the Birgunj Chamber of Commerce and Industry told this reporter over the phone. "The government had not prepared for the second wave. The situation is pitiable," his lament not different from suffering voices on the Indian side. "Industrial units on the Parsa-Bara corridor have switched to producing medical oxygen. The industry has been hit and yet we are producing just about 1,500 cylinders of oxygen," he said, ruing the shortage of empty cylinders across Nepal. "Even the big hospitals are throwing their hands up. But citizens forced to be in home-isolation too need oxygen," he again echoes cross-border woes. "Fortunately, the Integrated Check Post and Dry Port here are open and pre-ordered rakes and container loads of supplies are coming in," he said. "The oxygen shortage is devastating. The system seems to have collapsed," Uttam Agarwal, a hardware merchant in Birgunj, reported in a phone conversation with relatives in Bettiah. "People can source groceries and milk only in the 5 am-9 am relaxation of curfew," Rajpal said, adding, "The construction business is at a standstill, freezing the sale of steel and cement. Though medicine shops are open 24 hours, shortages are being reported." "We had run out of even Paracetamol but now supplies have come. Even supplies of drugs like Remedisivir are now expected from Bangladesh and India," he said. Nepali media, meanwhile, has been reporting black marketing of masks, medicines and oxymeters. Just last week, the Birgunj Police arrested one Ramhari Tiwary for selling oxymeters for 3,500 NR. Its cost, in Nepali rupee, is 1,700. "Hotels are closed. Tourists who drove to Chitwan are not there. Tourism, vital to our economy, has been hit hard," Birgunj chamber of commerce VP Madhav Rajpal bemoaned. However, up in the mountains, Nepal’s expedition industry has had a record year. "We have had over 400 climbers on the Everest. But that’s it. The economy has taken a big, big hit and that is the least of our worries now. Grappling with the pandemic is our only priority at the moment. The coronavirus has scaled even Mount Everest," said Raj Gyawali, convener of Nepal Tourism Think Tank-Into the Future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/pandemic-padlocks-bihars-roti-beti-relations-with-nepal/articleshow/82587354.cms||Abhay Mohan Jha

The fresh SOP includes an extended 2pm-5am curfew and curbs on all public gatherings. “Even if someone slaps a case on the police (later), our personnel will not hesitate to resort to lathicharge against those found violating the SOP. The police have to be strict at this time of crisis and force will be applied on violators,” the DGP said. He urged people to extend help to the government in the fight against the second wave by strictly adhering to the fresh SOP. Mahanta warned people in containment zones not to take the restrictions lightly. “Containment zones are zero-tolerance zones. We have seen a few instances of people from containment zones violating rules. Nothing will be tolerated from now on. Whoever violates the rule will be punished,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/now-attempt-to-murder-for-covid-sop-violation/articleshow/82593239.cms||Mukut Das
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Meat shops shut, patients on protein diet hit||LUCKNOW: People fond of non-vegetarian dishes are having a hard time finding fresh chicken or mutton as most meat shops are closed. According to owners of meat shops, the district administration has not included meat in the list of essential items, therefore, they have not able to sell it ever since the coronavirus curfew was imposed on May 1. Though some small meat shop owners in colonies and suburbs are open while others are selling with half shutter down, they are selling meat at higher prices. This has created problems not only for the nonvegetarian population but also for patients, particularly Covid-19 survivors, who are being advised high protein diet by doctors. The issue may also impact Eid celebrations, which although is known for ‘sewain’, many families including non-Muslims prepare nonveg dishes at home. Secretary of Poultry Farmers Boilers Welfare Association FM Sheikh said the association had written to the administration on May 1 requesting that meat and eggs should be included in the list of essential items. “Collectively, we are also facing loss to the tune of Rs 1 crore daily,” he added. Additional district magistrate (civil supplies) RD Pandey said: “There is no clarity in the notification of essential services issued by the state government on meat/ fish shops.” Dr Shalini Srivastava, a dietician at KGMU, said: “High protein diet is important in Covid-19 as it helps in fighting infection and gives strength post-recovery. To protect the body against muscle loss and to repair the damage to tissues, we recommend 75 gm of protein per day. It also boosts the immune system and provides energy to help patients overcome post-Covid weakness. Protein-rich food includes fish, chicken, meat, pulses, legumes and curd, among others. A normal person needs 50gm protein daily, while Covid patients require 75 gm.” Rajesh Kulpati (45), a Covid-19 survivor, said he found non-vegetarian soup more feasible than having pulses for high-protein requirements, but since it is not available, he opted for a protein supplement. Another Covid survivor, Rajan Sinha (51), said he found an alternative in frozen meat available in some big super markets. “A few aapbased food delivery services are also delivering meat at home but since the demand is too high, they are taking time,” he added. Aarth Kailash of Daliganj said, “Chicken meat provided by super markets is not only costly, but is not fresh as well. It doesn’t taste good either.” The closure is also affecting the livelihood of small shop owners. Mohd Saud, who has a shop in Rakabganj, said: “Local police is not allowing me to run my shop for reasons unknown. With the shop closed, I am finding it difficult to make my both ends meet.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/meat-shops-shut-patients-on-protein-diet-hit/articleshow/82589850.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Hospitals adopt ‘relative management’ strategies to reduce stress among kin||Nagpur: The increasing incidents of violence by kin of Covid patients has prompted hospital managements to take up ‘relative management’ programmes, to ensure free flow of communication and alleviate their stress and fears. In the backdrop of violence targeting doctors and damaging hospital property, systems are being put in place to ensure the relatives are well aware about the clinical status of patients on a regular basis. Communication gaps and miscommunication were found to be the most common causes that triggered violence against the medical fraternity. AIIMS Nagpur has formed a ‘patient relative management committee’, with staffers including doctors and paramedical staffers, to cater to the queries of patients’ relatives. “Different teams have been formed, who are present in two shifts, starting from 8am to 10pm,” said a source. “The patients’ kin have been provided helpline number of the committee, whose function is to gather information, updates and developments of a patients, including oxygen level, Remdesivir doses and possible discharge, and pass them on,” he said adding that such transparency helps gain faith and confidence of the patients. Niranjan Joshi, spokesperson of Alexis Multispecialty hospital, said his institution follows a stringent pattern of information dispensation, as it is a jointly commissioned international accredited hospital. “Every patient is admitted under a primary consultant, who is also the ‘care-giver’. The consultant is solely responsible for relaying health updates of every patient to his kin essentially on a timely basis,” he said. “We also arrange for audio-visual counselling sessions for the patients,” said Joshi. Dr Anup Marar of Orange City Hospital and Research Institute said a dedicated spokesperson has been nominated to relay status updates of a patient to his or her relatives on regular basis. “The spokesperson collects information about a patient from different specialists and relay it to the authorized relative of the patient whose number would be mentioned on the consent form,” he said. Dr Prashant Jagptap of Viveka Hospital said there are three special counselling teams for relaying health updates of a patient to his or her relatives once a day. “Our special counselling team relays information to each relative, and mentions in the record if someone was not contactable,” said Dr Jagtap. “All the information is always cross-checked by the seniormost doctor or intensivist or attending experts. We have also taken relatives of serious patients in PPE kits to meet their relatives,” said Dr Jagtap, adding that even relatives of non-Covid patients are routinely updated about their status.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hospitals-adopt-relative-management-strategies-to-reduce-stress-among-kin/articleshow/82607150.cms||Soumitra Bose

The proposed cost of the project is estimated to be Rs 97.44 crore. The new structure will be 50m high with a three-dimensional view of the runway. The project proposed last year was subsequently approved by the AAI. Officials said that the contractor will have to take care of the repair and maintenance work for seven years after the construction of the tower. The cost of the construction has been worked out as Rs 77.05 crore for construction and Rs 20.39 crore for repair and maintenance. The work will be completed in two years’ time once the construction work begins. Officials added that the new tower will enhance the safety of the airport as the air traffic controllers will have a better view of the runway. It will make it easier for the ATCs to handle more flights in a day. Madurai airport handled more than 25 flights in a day during its prime time. But the number has come down to single digits due to Covid-19 pandemic. The land acquisition work for the runway expansion project is in the final leg, an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/aai-floats-tender-for-atc-tower-in-madurai/articleshow/82587330.cms||---

According to the IMD, the depression is likely to intensify into a cyclone about 100 nautical miles (185 kms) off the northern Kerala coast and move northward till Karachi in Pakistan. “Since it covers the fishing grounds of Tamil Nadu fishermen we are trying to warn them,” he said. Since the annual fishing ban is in effect on the east coast, only vessels from the western coast of Kanyakumari have gone fishing. Fisheries department officials said only 84 boats at sea had gone from Thengapattanam fishing harbour, but another 150 from Kanyakumari had set off from Kerala. The department has started contacting the boats, which move in clusters, through satellite phones provided to them by the government, the coordination centres operated by fishermen in the coastal villages and through local churches. Jayakanthan said they have been advised to reach the nearest shore and various coastal states have been urged to accommodate the fishermen. ICG has been requested to warn the fishermen from their ships.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/cyclone-efforts-on-to-alert-tn-fishermen/articleshow/82587405.cms||M K Ananth

GMCH Dean Dr Kanan Yelikar said the devices have “some parts” missing. “The lot of ventilators received during last year were installed and are working properly. The fresh lot of 150 ventilators came to us around a month ago and it is yet to be installed for want of technical inspection,” she said, adding that 83 ventilators from the second lot were distributed to neighbouring districts and some private hospitals. While a political storm is brewing over the supply of alleged poor quality ventilators through Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations Fund (PM CARES) Fund, Yelikar said the whole issue needs to be looked at right perspective. She added the ventilators were made under ‘Make In India’ campaign and were received when there was dearth of ventilators. City MP Imtiaz Jaleel and BJP Rajya Sabha member Bhagwat Karad have drawn daggers at each other over non-functioning of the ventilators at GMCH. Jaleel said an official inquiry must be set up to check the supply of “bogus ventilators”. “All the ventilators supplied under PM CARES fund are of no use and those who supplied it need to be exposed,” he said. Refuting charges, Karad said the ventilators in question need some setting to be done before installation. “The local health authorities were not able to carry out the setting and therefore I ensured a technical team reaches Aurangabad to do the needful. The ventilators will be functional in next 24 hours to 48 hours,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/ventilators-given-through-pm-cares-not-installed/articleshow/82580603.cms||Prasad Joshi

This is 7.3% of the total cases recorded in the district in the last 14 months. The district was recording less than 300 cases a day till the beginning of the month and it was hovering around 400 to 500 till Sunday and climbed to 710 on Monday before skyrocketing to 995 on Tuesday and 1,076 Covid-19 cases on Wednesday. Health department official attributed it to pendency of samples getting tested due to practical difficulties at the laboratory in the Kanyakumari Medical College Hospital. “The number was so high as the samples collected last week were getting cleared till Wednesday. The number reflected in the bulletin will be high on Thursday and start reducing from Friday as all the pending samples will be cleared,” he said. The official said that the pendency of testing samples began early this month as a couple of technicians tested positive in the government laboratory in the district – that has a capacity to test 3,000 to 3,500 samples a day. Permission was sought from the government to divert 700 samples a day to a private laboratory. “There have been instances of cases increasing when these people keep moving about freely till the results came,” he added. Kanyakumari district administration has also taken efforts to reduce crowding at important markets such as the ones at Nagercoil town and Kaliyakkavilai close to the inter-state border. They have been shifted to the roads. Meanwhile, efforts have also been taken to decentralise sale of fish at the Thengapattanam and Colachel fishing harbours from Thursday by banning auction .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/kanyakumari-adds-2071-cases-in-two-days/articleshow/82587425.cms||---

She has accused him of harassing her while her husband Raushan Charan Das was admitted there for Covid-19 treatment. Her husband died at the hospital on May 8. Das, a software engineer, was settled in Noida, Uttar Pradesh. Bhagalpur SSP Natasha Gudia had formed a three-member probe team, which contacted the victim over the phone in Patna and registered an FIR at Bhagalpur Mahila Thana. The Bhagalpur SSP, when contacted, said Jyoti was sent to jail and further investigation was underway. In the FIR, a copy of which is with TOI, she accused one Akhilesh, who used to be in-charge of the ICU at night, of harassing her in several ways, including making indecent gestures. She also alleged extorting of money by the lower rank staff of the hospital from attendants of the Covid-19 patients, including herself. The woman alleged that she did not react to the harassment of Akhilesh and other issues just because of her husband, who was in a critical condition. Patrakar Nagar police station SHO Manoranjan Bharti said police were investigation into the allegations. “Police are investigating to know if Akhilesh is a doctor or a staff,” he said. Earlier on Tuesday, Bhagalpur police arrested Glocal hospital ward boy Jyoti Kumar for allegedly molesting the woman while her husband was admitted there before being brought to Patna. The Bhagalpur police had also lodged an FIR on the basis of the viral video in which the woman is telling the media about her ordeal from Bhagalpur to Patna. Demanding an in-depth inquiry so that she gets justice, Ruchi said she stands by her statements given to the media.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/harassed-woman-lodges-fir-against-private-hospital-in-patna/articleshow/82587453.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Mumbai||No fee hike this year for MTech aspirants at IITs||Mumbai: MTech aspirants keen on joining some IITs will not have to pay a hiked fee this year. The premier institutes have deferred the hike in MTech fees for the second year in view of the pandemic. A committee set up by the IIT Council to recommend M Tech reforms had proposed a hike in fees to help institutes generate some revenue and to bring in serious candidates. Currently, the tuition fees at most of the older IITs is Rs 5,000 per semester. IIT-Bombay’s Board of Governors had already approved the hike about two years ago. Subhasis Chaudhari, director of the institute, said that the institute had already taken a loan of over Rs 500 crore from Higher Education Funding Agency for several infrastructural projects. “Part of the loan must be repaid every year from the revenue that IIT earns from tuition fees. A modest fee hike was required to pay for this loan. But with the pandemic and the possible economic fallout, the decision has been again deferred. Many families may have lost their livelihood in the pandemic, so we will not be implementing the hike this year,” said Chaudhuri. The institute was planning to increase the tuition fee from Rs 5,000 to Rs 25,000. The loan from HEFA was taken over the last two to three years for hostels, faculty housing, academic buildings, a new facility for the campus’ incubation cell and so on. IIT-Delhi too has deferred the fee hike in the pandemic, said an institute official. Students across the older IITs currently pay around Rs 40,000 per semester, including hostel and mess and other fee components. The students get a stipend of Rs 12,000 per month if they take up teaching assistantship. A committee for MTech reforms had recommended bringing the MTech fees at IITs on a par with the undergraduate courses over three years. The UG fees currently is around Rs 2 lakh per year. The committee also said that the institutes will adopt a mechanism to ensure no deserving candidate will go without support.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/no-fee-hike-this-year-for-mtech-aspirants-at-iits/articleshow/82589932.cms||Yogita Rao
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: ‘DRDO hospital not apt for Covid patients with chronic ailments’||LUCKNOW: Days after a temporary Covid-19 hospital with 250 beds set up by DRDO at Awadh Shilpgram became functional, there has been growing demand from patients for a bed here, claimed officials from the integrated Covid command centre. The hospital is equipped with ventilators on 150 beds, while the remaining 100 have oxygen facility. The facility will be gradually expanded into a 500-bed hospital. According to UP government’s dashboard for Covid-19 hospitals, as of 9pm on Wednesday, ICCC had allotted all 105 ICU beds under its L3 quota for DRDO hospital, named the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Covid-19 Hospital. Of the remaining 45 for direct admission from other hospitals, 34 were available. Among oxygen-supported beds, 39 were available till 9pm. Speaking on anonymity, a senior official involved in the management of hospitalization said, “The newly constructed DRDO hospital has become a ‘status symbol’ among patients and families. We try to reason with such callers. In the majority of these cases, patients have severe comorbidities along with Covid. Hence, we prefer to send them to KGMU, SGPGI or other private hospitals, but they insist on DRDO hospital, which is still not equipped to handle critical patients.” The official cited the example of a 34-year-old Covid patient with 92% oxygen saturation whose family insisted on shifting him here. The family of another 30-year-old with oxygen saturation lower than 50% and severe co-morbidities also insisted on the same. “We explained to the patient that the makeshift hospital is not ready to admit him and that he would be better taken care of at SGPGI, KGMU or other private hospitals which have expertise,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/drdo-hosp-not-apt-for-covid-patients-with-chronic-ailments/articleshow/82589908.cms||Arvind Chauhan
---||Aurangabad||HC sets aside backward class quota for Dhule mayor's post; Remands matter back to state for fresh consideration||Aurangabad: The Bombay high court at Aurangabad has set aside a state notification of November 27, 2019 in respect of reservation of Mayor's post at the Dhule municipal corporation for a backward class candidate and has remanded the matter back to the state urban development department for consideration of reservation as per a rotation principle. In a ruling on May 7, the bench of Justice Ujjal Bhuyan and Justice M G Sewlikar relied on a 2014 judgment by the Karnataka HC which had declared that if there is any allotment to any reserved category for the second time in a municipality before completion of a cycle of rotation, it would be a clear violation of the principle of rotation. Bharatiya Janata Party councillor Sanjay Sudhakar Jadhav, who represents the scheduled caste (SC) community but had successfully contested the Dhule civic polls from a general category seat, had filed a writ petition challenging the notification of November 27, 2019 notification as being violative of the rotation policy. Lawyers Prashant Katneshwarkar and Yogesh Bolkar, representing Jadhav, had pointed out that since 2003, the Dhule mayor's term of two-and-a-half year each was never reserved for an SC candidate, but was reserved on four occasions for general/open category (2003, 2008, 2012 and 2017), twice for backward class category (2006 and 2014) and once for scheduled tribe category (2009). As such, the impending term which begins from June 2021 ought to have been reserved for a scheduled caste candidate and he qualified for the same, he contended. The HC bench, after referring to the provisions under the Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act and the Rules and arguments raised by either side, observed that it was in agreement with the Karnataka HC vis-a-vis rotation principle. "...Already on two earlier occasions there were reservations for backward class candidates. Repeating such reservation again for the current time would certainly be a violation of the rotation principle. This coupled with the fact that there has been no reservation till date for the scheduled caste category. This aspect needs to be seriously looked into by respondent no.1 (state UDD) Therefore, we are inclined to remand the matter back to respondent no.1 for a fresh consideration," the bench said. "The matter is remanded back to respondent no.1 to consider afresh the issue relating to reservation in the office of Mayor in the Dhule Municipal Corporation having regard to the discussions made above," the bench said. "Reconsideration so directed shall be carried out by respondent no.1 within a period of four weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment and order. Till the said exercise is carried out and notified, status-quo as on today as regards the office of Mayor in Dhule Municipal Corporation shall be maintained," the bench added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/hc-sets-aside-backward-class-quota-for-dhule-mayors-post-remands-matter-back-to-state-for-fresh-consideration/articleshow/82580638.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The hospitals found charging many times more than the amount fixed by the government for Covid-19 treatment. It was found in the inquiry that in one of the cases, a woman patient was charged 822% more than the fixed fee by a private Covid-19 hospital for 24 hours. Jacob, accompanied by a team comprising joint director, health, Dr Sunil Pandey, additional CMO Dr K D Mishra and special officer, revenue board, Apoorva Yadav conducted surprise inspections at hospitals in Gomti Nagar and Faizabad road and Kursi road. “During scrutiny of hospital records, it was found that hospitals were charging upto 822% more fee against the government approved Covid-19 package of Rs 18,000 per day, which includes treatment of hypertension, uncontrollable diabetic co-morbidity patients. The package also includes bed, food, nursing care, monitoring, emergency test, visiting charges, consultancy, medical test, hemodialysis,” an officer said. “Even after constant reminders that no patient will be charged for oxygen, the hospital on Kursi road was charging patients heavily for oxygen. One patient was charged Rs 86,400, another Rs 38,400 and Rs 28,800. The hospital did not even give original bills to patients for total charges it took as fee for Covid-19 treatment,” the report said. Other hospitals were also found charging excessively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/fir-against-hospitals-for-fleecing-patients/articleshow/82589933.cms||---

The Vaigai river witnessed flow of water due to overflowing Majalaru and Sothuparai dams and rain water. The water is being diverted to the scenic Teppakulam from Tuesday onwards, through Panaiyur channel. An official from the engineering department of Madurai corporation said that the water level has crossed 13ft and is expected to reach 14ft early on Thursday morning. They left water to flow for one full day before diverting to the Teppakulam to flush out dirt and soil. He added that water is continuously available in the tank since November 12. It went to the lowest of 2.5ft in April. “We will continue to fill the tank as 7.5cm of water level comes down in a day due to evaporation and percolatio,” the official added. He said that they cleaned the Panaiyur channel only a fortnight ago when the water was released from Vaigai dam for wetting the parched riverbed. Water was brought to Teppakulam for a few days then. So much garbage had accumulated in the channel between Ismailpuram 1st and 12th Street in just 10 days. Brimming water in the Teppakulam is a treat to the eyes of visitors as well as locals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/teppakulam-brimming-with-water-in-mid-summer/articleshow/82587477.cms||---
---||Madurai||Pvt companies cut milk procurement price due to sales dip||Madurai: Private milk companies have slashed the procurement price of milk up to Rs 4/litre due to decline in sales in the wake of the new restrictions announced by the state government to contain Covid-19 spread, which has dealt a heavy blow to the dairy farmers.Milk companies, including government cooperative societies are facing a decline in sales as tea shops are allowed to function only till 12pm, forcing them to bring down the procurement price. The ongoing lockdown in Kerala has also resulted in fall in demand. The procurement price of Aavin is Rs 31/litre, whereas private companies pay Rs 31.50/litre. Now, private companies are paying only Rs 27 or Rs 28 a litre depending on the quality. Although Aavin has not brought down the price, farmers cannot shift to Aavin as it has limitations in terms of quantity of procurement and handling. Farmers do not have a choice but to continue selling to private companies. A Ganapathi, a farmer from Kalligudi said back of the envelope calculation reveals that it costs Rs 20 to produce one litre of milk if cost involved in purchase of green fodder, dry fodder, monthly medical expense and labour are calculated. Cost of investment on the animal and sheds is separate. “It is profitable only if we get Rs 32 a litre,” he said. R Parthiban, a farmer from Alanganallur said that he is not affected by the price fluctuations as he is directly selling milk to the people at a good price.“Milk yield depends on nutrition-rich fodder supplied to the cows. A cow’s prime yielding time is only three months a year, which starts after giving birth to the calf. After that artificial insemination will be done and the quantity of milk will gradually come down in the next six months. It would not yield any milk for the next three months,” Parthiban said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/pvt-companies-cut-milk-procurement-price-due-to-sales-dip/articleshow/82587450.cms||V Devanathan
---||Mumbai||600 unaccompanied minors found on Western and Central Railway despite pandemic travel curbs||MUMBAI: Six hundred unaccompanied minors were found on Western and Central Railways in the financial year 2020-21 despite pandemic-induced curbs on travel and restricted train services. Nearly 65% of all the children found were male. Desperation as a result of the lockdown and the economic downturn could have contributed to minors moving to other towns, activists said. Data with Central Railway shows most children were found alone, or with underage siblings/friends, in Mumbai (142 cases) followed by Pune (119). On Western Railway, Mumbai reported 87 cases and Ratlam 68 cases. “Children may feel they can take up the responsibility of earning when adults are not in a position to do so. Bollywood films have often glorified such instances,” said activist and founder of NGO Prerana, Priti Patkar. Another reason for moving towards big cities is greater availability of resources and therefore, a better chance at getting help. But migration caused by distress becomes a fishing ground for traffickers. In one such instance in January, three sisters from Uttar Pradesh, looking for work, were trafficked to Mumbai by a woman in their neighbourhood. She left the girls, aged between 12 and 17 years, with an unknown man just before Bandra Terminus. The man briefly left the girls at the ticket reservation office when an alert RPF jawan spotted them and brought them to safety. “When there is distress, parents may not ask as many questions or exercise enough due diligence. So, strong safety nets must be created for children,” Patkar added. A few months ago, a 14-year-old boy from Rajasthan had landed up at Borivali station without informing his family. The police ensured his parents were informed and he was safe. “There is a standard operating procedure that has been implemented on the railways since 2015. A child found alone has to be produced before the Child Welfare Committee within 24 hours,” said PC Sinha, inspector general, RPF (WR). Child-friendly helpdesks have been created at major railway stations. “Instances of children leaving home after an argument with parents or losing their way while travelling with an adult were also reported,” said RS Salaria, senior inspector, RPF, WR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-600-minors-rescued-from-rly-stns-amid-pandemic/articleshow/82590130.cms||Nitasha Natu

Community leader Vinod Patil said that it was ironical that ruling MVA government and opposition BJP were indulging in mudslinging after the apex court struck down Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) quota. “The MVA government is saying that SEBC Act was flawed and BJP which framed it during its rule is to be blamed. On the other hand, BJP blaming MVA government for waging a weak battle in the Supreme Court while defending quota for Maratha community. Instead of suggesting some concrete solution, these political parties are engaged in cat fight,” he said. Patil added, “If the SEBC legislation was flawed, then why did Shiv Sena support it when it was in power along with BJP during the rule of previous government. We would like to also ask the BJP what relief it would bring to Maratha community now as it is in power at the Centre.” Stating that agitation in support for Maratha reservation would be stepped up in the near future, Maratha outfits have requested the state government as well as the Centre to take decisive steps to ensure reservation under SEBC Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/maratha-outfits-begin-protest/articleshow/82580720.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||HC to Pb, Hry: Explore if rules can be used for compulsory vaccination of all govt employees||Chandigarh: The Punjab and Haryana high court on Wednesday asked the states of Haryana and Punjab to explore the rules through which government employees of the two states can be compulsorily vaccinated for Covid-19. “We feel that states need to examine whether Rule 24 of the Haryana Civil Services (General) Rules needs to be invoked in case of government employees to explore whether government offices can be made fully functional at the earliest,” observed the high court. According to Rule 24 of the Haryana Civil Services (General) Rules, “Every government employee shall get himself vaccinated and re-vaccinated at any time when so directed by the government by general or special order.” Punjab has also been told to examine whether there is any ‘parimateria’ provision in the Punjab Rules as well which makes vaccination compulsory for government employees. In this context, Punjab’s counsel has been told to assist the court in light of the provision contained in Section 22(2)(h) of the Disaster Management Act. Considering the recent reports regarding the outbreak of the deadly virus in rural areas, the HC has asked both the states of Punjab and Haryana to provide a detailed report regarding the situation of the spread of virus in rural areas and the steps taken by the state at the ground level. The HC has made it clear that the report has to be filed by an officer not below the rank of additional chief secretary, health. A division bench comprising Justice Rajan Gupta and Justice Karamjit Singh of the HC passed these orders while hearing the ongoing petition related to the arrangements and the facilities available in the region to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic. The bench also directed both the states and the Union Territory of Chandigarh to impress upon the private diagnostic centres to reasonably slash their rates for CT Scan for Covid patients. The court also asked the Haryana government to explain the reports regarding wastage of Covid-19 vaccination in the state. HC seeks information about help by corporate sector under CSR Referring to the possibility of support by corporate houses in the hour of crisis, the division bench observed, “It is left to the three states to ask the corporate houses to participate in fighting the crisis by providing ambulances, oxygen beds, ventilators, CT Scan machines, etc to government hospitals so that economically weaker strata of the society has easy access to such facilities.” The high court also asked both the states and Chandigarh administration to apprise it about the response, if any, received in this regard from the corporate sector. These orders were passed by the bench after the Punjab advocate general (AG) Atul Nanda highlighted that under Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) incorporated in Section 135 of the Companies Act, it is obligatory for the companies to contribute at least 2% of their profit as social responsibility to society. Punjab needs 4 lakh vials of Covishield immediately: AG The Punjab AG also told the HC that Punjab needs around four lakh vials of Covishield vaccine immediately. Nanda also brought to the notice of the HC that 82 ventilators have were supplied to Punjab, of which 71 are faulty. He submitted that 24 oxygen containers are available with the state, but it has raised a demand for more. If six containers are arranged at the earliest, it would ease the situation in Punjab somewhat, he added. Regarding the availability of drugs, Nanda said that around 85,000 injections of Remdesivir have been supplied whereas the demand of 37,000 injections is still pending. Oxygen quota increased: Jain Satya Pal Jain, additional solicitor general of India told the HC that after the order dated May 7was passed by the HC, the Government of India increased the oxygen supply to Punjab from 227 MT to 247 MT and to Haryana from 267 MT to 307 MT. He added that the request made by Punjab for supply of six more oxygen containers and release of the pending quantity of Remdesivir injections and vaccines shall be looked into forthwith. As regards 71 faulty ventilators sent to Punjab, Jain submitted that the matter shall be examined immediately and necessary steps will be taken for rectifying the faults, if any, at the earliest. HC orders monitoring of ambulances The high court ordered Punjab, Haryana, and Chandigarh to get the nodal agencies in all districts to monitor ambulance facilities being provided by private operators. The HC also said the three states should also ensure that tele-consultancy is available to the general public 24x7. Services of doctors/final year medical students may be sought and such phone numbers be widely publicized, the HC said. The HC said It may seek a report regarding the tele-medicine facilities from the concerned deputy commissioner/additional deputy commissioners of the districts, who are designated as nodal officers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hc-to-pb-hry-explore-if-rules-can-be-used-for-compulsory-vaccination-of-all-govt-employees/articleshow/82587516.cms||Ajay Sura

---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Thundershowers turn evening pleasant, cloudy day ahead||LUCKNOW: Temperatures plunged by five to six degrees following heavy thundershowers that lashed the city on Wednesday evening, bringing relief from humid conditions prevailing for the past few days. The sky is expected to remain partly cloudy on Thursday, but there is low possibility of thunderstorm. However, thundershowers with gusty winds can lash a few places in the state on Thursday and Friday. The weather was hot and sultry all day, but changed around 8pm. Heavy thundershowers accompanied with lightning and gusty winds blowing at up to 30km/hour lashed the city. Soothing winds continued to flow even after the storm was over, making the conditions pleasant. State Met director JP Gupta said that a western disturbance (WD) over the Himalayan range and a cyclonic circulation of Madhya Pradesh were responsible for the thundershowers that lashed other parts of the state too. The maximum temperature in the city on Wednesday was 37.3 degrees Celsius, two units below normal, and the minimum temperature was 26.5 degrees Celsius, two degrees above normal. Similar mercury levels are expected on Thursday. The month of May, known for its typical hot dry winds and high mercury levels, has so far witnessed below normal day time temperatures because of a steady stream of WDs that have hit the Himalayas at regular intervals. These WDs are responsible for thunderstorms that the state and city have witnessed in the past 10 days, said Met officers. The WD also changes wind pattern, resulting in dominance of moisture-laden easterly winds over dry northwesterly winds, they added. While this phenomenon has kept maximum temperatures below normal, on the other hand, it has resulted in sultry weather conditions, officers explained. In comparison, February, March and April witnessed above normal day-time temperatures this year as the frequency of WDs was low during this period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/thundershowers-turn-evening-pleasant-cloudy-day-ahead/articleshow/82589976.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Full swing recovery in realty in April halted by 2nd wave||JAIPUR: The stamp and registration duty collection in April has overtaken the revenues achieved in the same month in 2020 and 2019, indicating recovery in the real estate demand just before the curfew came into force. The collections in April last year fell to Rs 7.77 crore due to lockdown, and are not comparable. But a comparison to April 2019 shows the collections of Rs 386.21 crore in the last month pointed to a demand coming back into the market. In April 2019, the collections stood at Rs 295 crore. A senior official in the stamp and registration department said, “There was a small boost from the new cess imposed last year. But overall, the real estate market did very well to come back strongly after the lockdown and demand squeeze in the first half of the last financial year.” The official said that despite the corona pandemic, collections in last financial year increased to Rs 5,297 crore against Rs 4,234 crore in 2019-20. Supporting the view, real estate developers in the city said that the demand was coming back to normal levels and had the second wave not been there, the market would have posted good growth over last year. “There was huge demand for completed projects and buyer sentiment had improved from January onwards. People had hired back lot of their staff. The market was in full recovery mode till the first half of April. Marketing and promotion activities were increasing. But then, corona had other plans,” said a builder in the city. Going forward, he said that even though the second wave has been very nasty, the recovery will be very fast. “In all likelihood, we don’t see this wave taking much of time. The difficulty has been severe, but the recovery will be faster.” Over 95% of the revenues from stamp duty and registrations come from property transactions with a very small portion contributed by the loan documents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/full-swing-recovery-in-realty-in-april-halted-by-2nd-wave/articleshow/82587517.cms||---

Around 800 covid deaths have occurred in the last one month in Kolhapur district and the daily count has consistently been above 50 in the last six days. “The Panchganga crematorium is the only one among the four in the city that is reserved for Covid victims. The other crematoriums are at Kasba Bawda, Bapat camp and Kadamwadi,” assistant health inspector Arvind Kamble of the KMC said on Wednesday. “There are 47 beds and one gas cremation machine at the Panchganga crematorium. The gas cremation takes one hour for each body while the normal bed takes six hours to completely turn into ashes,” he said. According to Kamble, the ‘Raksha visarjan’ process, which is on the third day post death, is being conducted within six hours to make space for another body. Considering the number of deaths every day, the KMC is planning to increase the capacity at the crematorium. People conducting the last rites at the Panchganga crematorium are under a lot of stress due to the continuous flow of bodies. Vikas Kamble, one of the workers, said, “I have never seen such flow of bodies in my 33 years of service at this place. Before the pandemic, hardly 10 to 15 bodies would arrive daily. However, around 60 bodies are being brought daily these days.” He said the beds get full by the evening and hence those coming late have to wait before the funeral procedure. Patients from Sangli, Satara, parts of Konkan and Belgavi, are succumbing to Covid during treatment in Kolhapur. Their bodies are also being brought to Panchganga crematorium, thus increasing the burden. BOX The Kolhapur civic body has issued a list of contact numbers of health inspectors to enquire about availability of death beds at crematorium sites. Mahesh Bhosale can be contacted at 9766532043 to enquire about Panchganga crematorium, Nandkumar Patil at 9766532048 for Kasba Bawda, Munir Faras 9766532052 for Bapat camp and Rahul Rajgolkar at 9766532040 for Bagal chowk burial ground.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/panchganga-crematorium-site-overburdened-50-bodies-daily/articleshow/82580816.cms||Rahul Gayakwad
---||Aurangabad||Three batches of HSC, SSC pupils await fee refund||CLEARED SKHER Aurangabad: A large number of SSC and HSC students from Marathwada have not yet received their refund of examination fees, evoking sharp reactions from education activists. Fee waiver was announced for students belonging to academic years 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2020-21 either due to drought or unseasonal rains in Marathwada. When contacted, authorities from the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHE) said technical issues were proving roadblocks in releasing the money towards beneficiary students. “While data of some beneficiary students is with us, that of others is still in the process of compilation at the level of schools and junior colleges. The process was earlier carried out in offline manner but we have now switched to online methods,” B B Chavan, acting secretary of MSBSHE (Aurangabad) division said on Wednesday. Chavan said a section of beneficiaries has already received the refund of their fees. “In some cases, the cheques issued in the name of students were returned to us as they were encashed after the stipulated 180 days. We have to prepare fresh cheques against the name of such students,” he said, adding that the board was compiling related data on a priority basis. The board has extended the date of submission of the desired data of students by educational institutes till May 30. Educational activist Prashant Sathe accused board authorities for having casual approach towards the fee-waiver issue. “The State Board has been completing the fee-waiver related formalities with a snail’s pace. Such a sluggish progress of any welfare measure defeats the whole purpose and leaves beneficiaries at lurch,” he said. Over around 1.6 lakh students register for HSC examination from Aurangabad division every year, while more than 1.8 lakh students appear for SSC every year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/three-batches-of-hsc-ssc-pupils-await-fee-refund/articleshow/82580775.cms||Prasad Joshi

They concluded their campaign on Wednesday, the International Nurses Day, which falls on May 12. Though the file pertaining to the issue is lying in the chief minister’s office (CMO), there has been no progress in the matter, alleged nurses’ association. There are around 13,000 nurses in Jaipur.“We met the health minister (Raghu Sharma) on Wednesday and he assured us that our proposal will get an approval in the state cabinet soon. Last year, too, on the nurse’s day, he had assured us that our demand would be fulfilled. If they don’t do it this time, then we’ll be compelled to call a statewide strike. But, we don’t want the patients to suffer during the pandemic situation,” said Pyarelal Chaudhry, state president, Rajasthan nurses’ association.“It’s been two years since the government has assured us that they will fulfill our demand, but nothing has been done in this regard. Around 100 public representatives including current ministers, former MLAs, Lok Sabha members and legislative assembly members have lent their support to our cause,” Chaudhry said.“The government need not spend a penny to fulfill our demand. They have granted job titles to 12 other cadres in the state, including the village assistants and other government staff. Instates like Uttarakhand, Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, the nurses have been granted the posts of nursing officers, but it has not been done in Rajasthan yet,” he added.Nursing head of Janana hospital, Chandpole, Ramesh Saini said the campaign was not to protest against the government, but to draw the attention to our cause. “Ours is a noble profession. Hence, we want that even we should be treated with respect in society. This is an absolutely non-financial demand. Our duty hour is up to 2 pm, but we have been working till 4 pm for the past three days,” said Saini.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/nurses-across-state-work-extra-two-hours-seeking-change-in-their-designations/articleshow/82587519.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The rape-cum-murder convict was brought from the Sunaria jail in an ambulance with a cavalcade of police force. Sources said Ram Rahim was taken to the hospital at 6pm following the advice of a team of doctors that examined him. Dr Pushpa Dahiya, medical superintendent, PGIMS, Rohtak, said Ram Rahim complained of high blood pressure, uneasiness and dizziness. He was brought for medical observation. She denied the convict was a Covid patient. A special CBI court in August 2017 had sentenced Ram Rahim Singh to 20-year imprisonment for raping two women -- 10 years each for the two rape cases. The terms would run consecutively and not concurrently. In January 2019, the court had sentenced him and three others to life imprisonment for the murder of a journalist over 16 years ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/rape-murder-convict-dera-chief-in-rohtak-hosp/articleshow/82587546.cms||---
---||Delhi||Bharat Biotech ready to share formula: Centre||NEW DELHI: Refuting allegations that the Centre is controlling supplies of Covaxin and not letting Bharat Biotech supply additional doses of the jab to Delhi, the Centre said the capital has received 75,000 doses of free Covaxin from the it, whereas Delhi government itself has procured 1 lakh doses and private sector got 20,000 doses. “We refute (the charge) that there is any pressure on anybody not to supply to any particular state,” NITI Aayog member health Dr VK Paul said, adding that such allegations affect the morale of vaccine manufacturers. He also countered the Delhi government’s claim that the state has run out of Covaxin. On Tuesday, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia had alleged the Covaxin manufacturer has in a letter said it cannot provide the Delhi government vaccines due to unavailability, and referred to directions of government officials concerned. Paul maintained that the Centre’s role is to facilitate. Paul said Bharat Biotech is also ramping up capacity and has already roped in three public sector undertakings. He also clarified Covaxin requires a specialised BSL3 (level 3 labs) platform and any company equipped with such laboratories can come forward for manufacturing the vaccine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bharat-biotech-ready-to-share-formula-centre/articleshow/82615275.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Bharat Bio hits back at CMs fretting over Covaxin supply||HYDERABAD: Covaxin developer Bharat Biotech is taking its detractors head on yet again. A day after Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to allow other companies to manufacture Covaxin and Covishield to tide over the vaccine crunch, the Hyderabad-based vaccine-maker has hit back. The company’s top brass on Wednesday said they were disheartened by some states complaining about their intentions at a time when they have ramped up direct supplies to 18 states, albeit through smaller shipments. Covaxin was developed by the company along with Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Virology (ICMR-NIV). Tweeting early on Wednesday morning, Bharat Biotech joint managing director Suchitra Ella, also said such criticism was demoralising for the company’s team that has been working round-the-clock to churn out vaccines despite manpower and lockdown challenges. “Covaxin dispatched 10/5/21.18 states have been covered thou in smaller shipments. Quite disheartening to the teams to hear Some states complaining about our intentions. 50 of our employees are off work due to covid, yet we continue to work under pandemic lockdowns 24x7 for U,” Ella tweeted. Both Kejriwal and Jagan wrote to Modi on Tuesday seeking transfer of Covaxin technology to other companies to enable quick ramp-up of vaccines as the current supplies are not enough to cater to the demand at a time the country is in the grip of a second wave of Covid-19. To make matters worse, Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Wednesday accused Bharat Biotech of refusing to supply Covaxin doses to the state at the behest of the Centre. Sisodia also made public a letter written by Bharat Biotech chairman and managing director Dr Krishna Ella to the Delhi government on Tuesday in response to a request for additional Covaxin doses. Delhi is one of the 18 states where Bharat Biotech has commenced direct supplies of Covaxin since May 1. “We appreciate your interest in procuring large quantities of Covaxin… However, there has been an unprecedented demand for our vaccine and in spite of increasing production every month, we are unable to keep up with the demand. Further, we are making dispatches as per the directives of the concerned govt officials. We, therefore, sincerely regret that we cannot make any additional supplies as requested by you,” Ella states in the letter. This is not the first time that Bharat Biotech has found itself at the centre of a controversy in these Covid times. The drug regulator's decision to issue Covaxin a restricted emergency use nod in the first week of January even as Phase III efficacy trials of the vaccine were underway, had sparked off a major row with many experts and politicians questioning the decision. But the company has not shied away from taking on its critics either. In early January, Dr Krishna Ella had hit out at critics as well as Serum Institute of India’s CEO Adar Poonawalla after his disparaging remarks about all vaccines, except the ones developed AstraZeneca Oxford, Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, being “safe as water”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bharat-bio-hits-back-at-cms-fretting-over-covaxin-supply/articleshow/82592027.cms||Swati Bharadwaj
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh to assess prevalence of black fungus, draw SOP||LUCKNOW: With doctors reporting a rash of cases involving a rare infection — Black Fungus — among recovering and recovered Covid-19 patients, the UP government on Wednesday directed health and medical education departments to coordinate with the advisory committee on Covid-19 to chalk out a report on the status of such cases in the state. During the pandemic review on Wednesday, chief minister Yogi Adityanath said, “Team 9 constituted under the chairmanship of chief secretary R K Tiwari should consult the state-level advisory panel of health experts on prevelance of Black Fungus infection.” Additional chief secretary, information, Navneet Sehgal, said: “The committee has also been tasked to develop a line of management for prevention and a standard operating protocol for treatment." Black Fungus is the common name for a fungal infection called mucormycosis. On Monday, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) expressed concern about a surge in such infections among Covid patients, diabetics, immunosuppressed patients (persons whose immunity levels have declined) and those who had a prolonged stay at intensive care units. “Mucormycosis may turn fatal if uncared for,” the ICMR advisory said. Seven cases of black fungus are being managed at Lucknow’s King George’s Medical University and four patients were flagged by the Meerut health administration. Prior to the ICMR advisory, such cases were first reported in Gujarat and Maharashtra. Physicians are of the view that non-judicious use of steroids in patients with co-morbid conditions may also predispose conditions that allow development of Black Fungus. “Steroids tend to cause a kind of immunosuppression, which is a known predisposing factor of black fungus,” said Dr Sunil Verma, a senior consultant in internal medicine. He added excess or mindless use of steroids can be detrimental while treating Covid or pneumonia. The ICMR advisory stated that warning signs should not be ignored in the vulnerable group. “Sinusitis, nasal blockade or congestion, nasal discharge (blackish/bloody), local pain on the cheek bone, one sided facial pain, numbness or swelling, blackish discoloration over bridge of nose/palate, toothache, loosening of teeth, jaw involvement, blurred or double vision with pain; fever, skin lesion; thrombosis and bedsores (necrosis (eschar), chest pain, pleural effusion, hemoptysis (coughing blood), worsening of respiratory symptoms are warning signs that must be taken seriously and dealt with,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/state-to-assess-prevalence-of-black-fungus-draw-sop/articleshow/82590042.cms||Shailvee Sharda

The students aim to promote the concept of “earn while you learn.” The students have also urged citizens to donate plant seeds so that they can carry out a massive tree plantation activity this monsoon. Prasad Bhopale, a masters student who initiated the concept, said, “We started this initiative under BCE Foundation and Vruksh Premi Welfare Organization where 500 students from six districts have come together to carry out the “mangoes for education” concept. Under this initiative, these students will home deliver Devgad alphonso and Vengurla alphonso mangoes and the profit generated from it will be used to fund their education. These mangoes are directly bought from the farmers from Devgad and Vengurla and, hence, people will get good quality mangoes at their doorstep at reasonable cost.” Meanwhile, the group’s prime motto is tree plantation under which students will urge people to join in the noble cause and donate seeds. Nikhil More, a student and committee member of mangoes for education, said, “The importance of oxygen in these pandemic times has made people realize the importance of tree plantation. People can donate us seeds of mango, jamun, fig, banyan, neem, pine and any other tree. We will carry out the further procedure to make seed balls out of them using potting soil, clay and ash and carry out a massive plantation drive across the district. People usually do not have time to make seed balls and carry out plantation activity and, hence, we will do it for them”. People can call on 8412824242 to donate seeds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/500-students-unite-for-mangoes-for-education-initiative/articleshow/82580854.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

The number of Covid-19 fatalities, however, remained high at 300. The 13,287 new Covid-19 cases were recorded from 78,035 tests, out of which 63,315 were RT-PCR tests and 14,720 rapid antigen tests. With 14,071 people recovering from the disease in the last 24 hours, the total number of active cases stood at 82,725 on Wednesday. On Monday, the city had recorded 12,651 Covid-19 cases with a positivity rate of 19.1%, which was a significant dip from the high of 36.24% recorded on April 22. The positivity rate further dipped to 17.76% on Tuesday and 17.03% on Wednesday, reducing by almost half from the positivity rate recorded exactly three weeks ago. While the city has been carrying out close to one lakh tests a day till recently, the numbers have decreased of late. The Delhi government ascribes the dip to the ongoing lockdown, which has resulted in few people venturing out of their homes and visiting public places like markets where large-scale testing used to take place earlier. While Monday saw a positivity rate of 19.1% from 66,234 tests, the positivity rate of 17.76% the next day was from 70,276 tests. Even more tests were carried out on Wednesday, but the positivity rate was lower. Data shared by the state health department shows that 49,974 or more than 60% of the active cases are recuperating under home isolation. With the city witnessing a slow but steady dip in the number of daily cases, active cases and positivity rate, the availability of hospital beds has gone up slightly, even though enough ICU beds are still not available. From just 1,199 vacant hospital beds on April 30, the number of vacant beds went up to 4,469 on Wednesday. The availability also improved due to an increase in the total number of beds from 20,938 on April 30 to 23,202 on Wednesday. The Delhi government’s LNJP Hospital has 562 out of 1,500 total beds vacant. GTB Hospital had 137 of 750 beds vacant and 122 of total 500 beds of DDU Hospital were vacant on Wednesday evening, as per the Delhi Corona app. However, most of the big private hospitals have no beds to spare and the total number of available ICU beds is also low at 84. The total number of deaths in the national capital due to Covid-19 has reached 20,310 and the month of May has already recorded 4,163 Covid-19 fatalities. The number of cumulative Covid-19 cases stands at 13,61,986.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/in-3-weeks-positivity-rate-down-by-a-half/articleshow/82587624.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Aurangabad||Maharashtra: Senior citizen given different vaccines in Jalna, under watch||AURANGABAD: A senior citizen from Jalna district, around 140km from here, completed his two-dose vaccination but with the first one being Covaxin and the second Covishield. His family claims he has suffered minor complications after the second dose. The rare incident, reported from the home district of Maharashtra’s health minister Rajesh Tope, has brought health authorities under fire and the recipient is under watch. Dattatraya Waghmare (72), of Khandvi village in Partur taluka of Jalna district, got his first jab of Covaxin at a rural hospital in Partur on March 22. On April 30, he got the Covishield dose at a primary health centre in Shrishti village. Waghmare’s son Digambar told TOI on Wednesday that his father developed a rash on the body after the second dose along with mild fever and anxiety. “We took him to the state health centre at Partur, where he was given some medication. The lapse on the part of the health machinery came to notice only a few days ago when I saw his two vaccination certificates,” said the 29-year-old, who runs a hair-cutting salon. The family informed the health authorities at the taluka level about the issue, following which a team of doctors was sent to conduct a health check-up of Waghmare, who is a heart patient and had undergone a bypass surgery a couple of years ago. “My father is illiterate and I’m also not much educated. It was the duty of the health authorities present at the vaccination centre to ensure that my father got the same vaccine doses,” said Digambar. Swapnil Lale, deputy director of health, Aurangabad division, said an inquiry has been ordered into the incident. “We have asked the Jalna district health officer to submit a detailed report. The man in question is stable and has not developed any further health complications so far,” he said. “Whether Waghmare’s incident can be considered under the category of Adverse Event Following Immunization (AEFI) can be decided only after the inquiry report is submitted,” Lale added. Ashok Belkhode, a member (health) of the Marathwada Development Board, said the incident has exposed lack of awareness about basics of vaccination in rural areas. “The ground level authorities at vaccination centres have to be more vigilant while executing the immunization programme. While the rural population at large is not aware about the dose to be taken and the interval between two shots, it is the duty of local authorities to verify the database of every beneficiary before administering vaccines,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/senior-citizen-given-differentvaccines-in-jalna-under-watch/articleshow/82580927.cms||Prasad Joshi

The MP has said that a team from the ministry of health and ICMR should visit AMU at the earliest to assess the situation and take immediate action. The MP has also said that AMU Medical College is not equipped to handle the situation due to shortage of medical equipment and other facilities. In his letter, Ali has said that AMU is facing the most challenging and toughest time in a century “due to the dangerous explosion of new variant of Covid-19 that has devastated the campus”. The MP has said that he is a member of the AMU Court and several AMU alumni from across the world have been expressing their concern and urging people to save the educational institution. “The institute recently completed 100 years of its existence and you yourself addressed the centenary celebrations as a chief guest, in December, last year,” Ali has said to the PM. “AMU’s Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College is also not fully equipped to handle such a challenging situation due to shortage of medical equipment and other facilities. The only medical college in Aligarh and surrounding districts requires sufficient medical aid, equipment, especially an oxygen plant on an urgent basis, to cater to a huge number of Covid patients who are struggling for their lives,” he has said in the letter. The MP has requested the PM to immediately provide medical assistance and allocate sufficient funds to the medical college so that it can procure equipment which will help it to provide necessary treatment to Covid patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/coronavirus-deaths-in-amu-mp-writes-to-pm-for-immediate-aid/articleshow/82590084.cms||---

And out of these 83 too, as many as 48 repaired ventilators are not being put to use over fears that they may break down, forcing the medical colleges to make up with their own life-saving equipment. Guru Gobind Singh Medical College, Faridkot, a constituent college of Baba Farid University of Health Sciences (BFUHS), had received 113 ventilators of which 90 are non-functional. Similarly, Government Medical College, Amritsar, had got 109 ventilators of which 97 are not working. Government Medical College, Patiala, had got 98 ventilators and out of these, 48 were made functional after repairs. The college has 61 ventilators of its own. BFUHS vice-chancellor Dr Raj Bahadur told TOI, “We have informed the state government regarding the malfunctioning of these ventilators. Even Karnataka is learnt to have raised a red flag about the malfunctioning of the ventilators received from the Centre”. He said it was imperative that the government should have provided a long-term comprehensive annual maintenance contract and a company should have engineers for rectification of malfunctioned ventilators. The vice-chancellor said each medical college has its own ventilators being used in ICUs. The anaesthesia department of a medical college has been converted into an L3 facility for severely sick patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/237-of-320-ventilators-under-pm-cares-fund-not-working-in-punjab/articleshow/82587600.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Mumbai||60+ in Mumbai can now walk in for 2nd dose 3 days a week||MUMBAI: The state on Wednesday suspended the vaccination drive for the 18-44 age group and diverted nearly 10 lakh doses purchased for this group towards completing the second dose of the 45-plus beneficiaries. Close to 20 lakh people from the 45-plus age group are awaiting their second dose, including 16 lakh for Covishield. Times ViewThe civic body should not change its guidelines every other day or even every few days for senior citizens and for citizens overall. Far too frequent changes make it hard for people to figure out what the latest rules are. For senior citizens who aren't tech-savvy, it's even harder to track changes. And even when the BMC tweaks rules, there must be some consistency; allowing walk-ins on certain days and not on others will result in confusion. For sure, authorities need to adapt and change policies depending on the need for vaccinations, but the frequency and manner of change are important.In Mumbai, less than a week after barring walk-ins, BMC decided to allow walk-ins for people above 60 and differently-abled persons three days a week (Monday to Wednesday) and online appointments on the other three days from next week. There will be no vaccinations on Sunday. Health minister Rajesh Tope said that for the next few days, priority will be given to completing the second dose of the 45+ group. “Serum Institute of India CEO Adar Poonawalla has promised the chief minister that 1.5 crore doses of Covishield will be given to Maharashtra after May 20,” Tope said. ‘Now, one vax centre in every corporator ward’Health minister Rajesh Tope said, “We will start vaccination for the 18-44 age group after we have adequate stocks.” The state currently has 7 lakh Covishield doses, of which 3 lakh were procured for the 18-44 age group and 3 lakh Covaxin doses, of which 2.75 lakh were meant for the younger group. As on Tuesday, the state had vaccinated 5.96 lakh in the 18-44 age group. Following the decision, many said on social media they may have to seek vaccines in other states. The BMC has emphasised that walk-ins will be allowed for citizens at vaccination centres closer to their homes. AMC Suresh Kakani said the decision was taken to make it easier for locals to get vaccinated and for those who were struggling with online appointments. Officials have indicated that the norms may be experimental at this stage and improvised next week looking at the response. “On Thursday, vaccinations would be completely online,” said Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer. Kalina corporator Tulip Miranda said walk-ins should be allowed for everyone above 60 and not just for those due for their second dose. In the Wednesday circular, the BMC chief said that in every corporator ward one vaccination centre is being started. In order to ensure that the centre functions to its capacity, there should be 100 doses available at every booth. On Wednesday, 28,559 people got vaccinated in the city. Some of the major centres such as Nesco in Goregaon and BKC Jumbo in Bandra vaccinated only 200-300 people. Tope said the state will receive some quota from the Centre in the next few days which will be diverted towards those seeking the second dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/60-in-city-can-now-walk-in-for-2nd-dose-3-days-a-week/articleshow/82590158.cms||Bhavika Jain

After an interaction between the representatives of Indian Industries Association (IIA) and MSME minister Sidharth Nath Singh and industrial development minister Satish Mahana on Wednesday, it was decided that industrial units can issue passes for transportation on their letterheads and no one will be stopped anywhere. “To encourage medical sector, the government is working on a sector-specific policy which will provide subsidies and incentives to promote MSMEs in the field,” Mahana said. The policy will be announced shortly. During the online meeting, the ministers and the organisation of micro, small and medium industries also discussed the impact of Covid-19 pandemic on the sector. National senior vice president of IIA, Manmohan Agrawal, spoke about the various problems being faced by the industry. He said the government should allow transport delivery offices to operate during curfews so that raw material or other items can be supplied to industries for operations. “Consumables required for maintenance of plants and machinery must be allowed to operate for at least two days in a week to allow maintenance work in factories,” he added. “Bills related to UPSIDA and power bills should be deferred for at least six months. Due to the problem of liquidity, it would help MSMEs tremendously if UPSIDA and DIC convert industrial leasehold land into freehold so that entrepreneurs with spare or unused land can dispose it of. EMI dues can also be deferred for a year to reduce financial burden on MSMEs while a one-year moratorium on interest should also be introduced,” Agarwal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/govt-for-ensuring-smooth-industrial-ops-amid-pandemic/articleshow/82590114.cms||---

The task force is now engaged research and preparing Covid paediatric protocol to be followed if such a situation arises. With the experts alerting the administration regarding the life-threatening ‘multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS)’ that Covid may trigger among the minors and it’s expensive treatment with IV Gammaglobulin costing Rs 30,000-50,000, the district administration is learnt to have asked the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) to check if these paediatric medicines are available in the market. Even Remdesivir is considered key therapy for treating children affected with Covid. In back-to-back meetings with the paediatricians this week, the district and civic administrations began drawing up plans to ramp up the health infrastructure, train the health and support staff and create awareness among parents, teachers and other grassroots health and community workers regarding the ‘red flag’ symptoms among children. It is learnt GMCH Nagpur has been already treating children with MIS, which may be major threat in the third wave. Though the percentage of children suffering MIS is small, it can be lethal. Dr Dipty Jain, head of the department for paediatrics at GMCH, said MIS was treatable with a costly therapy and can be overcome with proper and timely care. “MIS can lead to multiple organ failures but can be managed if detected at the right time and proper care is taken,” she said. “The minors are the most vulnerable lot as they are not being vaccinated too,” she said. Dr Jain, along with Dr Vinita Jain (Bhusari) of Daga Hospital, Dr Meenakshi Subramaniyam of AIIMS and several well known paediatricians like Dr Uday Bodhankar, Dr Satish Deopujari, Dr Sanjay Deshmukh are learnt to be part of the Covid paediatric task force. Dr Deopujari said standard operation protocol (SOP) must be formulated to manage the paediatric wave. “There would be two major categories of patients— the babies born to positive mothers and babies or children individually acquiring infection. Major thrust would be to train the staffers in rural areas to recognize the tell tale symptoms and manage the condition until need for a referral to tertiary care is felt,” he said. “We would need to create special ICUs for children, special equipment, beds and so on. Special beds to accommodate mothers to be with the children are required too,” he said. Looking at an high-risk section of around 10,000 minors in the district, a massive data collection drive needs to be launched to assess needs of the hospital beds, neonatal intensive care units, paediatrics intensive care units, oxygen facilities, bipap machines, concentrators, doctors and support staffers both at private and government hospitals. District collector Ravindra Thakare said the worldwide research, data and national guidelines have indicated third wave possibly targeting the children more. Dr Bodhankar said the children should be vaccinated against TB, MMR and also flu to bolster their immunity. “They should be given proper diets, introduced to breathing exercises and not given junk foods,” he said pointing at the deaths of around 400 children in America due to Covid. Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, president of the Indian Academy of Paediatricians, said three categories of children (0-5, 5-12 and 12 and above) should be made and the research should revolve around these groups. “If one lakh are affected, at least 10,000 would need hospitalization,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fearing-3rd-wave-hitting-kids-admin-forms-task-force/articleshow/82587742.cms||Soumitra Bose

He is "probably the oldest in the country" to overcome the infectious disease, hospital officials said. Ramananda Teertha was admitted with moderate Covid-19 symptoms on April 24 and is said to have no co-morbidities. "Teertha, who is aged 110, recovered from Covid-19 after undergoing treatment at our hospital," said M Raja Rao, superintendent, Gandhi Hospital. Teertha stays at an ashram in Keesara and is said to have lived in the Himalayas for nearly two decades. The hospital released a video where Teertha can be seen answering questions from doctors at the hospital. In the video, he said that he had undergone leg surgery at Gandhi Hospital a few years ago, helping authorities to pull out his records. Doctors at the hospital said he will be kept under observation for a few more days. They are planning to shift him to a non-oxygen bed and to put him on a liquid diet. In July 2020, 94-year-old P Vijayalakshmi walked out of Gandhi Hospital after recovering from Covid-19. She was at the time the oldest patient in the state to successfully fight the disease. She had been admitted with mild symptoms but lacked mental strength as she had lost her younger son to the coronavirus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/110-yr-old-beats-covid-in-gandhi-back-on-his-feet/articleshow/82592059.cms||Nirupa Vatyam
---||Hyderabad||Olympics door shuts on Saina Nehwal, Kidamabi Srikanth||HYDERABAD: The Tokyo Olympics door was slammed shut on shuttlers Saina Nehwal and Kidamabi Srikanth after the Singapore Open, the last of the qualifying events for the Games before the June 15 deadline, was cancelled on Wednesday due to a surge in Covid-19 cases globally. With their chances hanging by a thread after the Malaysia Open (May 25-30) was postponed on May 7, the Indian duo had pinned their hopes on the Singapore Open that was scheduled to be held from June 1 to 6. “Tournament organisers Singapore Badminton Association (SBA) and the Badminton World Federation (BWF) have jointly agreed to cancel the Singapore Open 2021 scheduled for June 1-6, 2021,” BWF said. “All attempts were made by the organisers and BWF to provide a safe tournament environment for all participants. However, rising Covid-19 cases globally led to complex challenges in managing inbound travel. Thus, in the interests of all players, tournament personnel and the local community’s health and safety, the event has been cancelled.” BWF also said that the tournament will not be rescheduled, but offered a glimmer of hope to the Indians. “BWF will issue a further statement on Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games qualifying at a later date.” However, chances of conducting another tournament before the Olympics begin on July 23 are slim and that makes the duo’s task of qualifying remote. “It's obviously disappointing,” Srikanth told TOI. “What can we do given the situation? We can only wait for the BWF decision. Now that five to six tournaments have been cancelled, we have to see what they will do,” he added. Saina is ranked 22nd and Srikanth 20th in the Race to Tokyo rankings. As only two players, who are in the top-16 of world rankings qualify from each country, PV Sindhu in women's singles and Sai Praneeth in men's singles have made the cut. Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty have qualified in men's doubles. This would be the first instance of Saina missing the quadrennial games since the 2008 Beijing Olympics and at 31, Saina might have played her last Games at Rio in 2016. That only four shuttlers have made it to Olympics this time is a poor show by Indian standards. Five Indians took part in the London Games, where Saina won bronze and seven went to Rio de Janeiro in 2016, where Sindhu bagged silver.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/oly-door-shuts-on-saina-srikanth/articleshow/82592103.cms||Manne Ratnakar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Raut wants ‘offensive’ posts out, moves court||Mumbai: Shiv Sena politician Sanjay Raut has filed an application before the Esplanade court seeking directions to Twitter and Google to block, hide, remove or pull down allegedly “offensive” posts against him, including video links, by Dr Swapna Patker on their social media platforms. The matter will next come up for hearing after the court vacation. On Tuesday, Patker, who claims that Raut and she “share family relations and have gone on holidays together as a family”, filed through her advocate Abha Singh an intervention application to be added as a party and be heard, since allegations are made against her posts. Raut’s application, filed on April 26, had made Twitter Communications India Pvt Ltd and YouTube LLC at the Google India office, apart from senior police inspector of cyber crime police station, as parties and not her. His plea is for removing or disabling access to offending content under the provisions of the IT Act. Twitter India, through its counsel Anirudh Ganu, last week objected to being made a party by Raut to his application and sought deletion since it has no control over the content, which is hosted and managed by Twitter Inc, USA. On Tuesday, Raut sought Twitter Communication India be deleted as a party, as also the Indian entity of Google LLC. Raut (60) in his application through Advocate Pankaj Bafna alleged that the woman is doing “targeted harassment” against him and has violated the rules of Twitter and YouTube in a “particularly egregious way” even after requests to “her and other followers”to remove the posts, including some made last month. Patker in her intervention plea alleged that Raut has “selectively referred to a few tweets from the entire twitter thread’’ and that she was exercising her freedom of speech. She said she has filed a petition against Raut before the high court. — Swati Deshpande||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-raut-wants-offensive-posts-out-moves-court/articleshow/82590225.cms||---

Though forest officials claimed all the deaths to be natural, the death of tiger cubs could have been averted had the frontline staff been alert. In the first incident, two-month-old tiger cubs, both female, were found dead in a siphon canal of Tekapar lift irrigation project, 15km from Bhandara near Garada. The cubs were first noticed by some morning runners who were out on their routine. Another cub was found dead near Dhanori in Paoni range on the outskirts of Umred-Karhandla-Paoni Wildlife Sanctuary. A full-grown male sloth bear was also found dead on Rawanwadi-Dhargaon, 12km from Bhandara. Bhandara deputy conservator (DyCF) SB Bhalavi said two cubs died due to drowning. The siphon well of the Tekapar-Shrinagar canal had water due to rains and the cubs must have fallen inside on Tuesday night. “We have installed camera traps to trace the mother. Her pugmarks were seen near the spot,” said Bhalavi. “There are around a dozen such wells and all are open. If these wells are not covered, more such incidents involving wildlife cannot be ruled out in future. These wells are six feet deep and prove to be death traps for animals,” said Pervez Shahid Khan of Save Ecosystem & Tigers (SEAT), Bhandara. “The canal was constructed 20 years ago when there was not much awareness about wildlife. but now that the wild animals are crying for space due to habitat destruction, irrigation department should fence these wells,” said honorary wildlife warden Nadeem Khan. However, wildlife lover Azhar Hussain says since April 25, local graziers had sighted the tigress with cubs in Garada area where the cubs died. “In November-December, this tigress had mated in Rawanwadi area and Bhandara RFO Vivek Rajurkar had information about it. This means no track of the tigress and cubs was kept by the frontline staff,” he said. In the second incident, an ailing cub died after foresters made an unsuccessful attempt to reunite it with the mother tigress in Sawarla in Paoni range. Bhalavi says the tigress with two cubs was being monitored since March 28, when they were first recorded. The cubs and tigress were regularly monitored. On May 5, the two cubs were sighted by one Chintaman Kumbre in compartment number 310 near a lake. However, the forest department in its release admits that only one cub was visible since May 7. The mother must have abandoned the cub and left the spot with another cub. For four days, officials did nothing to rescue the cub and SOP on the abandoned cub was not followed. “On May 11, we found the cub in a weak and dehydrated condition, and in the presence of a vet, we offered milk to it and kept the cub at the same place assuming the mother will take it away. The staff kept a watch the entire night, but the cub was found dead in the bushes on Wednesday morning,” said Bhalavi. In the third incident, a sloth bear was found dead on Dhargaon-Rawanwadi road near bamboo clusters. Wildlife vet Dr Gunwant Bhadke says, “The bear died of venomous Russel’s Viper bite. The body parts of the sloth bear showed haemorrhage and blood was oozing out of the body.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/three-tiger-cubs-sloth-bear-dead-in-bhandara/articleshow/82587747.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Sources told TOI that both Greyhounds commandos and Maoists have been affected by the virus in the second wave. According to sources, about two dozen Greyhound commandos have tested positive for Covid-19 in the last three to four weeks. The state police have also received intelligence inputs that that several Maoists are suffering from the pandemic in the jungles. The Visakhapatnam rural and East Godavari districts police have even appealed to the Maoists to join the mainstream and avail of medical facilities. Police sources said at least two members of each of the eight Maoist squads operating in the AOB area are down with Covid-19. This has put a temporary break on their movement. With the Greyhounds too affected, combing operations have been scaled down, sources said. At present the AOB area is left with just 140-odd Maoists. Most hail from Chhattisgarh as there are no new recruits from AP in the last five years. Sources said as many as 25 Greyhounds commandos are down with Covid-19, though with mild symptoms. Also, an officer of Greyhounds had lost his wife to Covid-19 after the couple returned from the Kumbh Mela. “Most of the Covid-19 cases among the commandos are asymptomatic. Their immunity is high due to their physical fitness and highly nutritious diet. However, they are suffering from fever,” a senior official of Greyhounds told TOI on the condition of anonymity. The entire force has been covered by two doses of vaccination. The official said all the commandos, who have tested positive for Covid-19, are recovering. The Greyhounds base is equipped with medical facilities and expert doctors. Greyhounds force was raised in 1989 and it had around 2,000 commandos in undivided AP. But after bifurcation of the state, around 1,000 commandos were allotted to the AP. Of them, more than 600 commandos are based in Visakhapatnam for the anti-Naxal operations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/ap-greyhounds-in-covid-crosshairs/articleshow/82592181.cms||Siva G
---||Allahabad||EC, higher courts & government failed to see risk of holding polls: Allahabad high court||PRAYAGRAJ: Citing the inroads made by Covid into UP villages untouched by the first wave, the Allahabad high court has observed that the Election Commission, higher courts and the government "failed to fathom the disastrous consequences" of permitting elections in a few states and panchayat polls in UP amid the pandemic. The single-judge bench of Justice Siddharth said the state government, which was already having a tough time controlling the spread of the virus in urban areas, would possibly find it extremely difficult to carry out tests, detect infections and treat the population in the villages. "The state lacks preparation and resources for the same at present," Justice Siddharth said on Monday while granting anticipatory bail to one Prateek Jain of Ghaziabad in a cheating case on grounds of the spread of Covid-19 being a threat to the person's life. Apprehension of death on account of reasons like the present pandemic of novel coronavirus can certainly be held to be a ground for grant of anticipatory bail to an accused," the court ruled, mentioning that a large number of FIRs had been lodged in the villages amid the recent panchayat elections in UP. "Even otherwise, the crime rate in villages is high in the state," it said. "Keeping in view the overall situation of the villages after the panchayat elections, a large number of accused may be infected (by the virus) and this may not have been detected." The court said that "if an accused dies on account of the reasons beyond his control when he could have been protected from death by the court, the grant or refusal of anticipatory bail to him would be an exercise in futility". According to Justice Siddharth, there were several ways in which an arrested person could contract the virus, including from fellow jail inmates, the police and court personnel. "There is no proper testing, treatment and care of the people confined in jails," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/election-commission-higher-courts-government-failed-to-see-risk-of-holding-polls-allahabad-high-court/articleshow/82593281.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey

The statement also said a new set of curbs have been imposed in addition to the existing ones. The new curbs will become effective from the morning of May 16. The new curbs mandate that planned marriage ceremonies between this period will have to be hosted at homes or at courts. A maximum of 11 people can attend the wedding and any other arrangements will remain banned. “Every person arriving into the state will have to remain in home or institutional quarantine for a week. However, this will not be applicable for those who will leave the state within 72 hours of their arrival,” the statement read. Besides mandatory quarantine, the government also banned the movement of inter and intra state bus services. “Private vehicles will require e-pass for the same,” the statement read. Social distancing norms will be strictly enforced in vegetable markets and weekly haats, the statement read. Notably, several lawmakers of the state had been demanding a complete lockdown for a week to lower the infectivity rate in Jharkhand, which is grappling with shortages of infrastructure, human resources and equipment to tackle the growing number of Covid-19 cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/cov-curbs-extended-till-may-27-in-state/articleshow/82599081.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Incidentally, May 12 was observed as International Nurses Day. The police have arrested Amar Pandey and one of his companions for the incident. Deputy development commissioner Shekhar Jamuar, who reached the hospital around 5:45am along with sadar subdivisional officer Rajesh Kumar Jha, said: “The patient was very critical and was admitted to the GNM building on Tuesday. He was on ventilator support and passed away in the early hours of Wednesday. The kin of the patient accused the on-duty doctors and nurses of being lax about the patient’s treatment and created a ruckus.” Palamu civil surgeon Dr Anil Kumar Srivastava said Pandey and his associates wielded logs and chased the nurses. “Intimated and fearing for their lives, the nurses took cover in a room and locked it from the inside as the kin of the deceased were hurling abuses and threatening the nurses of dire consequences.” While none of the nurses was hurt, the attendants smashed window panes with the logs. This was the third such incident during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic at the MMCH, the hospital management said. Although the administration had deployed eight policemen to prevent such incidents, only two of them were present at the GNM building at the time of the incident while the rest had allegedly gone to use the hospital washrooms. “Two men have been arrested for creating a ruckus at the Covid centre at MMCH. On-duty cops have been directed to deal with such cases with a heavy hand so that other patients and their kin are not inconvenienced,” Palamu SP Sanjeev Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/nurses-heckled-chased-by-kin-of-deceased-cov-patient/articleshow/82584378.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Raj Kumar Singh, one of the tenants of the deceased woman, his wife Aparna Banerjee and their friend Ravi have been arrested on charges of murder and dacoity under Section 396 of the Indian Penal Code. Dhanbad SSP Aseem Vikarant Minz said the cops found a blood-stained vest of Singh and chunni of Aparna from their washroom. The couple, who were trying to mislead the police by claiming to have seen some bike-borne criminals outside the house in black robes, could not explain the origin of the blood stains on the clothes. The police have also recovered the ATM card of Sinha from the house of Ravi, a resident of Matkuria in Dhanbad, along with some cash. Ravi have confessed to the crime. The police were also investigating the role of a fourth person, a friend of Ravi, who allegedly kept a watch at the main gate of the house. The mobile location of Rajkumar and Ravi was traced to Kusum Vihar on the night of the crime. Rajkumar had earlier claimed that he was on night duty in Bankmore. Police said that the couple had a tiff with Sinha after she banned the entry of outsiders into the house after 9pm. The SSP said, “The unprofessional manner in which the hand of the elderly woman was tied and the timing of the murder created suspicion in our minds about the couple right from the beginning.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/dhanbad-police-arrest-3-for-murder-of-elderly-woman/articleshow/82585960.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

For, nine days of ventilator support was withdrawn on Wednesday as his condition improved — a deserving birthday gift for a fighter. Devre, admitted in SMIMER hospital, was in a critical condition with 75 percent infected lungs. He fought on for 21 days till his condition started to gradually improve.While his family members also watched the celebration from outside the ward, the team of doctors, nurses and health workers celebrated the retired auto driver’s birthday in the ICU by decorating his bed and a ceremonious cake cutting. Devre had tested positive on April 22 and after three days he was admitted in SMIMER as his condition deteriorated. After nine days his condition worsened and he was put on a ventilator in the ICU. “With 75 percent lungs damaged his condition was critical when he was shifted to the ICU. We gave him a complete course of Remdesivir injection, plasma, steroid and other treatments to treat him,” said Dr Vipul Trivedi, a surgeon at SMIMER. Gradually Devre’s health improved and the man gave himself the best birthday gift — removal of the ventilator. “He is now stable with normal oxygen support. We are still keeping him under watch but it was like rebirth for him hence we celebrated his birthday,” Trivedi told TOI. According to the doctors in Covid ICU, the birthday celebration proved an encouragement for everybody in the hospital — patients, doctors and healthcare workers. “Everybody felt motivated that a critical patient has improved,” said a doctor.  “My father waved at us from his bed and he was looking good,” said an emotionally surcharged son, Bhavesh, who thanked the hospital staff for the celebration and care.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/rebirth-on-his-61st-birthday-for-this-coronavirus-slayer/articleshow/82583072.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

Locals apprehended the accused, Shivcharan Soren, and handed him over to police. Ghatshila subdivisional police officer Kuldip Toppo said Soren was drunk when he was caught by the locals. A native of Chandil, Soren has been living in Ghatshila since 2004. The deceased’s corpse was taken to Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Medical College and Hospital in Jamshedpur for autopsy and Soren was forwarded to jail on Wednesday. “The accused had consumed liquor while returning home. When he reached the local anganwadi centre at Puranadihtola around 9pm, he saw the girl. He dragged the minor behind the building of the anganwadi centre and raped her,” the cops said. Soren reportedly confessed that he had put a coarse towel on the mouth of the girl to prevent her from raising an alarm. Thereafter, she fell unconscious and Soren strangled her to death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/minor-raped-strangled-by-40-yr-old-man-in-ghatshila/articleshow/82585932.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ranchi||Hemant seeks help of MPs to run vax drive||Ranchi: MPs and MLAs from the North Chotanagpur division of the state on Wednesday suggested chief minister Hemant Soren that his government should set up oxygen-supported beds at block and community hospitals and health centres to cater to the growing Covid-19 cases in the rural belt. Giridih MP Chandra Prakash Choudhary, Koderma MP Annapurna Devi, Hazaribag MLA Manish Jaiswal, Gandey MLA Sarfaraz Ahmed and Bagodar MLA Vinod Kumar Singh suggested that block-level hospitals be equipped with oxygen-supported beds so that Covid-19 patients living in rural areas do not loose precious time in travelling to cities in search of beds and hospitals. Hazaribag MP Jayant Sinha suggested that the government must set up a medical council comprising doctors and public health experts to offer inputs to the government in the future course of Covid-19 management. “There is inaccuracy in data in Jharkhand’s Covid-19 dashboard, which needs to be fixed. The government must also organize daily press conferences like the Centre to disseminate timely information to the public and dispel the apprehensions,” Sinha said. Dhanwar MLA Babulal Marandi, Koderma MLA Neera Yadav, Chandankyari MLA Amar Kumar Bauri and Bermo MLA Kumar Jaimangal flagged the shortage of doctors, nurses and paramedical staff in sadar hospitals, block hospitals and community health centres. “There is an acute shortage of doctors and nurses. The government must explore ways to press medicos, trainee nurses and retired doctors into the service,” Marandi said. Bauri suggested that the government equip the charitable hospitals to treat Covid-19 patients. Bagodar MLA Vinod Kumar Singh suggested that the Covid-19 treatment in government and private hospitals be brought under the ambit of Ayushman Bharat — Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana. Alleging that private hospitals are charging exorbitantly, Dhanbad MP P N Singh urged the government to fund the treatment of poor patients in private facilities. Jharia MLA Purnima Neeraj Singh alleged that doctors are leaving Covid-19 patients unattended for hours at end, which is leading to the deterioration of their health. Soren, who spoke at last, claimed that his government is already on course to deploy medicos and trainee nurses in the hospitals to tackle the pandemic. Briefing the lawmakers about the steps being taken, Soren also sought the intervention of MPs in procuring 7 lakh doses of Covishield to administer the second doses to the beneficiaries above 45 years of age.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/hemant-seeks-help-of-mps-to-run-vax-drive/articleshow/82584309.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Ranchi||‘Rising fuel prices to hit economy’||Ranchi: Trade and business bodies on Wednesday said rising fuel prices are likely to hit various economic activities in Jharkhand in the coming days. It may be noted that petrol was sold at Rs 89.17 per litre while diesel was priced at Rs 87.26 for one litre on Wednesday. President of Federation of Jharkhand Chambers of Commerce and Industries Pravin Jain Chhabra said, “The rise in fuel prices has directly impacted the cost of transportation of goods, which is eventually being paid by the consumers.” He said that there are many industries, particularly the mining sector, where excavating machines, drillers, conveyors use fuel as a major input, will face major challenges as their operation will become costlier. “Other industries using fuel to run generator sets for their industrial undertakings will have to bear with higher energy cost,” he said. Kishore Mantri of the Bus Owners’ Association said the restrictions along with rising fuel prices have hampered their business. He said, “Firstly, the number of passengers was low and on top of that, rising fuel prices are adding to the cost of operation. Fuel forms at least 60% of our operating cost.” Meanwhile, petrol pump owners said that while their sales had fallen after the government started imposing restrictions on economic activities to control Covid, the rising price of fuel has further affected their business. Arvind Chadda, a petrol pump owner, said, “In the present circumstance, only those in urgent need are moving out of their homes. This has pulled down our sales. The rising fuel prices will certainly pinch the pocket of the common man.” Another petroleum dealer said that while sales have come down drastically, their fixed cost remains the same.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/rising-fuel-prices-to-hit-economy/articleshow/82585817.cms||Sanjay Sahay

The facility was kicked off on Wednesday. The facility that has come up in the Covid-19 war room of the civic body at Badamdibaug will monitor oxygen supply right from the place where it is picked up from to the place where it is delivered. Apart from monitoring the quantity of oxygen supplied to each hospital, it will also monitor usage to ensure there is no wastage or excess storage. “Knowing the occupancy of beds in the hospitals, we will also be able to work out the average requirement of oxygen there. This will take care of any imbalance in supply,” said officer on special duty for Covid-19 Vinod Rao. Rao added that the system will ensure that no hospital gets access oxygen and no hospital struggles for it. “Besides sufficient supply, efficient distribution is also important,” he added. Soon, the vehicles carrying oxygen will have GPS tracking devices and will be tracked in the war room.

---||Ranchi||Health dept asks pvt hosps to install oxygen plants within next 45 days||Ranchi: The state health department on Wednesday directed the deputy commissioners to ensure that all the private hospitals with a capacity of 50 beds or more in their respective districts set up Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) oxygen generation plants within the next 45 days. In his letter, the department’s additional chief secretary, Arun Kumar Singh, said that the department in consultation with the oxygen task force strongly recommends that all Covid-19 private hospitals, which are dependent on oxygen cylinders and refilling, should set up PSA oxygen generation plants. “Even if a hospital is getting its oxygen supply from cylinders, there may be issues in getting that supply on time due to a technical fault or transport-related problems, which may lead to a disaster and the hospital authorities will be held responsible in that case,” the letter read. The PSA oxygen generation plants are known to separate medical grade oxygen from the atmospheric gas and are available in various capacities. The government in its letter has asked the private hospitals to assess their respective peak requirements, based on which they should decide on the capacity of the plant. According to the private healthcare providers, most of the major private hospitals in Jharkhand have PSA plants, though some of them might have to augment the plant’s capacity as per the government’s new directive. Association of Private Healthcare Providers’ president (Jharkhand unit) Jogesh Gambhir said, “It is a good and an economically viable idea to install PSA plants, however, assessing the peak requirement during the current Covid crisis will be tricky. During normal days, 20% of the beds are oxygen-supported and the peak requirement is calculated accordingly, but at this moment no hospital can decide what could be the peak requirement.” He cited the example of the city-based Raj hospital and said, “When the hospital was established eight years ago, it started operating with a 32lt capacity oxygen plant, which was later doubled, and during the first wave of pandemic, a third plant of over 100 lt capacity was added. But now, even after installing around 160lt plant during the ongoing second wave, the hospital had to arrange over 300 oxygen cylinders on a few occasions.” The private hospitals have asked the government to provide a subsidy or tax rebate on the installation so that they can go for the capacity augmentation. “Installation of PSA oxygen plant is always economically viable but it may not be convenient for all establishments to cough up such a huge amount at one go,” Gambhir said. According to some estimates, the cost installing a PSA plant starts from Rs 25 lakh and goes up accordingly with the capacity. One of the major concerns of the hospital owners is the associated recurring cost in terms of power consumption. “Bigger the plant, greater is the power consumption and if a huge PSA plant is commissioned, it may not remain viable for operation for a long period of time,” one of the medical directors of a private establishment said, adding that they are going to consider capacity enhancement as per viability.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/health-dept-asks-pvt-hosps-to-install-oxygen-plants-within-next-45-days/articleshow/82584501.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

Topno was among the crowd of men from Ramyatola who were chasing away a herd of wild elephants which had entered the hamlet on Monday night. Although the men managed to drive the herd away from the hamlet to the borders of the neighbouring Bamni and Kurnul villages, one of the elephants sprang out from behind a bush and caught Topno with its trunk. The elephant, a young tusker, slammed Topno to the ground and took him behind the bushes and attacked him with its tusks. Topno died on the spot. The herd then moved away to the forests near Torpa-Gidum areas. While cops retrieved Topno’s corpse on Monday night, it was sent to Gumla sadar hospital for an autopsy on Tuesday morning. Anthony Lakra, the local forest official, said the deceased’s father was paid Rs 25,000 as immediate compensation while Rs 3.75 lakh will be paid in the coming weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/elephant-kills-man-kin-paid-25k-as-relief/articleshow/82586045.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Nagpur||Govt allows pvt hospital’s oxygen plant for 2 yrs on playground||Nagpur: The state government has given permission to Viveka Hospital to construct an oxygen plant in part of the playground at Naik Layout in South-West Nagpur. The residents have said that the playground should be restored for use by people after the end of Covid-19 pandemic.The state’s urban development department in a letter dated May 10 to Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) chairman gave permission for an medical oxygen gas plant for the hospital in 10,000 sq ft area of the playground for a period of two years. “Land is reserved for primary school and owned by NIT. Considering existing pandemic, amendment is being approved in NIT Land Disposal Act as a special case,” the department said.Director of Viveka Hospital Satish Lade told TOI, “Hospital operated 59 beds for Covid patients in second wave as against 39 beds in first wave. Hospital has oxygen pipeline and all necessary arrangements within the building. We could not establish plant due to lack of space. We were depended upon 200 jumbo cylinders. We faced serious problems due to lack of oxygen plant.”Lade added, “The government has made it mandatory for hospitals with 50 or more beds to have an independent oxygen plant. Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on May 5 directed the authorities to provide government land on lease on temporary basis to private hospitals for oxygen plant. Accordingly, we submitted application to NIT seeking permission to erect plant on the land adjacent to the hospital. We will be paying lease to NIT.”Nearby resident Ajay Kadu said, “We realize the importance of oxygen plant for a private hospital in current Covid situation. People used to play volleyball on the place where work on oxygen plant is underway. We hope NIT and government will not give the playground on permanent basis to the hospital. Also, we request authorities to ensure restoration of the playground for the people at the end of the pandemic.”The hospital is yet to get lease of the land as formalities of paying lease from the hospital and agreement are pending.Lade said, “We are preparing the plant as government has already projected chances of third wave. Uninterrupted supply of oxygen will help give better service to the people in the pandemic. Also, our jumbo cylinders and related infrastructure will be helpful for other hospitals, which do not have the plant.”Kadu said, “The hospital is situated in residential area. People are cooperating in various manners. The hospital should take it as its responsibility to give preference to nearby residents when it comes to providing bed or emergency treatment.”Corporator Pramod Tabhane said, “There is no issue if the hospital takes proper permissions and uses the land in pandemic.”Many hospitals in the city faced problems of oxygen shortage due to lack of plant. A couple of hospitals had to discharge patients for lack of oxygen, causing serious inconvenience to patients. Viveka Hospital is probably the first to seek permission and also receive nod for using NIT’s land for oxygen plant.Even Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has delayed opening of its hospitals for construction of oxygen plant considering shortage of jumbo cylinders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/govt-allows-pvt-hospitals-oxygen-plant-for-2-yrs-on-playground/articleshow/82587881.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Allahabad||Allahabad high court for Rs 1 crore aid to poll staff who died of Covid||PRAYAGRAJ: The Allahabad high court on Tuesday directed the Uttar Pradesh government to constitute a three-member Pandemic Public Grievance Committee (PPGC) within 48 hours in every district to look into the grievances of the public on difficulties faced in Covid treatment in the state. The committee should comprise a chief judicial magistrate (CJM) or a judicial officer, professor of a medical college and an administrative officer of the rank of ADM, the court said. The court further directed that complaints be made directly to the sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) of tehsil concerned in rural areas, who will apprise the PPGC. Earlier, the state government counsel had informed that the government had announced a compensation of Rs 30 lakh to those who died of Covid infection during the course of panchayat election duty, on which the court asked the state government to rethink about the compensation amount and increase it to Rs 1 crore. The court observed, “It is not a case that somebody volunteered to render his/her services during election. It was made obligatory to those assigned with election duty to perform their duties during election even while they showed their reluctance.” A division bench comprising Justice Siddhartha Varma and Justice Ajit Kumar said that the recent surge of the Covid-19 pandemic in the state is spreading in remote rural areas and smaller cities and towns of almost all the districts of Uttar Pradesh. “It would be in the fitness of the things that purchase of vaccines is not only expedited but vaccination programmes are launched at a war-footing. Even in our last order we had made it clear that unless and until everyone was vaccinated, nobody was safe. We hope and trust that the state government would try to purchase as many vials of desired vaccines as possible to vaccinate the maximum number and at least more than 2/3 of the population in 2-3 months’ time,” the court observed. Not satisfied with the affidavit filed by secretary (home) Badugu Deva Paulson, the court said that neither the required information as mandated by its earlier order was provided nor various directions passed by it earlier were complied. The court was unhappy with the affidavit as no information on number of ambulances, details of meal provided to patients at government hospitals were stated. The court directed the government counsel to apprise it as to how the state is managing Covid hospitals, oxygen, beds and life-saving drugs in Bahraich, Barabanki, Bijnor, Jaunpur and Shravasti.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/allahabad-high-court-for-rs-1-crore-aid-to-poll-staff-felled-by-covid/articleshow/82593305.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey

The Indian Coast Guard has asked all fishing boats and trawlers to return to the nearest shore while also asking other maritime traffic to take necessary precautions. The coast guard has put all its vessels and maritime surveillance aircraft on standby for search and rescue (SAR) operations. “As a preventive measure, the coast guard is maintaining ships at standby notice to meet any eventualities. The surveillance aircraft are geared up for augmenting SAR efforts,” said a coast guard official. A low pressure area is very likely to form over Southeast Arabian Sea around May 14 and is very likely to concentrate into a depression over Lakshadweep area and adjoining Southeast and Eastcentral Arabian Sea by May 15. It is very likely to move north-northwestwards and intensify further into a cyclonic storm around May 16, the Indian Metereological Department (IMD) has stated. “Ships at sea have been asked to relay the weather advisory to the fishermen at sea. If need be fishing boats are to be shepherded to nearest harbours,” said the coast guard. The weather advisory has been shared with all stakeholders, including the directorate of fisheries. The department has advised all fishing boats out at sea to return. Port authorities are also advised for safe operation of coastal vessels and multi-purpose supply vessels. The electronic surveillance has also been stepped up from ICG Remote Operating Station and VHF alerts are being sent out. IMD has forecast squally winds of speed 40-50kmph gusting to 60kmph along and off the coast of Goa from May 15 onwards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cyclone-looms-coast-guard-keeps-ships-aircraft-ready/articleshow/82588097.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The male accused in the case are currently lodged in Taloja jail in neighbouring Navi Mumbai, while the women undertrials are in Byculla prison in central Mumbai. The letter said that the activists were suffering from multiple health issues and that one of them, Jyoti Jagtap, has tested positive for Covid-19. Due to the pandemic, there has also been adisruption of usual communication channels, it said. "The Supreme Court has empowered the state governments to form high-powered committees, which could then decide upon the release of prisoners in each state. We urge you to recommend to the committee to release the undertrials on interim bail at least," the letter said. "We are all worried about their safety in these desperate circumstances, where everyone is at risk. Thus, we sincerely appeal to you to take timely and necessary measures for the release of our family members," it added.

They are simultaneously looking at a permanent solution. “After the order was revoked, we have made a request for a new complex. The Kala Academy is currently under renovation, so we need to move into a new premises soon. It is very difficult to move around at the Kala Academy. Currently, everything is blocked except the office block, so we cannot do anything on the ground,” the college principal, Ramrao Wagh, said. The college hopes it is granted approval to move to the Adil Shah Palace. They have also requested to be allotted either the commercial tax building or the high court building since these offices are moving to new buildings. “Immediately however, the college might move to the Adil Shah Palace as a temporary measure,” Wagh said. “But we need a permanent space to run classes.” The college initially had its heart set on the old PWD building owing to its pristine lawns and scenic setting overlooking the river Mandovi. Beautification works of the heritage building had also been taken up, only for the college to later be denied permission to shift there. The old PWD building has been retained by the office of the Smart City in Panaji. “We made a visit to the Adil Shah Palace and though beautiful, it is not suitable for a college. Our students have play rehearsals and dance classes. We cannot run classes from a building that has wooden flooring,” Wagh said.

Maharashtra State Council of Educational Research and Training (MSCERT) conducted the online survey in which around 13,000 schools from across the state responded. The survey revealed that apart from WhatsApp, schools conducted evaluation through home visits, offline tests and other online testing platforms. A whopping 95% of the respondent schools said WhatsApp was one of their evaluation platforms. Schools would send either an image or PDF of the assignment on their WhatsApp group, students would solve the same in their notebooks, click a photo and send it back in the same group. The other testing platforms were used by less than 76% of the schools. With reputed online testing formats not easily accessible for majority of students and schools, it was no surprise that WhatsApp emerged as the preferred tool. An education official said, “We wanted to get an idea on how schools adapted to the online teaching and evaluation challenge. Many schools did conduct offline tests because schools had reopened in Maharashtra from November onwards, but that was not mandatory. We have so many students, who are not at all financially sound, enrolled in Marathi and Hindi medium schools, hence can’t afford laptops and webcams. Smartphones of either the parents or neighbours are used for online teaching.” The definition of ‘online teaching’ varies from school to school. Affluent institutions conduct it through web meet type of platforms and the screen becomes a virtual classroom with live video and audio interaction. A senior principal of a Marathi medium school said, “Money makes everything possible and those kids have access to the best technology available. The big brand schools simply tell their students what technology, software etc is required and parents get it. But we have to adapt to whatever is available with our children.” In places like Gadchiroli, zilla parishad schoolteachers would visit homes of students to not only teach but also conduct evaluation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/whatsapp-most-popular-mode-of-school-evaluation-survey/articleshow/82588153.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

The city had received 4,500 doses of Covaxin for the 18-44 vaccinations Tuesday. Officials said the stock had been exhausted. The city’s Covishield stock for this age group is also over. After a mop-up at public health centres, a total of 800 doses of Covishield were gathered and these will be administered to people at eight sites on Thursday. These would be the last sessions at government sites for this age category till a fresh batch of vaccines arrives, officials said. People in the 18-44 age group were being inoculated at 37 government session sites and two private centres — Max and Fortis hospitals. While Max has Covishield, Fortis has Covaxin doses, according to an official in the health department. Both hospitals together have been inoculating 600-700 people daily. “We are hopeful of getting vaccines by this weekend and we can set up session sites after we get the doses,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram. Earlier, vaccination camps had been set up at offices, malls and residential societies. But with the supply becoming irregular, such programmes have been stopped Since May 1, only 41,342 people have been vaccinated in the 18-44 age group. Gurugram has a target of inoculating 10 lakh people in this category. On Wednesday, 4,046 people between 18 and 44 years were vaccinated. Apart from them, 5,645 people in the 45+ age group got the jabs at 41 session sites. With only two private centres inoculating people, residents are finding it difficult to book a slot for themselves. “After trying several times, I got a slot at a public health centre near Pataudi. But it is far away and I am not comfortable travelling that much given the current situation,” said Sushmita Saha, a resident of Sector 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/govt-sites-out-of-covaxin-doses-for-18-44-age-group/articleshow/82588296.cms||Ipsita Pati

Speaking to TOI, special public prosecutor Francisco Tavora said that pronouncement of the verdict has been deferred as the court is understaffed due to the new SOP issued to courts in view of the rise in Covid cases. He also said that the court is operating with 15% staff. On November 7 and 8, 2013, Tejpal allegedly sexually assaulted a woman at an event organised by Tehelka at a starred hotel in North Goa. On November 22, Goa Police lodged a suo motu FIR against Tejpal. He turned up in Goa on November 28, 2013 and was arrested on November 30 after his anticipatory bail plea was rejected. He was granted interim bail on May 19, 2014 to attend the cremation of his mother and since then, had been out of jail. In July 2014, Tejpal was granted bail. In September 2017, a Mapusa court framed charges against Tejpal for allegedly raping a junior colleague in November 2013. Tejpal had pleaded not guilty, paving the way for a trial.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/court-defers-tejpal-verdict-to-may-19/articleshow/82588359.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||Water levels in Selaulim, Anjunem reservoirs dip||PANAJI: With the summer at its peak, water levels at two of Goa’s largest reservoirs - Selaulim and Anjunem - have dropped to 34% and 24%, respectively. These levels, though slightly lower than those recorded last year during the same period, are considered sufficient to help Goa sail through the summer, until the arrival of the monsoons in the state. The Selaulim reservoir provides raw water for treatment and to meet the drinking water needs of most of South Goa. The Anjunem dam, meanwhile, helps meet the drinking water requirements in Sattari taluka as well as parts of Bicholim. The water level in the Amthane reservoir at Bicholim currently stands at 77%. Water from rivers is pumped into the reservoir during the summer by the water resources department (WRD) to up the levels. Goa has also received copious rainfall during the last monsoon, which has ensured sufficient raw water storage for the summer months. Similarly, the Tillari reservoir in Maharashtra is 53% full. Water from the dam is supplied to the Assonora water treatment plant which treats the water and provides it to meet the water needs of the populous Bardez taluka. The water level at the Chapoli dam in Canacona taluka stands at 53%. Two other minor reservoirs at Gaunem and Panchwadi are 53% and 26% full, respectively. Besides the reservoirs, the WRD has reserve water in 337 bandharas on rivers across Goa, which are tapped during the months of April and May. Goa faced one of its worst drinking water shortages in the summer of 2019, with levels in rivers dipping to critical levels.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/water-levels-in-selaulim-anjunem-reservoirs-dip/articleshow/82588563.cms||---

After examining the papers and questioning those who are named in the suicide note we can find out that how much money was due,” said an officer of the Adajan police station. His family members told police that Patel was facing a crisis in business due to the global pandemic.

---||India||Don’t brand B.1.617 Indian variant: Government||NEW DELHI: The Centre quoted a World Health Organisation statement to say that it will be incorrect to refer to the B.1.617 Covid mutant as an “Indian variant” as it would be unscientific and inaccurate to do so. “WHO does not identify viruses or variants with names of countries they are first reported from. We refer to them by their scientific names and request all to do the same for consistency,” the WHO south east Asia regional organisation said in a tweet. This came in the wake of B.1.617 —which has recently been classified as ‘variant of concern’ by the global health organisation – being referred to in media reports as the ‘Indian Variant’ since it was first detected in Maharashtra in India. A senior health ministry official said, “It is not just scientifically incorrect but also unfair to associate the virus with India in specific because we are just the first one to detect it through genome sequencing and alerted the global community about our findings. Based on our report, many other countries also detected prevalence of the variant,” an official said. “WHO has not associated the term “Indian Variant” with the B.1.617 variant of the coronavirus in its document. In fact, the word “Indian” has not been used in its report on the matter,” the health ministry said referring to WHO’s report identifying B.1.617 as a variant of concern. The WHO said B.1.617 variant of Covid-19 - first found in India in October and seen as a likely cause of the rapid spread of the infection — had been detected in sequences uploaded to the GISAID openaccess database “from 44 countries in all six regions”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/dont-brand-b-1-617-indian-variant-government/articleshow/82593376.cms||---
---||Goa||Four new water holes built in Keri forest||KERI: As a solution to the increasing human-animal conflicts reported in the forested areas of Keri, forest officials have decided to construct four new artificial water holes. On studying the reasons for the increasing cases of human-wild animal conflict in the forested areas of Keri, which falls outside the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary, officials realised that a prime reason was wild animals wandering out to quench their thirst. As summer peaks, wild animals increasingly step out of their natural habitat searching for drinking water. Forest officials of the Keri range realised that this issue needs to be addressed so that these animals do not venture near human settlements. Range forest officer Vivek Gaonkar said that work on three water holes has already been completed while the fourth one is in progress. “The water hole created at the foothill of Morlegad has been attracting wild animals like bisons, sambars and even leopards, which has been confirmed through camera traps. The water hole in Ponsuli has proved helpful for herbivores as well as carnivorous animals,” he said. Water holes are an important habitat component for wild animals. They provide drinking water for many species while also serving as a breeding habitat for many amphibians. They are significant for the local ecosystem and become a focal point of wildlife movements. “There was an urgent need to create water holes in Keri, as the forested areas that are out of the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary were facing acute drinking water shortage. Creation of the water hole at the foot hill of Morlegad will now help in minimising human wildlife conflicts and also prevent wild animals from entering into the main canals of the Anjunem dam. These artificially water holes not only attract big wild animals but also a number of birds,” Gajanan Shetye, a wildlifer from Keri Sattari said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/four-new-water-holes-built-in-keri-forest/articleshow/82588798.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Recoveries surpass fresh Covid cases for 12th day in a row||LUCKNOW: Following sustained decline in cases and surge in recoveries, the overall recovery rate in UP climbed to 85% against 73% in the last week of April. As many as 18,125 new cases and 26,712 recoveries were recorded in the past 24 hours. The pattern has also brought the number of active cases in the state to 2.06 lakh — over a lakh cases less than the peak of 3.10 lakh reported on April 30. Meanwhile, UP’s overall Covid-19 tally crossed the 15.5 lakh mark with the addition of new cases. “For almost 12th day in a row now, recoveries have outnumbered the new cases and this is reflected in the state’s recovery rate now. Against a recovery rate of about 73% in the last week of April, the rate now stands at about 85%,” said additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad. A look at the official bulletin indicated that the pandemic activity seems to have shifted to the western UP. While Meerut topped the list of new cases with 1,232 new cases, Gautam Budh Nagar (992), Muzaffarnagar (755), Ghaziabad (743), Moradabad (557) and Saharanpur (330) added nearly 4,600 cases which is about 25% of the total burden of new cases. Health officials expressed concern over the sustained loss of life of people to the pandemic. In the past 24 hours, 309 deaths were reported in the state. This translates into a loss of over 12 lives every hour. With this the total casualties reached 16369. Kanpur Nagar (26), Lucknow (23), Jhansi (17), Moradabad (14), Meerut (11) and Gautam Budh Nagar (11) were the top contributors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/uttar-pradesh-recoveries-surpass-fresh-covid-cases-for-12th-day-in-a-row/articleshow/82593385.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Chennai||Chandra, a fighter forever||Chennai: Life is like a table tennis game. It’s about finding the right balance between deft touches and powerful smashes," former national champion Venugopal Chandrasekhar once told TOI during a conversation. It summed up his life — a fighter on and off court — battling till the last point. On Wednesday though, the 63-year-old’s will-power was not enough to fight off Covid — the ace player and coach fell to the pandemic that has wreaked havoc. Chandra is survived by his wife Mala and son Sanjay.Cricket was Chandra’s first love but a head injury while fielding at the slips made him take up table tennis. At 12, Chandra enrolled in the now-defunct Emesor Sports Club in Adyar and his rise in the sport was swift. In 1970, Chandra became the Tamil Nadu sub-junior champion. Three years later, he not only became the state junior champion but also made the quarters of the Nationals.The coming years would see Chandra’s aggressive style of play and never-say-die attitude fetching him three National titles. Despite his prowess on the TT table, Chandra was always serious about his studies. "I was able to balance both TT and academics. For me, it was always a case of doing well in whatever I was taking up," Chandra had said. He was a gold medallist in BA economics and law from Madras University.Former national champion Kamlesh Mehta, who has had many memorable battles with Chandra on the table, hailed him as a fighter to the core. "Chandra had an aura about him. Nothing would faze him and he would keep fighting right till the end. He was such a difficult opponent to play against and one could never relax for a moment," recalls the eight-time national champion. Kamlesh had gone down to Chandra in the 1982 Nationals final. However, Kamlesh had his revenge a year later when he overpowered Chandra for his maiden national crown.Apart from his fighting qualities on the court, another facet of Chandra that impressed Kamlesh was his constant urge to add new shots to his game. "The top-spin was a shot that Chandra employed in his game and it became quite popular in the 1980s. He had mastered the shot at Ichiro Ogimura’s academy in Japan and soon every other player began to learn the nuances of it," says Kamlesh.Despite being at the peak of his powers, Chandra’s playing career was cut short due to a botched-up surgery in 1984. Chandra underwent a knee operation at a leading hospital in Chennai which left him partially blind and disabled. A setback of that magnitude would’ve left anyone demoralised — but not Chandra. He fought a protracted legal battle with the hospital and won about `17 lakh compensation after almost a decade. That didn’t help him revive his playing career, but Chandra didn’t lose his passion for the sport — he moved into coaching.Chandra’s ability to spot and groom talent saw him train a number of champions in his own coaching centre. Players such as G Sathiyan, Chetan Baboor, S Raman, M S Mythili, N R Indu and Preyesh Suresh Raj are some of the prominent names who have benefitted from Chandra’s expertise.It was on Chandra’s insistence that a young Sathiyan joined his academy at the age of five in 1998. "Chandra sir shaped my game from 1998 to 2012. My parents had gone to his academy to train my elder sisters. But he persisted that I should also join. His death is a personal loss for me and my mind is blank at this point of time," says Sathiyan, who qualified for the Tokyo Olympics recently.With the lockdown in Chennai in full swing, most of his students couldn’t pay their last respects to their beloved mentor. "But I know Chandra will always stay in their hearts — the honest, hard-working competitor who never took a step backward," says Kamlesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chandra-a-fighter-forever/articleshow/82593401.cms||Prasad RS
---||Bhopal||MP ranks 7th on list of vac tally, only 10% given a Covid jab so far||BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh is on the 7th position in the country when it comes to vaccination against Covid-19 based on the total number of doses administered. But the state is still way behind states like Gujarat, Rajasthan, Karnataka, which have less population than MP. Around 10% of the total population has been administered with either dose of vaccine and only 15 lakh have been administered with the second dose. As per the information available on Cowin portal, till May 12 afternoon a total of around 88.66 lakh vaccine doses were administered in Madhya Pradesh, while in both Rajasthan and Gujarat 1.47 crore doses were administered. Highest 1.89 crore doses were administered in Maharashtra. Around 1.23 crore doses were administered in West Bengal and 1.10 crore doses were administered in Karnataka. Similarly, 1.41 crore doses were administered in Uttar Pradesh. States likes Gujarat, Rajasthan, Karnataka have lesser population than Madhya Pradesh, but they are far ahead of MP in terms of vaccination, said our sources. Vaccination of people belonging to 45 plus age group started in the state on March 1 and till March 25 a total of around 18.3 lakh people of this category were vaccinated, said sources. Till now, a total around 15 lakh people have been administered with second dose of vaccine this includes around 5 lakh frontline workers and health workers. Thus as per the norms more than 15 lakh of the population above 45 should have been vaccinated till now, but instead only around 10 lakh have been vaccinated, said sources. Sources attribute this to the sudden surge in Covid cases in April, as majority of the people who were eligible for second dose were to be administered vaccine in April itself. The surge sparked fear, and as vaccination was done at hospitals, people avoided it, thus the vaccination centres have now been made outside the hospitals. Availability of vaccine is also an issue, but since vaccines for people above 45 years is being provided by union government and is not to be procured by state government directly, it is not affected much, said sources. But the sources also added that MP is getting less vaccines compared to other states like Gujarat, Rajasthan and Karnataka, which obviously leads to lesser inoculation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/mp-ranks-7th-on-list-of-vac-tally-only-10-given-a-covid-jab-so-far/articleshow/82593405.cms||Amarjeet Singh

Though Eid, one of the most important Muslim festivals, is just a few days away (May 13 or 14), there is no buzz around festivities even as community leaders and volunteers are engaged in reaching out to people with oxygen cylinders, medicines, hospital beds and Eid ration. “Eid doesn’t mean flaunting clothes and fine cuisine. It is a festival to share joy but since we are reeling under the assault of a pandemic, this Eid should be an occasion to help the needy,” said Iqbal Memon Officer, president, All India Memon Jamaat Federation, an umbrella organisation of 500 Memon jamaats. “Don’t spend much on buying clothes. Pay school fees of poor children, buy oxygen cylinders and pay hospital bills of poor patients battling Covid,” said Officer in an audio message which has gone viral. Haji Mudassar Patel, vicechairman, City Congress (minority department), was busy for a substantial part of Ramzan in distributing ration and Ramzan packets to the poor. “We are passing through one of the toughest times in our country’s history. Lockdown has already made the poor poorer. Eid should bring smile to the faces of those who have lost businesses or jobs,” said Patel who, along with former ministers Baba Siddiqui and Arif Naseem Khan, reached out to hundreds of the impoverished with ration and food kits. “Don’t shop for Eid, help the needy,” he urged too. Haj and Umrah Tour operator Imran Alvi said that his family has not shopped for Eid, both last year and this year, because “there is no meaning in celebrations when there are deaths in the family or extended family.” “How can we celebrate when people around us are dying? We have to do everything that we can to help people fight the dreaded Coronavirus,” he said. Since congregational prayers are banned, not many will visit mosques to offer the Eid namaz in the city. And most homes will skip hosting lavish Eid parties. “The sky will not fall if we just eat sheer khurma and a few other dishes, instead of preparing a dozen dishes,” said Officer, who also supported the idea of giving more fitra (a charity done before the Eid namaz) than mandated (a few kg grains or the equivalent in money per person).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/muslims-skip-eid-shopping-open-purse-strings-for-the-needy/articleshow/82593418.cms||Mohammed Wajihudin
---||Delhi||Vax shortage forces shutting of 100 Covaxin sites in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Hundred vaccination sites administering Covaxin to the 18-44 age-group, located at 17 schools, have been closed down by the Delhi government due to vaccine shortage. Bharat Biotech, the maker of Covaxin, has written to the government about its inability to supply additional jabs to Delhi. The AAP government had on May 7 requested BB to provide large quantities of Covaxin supplies so that the vaccination programme can be speeded up. The firm wrote to the principal secretary, health and family welfare it was “making dispatches as per the directives of the concerned (central) government officials. We therefore regret we can’t make any additional supplies.” Times ViewAt a time when vaccination needs to gather speed, this is a real setback to the process. The problem of vaccine shortage must be sorted out immediately. Delhi, like the rest of India, cannot afford delays on this front.Presenting BB’s letter at a press meet Wednesday, deputy CM Manish Sisodia said, “This document makes it clear the Centre decides which state will receive how much of the vaccines. If the Centre has the final say, it should... ensure the vaccine demand and requirements of all states are taken into account instead of being overlooked.” No Covaxin left for 18-44 age-group in any of the govt centres in Delhi...Bharat Biotech had also stated in its letter dated May 11: “There has been an unprecedented demand for our vaccine, and in spite of increasing production every month, we are unable to keep up with the demand.” Meanwhile, AAP MLA Atishi announced on Wednesday that no government centre will be able to administer Covaxin to the 18-44 age-group in Delhi from Thursday due to unavailability of vaccines. Delhi received a fresh consignment of 2,67,690 Covishield doses on Tuesday evening meant for the same age-group though. Sisodia appealed to the Centre to take cognisance of the shortage and increase supply of vaccines to Delhi. “Since there is a massive scarcity of vaccines at present in Delhi, we have had to shut a hundred centres in 17 Delhi government schools where Covaxin was being administered. This persistent shortage of vaccine may lead to further worsening of the crisis,” the Sisodia said. The Delhi government had given an order for procuring 1.34 crore vaccine doses for citizens between 18-44 years, including 67 lakh Covaxin doses. Sisodia reiterated chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s demand from the central government that the formula of Covid-19 vaccines should be shared with various pharmaceutical companies in India to increase production. “The need of the hour is for the central government to pass a global tender to procure vaccines instead of asking individual states to float tenders. Although the states are willing to float tenders if the need arises, it is important for the world to see India as one entity instead of a divided nation-state. After all, it is the responsibility of the central government to ensure availability of vaccines to all states while the states make sure that all citizens are vaccinated in a swift manner, within three months after receiving the vaccines from the central government,” said Sisodia. Atishi expressed the hope that the Centre would intervene and supply sufficient vials to Delhi. For healthcare/frontline workers and those above 45 years, only four days of Covaxin stocks and three days of Covishield stocks are left.

---||India||To spur Remdesivir output, government vows to buy 50 lakh vials||NEW DELHI: In order to incentivise Indian manufacturers of Remdesivir, a drug much in demand for treating Covid-19 patients with serious lung infection, the government has promised to purchase up to 50 lakh vials even after sales taper off. A government source said concerns of seven Indian companies that make the drug that they could be left with large inventories once the second wave of Covid-19 infections eased were valid and were addressed. “Possibly by August, the demand may drop, the government will step in to buy stocks,” the source said. The ramp up in production has been swift. A stocktaking with manufacturers in early April found that around 10,000 vials were being produced daily. Manufacturers said there was no demand for more even though capacities existed. The government then urged pharma companies to step up production. Very soon, by mid-April, cases of Covid-19 began to soar, creating shortages. Efforts to step up production began to bear fruit and at present, India is making around 3,25,000 vials a day. Though demand remains high, the levelling of cases, the government hopes, will result in adequate supply of the drug. Efforts by top government experts like Dr V K Paul, ICMR chief Dr Balram Bhargava and others like AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria, to stress that Remdesivir should not be used indiscriminately have also helped to rationalise demand. States have implemented protocols and patients and relatives advised that the drug is not a magic bullet and needs to be prescribed with care. As a result, Kerala returned 1 lakh doses of the 2.62 lakh it was allocated. Also, the Centre worked with state and district administrations to try and ensure the drug is available for those who need it. So, DMs had to ensure supply was given to patients on recommendation of the medical facility and treating doctors. The government is similarly looking at the advisability of the use of Ivermectin in a general manner. As the raw materials are available in India, there is no crunch in supply of the formulation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/to-spur-remdesivir-output-govt-vows-to-buy-50l-vials/articleshow/82593438.cms||---

Sources said that a meeting of dealers was called on Wednesday by officials of both the hospitals. The superintendents of the hospitals, advisors and other officials remained present at the meeting. According to insiders, the hospitals most routinely used drugs in stock for now but a major issue has been their existing vendors finding it difficult to either provide some medicines or provide them at the rates that were decided earlier. The government hospitals also rely on the Gujarat Medical Services Corporation Ltd for their needs. Sources said that the hospitals had reached a desperate situation regarding certain products including basic drugs and items like gloves for staffers and diapers for patients. A list of around 200 drugs, surgical items and other material has been prepared by the hospitals and has been shared with distributors. The distributors were called for a meeting on Wednesday and have been called again on Thursday noon. They will have to submit their bids then. While earlier each hospital used to have its own system of procurement, it is for the first time that the SSGH and the Gotri hospital have come together for such procurement. “Elsewhere too emergency procurement has been done in wake of the pandemic. We will seek permission for the procurement and, if allowed, go ahead with it,” said in-charge SSGH superintendent, Dr RG Aiyer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/panic-in-govt-hospitals-over-shortage-of-medicines-supplies/articleshow/82582733.cms||Sachin Sharma
---||Surat||BJP MP slammed after party worker’s kin dies||Surat: BJP MP from Bardoli Prabhu Vasava faced the ire of a BJP worker at a Covid-19 isolation centre in Puna area of the city on Wednesday. Mahesh Hirpara, secretary of ward 16 (Puna West) of city BJP unit, was angry with his party leaders since he did not get their help in arranging proper treatment for his cousin brother who succumbed to Covid-19 recently. Videos of the incident went viral in which Hirpara is seen angrily shouting at the BJP leaders including Vasava. The MP was accompanied by local BJP leaders. In a similar incident that happened recently, city BJP mayor Hemali Boghawala had to face the anger of her party workers in the Sarthana area when she went there to participate in a protest against the post-poll violence in West Bengal. Following angry protests and shouting of slogans by the workers she had to leave the spot. Vasava went on a visit to the Covid isolation centre at Saurashtra Patidar Social Trust in Puna. He was inspecting the work at the kitchen of the community centre when Hirpara, a textile businessman, started questioning him for not answering his calls. “I made several calls to Vasava and our MLA from Kamrej for help. My brother was critical but they did not answer my calls. I needed Remdesivir injections for him but I did not get my leaders’ help,” Hirpara told TOI. Hirpara’s cousin brother Pravin, 40, died due to Covid-19 on April 29 in a city hospital.

A bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli said the government must "learn from the bitter experience of Delhi citizens", adding many couldn't find beds, oxygen and "unfortunately succumbed to the disease without getting the chance to be treated". The HC was surprised by revelations made in the government's affidavit that the Indira Gandhi Hospital, meant to be operational with 1,241 beds, is only being used as a temporary facility, that too, for patients with mild symptoms, and doesn't have ICU/O2 beds. 4.5k beds available in city: Govt to HCThis is a huge facility planned, more or less complete, but lethargy of the state is the reason why it is not getting ready. The State has invested so much in this, it should have been operationalised, there are whispers of a third wave coming,” an upset bench reminded Delhi government lawyer, senior advocate Rahul Mehra, when he tried to draw the attention of the court to the availability of more than 4,500 beds in the capital. He said in view of the availability of such a large number of beds, there was no “grave urgency” to make the hospital operational. However, the high court was informed by the petitioner’s lawyer from Dwarka that at present 80 beds were operational in the Indira Gandhi Hospital, of which only eight were occupied. The court was also told that there was no piped oxygen, ICU beds or ventilators available at the hospital. The court said if the government had taken it up as a “pressing issue”, the 250- bedded facility would have been up and running by now. “There is no reason why the state shouldn’t complete the project at the earliest, learn from the onslaught of pandemic, we can’t be caught in the same situation,” the court observed, in response to Mehra’s claim that the situation regarding availability of beds has improved. Seeking a detailed affidavit, the court directed the government to indicate the timelines that were initially set for completion of the hospital, the reason for not completing it within that and the subsequent new timeframe set for finishing the project. Giving10 days to file the document, the court said the government must give a “realistic” deadline and once decided must stick to it, else “consequences will follow”. During the hearing, Mehra maintained that there was no lethargy on the part of the state and blamed the Central government for not increasing beds for Delhi in its hospitals. But the bench told him not to go “on a tangent” and said it was dealing with the Dwarka hospital and the delay in it being operational. “This is urgent. Please understand. We all became complacent after the first wave and when things eased up. That should not happen,” the court said and added that the infrastructure and equipment at the temporary medical establishments set up by it can be utilised in other hospitals once the temporary units are not required.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-raps-delhi-govt-over-delay-on-dwarka-hospital/articleshow/82593442.cms||Abhinav Garg

The test positivity rate too went up to 29.75% as 1,46,320 samples were tested in the past 24 hours. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan told his daily briefing that the state would immediately adopt the new guidelines of ICMR on Covid testing of not insisting on RTPCR tests for all. "Only those who test negative in the antigen test and yet show Covid symptoms need to go for RTPCR tests. More efficient antigen kits are now available in the state," he said. Vijayan said the interstate rail passengers to Kerala should produce RTPCR negative certificates taken at least 72 hours before their journey. The chief minister said the government was making efforts for mass production of pulse oximeters at cheap rates. "The startup companies can take up this task. The industries department has been asked to direct Keltron to take immediate steps in this regard," he said. Efforts are also being taken to improve the production of oxygen in the state. "An oxygen audit is being carried out by fire and rescue department personnel. Instructions have been given to pre-empt the possibility of fire accidents in hospital buildings," he said. Vijayan said the vaccines for which orders have been placed and proposed to be administered to those in the 18-45 age group would be given only to that category. "We have to fix priority groups and ensure that the vaccines are administered without any crowding. We don’t have enough vaccine to be given to all at one go. It has to be administered in a staggered manner. The local self-government institutions and health department should make viable arrangements to avoid crowding at vaccine centres. They can take the help of the police, if needed," he said. The Union government has informed that it would provide vaccines for those aged above 45 years and there are 1.13 crore persons in this category in Kerala. "We have asked the Centre to allot enough vaccines to meet this demand, which is of high priority," he said. Ernakulam (6,410 cases) led the district-wise tally of Covid cases on Wednesday, followed by Malappuram (5,388), Kozhikode (4,418), Thiruvananthapuram (4,284), Thrissur (3,994), Palakkad (3,520), Kollam (3,350), Kottayam (2,904), Alappuzha (2,601), Kannur (2,346), Pathanamthitta (1,339), Idukki (1,305), Kasaragod (969) and Wayanad (701). Among those who tested positive, 40,133 people were infected by contact while 241 came from other states. The source of infection is not known in 3,010 cases. The day's cases include 145 health workers. As many as five new hot spots were announced on the day while 75 places were excluded from the list, taking the total number of hot spots in the state to 740.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/state-logs-over-43000-cases-95-fatalities-test-positivity-rate-at-29-75/articleshow/82593437.cms||---

He also vowed to do whatever it takes to take care of the health of the people. “In order to bring down the mortality rate, we need people’s cooperation. It will be possible only by early testing and early treatment,” Sawant told reporters outside the South Goa district hospital, where he inspected the site of the incident where an oxygen leakage occurred on Tuesday. He also interacted with doctors and reviewed Covid management practices at the hospital. Technical experts who have flown in from Delhi have started the repair work of the tanker, which, he said, should be ready for refilling by Wednesday evening. South Goa collector Ruchika Katyal, medical superintendent of the hospital Dr Deepa Correia, co-administrator Dr Rajesh Patil, and others were present. He said that 30% of the deaths taking place at Covid hospitals were of those who were pronounced brought dead and those who succumb within 24 hours of admission. “Many land up in hospital after their lungs collapse, when it is difficult to treat them,” he said. “That’s why people should get tested immediately, and if tested positive, get admitted in step-up hospitals and get their medical kits from the primary health centres.” He urged pharmacies not to entertain over-the-counter medication for Covid-like symptoms. “Advise them to go to the nearest PHC and get tested, and to follow medical advice,” Sawant said. The chief minister also had a word of appreciation for the doctors and other staff at the hospital for “efficient” Covid management. “The capacity of the hospital has gone up to 530 beds. On average, 100 patients are discharged everyday, and an equal number admitted. The team at the South Goa district hospital as also the private doctors working here are doing a good job of handling the situation. The flu OPD has prevented crowding of patients,” he said. Asked whether he has taken over the health portfolio, Sawant said, “As the state’s chief minister, the health of Goans is of utmost importance to me. I will do whatever it takes to take care of the people’s health. And that’s why I had visited the Covid ward (GMC) yesterday. I will take care of the people’s health,” he said. Sawant later visited the ESI hospital and took stock of the facilities there. Stating that there were currently 230 patients being treated there, he appreciated the medical team for doing an “exceptional job” ensuring sufficient supply of oxygen and medicines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mortality-rate-will-drop-within-a-week-says-sawant/articleshow/82589343.cms||---

They have demanded this so that people with suspected Covid symptoms don’t mingle with other patients visiting the health centre. Many senior citizens thanked the authorities for heeding their plea. With both testing and inoculation done under one roof, many were fearful of getting their second dose of the Covid vaccine as this would expose them to people coming in for testing, thus increasing their chances of getting infected. After receiving several such complaints, the health authorities were compelled to shift the vaccination to the Government higher secondary school, near the Canacona police station. Meanwhile, a call centre has been set up at the Shree Mallikarjun college at Delem, to assist Covid-19 patients under home isolation. Operating under the supervision of the South Goa Disaster Management Authority and the Canacona Municipal Council administration, the centre will keep track of health conditions of home-isolated patients. When contacted, deputy speaker and Canacona MLA Isidore Fernandes said more measures will be put in place, including converting of the old CHC building into a step-up Covid care centre. He appealed for support of locals including that of the health team, to win the fight against the virus. Meanwhile, 64 new Covid cases were detected on Wednesday. New cases have been detected from every part of the taluka. The municipal area recorded 22 new cases. Among the villages, Shristhal recorded nine cases; Khola five cases; Agonda 10 cases’ Poinguinim nine cases; Loliem-Polem one case, Gaondongrim five cases and Cotigao three cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-vax-centre-canacona-locals-want-testing-moved/articleshow/82589375.cms||---

He was undergoing treatment for Covid-19 a private hospital in Margao since the last few days. Gomes had represented Tarun Tejpal, founder editor of Tehelka, in the rape case against him before the additional sessions court, the judgement in which is awaited. The pronouncement of the judgement in the case, which was slated for Wednesday, was adjourned to May 19. Chief minister Pramod Sawant said he was saddened by the passing away “of prominent Goan lawywer Adv Rajeev Gomes”, “feeling devastated”, was how leader of opposition Digambar Kamat reacted on learning of Gomes’s demise. “Deeply shocked and pained by the sad demise of my esteemed colleague Adv Rajiv Gomes. A great loss to the legal fraternity,” commissioner of NRI affairs and BJP general secretary Narendra Sawaikar said in his condolence message. Gomes was a mentor to many young lawyers and his passing has created a deep void and brought about a sense of gloom amongst the legal fraternity. “Well, whom do we turn up to now senhor Rajeev Gomes? Will remember every bit of time spent with you?” young lawyer Hrishikesh Kadam posted on Facebook, a sentiment shared by many whom Gomes mentored.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/adv-gomes-succumbs-to-covid-on-wed/articleshow/82589411.cms||---

Of the 150 Covid patients admitted at the hospital, 80 are on oxygen. On Tuesday, 26 had patients lost their lives at the Goa Medical College due interruptions in the hospital’s central oxygen line between 2am and 6am. On the same day, the South Goa District Hospital also faced a shortage, but due to a gas leak incident. The chief minister told the official at the Ponda hospital that he would sort out problems faced by them in procuring some life-saving medicines. Sawant also assessed the hospitals oxygen issues. Sawant said that the mortality rate could be brought down if people got themselves tested before the onset of complications. This way they would not need any oxygen or ventilator, he said. The hospital’s medical superintendent Dr Vikas Kuwelkar said that they have no ventilators. Only patient’s with mild infections are admitted here, but on Sunday it witnessed four deaths. Dr Kuwelkar said the patients were aged between 60 and 72 and had been brought in critical condition. Following its April 18 decision to use one floor of the Ponda sub-district hospital partially for Covid patients, the state government on April 20 converted it into a full fledged Covid hospital. those in need of any other treatment are either sent to Goa Medical College, Hospicio, or the North Goa Sub District Hospital, Dr Kuwelkar said. As the number of Covid patients is rising, the Ponda hospital is going to increase beds on its third floor on Thursday, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-surprise-visit-cm-assures-ponda-hosp-help/articleshow/82589511.cms||Suraj P Kaisuvker

Vendors without face masks were also fined by the police during the inspection carried out by the panchayat along with police. Vendors were also warned that their items would be confiscated if they attracted crowds at their selling points. It was also noticed that vendors were selling their items near the Nerul bridge with scant regard for social distancing. Despite the curfew restrictions, there were complaints from locals that many vendors were selling vegetables, fruits, fish and other items attracting large crowds. Secretary of Nerul panchayat Govind Khalap said that they had received a number of phone calls regarding crowding, and hence they acted swifty and asked vendors to remove their goods. “I request the public not crowd such places as Covid cases are on the rise. I have got instructions that if there is unnecessary crowding, with SOPs not followed, the vendors’ goods will be confiscated,” Khalap said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/nerul-panchayat-fines-vendors-flouting-sops/articleshow/82589534.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Dura cylinders are vacuum insulated liquid gas cylinders that allow storage of cryogenic gases like medical oxygen.

In this scenario, a few voluntary organisations are stepping forward to help. The Popular Front of India (PFI) said it has helped with at least 18 Christian and 38 Muslim burials, and 23 Hindu last rites. PFI State president Shaikh Abdul Rauf said that they have 40-50 volunteers across the state, who carry out the social service even while observing the Ramadan fast. “During the second wave, members met and decided that this time giving only money and food will not be enough. It was decided to help with the last rites as this factor rose as a challenge during the second wave,” he said Rauf told TOI that when families find it difficult to arrange for the last rites, the office of the South Goa Collector or the district hospitals contact them. “A family in one of the wards was home quarantined after all members were tested positive. When an 80-year-old woman from the house died, the family was left helpless. We contacted members of PFI. They came to the house and took the coffin for burial. Not a single rupee was taken by them, not even for fuel,” deputy sarpanch of Loutolim, Joana Fernandes said. Rauf said that they had to raise money and organise vehicles. They were given three vans by way of charity. One van they turned one into an ambulance. “Money was raised by way of donations from Muslims, especially during the month of Ramadan when Muslims donate more generously. Many volunteered their services,” he said. The organisation has helped with the last rites of unclaimed bodies, the destitute and, at times, of those whose family members shirked from claiming. The majority of burials and cremations they have helped with have been in South Goa, Panaji, Sakhli and Valpoi. “We have even laid to rest some popular people. Sadly even their relatives have remained absent for their last rites. People sometimes call us and say that they will pay us. We are not doing this for the money. However, sometimes people forcibly give us some money for fuel and that money goes to the organisation,” Rauf said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/good-samaritans-step-in-to-help-with-covid-last-rites/articleshow/82589624.cms||Ruvina Khan

There is another positive to it; it has sharply improved the air quality of the state. Close to a month of lockdown,has brought down the air pollution steeply in all the major cities of Madhya Pradesh. Air quality index of Bhopal on April 12 was 170 that came down to 62 on Wednesday. Similarly, the air quality index of Indore came down to 88 from 128 in a month. In Gwalior, the air quality index was at 109 that improved, which came down to 72 and in Jabalpur the air quality index came down to 67 from 78 on April 12, as per the central pollution control board data. Air quality is measured taking into account the levels of sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (Nox), RSPM10 and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the air. While the rise in sulphur dioxide is due to vehicle emissions, increase in nitrogen oxide is due to human activity, including vehicles and sewage etc. PM 10 is caused by dust, construction, including building of roads while PM2.5 is due to dust, human activity and climatic conditions. Of the four, officials said, PM2.5 is the most harmful to health since it causes severe lung diseases. Air quality index between 0 and 50 is termed as good with minimal possible health impacts while air quality between 51 and 100 is satisfactory but may lead to minor breathing discomfort to sensitive people. Air quality above 100 is moderate and leads to breathing discomfort to the people with lungs, asthma and heart diseases. AQI above 200 leads to breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure. Officials said the air quality was best during the corona restrictions last year while air pollution sharply went up in major cities this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/air-quality-improves-as-streets-vacant-biz-shut-in-madhya-pradesh/articleshow/82593516.cms||Ankur Sirothia

It was hearing PILs filed by various entities (individuals and organisations). The bench comprising Justices Nitin W Sambre and M S Sonak said the state government has to ensure that the GMCH is supplied with the required amount of medical oxygen. “The situation of oxygen at Goa Medical College is quite grim. We have long passed the stage of determining whether patients are suffering from the lack of oxygen or not,” the court observed. Asserting that oxygen supply should be made available to the patients in GMCH, the judges said that the right to life is a fundamental one guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution. “There is, therefore, a corresponding duty cast on the state to ensure that this life is not extinguished on account of inability on the part of the state to supply oxygen to these unfortunate victims of the pandemic,” the court said. The state officials repeatedly assured us that there was sufficient oxygen available but the problem was of logistics of the supply chain, it said. “At this stage, we do not wish to go into the projections of oxygen requirement made by the under secretary on one hand and the dean on the other, though, prima facie we are inclined to go by the projections of the dean who is actually functioning from the GMC,” the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/oygen-situation-grim-take-steps-to-improve-it-high-court-to-goa-government/articleshow/82593550.cms||---

Reacting to opposition criticism that Indians were deprived of the vaccine while doses were sent to other countries, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra alleged that parties like Congress and AAP are spreading misinformation. Patra said 1.07 crore doses sent abroad were India’s aid to different countries and of those, 78.5 lakh were dispatched to seven neighbouring countries. He said over two lakh doses were given to UN peace-keeping forces, in which over 6,600 Indian soldiers are deployed. He said: “Sending over 5.50 crore vaccine doses abroad was the compulsion of two Indian manufacturers as it was part of their commercial and licencing liabilities.” As the intellectual property rights of Covishield, manufactured by Serum Institute of India, are with AstraZeneca, a foreign firm, he said SII was obliged to send abroad part of the vaccines produced.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/84-of-vaccines-sent-abroad-was-part-of-licencing-liabilities-bjp/articleshow/82593569.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Nanoor TMC worker dies of post-poll violence injuries at Kolkata hospital||Suri: A Trinamool Congress worker, grievously injured in a political clash on May 3, died at a Kolkata hospital on Wednesday, sparking tension in his hometown Nanoor in Birbhum. Shyamal Das was allegedly beaten up during the violence in Raninagar a day after the Bengal assembly poll results were announced. He and another victim, Munshi Kamal, were first rushed to a Nanoor health facility and then to hospitals in Bolpur and Burdwan before being referred to Kolkata. Munshi Kamal is still critical. Shyamal’s death has triggered a blame game between Trinamool and BJP. “They (Shyamal and Munshi) were authorised cattle traders, but villagers thought they had come to take away cattle by force. There is no doubt that BJP supporters instigated villagers to attack our party supporters,” Trinamool block president Subrata Bhattacharya said. The BJP claims the duo was trying to bully villagers. “They had gone to the village to forcibly take away cattle. Villagers resisted. BJP workers had no role in it,” said Tarakeswar Saha who contested from Nanoor on a BJP ticket, but lost.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/nanoor-tmc-worker-dies-of-post-poll-violence-injuries-at-kolkata-hospital/articleshow/82586996.cms||Someswar Boral

---||Kolkata||Row erupts in Visva Bharati over lecture on BJP’s defeat in Bengal||SANTINIKETAN: A notice on a lecture uploaded on the Visva-Bharati website on Tuesday went missing on Wednesday afternoon, hours after it was placed in the public domain. The topic was “Why BJP failed to win West Bengal assembly elections”. VB, a central university, had invited Sanjay Kumar, co-director of Lokniti, a research programme at Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), to deliver the lecture on May 18. Vice-chancellor Bidyut Chakrabarty was scheduled to preside over the lecture. Accordingly, the joining link for the Zoom meeting was also in the public domain. This was the first time VB had arranged a lecture on an overtly political topic. The notice was later nowhere to be seen on the VB website, without any official clarification from the university. But word went around the varsity that the lecture was “cancelled for the time being due to unavoidable circumstances”. Phone calls and messages from TOI to VB public relations officer Anirban Sarkar didn’t elicit a response. But the Prime Minister’s nominee to VB executive council, Dulal Chandra Ghosh, didn’t hide his dismay over the topic. “Visva-Bharati is an education institution. The university usually organizes lectures on education, society and international affairs. I don’t see any reason why a university has to organize a lecture on why a political party lost or won an election,” Ghosh said. He further said that even the BJP leadership wouldn’t be comfortable with such a topic. “There is a university committee to decide on topic of lecture and speaker. I don’t know if the topic was discussed in that committee. I don’t think members were unanimous over the topic if the matter was placed in the meeting at all,” Ghosh said. Excerpts of Sanjay Kumar’s post-poll survey are already in public domain in which Lokniti researchers have presented survey-based data on how voting pattern in Bengal (political affiliation-wise and a huge chunk of unattached voters) differed in the recently concluded assembly polls from the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vb-poll-lecture-notice-vanishes-within-hours/articleshow/82586948.cms||Someswar Boral
---||Kolkata||Bengal district on alert for bodies in Ganga||Malda: The West Bengal government has asked the Malda district administration to step up surveillance for bodies found floating downstream in the Ganga and and cremate them in keeping with Covid protocol. News of bodies floating down the river in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh has sparked panic among residents of Manikchak and Kaliachak. Several boats have been arranged — near Gadai island of Manikchak block — to inspect the Ganga from Friday. Police stations adjoining the river bank — Bhutni, Manikchak, Mothabari and Baishnabnagar— have been alerted as also civil defence volunteers. The Ganga reaches Bengal at Manikchak via Rajmahal in Jharkhand. Minister of state Sabina Yeasmin said: “It is true that people on the bank of the Ganga have panicked. Everyday thousands use this water for various reasons. We are trying to assure them.” District magistrate Rajarshi Mitra said a directive had reached the district regarding the issue and arrangements were being made. Manikchak BDO Joy Ahmed said: “The time of surveillance is yet to be finalized. We are waiting for a nod from the DM.” Manikchak police station inspector in charge Sanjib Biswas said: “We’ll start vigilance from tomorrow and have asked people not to panic. As soon as such a body is spotted, it would be recovered and disposed of accordingly.” The DM said: “We are taking all measures but considering the present level and current of water in the Ganga, we think the possibility is remote of bodies flowing in in the next 24 hours.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-district-on-alert-for-bodies-in-ganga/articleshow/82586879.cms||Subhro Maitra
