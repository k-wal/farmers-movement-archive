The letter by the Constitutional Conduct Group alleged that the Centre was ill-prepared to tackle the spread of coronavirus since the pandemic surged and urged the government to take urgent action, including centralising procurement and supply of vaccines and ensuring that they are administered free of cost and universally to all Indians. The letter was endorsed, among others, by former Cabinet secretary KM Chandrasekhar, former health secretary K Sujatha Rao, former foreign secretary and ex-national security adviser Shiv Shankar Menon, former adviser to the Prime Minister TKA Nair, former CIC Wajahat Habibullah and former Delhi LG Najeeb Jung. "Right from the outset of the pandemic in March 2020, your government has never systematically assessed the funds that state governments would need to tackle the pandemic", the former officials said, criticising the Centre for failing to pay GST dues to states, incurring "unnecessary expenditure" on the Central Vista project and not listening to repeated warnings by the international and domestic scientific community. Suggesting that the government must substantially increase RT-PCR testing in rural and urban areas, make adequate funds available to states to provision for medical facilities, provide monthly income support to needy persons, remove FCRA restrictions on NGOs and place all data in public domain to ensure that evidence-based policy measures are implemented, the former bureaucrats also noted with concern the "steady erosion of the Cabinet system of governance" and worsening of federal relationships with states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/address-crucial-issues-at-stake-former-civil-servants-in-open-letter-to-pm/articleshow/82810273.cms||Swati Mathur
---||Kolkata||I’m training for the Olympics, whether it happens or not: Pranati Nayak||She loved Sushant Singh Rajput in MS Dhoni: The Untold Story and enjoys songs of her favourite singers, Sonu Nigam and Neha Kakkar, in her free time. But with her eyes set on an Olympics medal in gymnastics, Midnapore girl Pranati Nayak hardly gets any free time amid her hectic training schedule. Speaking to us from the Sports Authority of India sports complex in Salt Lake, where she is currently training, Pranati said, “I’m currently training under my coach Lakhan Sharma and the schedule is rigorous. The morning session starts at 6 am and ends at 9 am. In the evening, it’s from 5 pm to 8.30 pm. I get Sundays off and on Saturdays, there’s only a morning session. Over and above this, I also have physiotherapy and treatment sessions.” As for her diet, Pranati said with a smile, “I eat everything, but in moderation. Basically, we maintain a healthy balanced diet here. And yes, I love ice cream.” ‘MY FULL FOCUS IS ON BAGGING AN OLYMPICS MEDAL’The 26-year-old is, of course, elated that she has got a chance to represent India in the biggest sporting extravaganza on earth. “It feels great! My dream has come true. I took up gymnastics when I was six and it has been a roller-coaster ride since then,” said Pranati, who was groomed and trained by SAI coach Minara Begum (picture below) and shot into the limelight after winning the bronze in Women's Vault at the 8th Senior Artistic Gymnastics Asian Championship, Ulanbataar, Mongolia, in June 2019. When asked about the prospects of the Olympics actually happening this year, Pranati said, “The Olympics is set to happen in July and I’m training for it, whether it happens or not. People are wondering whether the Olympics will happen or not amid a pandemic, but we are preparing ourselves with a positive mindset. Rest depends on the situation. Right now, my full focus is on bagging an Olympics medal.” ‘DIPA DI (KARMAKAR) IS MY IDOL’It was her birthday on April 6 and she missed being with her family this year. “I couldn’t be with them this year because of the training. I miss my parents and speak to them twice a day, as I don’t get much free time. I get to speak to my elder and younger sister once every two days. They are both married now and don’t have any interest in sports. It seems I’ll get to meet them after the Olympics and hopefully with a medal,” she said, adding that her parents have sacrificed a lot for her. “We come from a humble background, but my parents (picture below) made sure that it shouldn’t affect my dreams. My parents have always stood by me like rocks. Baba used to be a bus driver, but after I got a job (in the railways), I asked him to retire and enjoy life,” she said. When asked how she spent the lockdown last year, she said she spent a lot of time training at home. “I also love to cook. So, I used to make various types of chicken dishes. I watched TV serials too. And when I got time, I listened to songs and watched Bengali and Hindi movies. My favourite singers are Sonu Nigam and Neha Kakkar. I also love sports-related films and loved Sushant Singh Rajput in MS Dhoni: The Untold Story,” said Pranati. Telling us that she considers India’s first ever female Olympic gymnast Dipa Karmakar her idol, Pranati said, “I really look up to her. I also admire US artistic gymnast Simone Arianne Biles.” Photo credit: Ashutosh Paul||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/im-training-for-the-olympics-whether-it-happens-or-not-pranati-nayak/articleshow/82801806.cms||Ruman Ganguly
---||India||Centre asks states to vaccinate Oxygen tanker drivers on priority||NEW DELHI: The road transport ministry on Thursday urged all state transport secretaries to carry out "special vaccination drive" for Liquid Oxygen tanker drivers. It also asked the states to give priority in admission and treatment to such drivers in hospitals, if they get infected with Covid-19 virus. The advisory to states to take these up as "top priority" gains importance considering that the oxygen tanker drivers are now in high demand to transport the key medical aid from different parts of the country to hospitals. Only drivers with adequate training and having the "hazardous cargo" licence are allowed to operate the Liquid Oxygen trucks. The demand of such drivers is expected to be high for a few more months for oxygen management. The ministry has also said the government’s immediate focus is to make available around 500 drivers in the next few weeks and keep the pool ready for use at any given point of time. It has said the numbers will be increased gradually to 2,500 in the next two months. It has asked the states to quickly skill the drivers with training in handling of hazardous chemicals and liquid medical oxygen through short programmes and apprenticeships. Secondly, they have been asked to skill heavy motor vehicle licence holders in the same manner. Sources said the government is also contemplating a proposal to give financial incentive of around Rs 15,000 to each oxygen tanker driver for their service. But no decision has been taken yet. Meanwhile, trucking industry sources said the government should also consider giving priority to drivers of commercial vehicles engaged in transport of essential supplies including pharmaceuticals, medical aids and other necessary items to ensure there is no shortage of these items in the market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/centre-asks-states-to-vaccinate-oxygen-tanker-drivers-on-priority/articleshow/82810719.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||Goa||Striving to get more minutes next season, I’ll work harder: Sanson||Panaji: Sanson Pereira believes FC Goa can end their Indian Super League (ISL) title drought next season. The young defender made his debut this season and went on to feature in all of Goa’s six games in the AFC Champions League. The 23-year-old from Nuvem has come a long way since his early days with Salgaocar FC. At Goa, Sanson has grown by leaps and bounds, thanks to the efforts of head coach Juan Ferrando. “It was really good playing under him (Ferrando),” Sanson told TOI. “He is a teacher. Even before a practice session, there were video sessions as to why we were doing things in practice. There was a plan for everything. Every drill in training session, every match.” With Saviour Gama missing out due to suspension, the left-back started in the opening match of this season’s ISL. He showed promise, but with Gama returning to the squad and putting up consistent performances, Sanson was restricted to just four appearances. But Sanson kept himself motivated and is now looking for more minutes in the future. “It was very difficult for me. But then I started doing more in training and prove that I can do. I gave my best in training. For me, it was tough to break in as I was new. I’ll be better from next season to get more minutes and I will prove that,” said Sanson. Thanks to the AFC criteria, Goa could field only four foreigners in ACL, from the six they had in ISL. It gave opportunity to many local players to prove their worth and Sanson grabbed the chance with both hands. No one gave Goa a chance in the AFC Champions League, but they surprised critics with two goalless draws in their first two games against Al Rayyan (Qatar) and Al Wahda (UAE). Against last editions runnersup and Iranian champions Persepolis FC, Goa didn’t have a chance and lost narrowly 1-2 and were then humbled 0-4 in the second leg. But Goa and Sanson learnt a lot from the experience. “It was very good. The teams were very good. For any mistake, our team would have got punished. It helped me a lot to focus every time. I have improved in terms of technical and tactical abilities. The video session coach used to show us really helped me understand the game better,” said Sanson. Sanson give the entire team credit for his growth and promises much more next season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/striving-to-get-more-minutes-next-season-ill-work-harder-sanson/articleshow/82810842.cms||FLAVIO LOPES

In his valedictory address in the council, Shariff said the chief minister has a lot of patience to handle issues. “With all my experience, I am saying he has more patience than me and he has never discriminated me on political lines,” he said, adding that the chief minister fondly received him when he met him at the Raj Bhavan just three days after the controversy over the three capitals bill in the council. Shariff said he was deeply disturbed during the debate on the three capitals bill last year. “I even thought of quitting the post after I failed to bring consensus in the House. In fact, the chief minister asked me why I was so disturbed. I must thank him for the way he treated and loved me,” he added. It may be recalled that Shariff’s decision to refer the three capitals bill to a select committee during the special session of the council in January last year created huge political controversy following which the chief minister moved a bill in the assembly to dissolve the legislative council. Shariff was elected to the legislative council as a TDP nominee about six years ago and became chairman in 2019 after then chairman NMD Farooq was inducted into the cabinet by then CM Chandrababu Naidu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/outgoing-lc-chair-showers-praises-on-cm/articleshow/82809281.cms||Samdani MN
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Schools keep Class XII students busy with revision tests||CHENNAI: City schools are keeping Class XII students busy with multiple online revision tests during the lockdown to ensure they stay in focus. Some schools are witnessing near 100% attendance as students feel that these tests might carry a weightage if the government cancels the board exams in view of the pandemic. The exams, conducted with common question papers in schools across the Chennai district, are being conducted for three hours in the afternoons. While the syllabus is intimated in advance, question papers are being mailed to schools which later share them among students through online platforms. G J Manohar, principal of MCC Higher Secondary School in Chetpet, said each school follows different methods to conduct the revision tests and monitor the exam. “For example, in our school, we will send Zoom links to and at a time, 400 students join the video meeting link, take the exam with their cameras on. They post their answer sheets on WhatsApp groups later. Many students are taking the exams seriously,” he said. Students wrote two revision tests in pen and paper mode before schools were closed. The third round of revision tests started on May 12 ended on Thursday. The fourth round of revision tests is scheduled from May 24 to June 1. Padmaja R, the headmistress of Chennai Girls Higher Secondary School in Saidapet, said the revision tests will keep the students in touch with concepts for the board exams. “While there were teething issues initially, now, except for a few students who face technical issues, others appear for the exams regularly. We let students with tech glitches write the exam and post answer scripts later,” she said. “Our teachers take classes, clarify doubts in the morning and conduct revision tests in the afternoon. We have asked them to keep a logbook of whatever they teach during the lockdown,” said P Shanthi, headmistress of Jaigopal Garodia Government Girls Higher Secondary School in Virugambakkam. “Teachers are correcting the answer sheets online and uploading the answer sheets in google drive,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/schools-keep-class-xii-students-busy-with-revision-tests/articleshow/82820467.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Barge toll now 49, search on for rest 26; 11 on tug also missing||MUMBAI: The Indian Navy’s search and rescue teams recovered, by Thursday evening, 49 bodies of crew members of the barge Papaa (P-305) that sank 70km off the Mumbai coast in the wake of Cyclone Tauktae. The search for 26 personnel still missing continues with six naval warships, P8I maritime surveillance aircraft, and Chetak, ALH and Sea King helicopters involved in the effort. The barge had 261 personnel on board, and 186 of them had been rescued by Wednesday evening. Bodies of 27 victims were brought to Mumbai on board INS Beas on Thursday, while INS Kochi and INS Kolkata had on Wednesday together brought back 22 victims and all the rescued personnel. Among those still missing is barge master Balwinder Singh. While police have registered a case of accidental death in the P-305 case, they have registered another case of persons missing after 11 crew members of a tugboat were found to have been untraced. The Navy found out about the tugboat, named Varapradha, after two of its crew members were saved by INS Kolkata when it was undertaking search ops for P-305. Family members of one of the dead P-305 personnel, quality control engineer Vishal Katdare (37), said they learned from his colleague Deepak that the barge master had been firm about carrying on the waters as he was sure the cyclone would not harm them. But as the barge started sinking, the master jumped into the waters without a life jacket, the survivor told Katdare’s family. Katdare was in the waters for almost 12 hours and died after he was rescued. A defence official said the rescued crew members were very weak after having been in the waters for several hours with their life jackets on. As they need to overcome the trauma, counselling will be provided by the agency concerned before they are allowed to go home, the official said. All those brought back to Mumbai’s shores have been placed in quarantine and will undergo medical examination. Most rescued crew members said they had lost all their belongings in the barge that sunk. The marine crew on P-305 was owned and operated by M/s Durmast Enterprises Ltd. A spokesperson for the barge company Afcons, the contractor in this case, said, “As per the international standard vessel chartering terms, the responsibility for the marine side of the operations, namely safe vessel operation, navigation and vessel management, come under the scope of the vessel owners, carried out through the vessel’s master, officers, and the crew appointed on the vessel by the owner. Evacuation of the vessel is an extreme step only resorted to in case the vessel is in distress.” The naval warships still engaged in the search and rescue operations are INS Kochi, Kolkata, Beas, Betwa, Teg and Talwar. The Glory Ship Management Pvt Ltd, owners of the tug Varapradha, approached police and lodged a missing complaint about 11 crew members and the tug on Wednesday. Two crew members — Francis Simon (51) and Sahebsapan Bhutia (23) — have been rescued. “The two survivors told us there were a total of 13 people in the tug. They said the 11 others might have drowned. The two were able to climb onto the life raft and survived. They were brought to Mumbai,” sources said. The two survivors told police they had been seeking permission to come back on May 17 (Monday) but lost contact with the company at around 2.30pm. The tug captain, Nagendra Kumar Prajapati (59), is also missing. The other 10 missing crew members are in the age-group of 22 to 46. The sister and brother-in-law of one of those missing, Rakesh Kumar, arrived from Pune to Mumbai on Wednesday to find out details. Rakesh’s wife and one-year-old son stay with his parents in Darbhanga, Bihar. “We have registered a missing person case,” confirmed Suhas Hemade, senior inspector. Meanwhile, Maharashtra Congress on Thursday demanded the resignation of petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan on moral grounds over the death of P-305 crew members and termed it a “manmade tragedy”.

This comes even as the drug industry is facing a huge escalation in raw material prices, packaging, transport and logistics costs. Two anti-virals — Remdesivir and Favipiravir — and Tocilizumab injections being used in the Covid-19 treatment have witnessed massive shortages over the last few months. Antibiotics such as Azithromycin and Doxycycline, steroids including dexamethasone, methylprednisolone and prednisolone, anti-fungal injection Liposomal Amphotericin B, and commonly used vitamin C and zinc medicines are in huge demand with Covid-19 infections surging across the country. The shortage is more acute in small towns, with rural areas being the worst-affected. Read AlsoCoronavirus black fungus infection: Signs, symptoms and everything we know about the deadly fungal infection“Though we have been saddled with huge cost increases on account of raw materials, freight and transportation costs, companies are trying to keep pace with demand,” Ashok Madan, executive director at industry lobby group Indian Drug Manufacturers’ Association (IDMA) told TOI. Amid rising cases of not just Covid-19, but complications such as mucormycosis or black fungus, several pharma companies, including Cipla and Bharat Serums, are scrambling to ramp up production. Complex injectables such as Amphotericin B used in its treatment are out of stock in several cities, including Delhi and Mumbai. The “unprecedented” demand has outstripped supply multiple times and it would take at least 15-20 days for new stocks to hit the market as the product requires a lead manufacturing time. “Active pharmaceutical ingredients of the injection are limited, and it involves a complex manufacturing process,” a manufacturer said. Rakesh Bamzai, president, India, Emerging Asia & Access Markets at Viatris, said his company and Gilead are closely working with the government to accelerate supplies of AmBisome to help meet the needs in India. Viatris imports and distributes the drug from US firm, Gilead Sciences. Industry watchers said in certain commonly used drugs such as paracetamol, or even Favipiravir and Remdesivir, shortages could be due to hoarding and panic buying. “Demand has surged and we are supplying and operating at 100% this month,” a spokesperson from GSK Pharmaceuticals, which markets one of the top-selling paracetamol brands, Calpol, said. The shortage has stretched in certain pockets to products that have several hundreds of brands in the market, like in the case of fever and pain-relief medicine paracetamol, with 400-odd brands, and others like Doxycycline, vitamin C and zinc. Industry experts said ICU products like Heparin and Mannitol are in short supply too. Over the last one month, the government has attempted to address the situation by monitoring the supply and urging the industry to ramp up production, but distress calls from patients continue on social media platforms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/key-drugs-steroids-in-short-supply-input-costs-surge/articleshow/82813009.cms||Rupali Mukherjee

With 14 mucormycosis deaths, Haryana’s casualties are second highest in the country after Maharashtra. Uttar Pradesh has recorded eight deaths, all of them in Lucknow. The figures for the rest of the state are not available. Jharkhand has recorded four deaths while two deaths each have been reported from Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Uttarakhand. Bihar, Assam, Odisha and Goa have reported one death each. Some states, however, said they have not collated data on mucormycosis cases and deaths yet. A day after Rajasthan declared the disease an epidemic, Gujarat, too, followed suit on Thursday. Other states like Punjab, Haryana, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Telangana have declared it a “notifiable disease” under the Epidemic Diseases Act, making it mandatory to report every mucormycosis case to the state government. Read AlsoCoronavirus black fungus infection: Signs, symptoms and everything we know about the deadly fungal infectionAt least 10 states —Delhi, Telangana, Odisha, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Goa, Gujarat, Karnataka and Kerala — said they have either run out of the drug or stocks are fast depleting. Some of these said there were no stocks in private pharmacies. Maharashtra, which accounts for more than 70% of the black fungus deaths in the country, has recorded 1,500 cases. The state has been grappling with severe shortage of the liposomal amphotericin B drug since early April. “The state needs 1.50 lakh vials of the drug but has received only 16,000 vials from the centre,” said Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope.

Gujarat, which has about 1,500 cases – though these are not official figures unlike other states -- faces the same problem. Sources in the health department said only 10% of the affected patients are getting the injections.Odisha was virtually left with no stock on Thursday and was waiting for some vials to be sent by the central government on Friday. Karnataka health minister K Sudhakar said the state has only 1,000-odd vials of amphotericin B and added that an order for another 20,000 vials has been placed. Many states are now knocking on Centre’s doors or negotiating with pharma companies. “We have just 700 vials of liposomal amphotericin B left. We have spoken to Union health minister Harsh Vardhan asking for 50,000 vials. We are also in touch with eight pharma companies,” said Rajasthan health minister Raghu Sharma.

The better news is, however, tempered with concern over positivity rate remaining high in some states with 22, including West Bengal, Karnataka, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh, reporting over 15% positivity, health ministry data shows. Though the reducing positivity rates are a good sign, the progress needs to be sustained over the next few weeks. The daily positivity rate dropped to 13.4 % on Wednesday, even as more than 20.5 lakh samples – highest in a single day so far – were tested from across the country. The overall weekly case positivity declined consistently for the last two weeks to 15.2% during May 13-19, against 21.5% ( April 29-May 5) as the number of districts with falling rates also increased to 303 from 210 in the same period.

As a result of increased testing, the case positivity has started declining since last two weeks after a consistent increase for 10 weeks,” Lav Agarwal, joint secretary in the health ministry said. He cautioned against any laxity and said a strict vigil and stringent containment measures need to be in place as cases are still high in many states and any lapses can quickly reverse the overall positive trend seen in recent weeks.

She termed the virtual meeting “casual and a super flop” and alleged Modi tried to “play down” the Covid threat. The PM was feeling “insecure” and trying to hide it by sheer arrogance, she said. “Are we puppets or bonded labour? We were invited to the meeting while the PM interacted with some of the DMs and then gave a speech. He didn’t have the courtesy to listen to us,” Mamata said after the meeting got over. “The CMs of Bengal, Maharashtra and Kerala were present in the meeting. We had many things to ask about the supply of vaccines, oxygen and medicines, but we couldn’t. There are four black fungus cases in the state. Nobody asked us about it. It is a blatant violation of the federal spirit. All the CMs should come together against such an insult.” Mamata said Modi tried to play down the Covid threat. “The PM said the Covid wave was on the slide. This is what they did after the first wave. You all know how polls were held in eight phases despite our plea to club the phases and how the virus has now spread,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/humiliated-at-pm-meet-cms-made-to-sit-like-puppets-mamata-banerjee/articleshow/82814270.cms||Debashish Konar

The statement came a day after the state government announced that just three teachers had died during poll duty, drawing widespread condemnation from opposition parties and unions which have put the figure at 1,621.

---||Business||Smaller towns driving growth in home loans||MUMBAI: Despite the pandemic and a lockdown in the first half of the fiscal, outstanding home loans grew 9.6% to Rs 22.3 lakh crore in the first nine months of FY21. As the virus hit metros in the first wave, more people purchased homes in smaller towns, resulting in tier-2 and -3 centres recording the highest growth in home loans. According to a report by CRIF, which operates a credit bureau in India, the smaller centres recorded a higher annual growth rate in home loan books compared to metros. A large part of the growth has come from the affordable and mid-market segment. The flip side of the development is that home loans have become riskier for banks as defaults are higher in the affordable category and in case of younger borrowers. While metros accounted for Rs 11.2 lakh crore of outstanding home loans, their share came down to 7.3%. Among metros, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad saw the maximum growth in outstanding home loans at 11.3%, and Chennai the least (at 4%). Mumbai, Pune and Bengaluru grew by 7%, while Delhi and Kolkata grew by 6% and 9.8%, respectively. Tier-2 centres grew by 10.9%, while tier-3 and beyond grew 13.3%. The fastest-growing tier-2 centres were Rajkot (16%), Guntur (14.8%), Vijayawada (13.7%), Thiruvananthapuram (11.4%), Coimbatore (11.3%) and Jaipur (10.5%). The tier-3 centres that topped the growth list include Chittoor (18.1%), West Godavari (15.7%), Karimnagar (17.1%), Tirunelveli (13.2%), Bharuch (12.1%), North Goa (10.4%) and Jalgaon (11.6%). The growth is driven by lending by banks, particularly those in the public sector, who now dominate the mortgage business. As of December 2020, the top five public sector banks constituted nearly 30% of home loans by value, while the top five private banks contributed 15%. Housing finance companies, many of which faced liquidity pressures, now account for only 37% of outstanding mortgages.

It didn't take long for his two friends, Avani Singh and Rishay Gupta, to join hands. Before they knew, 250 students from across India had volunteered as foot soldiers. Soon, two WhatsApp groups were floated — "Covid-19 Sahayta Kendra" and "Sahayta Kendra Volunteers". The first was for students who were ready to devote time every day to find verified leads on hospital beds, ventilators and oxygen cylinders across states. The second group then worked on the genuine information, connecting patients with their needs — from Meerut to Nagpur, Kolkata to Bengaluru. They have by now helped hundreds. "The strategy was simple," Ansh, a resident of Saharanpur and student of Class 12, told TOI. "Good information has the power to save lives. The idea was floated and Avani and Rishay, both from Meerut, came in. We had to develop a database of verified leads that could be passed on to people in need, and on time." Avani, 17, added, "Whenever there’s a demand for something, a hospital bed in Chandigarh perhaps, we immediately contact our network source in that city who has access to the real data on beds there. We then quickly call the hospital for confirmation and the needy person is directed to that facility." Some 110 volunteers in the primary WhatsApp group continuously keep track of leads and update the database. Then the other group takes over. TOI contacted some of the families, in different parts of India, who had got help from these students. Devraj Khunteta, a Jaipur resident, was one of them. "My grandmother was in dire need of a ventilator. Most hospitals had beds but no ventilator. It was then that I sent across messages to my friends and one of them connected with this group. I was immediately sent verified information and I got a ventilator." In Delhi, Anoma Jayant got a bed for her uncle in the nick of time. And in Bengaluru, Elakkana P got AB negative blood. One of the volunteers, Sripriya Chowdhury, 18, said she takes care of "Kolkata region". "I generate authentic leads for my city," she said. "It is a strenuous task. But then it is a matter of life and death. If someone gets an oxygen cylinder in time, it saves a life. It's a noble cause and spending two hours daily is not a big deal."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/3-teens-connect-patients-with-hospital-beds-and-o2/articleshow/82814671.cms||Sandeep Rai

This is a veiled reference to China’s coercive actions on supplies both in the first and second waves of the pandemic. There was a reference to the fact that countries went into extreme nationalist modes during the pandemic. “Few practiced what they preach-ed. Some even stopped preaching altogether,” Jaishankar said. “Call it buying nationally, middle-class concerns, dual circulation of self-reliance — there is no question that many polities are seeking to hedge against excessive exposure internationally.” Read AlsoIndia can de-risk global economy through more effective partnerships, says JaishankarNEW DELHI: External affairs minister S.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said his security cabinet had voted unanimously in favour of a "mutual and unconditional" Gaza truce proposed by Egypt, but added that the hour of implementation had yet to be agreed. Hamas and Egypt said the truce would begin at 2am. (2100 GMT Thursday), ending 11 days of Israeli-Palestinian hostilities. Within minutes of the announcements, in the countdown to the ceasefire, the sides were trading blows again. Sirens warned of incoming rockets in Israeli border communities, and a Reuters reporter heard an air strike in Gaza. There was no immediate word of casualties. Amid growing global alarm at the bloodshed, US President Joe Biden urged Netanyahu on Wednesday to seek de-escalation, while Egypt, Qatar and the United Nations sought to mediate. Biden was due to deliver remarks on the Middle East at 5.45pm Washington-time (2145 GMT), the White House said. Hamas said the ceasefire would be "mutual and simultaneous". "The Palestinian resistance will abide by this agreement as long as the Occupation (Israel) does the same," Taher Al-Nono, media adviser to Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh, told Reuters. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi had ordered two security delegations into Israel and the Palestinian Territories to work towards upholding the ceasefire, Egyptian state TV reported. In a televised speech Abu Ubaida, spokesman of the Hamas armed wing, said: "With the help of God, we were able to humiliate the enemy, its fragile entity and its savage army." He threatened Hamas rocket fire that would reach throughout Israel if it violated the truce or struck Gaza before the hour of implementation. Rocket attacks by Hamas and the allied Islamic Jihad had resumed after an eight-hour pause earlier on Thursday, as Israel pursued shelling that it said aimed to destroy the factions' military capabilities and deter them from future confrontations after the current conflict. Israeli defence minister Benny Gantz said on Twitter that the Gaza offensive had yielded "unprecedented military gains". Speaking to his US counterpart Lloyd Austin, Gantz said Israel's defence establishment would "continue to work closely and in full cooperation with the Pentagon and the US administration to stabilise the region," Gantz's office said. Since the fighting began on May 10, health officials in Gaza said 232 Palestinians, including 65 children, had been killed and more than 1,900 wounded in aerial bombardments. Israel said it had killed at least 160 combatants in Gaza. Authorities put the death toll in Israel at 12, with hundreds of people treated for injuries in rocket attacks that caused panic and sent people rushing into shelters. The violence was triggered by Palestinian anger at what they saw as Israeli curbs on their rights in Jerusalem, including during police confrontations with protesters at Al-Aqsa mosque. Hamas previously demanded that any halt to the Gaza fighting be accompanied by Israeli drawdowns in Jerusalem. An Israeli official told Reuters there was no such condition in the truce. "The only way there'll be a Hamas-Jerusalem linkage is if they agree to us drowning them on 'Jerusalem Beach' in Tel Aviv," security cabinet minister Tzachi Hanegbi told Israel's top-rated Channel 12 TV earlier on Thursday. Biden discussed Gaza with Sisi and the White House said reports of moves toward a ceasefire were "encouraging". Hamas is deemed a terrorist group in the West and by Israel, which it refuses to recognise. The United Nations said its Middle East envoy, Tor Wennesland, was in Qatar on Thursday as part of truce efforts.

Explaining the government decision to make a three month interval mandatory for Covishield, ICMR head Dr Balram Bhargava said the immunity post the first shot was found to be quite strong. He said a three-month gap will give the best results. “On the other hand, immunity level after the first shot of Covaxin is not as high and this means the second dose should be taken after four weeks to ensure full efficacy,” Dr Bhargava said. He said the recommendation that those who contracted Covid after the first dose wait three months for vaccination was based on assessment that those who recover from the disease have anti-bodies. “It is not clear how long the anti-bodies last...So it is advised that vaccination be completed after a three-month interval,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covaxin-shots-gap-unchanged-as-protection-after-1st-dose-not-high/articleshow/82815782.cms||---

The state has sought quashing of two paragraphs in the FIR and a halt to a ‘roving’ probe into dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Waze’s reinstatement, besides Deshmukh’s alleged “exercise of undue influence” over police transfers and postings. It said the CBI has gone “beyond’ the HC’s April 5 order for a preliminary enquiry into the allegations of ex-Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh claiming malpractices by Deshmukh as minister. Param Bir Singh’s March 20 letter to CM Uddhav Thackeray didn’t refer to Waze or police transfers, the state counsel said, adding that the HC had clearly given Singh liberty to raise his grievances regarding postings and transfers before an appropriate forum. Opposing the state’s petition, additional SG S V Raju, for the CBI, said the HC had observed that “there can be no fair probe by the state”, while ordering the preliminary enquiry. The vacation bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and S P Tavade adjourned the matter to Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/maharashtra-seeks-partial-stay-on-anil-deshmukh-probe/articleshow/82816442.cms||Swati Deshpande

On Thursday, Adani went past Zhong Shanshan, the head of a China-based beverages-to-pharma conglomerate. Globally, Ambani is the 13th richest, while Adani is at the 14th place. As of Thursday, Adani’s total net worth was $66.5 billion compared to Zhong Shanshan’s $63.6 billion and Ambani’s $76.5 billion, according to Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Adani’s wealth has surged by $32.7 billion this year, while Ambani has lost $175.5 million, a report by Bloomberg said. Adani’s meteoric rise in fortunes happened in the last one year since May 2020, as the stock price of each of the group’s six listed companies have galloped northward, BSE data showed. From about $20 billion at the start of May last year, the Adani Group’s aggregate market capitalisation is now nearly $115 billion — a rise of nearly six times. In comparison, the Reliance Group’s aggregate market cap has moved up from nearly $125 billion to a little over $178 billion now. In the last one year, the stock of Adani Total Gas has rallied 1,145%, the most among all the six group companies. In addition, Adani Enterprises has jumped 827%, Adani Transmission 617%, Adani Green Energy 433% and Adani Power 189%. The least of the gains was recorded in Adani Power stock that has rallied 142%. Over this one year, the group, which has also been mired in a huge controversy because of a large buyout of a coal mine in Queensland in Australia, has signed a large number of deals in India. As a result, it now has a strong presence in sectors as diverse as ports, airports, energy, resources, logistics, packaged foods, agribusiness, real estate, financial services, gas distribution and defence-related manufacturing. On Wednesday, Adani Green Energy said that it will acquire SB Energy, SoftBank’s Indian renewable energy business, for an enterprise value of $3.5 billion. In March, Adani Group also bought out its partners’ stakes in a port in Andhra Pradesh. In September last year, it also took control of Mumbai and upcoming Navi Mumbai airports and entered into long-term lease of six more airports with the government — one each in Ahmedabad, Guwahati, Jaipur, Lucknow, Mangaluru and Thiruvananthapuram.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/adani-with-67bn-is-asias-2nd-richest/articleshow/82811897.cms||---

The appointment follows the RBI’s direction to ensure adherence to the minimum qualification criteria for the position of CFO. Sitaram is a qualified chartered accountant and has over 15 years of experience in handling finance and accounts and taxation matters in IDBI Bank. The RBI’s directive to banks to appoint qualified CAs as CFO is compelling banks to cast a wider net in their search for candidates. Besides the academic qualification, RBI requires the CFO to have 15 years of experience in overseeing financial operations such as accounting and taxation and most of it in a bank or financial institution. SBI had appointed former EY partner Charanjit Surinder Singh Attra as CFO in September last year after advertising for the position. The bank had offered an annual cost to the company of Rs 75 lakh to Rs 1 crore which was almost thrice of what the chairman earned at that time. The RBI too hired laterally for the CFO position. The central bank had appointed Sudha Balakrishnan a CA and former director with National Securities Depositories Limited (NSDL) as its CFO in 2018.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/idbi-replaces-cfo-over-rbis-ca-diktat/articleshow/82811977.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

This includes Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara, Rajkot and other 32 cities. However, night curfew will remain in force from 8 pm to 6 am in all 36 cities until May 28. The decision to allow all commercial establishments to remain for six hours daily was taken by a high level committee chaired by CM Vijay Rupani, even as the daily number of persons testing positive for Covid-19 fell below 5,000 on Thursday. A notification to this effect was issued on Thursday night by the government. Trade bodies had been making repeated representations to the state government, seeking a relaxation in limited lockdown. Other than those providing essential services, all commercial establishments in 36 cities of Gujarat had been asked to remain shut to prevent further spread of the pandemic. “All shops, commercial establishments, hand carts, shopping complexes, marketing yards, hair cutting saloons., beauty parlours and other establishments will be allowed to remain functional from 9 am to 3 pm. Restaurants will be allowed to provide takeaway services from 9 am to 8 pm,” the home department notification said. A maximum of 50 persons will be allowed for wedding ceremonies and people will be required to seek permission on the Digital Gujarat portal. 20 persons will be allowed to attend the final rites of a person. The notification said that all establishments will be allowed to function with not more than 50 % attendance and public bus services will also function with just 50% capacity. Traders have welcomed the government decision of allowing shops and commercial establishments to reopen. “The decision is exactly in line with our demands to allow shops and establishments to function once again, albeit for a limited period of time. This will breathe life into the retail trade which has remained shut for over three weeks now. We have made an appeal to the traders to adhere to all social distancing and other Covid-protocol related norms in interest of their own and the people's safety," said Jayendra Tanna, president, Gujarat Traders' Federation (GTF). Dr Devendra Patel, president of Indian Medical Association (IMA) Gujarat Chapter, told TOI that IMA had written a letter to the CM recently, requesting him to extend the restrictions till May 31. "But we understand that the government also faced pressure from trade bodies. The cases have recorded a sharp decline in the past few days, and it is our responsibility now to maintain the low numbers," he said. "We don't have anything against the businesses - but we appeal to the citizens not to venture out without good reason and follow all protocols such as social distancing, double masking and use of sanitizer to reduce the spread."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/daily-cases-below-5k-guj-opensfor-business-between-9am-3pm/articleshow/82811649.cms||---

Guzzling down chilled beer and lazing around on pristine beaches, tourists, most of them from Gujarat, were the main drivers of this scenic Union territory's economy. One could never get enough of the simple ride on rented scooters as they traversed the roads lined up with coconut trees, which epitomized the beauty of this place. But drive through the town today and you are greeted with depressing scenes of uprooted trees, hotels with glasses and windows shattered and blown away shades. According to officials, nearly 7,000 trees are lying uprooted on the roads. The beach town famed for its Portuguese style architecture is a pale shadow of its past glory. Never before in the last several decades has Diu witnessed such a devastation left behind by Cyclone Tauktae that roared into Gujarat from this coast on Monday night. Tauktae pounded Diu for nearly nine hours with wind speed of nearly 170-180 kmph beginning Monday evening. The only people seen are teams of administration who are painstakingly trying to clear the roads of trees. Ghoghla got Blue Flag certification last OctoberIt was only in October last year that Ghoghla beach in Diu had earned the prestigious ‘Blue Flag’ certification granted to clean, safe and environment-friendly beaches, marinas and sustainable boating tourism operators. In fact, the administration persevered to earn this coveted title and spent around Rs 22 crore in 2018 to meet the criteria for Blue Flag tag. Chandresh Solanki, Ghoghla beach manager, said, “Several structures including canopies, showers, toilet blocks, and changing rooms were shattered by the cyclone. The beauty of this beach was the plantation which has also flattened.” A team of 32 people were engaged in managing the beach after getting the Blue Flag status, but currently there are around 11 only since March-end due to Covid-induced situation. Besides its cleanliness and safety, Ghoghla beach was preferred by tourists as liquor is not permitted here and guards are constantly on the move to ensure there is no nuisance. Amenities on the beach were developed as per the norms of Foundation of Environmental Education (FEE) that awards the Blue Flag status. The beach has a demarcated swimming zone, bamboo canopies for seating, showers, changing rooms for men and women, toilet blocks, a well-developed garden and recreation facility for children. There is a watch tower where a guard is deputed to see that nobody drowns while swimming in the sea. It has now gained more popularity over Nagoa beach. “To retain the status of Blue Flag for Ghoghla, we have to apply every year. This year we have already applied for it and before the team of certification visits, we will restore the beauty of this beach, ” said Solanki.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/under-tauktae-influence-diu-drowns-in-low-spirits/articleshow/82811770.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

Appearing for the Centre, additional solicitor general KN Singh submitted that the increased daily quota of oxygen is 270 metric tonnes and not 400MT as stated earlier. He cited miscommunication by an additional secretary-rank officer. Singh came forward to submit soon after the division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Kumar started the hearing on PILs of Shivani Kaushik, Rohit Kumar and Gaurav Kumar Singh filed over the grim pandemic situation. Singh urged the bench that his submission be taken on record and updated. On Monday, Singh submitted that Bihar’s daily oxygen quota has been increased to 400 metric tonnes. Meanwhile, the bench rapped the Patna Municipal Corporation for filing an unsatisfactory counter-affidavit on Thursday. On Tuesday, the court had asked how the corporation was collecting and disposing of bio-medical wastes such as PPE kits, masks, testing kits generated in the area under its jurisdiction, but the reply was not present in the affidavit. Corporation counsel Prasoon Sinha faced the high court's ire over the unsatisfactory affidavit, filed through him by municipal commissioner Himanshu Rai. It directed Sinha to file a fresh affidavit giving details as per order. The state government is yet to file its reply over the report of a three-member technical committee headed by Dr Umesh Kumar Bhadani of AIIMS-Patna. Advocate general Lalit Kishore requested the court on Thursday for granting time, which was allowed, and the hearing was fixed for May 25. The court expressed its satisfaction with a supplementary affidavit filed by the PMCH superintendent Dr Indra Shekhar Thakur stating that the oxygen issue highlighted by amicus curiae Mrigank Mauli and other issues like hygiene and food facilities for patients have been addressed. Mauli at this point submitted that an inspection be carried by the 13-member high powered technical committee headed by the AIIMS-Patna director at PMCH but the court did not entertain it. Senior counsel PK Shahi appearing for the PMCH submitted that a committee has been formed for looking at oxygen supply arrangements, hygiene and food, and for grievances of attendants. Senior counsel SD Sanjay urged that the committee formed in PMCH must be advertised to common people to which the court asked AG to look into it. The matter has been listed for hearing on Friday too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/centre-to-hc-bihars-daily-oxygen-quota-is-270mt-not-400mt/articleshow/82809539.cms||Debashish Karmakar

This portable kit will help timely detection of covid and control the spread of this viral disease. According to an advisory issued by the ICMR, the user is supposed to buy a CoviSelf kit, a type of Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) kit, and download the Mylab app on his mobile phone. The mobile app is a comprehensive guide of the testing procedure and will provide a positive or negative test result to the patient. Only nasal swab will be required RAT. Former president of state unit of IMA, Dr Rajiv Ranjan Prasad said, “The CoviSelf kit is a boon in disguise as it would help minimise the spread of infections. As all tests to be carried out by this kit would be centrally managed, it will help the medial bodies and the policy makers in monitoring prompt treatment of positive people. Test at home would avoid unwarranted rush at various testing labs and reduce chances of getting infected due to the huge rush at the testing centres.” Dr Prasad, however, pointed out that that only symptomatic individuals and people who were in immediate contact of people who tested positive in the laboratory should use this home test. “Indiscriminate testing is not advised,” he added. Viral disease expert Dr Arun Shah said this rapid antigen test is at least 50% effective as it easily screens positive cases. “All individuals who test positive may be considered as true positives and no repeat testing is required. However, all symptomatic individuals who test negative by RAT should get themselves immediately tested by RT-PCR,” he said. He further pointed out that this test is relatively cheaper and time saving. A person can have the kit at about Rs 250 and the result of the test would be made available within 15 minutes. “This ‘point of care’ testing kit is as good as rapid malaria or kalazar testing kit of earlier times. It would certainly help detect infection in asymptomatic cases and help control transmission of the virus,” Dr Shah added. Patna University (PU) Central Dispensary’s chief medical officer Dr Anil Kumar welcomed ICMR’s approval of the CoviSelfTM (PathoCatch) Covid-19 OTC Antigen LF device created by the Pune-based Mylab Discovery Solutions Ltd and said it would go a long way in retarding the rate of viral infections in the country. He said the home test should be conducted according to the process described in the mobile app wḥich will provide a positive or negative result to the patient. The data to be centrally captured in a secure server linked with the testing portal will serve a very useful purpose in combating the disease, he added. PU biotechnology teacher Prof Birendra Prasad pointed out that such home tests were already being done in UK and USA and giving much relief to people suspected to have covid infections. This simple test would indicate in no time the positivity or negativity of infection and the people found positive may isolate themselves and start proper treatment without any delay. This would certainly save a lot of lives, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/experts-hail-icmr-nod-to-self-use-kit/articleshow/82809456.cms||B K Mishra

---||Patna||Cyclone Tauktae: Rain brings temperature down in Bihar||PATNA: In between the departure of cyclone Tauktae and onset of southwest monsoon, Bihar got a prelude of the rainy season on Thursday as many places in the state received light to moderate rainfall, paving way for breezy weather in the peak summer month. Patna Meteorological Centre said in its afternoon bulletin that light to moderate rainfall occurred at a few places in the state during the last 24 hours. Places which received significant rainfall included Mohania (60mm), Patna (58mm), Siwan (50mm) and Motihari (40mm). The rainfall in Patna was incidentally highest in the month of May since 2013, when the state capital had received 92.2mm rainfall on May 31. Also, the rainy weather and cloud cover led to perhaps the coldest day in the otherwise scorching month of May as the maximum temperature in Patna plunged 26.6 degrees C on Thursday, 11 notches lower than normal for the day. Similar drop in temperature was witnessed in Gaya where the maximum temperature stood at 28 degrees C, 12 notches lower than normal. Most other districts witnessed rainfall and thunderstorm and weathermen have issued a forecast for similar weather conditions on Friday as well, though it will gradually reduce in intensity. The inclement weather is likely to be comparatively more intense in eastern parts of the state on Friday as yellow-colour warning has been issued by Patna Meteorological Centre for districts like Kishanganj, Supaul, Madhepura, Saharsa, Araria, Purnia, Katihar, Bhagalpur, Banka, Munger, Khagaria and Jamui. Partly cloudy skies have been predicted in Patna on Friday and clear skies from Saturday onwards. Shailendra Kumar Patel, an official at Patna Meteorological Centre, said light to moderate rainfall would occur at a few places in the state over the next 48 hours. “The maximum temperature is likely to be several notches lower than normal during the period. After two days, westerly and north-westerly winds are likely to prevail in the state,” Patel said. While the maximum temperature will again rise with westerly winds setting in the state after 48 hours, southwest monsoon is expected to make its onset in Bihar around June 15-18.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tauktae-impact-rain-brings-temp-down/articleshow/82808710.cms||Piyush Tripathi

The plants, which are expected to become functional soon, will cater to the needs of patients at five divisional railway hospitals and a superspecialty hospital at the Karbighaiya end of Patna Junction. ECR chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar said the oxygen plants would be set up at the divisional railway hospitals at Danapur, Sonepur, Samastipur, Pt Deen Dayal Upadhyaya and Dhanbad. The five divisional railway hospitals and the superspecialty hospital in Patna have been dependent for oxygen supply on different agencies. ECR superspecialty hospital chief medical director Dr R K Verma said the process to set up the plant would start soon. “The superspecialty hospital has four invasive ventilators, 20 ICU beds and 30 isolation beds for the for the Covid patients,” he added. Railways has already converted its 120-bed divisional hospital at Danapur into a Covid-dedicated hospital for the railway employees. “This hospital is equipped with ventilator and ICU facilities for the treatment of Covid patients,” the CPRO said. The CPRO said the Railway Board has approved setting up of at least 86 more oxygen plants at railway hospitals across the country. Of them, four plants have already been made functional. The Railway Board has delegated power with the general manager to spend Rs 2 crore for sanctioning oxygen generation plants in each zone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/oxygen-plants-to-be-set-up-at-six-railway-hosps/articleshow/82808487.cms||Kumod Verma

While inspecting the waterlogging prevention works in the state capital on Thursday, commissioner of the Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC), Himanshu Sharma, claimed that 90% of the big drains had already been cleaned. Sharma, who led a team of officials of the PMC and the Bihar Urban Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited, assessed the situation in waterlogging-prone areas like Rajendra Nagar and concluded that the rainwater was drained away in less than two hours. At present, PMC workers are sanitizing different areas, cremating bodies, managing the session sites set up for the vaccination drive, running community kitchens and performing monsoon preparedness works. PMC’s public relations officer Harshita told this newspaper, “During the last two months, the primary task of our workers was to conduct disinfection drives for curbing the spread of coronavirus and manage corpses. Now that the monsoon season is around the corner, they are also being engaged in drain and manhole cleaning works.” Bodies continue to be cremated: As the number of Covid deaths remains high, the visuals at Patna’s crematoriums are chilling. Altogether eight corpses had been cremated at the Bans Ghat alone by 1pm on Thursday. “April was a nightmare because nearly 70 corpses were cremated every day. The process of cremating one body takes around 45 minutes and 400 kg wood,” said Raj Kumar, who looks after the Bans Ghat crematorium. Covid corpses are also being cremated at the Gulbi, Khajekala, Digha and Nandgola ghats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/pmc-boss-90-of-big-drains-cleaned/articleshow/82808734.cms||---
---||Business||Don’t panic-sell bitcoin in crash: Crypto startups||MUMBAI: Indian crypto entrepreneurs are urging investors not to panic-sell assets like bitcoin and ether after prices crashed over 30% this week. According to cryptocurrency exchanges, investors should decide if they can sustain with locked funds for 3-4 years, and use only risk capital for what would be more of an allocation for long-term appreciation. These digital exchanges facilitate trading for most of the 1 crore Indian investors in highly volatile cryptocurrency assets. Users of some of these platforms were unable to place their orders due to the high volume of trading on Wednesday. While investing or trading in cryptocurrencies is a legal grey area, Indians owned about Rs 10,000 crore worth of such assets as of February. “The market faced a bull run for three months, but a correction has just kicked in. This was expected to happen as the stability of the industry decreased,” said Sathvik Vishwanath, co-founder and CEO of Unocoin, which — founded in 2013 — is one of India’s oldest crypto bourses. “Corrections are normal in financial markets. Crypto markets especially see such ups and downs in prices. Investors should remain calm during such dips and look at long-term gains,” said Raj Karkara, CMO of ZebPay, which was founded in 2015. Crypto entrepreneurs stressed that investors should allocate risk capital if one is entering or averaging. “Investors should make sure they use only risk capital, which they can afford to lose, so they are less likely to panic if it (correction) happens,” Karkara said. Industry people said market crashes are not alien to cryptocurrencies, and that bull runs after corrections have given returns in multiples. “We have not seen a dip of this magnitude in crypto for long. It is unsettling but what we are seeing and the reason why most exchanges are under heavy load is because there are a lot of new people and a lot of buying pressure and that will help the markets to bounce back,” said Nischal Shetty, co-founder and CEO of WazirX, one of India’s largest crypto exchanges. WazirX faced an outage as it claims to have recorded a 400% surge in traffic on Wednesday compared to the previous month. Crypto investors, who may be stuck at high prices, too should not panic-sell, according to them. “In these times, it is important for investors to decide if they can sustain with the locked funds due to a downtrend for 3-4 years and, if so, sitting tight appears to be the better option than going into a panic-sell mode,” Vishwanath said. “Investors with a horizon of 2-3 years will make profit, and Wednesday’s drop was a paper loss and not an actual one as the market has recovered since then. Investors should wait for the next rally for profit-booking,” said Shivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, which was founded in 2016. Crypto startups also said that regulation will help restore investor faith. “A strong remedy to restore investor faith in the alternate investment class will require the government to frame regulations to safeguard investor money. We have always advised retail users to make informed decisions after evaluating their risk-taking capabilities,” said Monark Modi, founder and CEO of Bitex, which was founded in 2018. Investors must not succumb to FOMO (fear of missing out) while making investing decisions nor should they expect to make a quick buck, the exchanges added. “The best way to manage volatility and avoid emotional and financial extremes is to use rupee cost averaging and SIPs. Buy a little bit at regular intervals without trying to guess what the low is and without FOMO. This will give better returns in the long term,” Karkara said. Modi too said investors should not follow the trend of entering the crypto space when prices dip and exiting when they balloon, and instead have SIP plans to average out volatility cycles. However, Nithin Kamath, founder and CEO of stock broker Zerodha, referring to the crypto crash in a series of tweets, said, “While it is tempting to average down, the odds of this strategy working are significantly low in the long run … The right way, for most people, is to not have concentrated positions.” Bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency, gained over 300% in 2020 to about $30,000. The rally continued in 2021 as well and bitcoin hit a lifetime high of $64,000 in mid-April before crashing to a low of $31,000 on Wednesday. At its high, bitcoin had a market capitalisation of over $1 trillion with growing acceptance by Wall Street as a store of value, led by Elon Musk’s electric vehicle company Tesla. The price has crashed over two main factors: First, Musk recently announced Tesla won’t accept bitcoin payments till its environmental concerns are addressed. Second, China’s central bank warned financial companies from facilitating cryptocurrency trades. Bitcoin pared some of its losses after Musk’s tweet on Wednesday: “Tesla has diamond hands”, which indicated it is not selling bitcoin. At 10pm on Thursday, bitcoin was up 6% at $39,500. On Thursday, Franklin Templeton India’s chief investment officer Anand Radhakrishnan tweeted: “What good is a fall, if the price is still 90% higher than where it was 6 months back & significantly higher than a year back. Call it a blip! #crypto”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/dont-panic-sell-bitcoin-in-crash-crypto-startups/articleshow/82811766.cms||Aseem Gujar

These may be a precursor to the dreaded mucormycosis. Along with MM treatment, doctors advise getting an MRI scan of the brain done. For, condition of brain mucormycosis may go unnoticed until a patient suffers from epilepsy or becomes unconscious. Surat doctors recently came across a rare case of MM infection in the brain of a 23-year-old patient from Kosamba while his sinus, eyes and lungs, which are usually found infected in MM patients, were completely unaffected. In fact, it was a case study for the doctors too who learnt about MM infection in the brain after conducting a surgery and biopsy. “The patient started having fits and hence got MRI scans done. It showed brain edema which gradually increased, and his body movements were also slowing down. He was, therefore, brought to Surat,” said Dr Hitesh Chitroda, a neurosurgeon. Read AlsoCoronavirus black fungus infection: Signs, symptoms and everything we know about the deadly fungal infectionThe surgeon further said that after CT scans showed that there was midline shift due to pressure, they conducted a brain surgery to decrease pressure. The surgery was done by Dr Chitroda along with Dr Maulik Patel and Dr Rakesh Bharodiya, a biopsy of brain tissues. “Biopsy report suggested mucormycosis infection in the brain, which surprised us as his sinus was unaffected. In usual case, the sinus gets infected first and then brain is affected,” he said. Doctors suspect that the patient may have dissemminated mucormycosis in which the infection spreads through blood streams and most commonly affects the brain. “I have never come across or heard of post-Covid isolated brain MM infection. Hence, this could be the first such reported case,” Dr Chitroda told TOI. Advisory issued by Indian Council of Medical Research for screening, diagnosis and management of mucormycosis does not mention about symptoms like fits and brain edema.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/mm-found-in-covid-cured-patients-brain/articleshow/82806843.cms||Jay Pachchigar

---||Business||PSU bank employees to get small windfall as incentive||MUMBAI: Employees of many public sector banks are in for a small windfall due to the performance-linked component in the wage agreement signed with the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) in November 2020. Canara Bank this week paid out a performance-linked incentive to its employees, equivalent to 15 days’ pay, soon after announcing its financial results. This followed the bank reporting a net profit of Rs 2,557 crore for FY21 as compared to a Rs 5,838-crore loss in the preceding year. Bank of Maharashtra, one of the earliest to report its results, had posted a net profit of Rs 165 crore for the fourth quarter, an increase of 187%. The Pune-based bank has also distributed a performance-linked incentive to its employees. State Bank of India, the largest employer with 2.5 lakh employees, is also expected to announce an improvement in profits. Brokerage firm Sharekhan has forecast an 82% rise in its third quarter profits. In terms of the wage agreement, employees would get an incentive of five days’ salary if their bank reported an increase in operating profit of between 5% and 10%, and 10 days’ if the increase is between 10% and 15%, and 15 days for any increase above 15%. This is available to all employees irrespective of their rank or designation. Unions had strongly opposed linking their salaries to the performance of the bank. Their position was that the financial performance depends on the government policies over which they have no control. Also, most of the losses were on account of large corporate loans which are decided at the top level. However, the IBA had insisted on the clause to reward better-performing banks and to inculcate a sense of competition among employees of public sector banks. Despite the pandemic, most public sector banks are expected to improve their performance over the previous year. This is because by the time they finalised their results for FY20, the entire nation was in a lockdown and many banks made significant provisions for Covid impact. Also, the bad loan provisioning that banks have had to make since the RBI forced their hand through its asset quality recognition in 2016 has finally achieved completion. Third, the four acquiring banks last year made significant fair value provisioning in the 10-bank mega merger. As a result, most public sector banks are expected to report a profit during the current fiscal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/psu-bank-employees-to-get-small-windfall-as-incentive/articleshow/82811834.cms||Mayur Shetty

Ganga Kumar Choudhary, who runs a tent and crockery business, was returning home around 7 am when several shots were fired at him by two bike-borne persons, police said, adding one of the bullets lodged in his back. Miraculously, he did not lose his balance and accelerated his two-wheeler and stopped only after entering the Buddha Colony police station premises, according to police sources. Sub-inspector Arvind Kumar rushed him to the PMCH from where he was shifted to a private hospital. Choudhary is reported to be out of danger. Hee has lodged an FIR with the Buddha Colony police station against one Randhir Yadav of Pahalwan Ghat in Dujra and another unknown person for shooting at him. Police said Randhir is accused in several criminal cases. Quoting the FIR, police said Choudhary has alleged that he spotted Randhir fired at him, but could not recognise the person behind him as he was wearing a helmet. The sub-inspector said Choudhary failed to say why he was shot at. “Further investigation would clear things up,” he said. Police sources said Thursday's incident is likely related to gang rivalry over extortion and land grabbing activities. “Choudhary is a close aide of a notorious criminal Sipul who is evading arrest. Sipul and his associates are accused in the murder case of Vikash Yadav who was shot at on the night of Holi when he was returning home on a bike. He died after a few days during treatment,” a police officer said. He said Randhir is Vikash’s younger brother. “Sipul wanted to kill Randhir but mistakenly fire at Vikash. Police suspect that Thursday’s incident was to take revenge of Vikash’s murder,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/trader-rides-to-police-station-after-getting-shot-cops-suspect-gang-rivalry/articleshow/82808440.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The bank had floated a Rs 1,000-crore issue and chose to retain an additional Rs 447 crore under the green-shoe option. The committee of directors of the bank approved the issue price of Rs 33.8 per equity share of Rs 10 each, which is at a 5% discount to the floor price of Rs 35.6 as determined according to Sebi regulations. Shares of Union Bank of India closed at Rs 36.85 on Thursday. The issue will help the bank reduce the share of government holding, which stood at 89% as of March 2021. It will result in a dilution of around 6% of the present capital and boost the capital adequacy ratio of the bank. Earlier Canara Bank and Punjab National bank and IDBI Bank had raised funds through the qualified institutional placement route.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/union-bank-raises-rs-1447cr-via-qip-route/articleshow/82812019.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata youth in hospital with suspected black fungus||KOLKATA: A city youth was admitted to CMRI with suspected black fungus late on Thursday night. This is the first case in which black fungus-like symptoms have been found in a local resident. The patient’s samples will be sent for confirmatory biopsy and the state health department is tracking the case. State health department said five cases of black fungus were recently reported in the state and only two were after Covid infection. On May 15, TOI reported four black fungus cases, but all from Bihar and Jharkhand. “We have Amphotericin B so there should not be much problem for this drug. We are trying to develop some guidelines and are collecting data from all districts,” said state director of health services Ajay Chabraborty. CMRI Hospital sources said the patient had been under treatment for Covid for about two weeks in another private hospital in Kolkata, but was referred here after showing symptoms of black fungus. “Our ENT surgeon has evaluated the patient where a black lesion has been found in his nasal passage. Because of this, we highly suspect this is a case of black fungus. Biopsy reports will confirm it,” said R Shyam Krishnan, consultant intervention pulmonologist at CMRI. The hospital said that once the report confirms it, Swasthya Bhawan will be intimated. Last week, a patient in her mid-60s was referred to CMRI with massive swelling in the eye. But she died before any confirmatory test for mucormycosis, or black fungus, could be done. Highly diabetic, this patient had suffered from Covid pneumonia and had steroid treatment. “This fungus is normally found in the environment. While it cannot harm people with good immunity, those whose immune system is suppressed can be hit hard. Covid patients who are diabetic and have been on prolonged steroid treatment and high oxygen support are most susceptible,” said Anirban Dalui, public health specialist at Swasthya Bhawan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kol-youth-in-hosp-with-suspected-black-fungus/articleshow/82810000.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Patna||Patna: Now, doctors warn of white fungus||PATNA: Not only black, but white fungus too may prove fatal if it finds passage to lungs in immune-compromised people, including Covid patients and those who have recovered from it, experts said. Though no case of white fungal infection in Covid patients has been reported from any hospital in the city, medical experts have sounded an alert. They said white fungus (Candida and Aspergillus) reaching the lungs could pose a new challenge. Though no case of white fungus in any Covid patient, during or after treatment, has been reported at Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH), the hospital’s head of microbiology department Dr S N Singh said presence of Candida was detected in the lungs of four patients, including two who have recovered from Covid, in his private microbiology lab. He said though RT-PCR and antibody test reports of both patients came negative, HRCT scan showed high load of white fungal infection in their lungs. He said the oxygen saturation dips in such cases and patients feel breathlessness. “However, timely treatment helps patients recover fast,” he added. NMCH superintendent Dr Binod Kumar Singh said hot and humid environment, diabetic condition and staying on oxygen support for long were the main causes of black and white fungal infection. “The chances of late emergence of white fungus in recovered patients cannot be ruled out,” Dr Binod added. Dr Sanjeev Kumar of AIIMS-Patna said in case of white fungus infection in vital organs in people with weak immunity, surgery is the only option. “Be it black or white, all fungal infections in vital organs could be fatal,” he added. Dr Anil Kumar, head of trauma and emergency at AIIMS-Patna, said apart from fungus, many rare bacterial and other microorganism-caused new symptoms may emerge in Covid and post-Covid patients in the days to come. He said since the hospitals with specialist doctors regularly keep watch on new symptoms in patients and carry out investigations, such infections are easily detected. “However, if it remains undetected, the possibility of which is very high in case of patients in home isolation or those being guided by unskilled practitioners and quacks, the complications due to fungal infection could lead to serious conditions,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/now-doctors-warn-of-white-fungus/articleshow/82809492.cms||VK Tripathi

Do not ignore post-Covid complications||PATNA: Hundreds of patients may have won the battle against coronavirus, but quite a few of them are now experiencing post-Covid complications like extreme weakness, body ache, muscle pain, consistent cough and lung infection. Experts advise them to observe their condition and get in touch with doctors immediately. Consulting physician Dr Israrul Haque claims that many Covid recovered patients feel weak and are unable to resume their normal routine. Some even have low fever, body ache, muscle pain and cough. “In some cases, the problems are mild while in others, they tend to be serious even after the patients recover and test negative,” Dr Haque says and urges them to get basic tests like complete blood count, RFT, LFT, CRP, serum ferritin, IL-6 and D-dimer done. Paediatrician Dr Arun Shah recalls, “Post-Covid complications were experienced by patients even during the first wave of Covid-19 last year.” He points out that several cases of mucormycosis or black fungus are being witnessed in the second wave. The disease’s symptoms, however, appear within the first three weeks of a person testing Covid positive. Dr Shah adds, “Since one of the reasons for post-Covid deaths is blood clotting, it is important to undergo a D-dimer test.” Doctors also advise people to perform breathing exercises, eat a healthy diet and stay happy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/won-battle-against-virus-do-not-ignore-post-covid-complications/articleshow/82809288.cms||Sheezan Nezami

District magistrate Abhishek Singh has directed the civil surgeon, Kamal Kishore Rai, at a meeting on Wednesday to ensure testing for Covid-19 at a ratio of 80:20 in rural and urban areas respectively on a war footing. He has asked all the circle officers to submit reports about high risk contact tracing in their respective jurisdictions to ensure collection of samples. “Monitoring of those in home isolation is being done through mobile application to immediately provide healthcare, when needed. About 95 % people in home isolation get recovered. The number of such cases has declined in the district. Medical kits have been made available to 1006 people in home isolation,” the DM said. Meanwhile, Anugrah Narayan Magadh Medical College and Hospital (ANMMCH) superintendent Harish Chandra Hari said in the meeting that some senior doctors and paramedical staff leave the headquarters without permission after their duty is over. The DM immediately asked the city SP Rakesh Kumar not to allow such doctors and the paramedical staff to go out of the district without e-passes. The superintendent also said that 129 patients were undergoing treatment at ANMMCH including 14 in ICU and four on ventilator support. The DM also appealed to the people to get themselves vaccinated and said that adequate stock is available in the district. For people above 45 years and for the second dose there is no need of registration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/focus-on-testing-in-rural-areas-gaya-dm/articleshow/82808689.cms||---

The letter, which allayed all her apprehensions of not making it to one of the most premier B-schools of the country, came on the day of Eid, which marks the end of holy month of Ramadan when Muslims across the world fast from dawn to dusk. Dr Bardai, who has completed her MBBS from BJ Medical College in Ahmedabad, was doing Covid duty as part of her medical internship when the final results for Common Admission Test (CAT) 2021 came in. “I felt as if my prayers were answered. I was doing Covid duty for about a year and found time only between two shifts or during the mandatory quarantine period to study for CAT. Yes, there were apprehensions but I am happy to make the cut in the end,” said Dr Bardai. Hailing from Rajkot, where she completed her schooling, Bardai belongs to a family of businessmen. Her father ran a business in Africa before moving to Saurashtra. “I think it is quite out of the box for medical professionals to go on to do an MBA. However, I believe there is a dire need for such people and the pandemic may have shown us why we need better management in healthcare and the medical field,” she said. Her goal is to eventually go into healthcare consulting and then stating a venture of her own. “So in all, I will always remain a doctor but I shall be utilizing my skills a bit differently.” She has been a bright student, always making it among the top 10 students at B J Medical college, considered as one of the top medical colleges of Gujarat. In Class 12 she scored 96.4% and ranked at number 30 in the merit list for medical colleges in Gujarat. At that time there were no mandatory NEET exams and admissions to medical colleges were based on Class 12 results and GUJCET score. Dr Bardai has served about seven duties for Covid-19 as part of her studies. Her stellar performance in academics continued as she scored 96 percentile to not only crack CAT 2021 but get interview calls from top B-schools of the country including IIM-Kozhikode, nine new IIMs, FMS Delhi and NMIMS, Mumbai. She has also cleared the decks for getting admission in NMIMS. “As a medical science student, I was used to studying for ten long hours. So, it was not a big challenge to study six hours a day for CAT. The bigger challenge was when Covid-19 cases began to rise and we had to step up our efforts and work relentlessly," according to Dr Bardai. Asked how she managed to crack the personal interview round, the last crucial stage before securing admission at IIM-Bangalore, Dr Bardai said that mock interview sessions prepared her really well for the actual interview. “Major part of my interview was about the shift that I am making and why I am doing so. And the other part was related to the business and innovation aspect of the healthcare sector. Immense reading in the couple of months prior to the interview about everything going around me helped me a lot. The most important aspect was to be myself and be very confident about what I say," she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/doctor-on-covid-duty-secures-iim-b-admission/articleshow/82811835.cms||Bharat Yagnik

Physicians, anesthesiologists and staff nurses were guided on critical care in the context of Covid-19 on the first day of the training session. The state is also in the process of training paediatricians across Bihar to tackle possible Covid-19 complications in children, who are likely to be affected in the third wave. The training session came after a letter was issued by the additional chief secretary (health), Pratyaya Amrit, on May 17 to all heads of government medical colleges and hospitals and civil surgeons. The letter stated that doctors and nurses of all government health institutes should be imparted training by AIIMS-Patna, which is a centre of excellence, and USAID, RISE, to enhance their Covid-19 managing capacity. On Thursday, nearly 300 healthcare workers joined this online training programme. Sources said an unprecedented rise in the number of Covid-19 cases in the second wave, and a lack of ICU management training, was among the reasons for organising this workshop. Programme officer of USAID, RISE, Dr A Kumar, said after the first phase training concludes on Friday, they will be conducting the second phase of the two-day training scheduled on May 27 and 28. The second phase will be for principals and superintendents along with the faculty members of medicine, anaesthesia, pulmonary medicine, community medicines, paediatrics and microbiology department. He further said a special training session would also be organised for paediatricians across the state in the first week of June, including those who have a private practice. “They will be trained in the first week of June and we expect nearly 1,200 paediatricians to be a part of our training programme,” said Dr Kumar. Apart from these virtual training sessions, a doctor and a nurse from each district will also be given hands-on training in ICU management.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/training-at-aiims-patna-for-doctors-health-workers-to-tackle-covid-3rd-wave/articleshow/82809353.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Man returns money after fake test row||KOLKATA: An alleged middleman was handed over to police and forced to return Rs 1,700 each to 21 residents of a high-rise in Entally after he allegedly faked RT-PCR tests and handed out false negative certificates following collection of swab samples. The cops, though, denied the accused had generated fake reports as alleged by the complainants and called it an “honest mistake” by the laboratory with which he had tied up. The complainants also alleged the accused had used old reports and QR code to pass off the reports as genuine. According to locals, when a resident of the building died from Covid complications on May 10, around 21 neighbours decided to get themselves tested. They contacted the accused who said he was attached to a laboratory in Park Circus. A laboratory employee came to the building and three days later, the reports were handed over. All 21 reports were negative, though a couple of them were displaying Covid symptoms. When the residents scanned the OR code of the report and tried to download them, they found they belonged to others and were from a year ago. Cops, though, said it was an error. “These are wrong reports and we have enquired with the laboratory. The accused had not forged any QR code. He had handed over old reports without knowing of the error,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/man-returns-money-after-fake-test-row/articleshow/82810194.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Both CBSE and CISCE have cancelled the Class X board exams and set a date for taking a call on the Class XII boards. “We have not considered cancellation the board examinations. The decline in Covid-19 cases gives us hope of a slide in infections and an improvement in the situation,” said education minister Bratya Basu. Several Teachers’ organisations and the examination conducting bodies have been repeatedly requesting the school education department to not cancel any of the examinations. “The schools have not conducted the test examinations this year as CM had announced that all students will be allowed to appear in Madhyamik and HS. How can the Madhyamik board derive a formula in absence of an evaluation sheet?” questioned a headmaster. Teachers’ organisations have also requested the minister not to cancel the Madhyamik examinations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-keeps-board-exams-hope-alive/articleshow/82810096.cms||Somdatta Basu
---||Patna||Bihar: Former Sheikhpura SP, SDPO face departmental proceedings||BIHARSHARIF: Munger range deputy inspector general (DIG) of police Shafiqul Haque on Thursday recommended departmental proceedings against the then Sheikhpura SP Daya Shankar and sub-divisional police officer (SDPO) Amit Sharan for their alleged involvement in protecting accused policemen, who had fraudulently transferred in their accounts over Rs 50 lakh meant for payment of increment to cops in the district between January 2015 and October 2018. Daya Shankar is presently posted as Purnia SP and Amit Sharan is posted in Patna. In his strong-worded letter of recommendation to the police headquarters for action against the accused police officers, the DIG wrote, “The then Sheikhpura SP Daya Shankar and SDPO Amit Sharan misused their powers to protect policemen, who were accused of fraudulently withdrawing over Rs 50 lakh meant for the added salaries of their colleagues between 2015 and 2018. The investigation reports prepared by them against the accused policemen were based on false evidences, which felicitated their bail. The two had then given a clean chit to four of the seven accused policemen.” According to police sources, the salary scam had come to light when accountant Manorma Devi detected in 2018 that six constables and a havildar of Sheikhpura police transferred over Rs 50 lakh in their accounts in connivance with an accountant and a bank employee. At her initiative, an FIR was filed against the accused policemen. The investigation report said then SDPO Amit Sharan and SP Daya Shankar prepared a faulty investigation report that felicitated bail of the accused and later the SP gave a clean chit to four accused – constables Sahdev Chaudhary, Sumitra Devi, Devdhari Singh and Sanjeet Singh. Constables Mantu Paswan, Jitendra Singh and havildar Shakil Akhter were made accused in the case. The DIG’s report also found role of a bank employee, the then accountant and the audit team suspicious. Sheikhpura SP Kartikey Sharma said all the seven accused policemen have already been terminated and steps were being taken to arrest four policemen who were absolved of charges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/former-sheikhpura-sp-sdpo-face-departmental-proceedings/articleshow/82808261.cms||Farrukh Nadim

However, it seems the NDA government in the state is neither in a mood to work nor it has any intention to let others work. The state has a tired CM,” Tejashwi wrote on a social media platform. Tejashwi also criticised the vaccine policy of the Centre under which the state governments will have to directly negotiate the price with the producers and purchase them. “It will put additional financial burden on Bihar. CM Nitish Kumar should explain what is the state government’s stance on it and what the government is going to do about procurement of vaccines in a state with a population of around 13 crore,” Tejashwi said. However, state BJP president Sanjay Kumar Jaiswal said instead of Patna, Tejashwi should have opened the Covid care centre in his assembly constituency Raghopur which needed a hospital. “His Covid care centre in Patna is meant for media attention. To open and run the centre, he should have taken permission from the DM and civil surgeon, not the CM and health minister,” Jaiswal added. BJP national vice-president and former Union minister Radha Mohan Singh said the coronavirus pandemic was being effectively tackled under the leadership of PM Modi. “The production of oxygen has been increased to 9,446 metric tonnes per day and 2,000 oxygen generation plants are at various stages of execution,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tejashwi-bjp-netas-in-war-of-words-over-covid-care-centre/articleshow/82808364.cms||Abhay Singh

This is the third death of mucormycosis in Uttarakhand while the state, in the month of May, has reported 50 black fungus cases, including four reported in the last 24 hours. Among the 50 cases, 46 were reported from AIIMS Rishikesh while Haldwani based Sushila Tiwari Medical College reported one suspected death and one patient of mucormycosis, but the culture test report is still awaited. The first case was detected in the state on May 12 and the rest followed within a week’s time. Commenting on the availability of Amphotericin B, Uttarakhand drug controller (DC), Tajber Singh, said the state currently has 70 doses of the medicine and Rudrapur based VHB Medi Sciences Limited, manufacturer and supplier of various pharmaceutical products, has assured a stock of 200 doses in the coming week. The Amphotericin B is being currently used for the treatment of the deadly disease. The health department, earlier this week, had issued an SOP for the procurement of Amphotericin B, just like Tocilizumab. The directives were issued by secretary Pankaj Pandey. It stated that Amphotericin B will only be issued to medical colleges and district Covid hospitals, “if available”, and no other private centres should be entertained. The hospitals have to fill a fully detailed form to get the medicine and the demand can be raised twice a day. A two-member team from the health directorate will verify the case and will issue the same on a case-to-case basis. To ensure greater transparency, the hospitals have been asked to deposit the empty vials of the medicine back to the nodal officers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/3rd-black-fungus-death-in-ukhand-50-cases-so-far/articleshow/82808018.cms||Ishita Mishra

---||Business||Don’t panic-sell bitcoin in crash: Crypto startups||MUMBAI: Indian crypto entrepreneurs are urging investors not to panic-sell assets like bitcoin and ether after prices crashed over 30% this week. According to cryptocurrency exchanges, investors should decide if they can sustain with locked funds for 3-4 years, and use only risk capital for what would be more of an allocation for long-term appreciation. These digital exchanges facilitate trading for most of the 1 crore Indian investors in highly volatile cryptocurrency assets. Users of some of these platforms were unable to place their orders due to the high volume of trading on Wednesday. While investing or trading in cryptocurrencies is a legal grey area, Indians owned about Rs 10,000 crore worth of such assets as of February. “The market faced a bull run for three months, but a correction has just kicked in. This was expected to happen as the stability of the industry decreased,” said Sathvik Vishwanath, co-founder and CEO of Unocoin, which — founded in 2013 — is one of India’s oldest crypto bourses. “Corrections are normal in financial markets. Crypto markets especially see such ups and downs in prices. Investors should remain calm during such dips and look at long-term gains,” said Raj Karkara, CMO of ZebPay, which was founded in 2015. Crypto entrepreneurs stressed that investors should allocate risk capital if one is entering or averaging. “Investors should make sure they use only risk capital, which they can afford to lose, so they are less likely to panic if it (correction) happens,” Karkara said. Industry people said market crashes are not alien to cryptocurrencies, and that bull runs after corrections have given returns in multiples. “We have not seen a dip of this magnitude in crypto for long. It is unsettling but what we are seeing and the reason why most exchanges are under heavy load is because there are a lot of new people and a lot of buying pressure and that will help the markets to bounce back,” said Nischal Shetty, co-founder and CEO of WazirX, one of India’s largest crypto exchanges. WazirX faced an outage as it claims to have recorded a 400% surge in traffic on Wednesday compared to the previous month. Crypto investors, who may be stuck at high prices, too should not panic-sell, according to them. “In these times, it is important for investors to decide if they can sustain with the locked funds due to a downtrend for 3-4 years and, if so, sitting tight appears to be the better option than going into a panic-sell mode,” Vishwanath said. “Investors with a horizon of 2-3 years will make profit, and Wednesday’s drop was a paper loss and not an actual one as the market has recovered since then. Investors should wait for the next rally for profit-booking,” said Shivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, which was founded in 2016. Crypto startups also said that regulation will help restore investor faith. “A strong remedy to restore investor faith in the alternate investment class will require the government to frame regulations to safeguard investor money. We have always advised retail users to make informed decisions after evaluating their risk-taking capabilities,” said Monark Modi, founder and CEO of Bitex, which was founded in 2018. Investors must not succumb to FOMO (fear of missing out) while making investing decisions nor should they expect to make a quick buck, the exchanges added. “The best way to manage volatility and avoid emotional and financial extremes is to use rupee cost averaging and SIPs. Buy a little bit at regular intervals without trying to guess what the low is and without FOMO. This will give better returns in the long term,” Karkara said. Modi too said investors should not follow the trend of entering the crypto space when prices dip and exiting when they balloon, and instead have SIP plans to average out volatility cycles. However, Nithin Kamath, founder and CEO of stock broker Zerodha, referring to the crypto crash in a series of tweets, said, “While it is tempting to average down, the odds of this strategy working are significantly low in the long run … The right way, for most people, is to not have concentrated positions.” Bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency, gained over 300% in 2020 to about $30,000. The rally continued in 2021 as well and bitcoin hit a lifetime high of $64,000 in mid-April before crashing to a low of $31,000 on Wednesday. At its high, bitcoin had a market capitalisation of over $1 trillion with growing acceptance by Wall Street as a store of value, led by Elon Musk’s electric vehicle company Tesla. The price has crashed over two main factors: First, Musk recently announced Tesla won’t accept bitcoin payments till its environmental concerns are addressed. Second, China’s central bank warned financial companies from facilitating cryptocurrency trades. Bitcoin pared some of its losses after Musk’s tweet on Wednesday: “Tesla has diamond hands”, which indicated it is not selling bitcoin. At 10pm on Thursday, bitcoin was up 6% at $39,500. On Thursday, Franklin Templeton India’s chief investment officer Anand Radhakrishnan tweeted: “What good is a fall, if the price is still 90% higher than where it was 6 months back & significantly higher than a year back. Call it a blip! #crypto”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/cryptocurrency/bitcoin/dont-panic-sell-bitcoin-in-crash-crypto-startups/articleshow/82823541.cms||Aseem Gujar

Patil reviewed the law and order situation with the top brass of the city police after returning from Gadchiroli on Friday. In his maiden Vidarbha tour after taking over from former home minister Anil Deshmukh, Patil had also gone to Gadchiroli to assess the situation in the Naxal-affected district. Coincidentally, 13 Maoists cadres were eliminated by Gadchiroli polices’ C-60 commandos on Friday when Patil reached the district. Patil, recalling the 2009 Hattigota encounter of May 21, where 16 cops were killed by the Maoists, said it was a befitting reply from the district police though after a gap of some years. Patil, during his interaction with select media personnel, said senior police officers must act in a manner that the state’s image is not maligned. The bona fide actions of the officers and their sincerity can only bring a positive change in the image of the state and it’s police department, he said. Sources said Patil had expressed his contentment regarding police action in enforcing Covid restrictions, managing the law and order, preventing and detecting crime, and also welfare of the personnel suffering from corona. He, however, had sounded concerned with the high rate of body offences in the region. “We need to explore the reasons behind the high rate of body related offences like assaults and attacks and bring them down,” he told the media. Patil also indicated that he would also soon clear the promotion related issues and recruitment process after getting the Supreme Court guidelines on Maratha reservation interpreted through a committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/study-pattern-reasons-for-body-crimes-in-city-home-minister-tells-cp/articleshow/82841064.cms||---

The petition also asked for capping the charges for CT-scan. The bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma has given the petitioner three days’ time to make the Centre a party to the PIL and issued notice which was accepted by assistant solicitor general Rakesh Thapliyal. The court has now given all the respondents two weeks’ time to file their counter affidavits. The petition letter has been filed by advocate Aditya Pratap Singh arguing that recently several students were caught in Doon possessing forged RT-PCR reports to enter their colleges. “There are sample templates which are available online and easily accessible… once a genuine report is in possession the same can be easily edited/amended,” the letter said. Singh said the state's private hospitals are charging between Rs 4,000 and Rs 8,000 for a CT scan. On the other hand, several states like Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh have issued notifications under the Disaster Management Act and have capped the prices from Rs 1,500 to Rs 3,000. The petition further said that even though people of the state are gasping for breath there have been numerous cases of hoarding and black marketing of oxygen concentrators. Therefore, the petition said, they should be declared essential commodities so that people involved in hoarding and black marketing can be charged under the Act. “Various high courts across the country have raised concerns that despite there being Drug Pricing Control Order (DPCO), 2013, and office memorandums by NPPA there are numerous complaints of hoarding and black marketing. Once the oxygen concentrators are declared as essential commodities then their MRP can be fixed and all notifications issued by NPPA can be followed in its letter and spirit,” read the petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/pil-in-ukhand-hc-raises-issue-of-fake-rt-pcr-test-reports/articleshow/82808092.cms||Prashant Jha

The accused, Anil Vaghela, lived on a footpath nearby. Relying on CCTV footage, the court said that if any train were to pass, the possibility of an accident and loss of life could not be ruled out. “Fortunately, the train… stopped,” the court said. It said that since Vaghela lived close to Charni Road railway station, if released on bail, he could commit such an offence again. “Therefore, considering the seriousness and prima facie evidence available on record (there is) no ground to release accused on bail,” the court said. Vaghela was booked for “mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees and upwards” under the IPC and offences under the Railways Act. The maximum possible sentence is three years’ imprisonment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-bail-for-vendor-who-laid-iron-rod-on-tracks/articleshow/82814381.cms||Rebecca Samervel

At least five persons were killed as rains wreaked havoc in the state causing landslides and road blocks. Several places, including Dehradun, received incessant showers since Wednesday night. The red alert was issued by the regional meteorological centre, particularly for the nine hill districts. "Although it has no direct impact on Uttarakhand, the remnant of cyclone Tauktae strengthened the western disturbance already passing over the western Himalayan region," said Rohit Thapliyal, senior scientist at the Met centre in Dehradun. Three persons, including two teenage girls, were killed after their temporary shelter - used to keep cattle fodder - collapsed at Jogyo village in Chakrata tehsil of Dehradun district on Thursday. On receiving information, a team of State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) reached the spot and with the help of locals, launched a search and rescue operation. "The incident occurred at 8:30 am. A temporary shelter, locally known as 'chaani', collapsed due to heavy rainfall when three persons were inside. One body has been recovered while two are still missing," Deepshikha Rawat, disaster management officer told TOI. The deceased have been identified as Munna, 32 as well as Kajal and Sakshi, both 13 years old, according to a SDRF official. The districts in Kumaon region were also lashed by incessant showers resulting in loss of life and property.

The administration was planning to shift the patients, but they eventually managed to drain out the water. According to officials, blocked drains caused the waterlogging. Several parts of the city also witnessed severe waterlogging. Around Rs 2.50 crore was reportedly spent to install a pre-fabricated structure of a 150-bed base hospital in Bhupatwala region during the Kumbh Mela by the mela administration and after the religious event, the structure was converted into a dedicated Covid health centre. The centre was inaugurated by chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat and Baba Ramdev on May 5. The administration claimed that 10 ventilator beds are available for critically ill patients, but the ventilators are "not operational so far due to lack of staff". Haridwar chief medical officer (CMO) Dr SK Jha said, “Water entered the Covid health centre early on Thursday following which I rushed to the facility and planned to shift the patients to other hospitals. But, we found out that a drain passing near the hospital was blocked and the local administration reduced the water level by opening it." The CMO added, "There were 18 patients at the centre and we did not shift anyone.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/rain-water-enters-covid-health-centre-in-haridwar/articleshow/82808226.cms||MS Nawaz

Hence, camps are being conducted in the tribal hamlets on a priority basis.”Sahu appealed the tribal community to come forward and get inoculated to protect themselves from the virus. According to her, 1,600 tribal people have taken the jab.Pointing out that the district has been reporting more than 300 cases a day, Nilgiris collector J Innocent Divya said at least 200 of them would require hospitalization, of which around 20% require oxygen support. “In the first wave, tribals in the district weren’t much affected.

Details of these children were collected with the help of the health department and Integrated Covid Command Control Centre, said child protection officer Nirupama Singh while talking to TOI on Thursday. Singh further said, “The number of children, who lost their father or mother due to Covid, is quite big, but a large number of them are with their family members having good financial condition. We are mainly collecting details of children from weak financial backgrounds who lost their father or mother due to Covid, and the remaining families are not in a position to take their proper care.” “Luckily, so far, we have not found any child losing both parents which would have been traumatic for the kids,” she added. The child protection department had initiated a drive to identify children who had lost father or mother due to Covid-19 to ensure proper legal protection for them after several appeals for adoption of orphaned children were noticed on social media, said deputy director, woman and child welfare, Pravin Kumar Tripathi. In case, any child becomes orphan, people should contact toll-free Childline 1098, helpline 181, district child protection officer on 7518024048, child protection officer (CPO) 8840830673 or chairman of child welfare committee on 9453048580, he added. The CPO said, “Adopting a child without following prescribed norms is illegal. We are creating awareness that Child Adoption Resource Authority (CARA) is the only body that facilitates adoption. Those interested in adoption should register on the website cara.nic.in. Adopting any child directly from any individual or hospital is crime and violation of the rights of the child.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/53-kids-from-poor-families-inkashi-lost-one-parent-to-covid/articleshow/82812212.cms||---

The district administration is now contemplating to fix the responsibility of Covid treatment and checking deaths in rural areas on the supervisory committee constituted under micro planning and is likely to launch a big campaign in rural areas to check coronavirus infection spread. District panchayat raj officer Kamal Kishore said responsibility would be fixed on committee members, including ANM, Lekhpal, Asha Bahu, secretary panchayat, and stern action would be initiated against them for any lapse. Kishore said houses in each lane would be allocated to members for supervision. They will arrange examination of sick persons, distribute medical kits and urge people to get vaccinated. DPRO said the superintendent of community health centre and block development officer would do village-wise micro-planning and draft an action plan for supervisory committee. Meanwhile, endocrinologist Dr Rishi Shukla said villagers have to take all precautions against Covid. “Taking medicines for fever and other Covid-like symptoms from untrained village doctors and medical stores is wrong. People should go to community health centre or primary health centre or district hospitals for testing, medical advice and treatment,” he added. “People are not taking it seriously. They think they are living in a healthy atmosphere in comparison to cities and so corona would not impact them. As a result, several villagers have lost lives,” he said. Dr Shukla said around 45% of Covid cases in April were reported from rural areas which also contributed around 50% of deaths.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/admin-starts-micro-planningto-check-covid-in-rural-areas/articleshow/82811840.cms||---

In his reply filed to a quashing petition by Singh, Ghadge, 55, through his advocate S B Talekar, denied Singh’s contention that his FIR was to “seek personal vengeance” and was filed in “connivance with people who had a grudge” against him for having highlighted “corrupt malpractice” by the highest functionaries of the state. Ghadge alleged that Singh had “done a disservice to people of Maharashtra and defamed the force he belongs to…" He alleged that Singh had sought to implicate him “in several false and frivolous offences”.

According to information, a woman hailing from Etawah district and the man, Anuj, of Nagla Vishuna village under the limits of Saurikh police area of Kannauj were having an affair for some time and eloped from their homes in March 2021. It was when her alleged lover’s father promised to solemnise their marriage, the two returned to their homes.

The woman told reporters that she had eloped with her alleged lover in March 2021. After staying together for a few days, she had approached her lover’s parents and disclosed their marriage plan. Her lover’s parents had then asked them to return to her respective homes promising them of arranging a marriage ceremony soon. But when she reached her alleged lover’s house in Kannauj on Wednesday, they refused to talk to her over the issue, besides threatening her with dire consequences. She then approached Kannauj police seeking police security cover following which she was provided four police personnel for her round the clock security.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat invites over 700 global firms||GANDHINAGAR: Although the 2021 edition of the biennial Vibrant Gujarat Summit has been called off because of the raging pandemic, the Gujarat government is intent on keeping the investment momentum going. The state government has written personalised letters to chairmen and CEOs of over 700 global companies based in over 50 countries, inviting them to invest in Gujarat. The companies which have been approached are those which are looking to expand their operations or shift their units out of China in the post-Covid era. These companies are from about 40 diverse sectors ranging from pharmaceuticals to finance technology (fintech). The government of India is also partnering the state government in its endeavour to attract fresh investment. Union ministries and departments like department for promotion of industry and internal trade (DPIIT), department of electronics& it, ministry of textiles, pharmaceuticals and chemicals etc. have assured full support to the latest endeavour by the state government. Armed with a new industrial policy which offers several incentives to businesses, plug-and-play infrastructure for industries at the special investment regions (SIR) of Dholera, Becharaji and Dahej and the GIFT city which is a hub for fintech companies, the Gujarat government aims to provide the best business environment to companies from a variety of sectors. Additional chief secretary (ACS) in the chief minister’s office, Manoj Das, said the state government has been engaging with global companies through webinars, video conferences, etc. “Although the 2021 edition of Vibrant Gujarat Summit has been put off, we decided to continue our engagement with global investors to attract investment to the state in the post- Covid world,” he said. Das added, “Global companies are also looking at several other countries from the ASEAN region such as Vietnam, Bangladesh, Thailand, etc. for investment. Based on analysis and current trends we are primarily targeting companies from the USA, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, UK, Germany, France and Canada. In India, Gujarat has been the most preferred business & investment destination for large multinationals for the past several years. We have set out a target to attract at least 10% of these companies who are looking to set up new facilities in the ASEAN region.” The official said that despite the lockdown and major adverse economic impact of the pandemic, Gujarat attracted the highest FDI. “As per the official data released by DPIIT, Gujarat received highest FDI worth Rs 1.58 lakh crore ($21.24 bn) between April and December 2020. In the first six months of FY2020-21, Gujarat registered a 550% growth in FDI as compared to the corresponding period of the previous year. We expect this trend to continue and a good number of companies will invest in the state,” Das said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/state-invites-over-700-global-firms/articleshow/82810263.cms||Kapil Dave

It was even more distressing for officials to find that the sister-in-law of the grandfather of the siblings, in the age group of one to 15 years, was trying to usurp around Rs 23 lakh deposited in their father’s bank account. Moreover, the woman gave a one-year-old girl to a couple in the Sunderpur area and left the four others in the custody of a labourer. Child protection officer Nirupama Singh told TOI on Thursday, “We had issued an appeal asking people to report if any child is orphaned due to Covid-19 to ensure their safety and legal protection. A caller informed us about these five children living in a pitiful state in the Kirahiya Sankuldhara area after the death of their parents.” The district probation officer Pravin Kumar Tripathi set up a joint team of district child protection unit’s Rajkumar, Childline’s Vandana Srivastava and Khojwa police outpost under Bhelupur police station. The team raided the residence of the woman, who claimed to be the grandmother of the five siblings, including three sisters and two brothers. The children were rescued from two places by officials who got their Covid-19 test conducted and quarantined them with Childline. “During investigation, we found their father was killed in a road mishap six months ago and their mother died due to some ailment three months ago. Their grandfather lives in Australia,” said Singh. Officials found that the grandfather of children had sent Rs 22 lakhs for construction of the house and the amount was deposited in the account of their father, who had made his wife account nominee. Officials found Rs 22.97 lakh deposited in the said bank account and also found some LIC bonds. Officials said the woman and her family had tried to withdraw money but the bank refused to release it without necessary documents. The child welfare committee got the documents of bank account and LIC bonds registered in the police general diary. Officials are now trying to contact their grandfather in Australia to settle the issue of their custody. The children are so traumatized that even the eldest girl was unable to tell her father’s occupation. Their counselling will start soon after which we hope they will share proper information about their parents, CPO Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/five-orphaned-siblings-rescued-bychild-welfare-officials-in-kashi/articleshow/82812015.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

Currently on bail, Yogesh had defeated his nearest rival Nirdosh Chaudhary by a margin of 2150 votes. He was a candidate from ward number 5 for the post of district panchayat member. The violence in Bulandshahr’s Siyana erupted on December 3, 2018 over an alleged incident cow slaughter.

Soon, violence erupted and the mob outnumbered policemen. Later, SHO of Siyana police station Subodh Singh and an agitator Sumit Singh were killed. UP Police had in its charge-sheet said that Yogesh and other key conspirators in the case were in constant contact and exchanged several calls within a span of few hours leading to the violence. The charge-sheet had placed Yogesh and other co-conspirators at the scene of crime through technical and forensic evidence. He was granted bail by Allahabad high court recently. Now, a video has also gone viral in which Yogesh, despite having won the poll, is seen attacking a villager and his family for “not voting him”. The incident occurred in Nayabaans village.

---||Kanpur||Wonder crop sorghum helpful against corona||Kanpur: Sorghum (jowar) can be a wonder crop not only for all those related to sugar industry but to a common man also in fight against coronavirus. National Sugar Institute, Kanpur in collaboration with ICAR-IIMR, Hyderabad has been conducting studies to assess the potential of the crop for the last two years at the institute farm and five sweet sorghum varieties (CSH 22S, SSV 84, SSV 74, Phlue Vasundhara and ICSSH 28) considered suitable for sub-tropical region are being cultivated and tested. Studies carried out at the institute indicate that while the juice from stem/stalk of the crop can be utilized for production of ethanol, jaggery and nutritive low calorie sugar syrup, the grains obtained as sorghum (jowar) can be used extensively as a healthier flour in place of ‘maida’ or ‘wheat flour’, particularly during the current corona crises. “Studies carried out in this regard indicate that one millet which is a healthy alternative to the all-purpose flour is jowar or sorghum. Rich in protein iron and copper, this gluten free grain has been known to play a crucial role in cellular function and repair. The rich quantity of potassium and phosphorous helps lower cholesterol and manage high blood pressure. A large amount of fibre present in the grain sorghum helps improve the digestive system. Sorghum provides almost 44 % of the required daily intake of fibre. A strong immune system thus helps to prevent any viral or other diseases from entering the body. The vitamins C present in the sorghum grain also helps boost our levels of immunity and thus sorghum appears to be an important ingredient of our diet in the current times,” said NSI director, Prof Narendra Mohan. “It can be thus a win-win situation for everyone, while the farmers can get a better price of the produce by utilizing each part of crop in an innovative manner, the country as a whole can get more ethanol to meet requirements of ethanol blending in petrol besides getting a healthier diet to reduce malnutrition, improving digestive system and immunity as a whole which is very much required to fight coronavirus,” said Professor Mohan further. He added, “This crop, sorghum (Jowar) which is a short duration crop of 4-5 months only requiring less water can be grown as an inter-crop with sugarcane and thus the farmers can increase their income further per acre of land.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/wonder-crop-sorghum-helpful-against-corona/articleshow/82811981.cms||---

The damage is worst in districts including Junagadh, Amreli, Bhavnagar and Bharuch, whereas production-level loss is equally high among salt makers in Little Rann of Kutch (LRK).  Explaining this, Bharat Raval, president, ISMA, said, “No major infrastructure damage has been reported in districts such as Jamnagar, Morbi, Porbandar, Dwarka and Kutch. However, in Amreli, Junagadh, Bhavnagar and Bharuch, the situation is worse because of the heavy rainfall. Coastal areas of these districts experienced at least 8-inch rainfall in a matter of 10-12 hours. Due to this, a lot of salt (finished product) on the mounds got washed away, which was ready to be dispatched.” “Moreover, 75% of the partly crystallised salt lying in the saltpans got washed away completely. This could have been salvaged but with so much excess rainfall and several areas lying unapproachable, the salt production season, which typically lasts till June second week, is now over. Therefore, this is a clear loss of production. This led to a total loss of Rs 115 crore across Gujarat,” said Raval. The cyclone dented an estimated 30 lakh tonnes of salt production. Of this, at least 15 lakh tonnes was washed away whereas the remaining is the loss due to short-termination of the season. Loss to infrastructure included damage to sheds, and a bit of damage to the machinery as well, according to ISMA estimates. With some 9,800 salt manufacturing units across the state, Gujarat contributes 75% of India’s total salt production. March-May is the peak salt production season and therefore a lot of salt which has been crystalised and readied for dispatch is kept in the form of mounds in the open grounds. While salt pans along the coastal belts are still approachable and keep moving the stock from time to time, those in the LRK don’t shift stock out of the desert. This results in a significant production loss.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rs-200cr-losses-for-salt-manufacturers/articleshow/82810329.cms||Niyati Parikh

It underlines the fact that the infection shouldn’t be identified as a post-Covid complication alone. Mucormycosis, also known as black fungus, was so far thought to be striking recovered Covid patients a few weeks or months after hospitalisation. But from a review of 32 cases of the fungal infection, Parel’s Global Hospital found that the average time for onset of symptoms was 12 days since hospitalisation for Covid treatment. The earliest a patient developed signs of black fungus was after five days in hospital. The state has now come out with an advisory, saying doctors must screen patients for the fungal disease before or post-discharge. Global, which is receiving a steady stream of patients from Jalgaon, Dhule, Buldhana and other cities of Vidarbha, studied the medical records of patients starting from their hospitalisation in their native places to draw the conclusion. By interviewing the patients about their Covid admission dates and the date of onset of mucormycosis symptoms, the Global doctors found many had started suffering from numbness, loosening of teeth or excruciating pain in the oral region or under the eyes while they were being treated for Covid in those hospitals. Yet, in most cases, the diagnosis happened weeks after they were discharged. The time taken to diagnose the fungal infection stretched from weeks to a month. Read AlsoCoronavirus black fungus infection: Signs, symptoms and everything we know about the deadly fungal infectionInfectious disease consultant Dr Vasant Nagvekar, who is also a member of the state task force, called the findings “eye-opening”. “The medical history showed that most were given pain relievers or other medicines and sent home. We want to tell doctors to remain alert about mucormycosis symptoms even as they are treating for Covid,” he said. Of the 32 cases treated in the hospital, only six were women. The youngest patient was a 28-year-old man while the oldest was 65. Eight have been discharged after successful treatment. The fungal infection was also found in two non-diabetic patients. Diabetics are believed to be especially prone to the infection. The hospital also found that 25-30% of the patients developed diabetes after they were started on Covid treatment and steroids. Dr Milind Navalakhe, an ENT surgeon who consults with Global, said early detection was the key to saving patients from having to undergo life-altering surgeries. Three patients had to lose an eye, while nearly six lost their upper jaw to arrest the infection. “A bigger challenge now is an acute crisis of the antifungal medicine amphotericin B that is needed to treat patients besides the surgery,” he said, adding the hospital has not received any supply since last week. In Mumbai, civic hospitals have seen over 111 admissions, a majority from outside the city. Overall, the state has seen 1,500 cases and 90 deaths so far.

Since April 30, it was the second death due to mucormycosis reported at Banaras Hindu University hospital while 17 more patients are under treatment. Three suspected black fungus cases are being tested. The chief medical officer Dr VB Singh also asked all private hospitals to report if any case of patients suffering with black fungus is detected. The district administration has also arranged the stock of medicine required for black fungus treatment and handed them over to the BHU officials on Wednesday night. A 74-year-old man from Mirzapur, who was admitted to level-3 Covid facility at super specialty block of BHU hospital with co-morbidity and chronic Covid-19 infection, had developed black fungus and was being treated for it for past few days, said the medical superintendent Prof KK Gupta. He died during the course of treatment on Thursday, he said adding that he belonged to Mirzapur district. This was the second death reported due to black fungus in this hospital as before him a 54-year-old woman from Azamgarh, who was also comorbid and Covid-19 positive, had succumbed to black fungus on May 15 even after a surgery which was performed on May 12, said Prof Gupta. Both the patients who died were diabetic while the woman was also suffering with obesity. The cases of black fungus were first detected at this hospital on April 30, he said adding that so far 19 patients, including the two deceased, have been detected. Among these patients, 16 are also Covid-19 positive and are under treatment in two cubicals of 8-bed each at L-3 facility while three non-Covid patients are being treated in medicine ward, he said adding that three suspected cases of black fungus are under treatment in emergency ward and necessary tests are being conducted. The CMO said that so far no confirmed cases of black fungus have been reported from any private hospital. “But, as I was contacted for the medicines required for the treatment patients suffering from black fungus in past few days, all the private hospitals have been asked to provide report of cases of mucormycosis on the line of Covid cases if detected there, said the CMO. In view of the increasing menace of black fungus and crisis of Amphotericine B injections used for its treatment in the market, the district administration swung into action. District magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma said that 100 vials of this injection have been arranged and handed over to Prof Gupta. The UP ministers including Neelkanth Tiwari and Ravindra Jaiswal also assured the hospital authorities of timely availability of necessary medicines by the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/black-fungus-claims-second-life-in-varanasi/articleshow/82812236.cms||---

KMC received several complaints against the lab, stating the lab operators are charging around Rs 4,000 for the scan. While the government fixed rates for HRCT scan is around Rs 2,000 to Rs 3,000 depending on the depth and intensity of the scan. Nikhil More, the deputy municipal commissioner of KMC said, “We cross-checked the complaint by visiting the lab as a patient and his relatives. We have asked for a reply to the notice . Once we get a reply, we will initiate action accordingly. The action may be registering offence or imposing fine as per Disaster Management Act.” The district administration has made it mandatory for the diagnostics labs to provide the details of the reports of scans done. Many patients prefer the scan before carrying out the RT-PCR test. The labs have also been asked to facilitate the collection of swabs of suspected Covid patient. However, it is hardly followed. More said the complaints were made earlier as well against the lab. “We have appealed to the citizens to write to us in case private labs are overcharging for tests and scans, for which the fees have been capped by the state government. Also, the citizens can complain about the violation of Covid rules such as social distancing in the labs,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kmc-issues-show-cause-notice-to-private-lab/articleshow/82775867.cms||---

The state government has allowed shops to remain operational from 9am to 3pm, which is in line with the request of a trader’s body in Gujarat. “The move will come as a big relief to retailers who will be able to resume business as usual after nearly three weeks of shutdown,” said Jayendra Tanna, president, Gujarat Traders’ Federation. A number of trade associations have appealed to members, to ensure strict adherence to Covid-19 norms. “We have appealed to all the members to allow limited members and ensure complete social distancing is maintained across shops. We are grateful to the government for lifting curbs on retailers,” said Ashish Zaveri, media convener of Amdavad Vepari Mahajan. Meanwhile, Retailers Association of India (RAI) has pushed for providing financial aid to the industries. Kumar Rajagopalan, CEO, Retailers Association of India, said, “Almost 80% of the retail stores are closed due to various restrictions across states. The cash inflow of the industry has come to a standstill, while the fixed operating costs remains intact. If a timely relief package is not provided by the government to ease the financial stress, then the industry will find it hard to survive.” Mihir Bosamia, a textile retailer, said, “Since the front-end is closed, there is little business being generated which is severely affecting cash flows and payments. It is increasingly difficult to make payments to suppliers most of who are MSMEs. It has also affected payments to banks. The entire ecosystem and chain down to manufacturing is getting adversely impacted increasing the likelihood of businesses turning NPAs.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/traders-retailers-rejoice-relaxation-on-restrictions/articleshow/82810327.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Isolation centres in Jind villages locked, lack health staff and avoided by locals||Jind: Covid-19 isolation centres set up at government schools and institutions in villages of Haryana’s Jind district are an eyewash, according to residents of six villages in Uchana Kalan constituency which TOI visited earlier this week. Uchana Kalan is a high-pofile constituency, represented by Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala in the assembly. It has been a stronghold of former Union minister Birender Singh, who is the grandson (maternal) of peasant leader Chhotu Ram. All six isolation centres which TOI visited — located in the villages of Sudkain Kalan, Dumarkh Kalan, Badoda, Ghogadiya , Ghaso Kalan, Uchana Khurd — did not have basic facilities for treating Covid patients. In all, there are 19 such isolation centres in villages falling under Unchana Kalan constituency, which is located in Jind district. According to villagers, even the existing infrastructure of beds and buildings have been provided by locals. There were only four beds set up at Dumarkha Kalan village, from where Birender belongs. His son, Brijendra Singh, is the BJP MP from Hisar. On the other hand, the isolation centres at Sudkain Kalan and Badoda, each of which have four beds, were locked. There were no PPE kits, medicines, teams of doctors, electricity back-up, or even a decent bathroom at most places. There was no wall to demarcate the Covid care centre at some places. At most of the points, the only officias were watchmen and caretaker. Sources said the centres were established over the past five days, but no one had visited them, be it patients or doctors. The district administration and health department are yet to provide any protective gear to staff members and caretakers being deputed here. Mewa Singh, a native of Dumarkha Kalan, said the government had no plan to deal with Covid in villages. “People are preferring their field for isolation, instead of the government’s isolation centre. There are no basic amenities available at any centre. Government is just making false promises of setting up isolation centres, which will prove misuse of the budget. If the government is really serious about stopping the virus, it should provide medical staff, sufficient medicines, masks, sanitisers , gloves, PPE kits, and staff to round-the-clock care to patients,” he added. Jind deputy commissioner Aditya Dahiya said the matter had come to his knowledge and he would act accordingly. “We came to know people are reluctant to visit Covid-19 isolation points. We are trying to motivate people to go there and will provide essential items soon,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/isolation-centres-in-jind-villages-locked-lack-health-staff-and-avoided-by-locals/articleshow/82812766.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Power use shows no ‘lockdown’ in industrial units||Nagpur: In an indication that almost all industrial units have continued operations even during lockdown, there was only marginal decline in power consumption through high tension (HT) supply, which goes to industries, in April. The restrictions had come into effect from April 13 and are in place till June 1. During March, as much as 103 million units (MU) of power was consumed through HT supply in Nagpur city, Butibori and Hingna. In April, 95 MU was consumed in the same places through HT supply. A reduction of 8 units is marginal if the majority of industries are supposed to be closed for half the month, said a MSEDCL source. So far, not more than 290 industries have submitted the self-declaration, which was mandatory for continuing operations by following norms during the lockdown. Going by MIDC estimates, there over 2,000 big and small units in their estates alone. Apart from these, there are smaller industrial pockets likes Bhandara Road or Uppalwadi. The restrictions allowed only industries engaged in making essential items like food products, medicines, or medical equipment. The units having continuous production process were also allowed. A self-declaration was to be submitted to the industries department by these concerns. The remaining industries had to make arrangements for the workers to stay within or close to the unit. They were also asked to create a bubble arrangement, under which workers were supposed to be kept in a designated area and allowed to travel only to the factory and back. Even such units were to submit a self-declaration that the norms are being complied with before starting operations. Sources in industries department admit that if only 290 units were officially operating on the basis of the declarations, the power consumption should have been much lower. The reduction of 8 MU power consumption can be mainly because steel units shut down for want of oxygen. As the cases increased, industrial oxygen had been diverted to medical use, which affected operations at steel units. Sources in the government admitted a number of units are continuing operations without submitting declarations. The district administration has the power to take action against such units. IN A NUTSHELL There are over 2,000 units in MIDC estates alone Only 290 units have given self-declaration for operations during lockdown This means the rest are supposed to be closed Power consumption data shows completely different picture In March, 103 MU went through HT supply, and only reduced marginally to 95 MU in April||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/power-use-shows-no-lockdown-in-industrial-units/articleshow/82812769.cms||Shishir Arya

After analyzing the skull, a police officer said the deceased might have been aged about 45 years. “Motorists found the charred skull near the cattle feed shop and alerted the Singanallur police, who retrieved that from the road and sent that to the forensic experts with the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital for further investigation.” The officer said they had combed the area for remaining parts of the body and more evidence, but in vain. “We suspect that stray dogs might have dragged it to the roadside from the nearby graveyard.” tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/charred-skull-found-on-road-probe-on/articleshow/82812773.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Bereaved kin forced to buy wood at high price for last rites||DEHRADUN: Despite claims by the Uttarakhand government that it is providing free-of-cost wood for cremating bodies of both Covid and non-Covid patients during the pandemic, family members of the deceased are jostling to get wood at the crematoriums and allege that exorbitant rates are being charged from them. Many allege that despite paying Rs 3,500-5,000 for wood per pyre, they are not getting sufficient wood. “When I went to pick the ashes of my brother’s wife along with him, we were heartbroken to see her remains in an unburnt condition because insufficient wood was used in the pyre. Even the dead are being humiliated,” said Ashok Kumar, a resident of Kimadi in Dehradun. Satyendra Chopra, another city resident who lost his elder brother to Covid-19 recently, shared his ordeal during the cremation, saying, “We had to wait for a very long time because the wood was not available in adequate quantity. More than 20 bodies were waiting to be cremated even as the crematorium staff was haggling over the price of the wood for the pyre.” As reported by TOI earlier, forest minister Harak Singh Rawat had announced in the first week of May that free-of-cost wood will be provided by Uttarakhand Forest Corporation to facilitate all cremations as a humanitarian gesture during the pandemic. When queried on the issue, Ashish Kumar Srivastava, district magistrate of Dehradun, said, “The wood has been made free-of-cost for cremation by the state government but people are still paying for it on account of their religious beliefs. Nonetheless, we are keeping a check on the incidents of overpricing. Besides, the prices have been fixed and put up at the crematoriums for the convenience of the people.” Recently,Haldwani municipal corporation and forest corporation staff were allegedly caught red-handed while fixing the price of pyre wood with family members. Irked locals had thereafter highlighted the matter on social media. Data prepared by the urban development department — which is overseeing the crematoria in the state — reveals that Uttarakhand witnessed the cremation of more than 250 bodies per day in the first fortnight of May. As per the state forest corporation, they are providing at least 1,000 quintals of free wood per day for the last rites to all the municipal corporations and councils in the state. Officials of the corporation alleged that hoardings have been put up by the forest corporation at several crematoriums stating that free-of-cost wood is being provided.

---||Nagpur||Low premiums, high claims: Covid covers vanish from market||Nagpur: The much-hyped Covid Rakshak and Kawach policies launched during the first wave of the pandemic, are absent from the market during the second wave. The Covid specific policies, which sold like hot cakes at both private and government general insurance companies, have quietly been put on hold these days. Though the policies officially continue, insurance companies are preferring not sell them. The polices brought last year are being renewed but new customers are not being entertained. There are some companies in which the old polices are also not being renewed. TOI has come across a case in which the customer had raised the issue about non-renewal of his policy. The polices came by the name Covid or Crona Rakshak and Kawach. The former gives cover of Rs2.5 lakh even if a patient just tests positive. This covers home quarantine also. The latter covers Covid treatment on reimbursement basis with a cap of Rs5 lakh. The average premium ranged not more than Rs3,000-4,000 for such policies. Insurance companies now find the premium too less as compared to the sum assured. The policies were sold aggressively earlier but the calculations went wrong and the companies were flooded with claims leading to the current stance. TOI inquired at four different general insurance companies, which confirmed the two policies were not available. Government companies still issuing the policies are rather cautious. Persons who had Covid are being discouraged and thorough health checks are being insisted on, apart from aspects like comorbidities being considered too. “Yes, we are getting inquiries about the two policies from clients. But the company has decided to no longer make any fresh sales. Although existing customers are being serviced if they want an extension,” said a regional head at a private company. At another private company, the concerned regional head said the polices were not available. Admitting that it was because of losses, the officials said clients are being convinced that they should take the regular cover. “We are saying that Covid is a passing phase but if they take a regular health insurance plan it would cover other diseases including mucormycosis, which has emerged as a post Covid complication,” said the official. However, the regular plans come for a higher premium, which ranges anywhere between Rs1,500 to 2,500 per lakh of the sum assured. Sources in the insurance companies said the low premium has led them to discourage sales of Covid specific policies. Manoj Ray, a finance consultancy professional, said in his own case the policy which expired on May 7 has not been renewed. “I had taken the Rakshak policy which provided a straight cover of Rs2.5 lakh on testing positive. The private company flatly refused when I applied for extension. The matter was taken up with officials, who maintained the stance that the policy is no longer available,” said Rai. His colleagues had also gone for the same policy, and even they have been refused extension, said Rai. Prasanna Dani, a health care consultant, said the companies have been giving offline renewal but fresh sales have been stopped. Instead, regular health plans are being pushed. “Our company is still providing the reimbursement policy, but only after due diligence,” said a source in a PSU insurance company.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/low-premiums-high-claims-covid-covers-vanish-from-market/articleshow/82810357.cms||Shishir Arya

---||Pune||Curbs pull down Maharashtra property registrations & revenue by 60%||PUNE: Maharashtra has recorded nearly 60% drop in registration of property documents, as well as revenue, in the first 45 days of the current financial year as against pre-Covid average monthly registrations due to the pandemic restrictions imposed by local authorities. Registration officials said the drop in registrations alone for the first 45 days was about 65% as compared to March this year. An official said on an average, the state would register 2.3 lakh documents per month before the pandemic began, which brought Rs2,200 crore in revenue per month. In April, as many as 1.34 lakh property documents were registered, leading to a collection of Rs 845 crore, the official said, citing the data. “In May, the registrations till May 19 stood at 49,775, which brought in Rs 666 crore in revenue,” the official said. The overall pandemic situation followed with restrictions has hit the department collections and registrations severely. “We have some of our offices closed in Amravati, Parbhani and Hingoli due to to the pandemic. Once the cases start declining and the restrictions are relaxed, we can expect things to streamline,” state Inspector General of Registration and Stamps Shravan Hardikar said. The state government restored the stamp duty to 6% throughout the state and 5% in Mumbai from April 1, which too has impacted the registrations, said potential buyers who were hoping the stamp duty waiver to be extended. The state had slashed stamp duty charges to 3% between September 1, 2020, and December 2020 in a bid to boost real estate sales amidst the slowdown caused due to the first wave of Covid-19. The government then continued it with a 2% reduction from January- March this year. National vice-president Credai Shantilal Kataria said the second wave had affected the market sentiment. “The state government should take some decision to help consumers by extending the stamp duty waiver once the cases reduce. The central government should also give some relaxations in Good and Services Tax,” he said. As per the data provided by the Inspector General of Registration (IGR), Maharashtra, the stamp duty cut period between September 2020 and March 2021 registered a growth of 114% in registrations against the same period last year September 2019 to March 2020. Prashant Thakur, director & head – Research, Anarock Property Consultants, said despite the stamp duty cuts, the state government recorded almost the same volume of registrations revenue as it did last year in the same period. “Ever since the expiry of the stamp duty cut period from April 1, there has been a drop in property registrations,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/curbs-pull-down-maha-property-registrations-revenue-by-60/articleshow/82812797.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The statement came a day after the state government announced that just three teachers had died during poll duty, drawing widespread condemnation from opposition parties and unions which have put the figure at 1,621.The chief minister said, “The poll panel rules are archaic and issued when there was no Covid-19. Therefore, there is a need to take a fresh, sympathetic view.”Chief secretary RK Tiwari and additional chief secretary of panchayati raj department, Manoj Kumar Singh, have been asked to approach the state election commission with a request to amend the rules.The announcement was met with mixed reactions. Unions have been asking the government to pay Rs 1 crore compensation and a job for a family member of the dead teachers. They said they feel "that the ball has now been put in the poll panel’s court".President of Prathmik Shikshak Sangh, Dinesh Chandra Sharma, said, “Finally the government has taken the first step towards providing justice. I only pray that officials don’t provide misleading figures.” Basic Shiksha Adhikaris (BSA) of all the districts have been notified to provide an updated list of teachers who died after contracting Covid-19 during the election training period and while on poll duty. There is still uncertainty over the time period.Earlier this month, the Allahabad high court had criticised the state government and the poll panel for paying “very little” in compensation to the kin of polling officers who die on duty after it was told about the provision of Rs 30 lakh ex-gratia. “It is not a case that somebody volunteered to render his/her services during an election. But it was all made obligatory to those assigned with election duty to perform their duties during election even while they showed their reluctance. The amount of the compensation, in our considered opinion, is very less,” the court had observed.The unions have been maintaining that all the 1,621 teachers got infected with Covid-19 during their panchayat election duty and subsequent ballot counting and they should be compensated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/yogi-for-change-in-ec-rules-to-widen-relief-for-teachers-who-died-in-poll-duty/articleshow/82808304.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

According to locals, a fire broke out around 2.30pm, when the flames engulfed the incinerator and caused a short-circuit at the crematorium, managed by Howrah Municipal Corporation. Though the fire was doused in 90 minutes, civic electrical department workers, who have started restoration work, will take some time to repair it. A worker alleged multiple bodies were being cremated in the furnace, which could have led to the fire. “Now, 11 bodies were in queue till Thursday evening,” he said.

The registrations of new private cars and bikes has been stalled for nearly a month now. According to an estimate, the automobile industry may have incurred losses of at least Rs 225 crore during the latest lockdown due to no new cars/bikes being registered, a senior RTO official said. The official further said: “The showrooms are shut now and the sales of cars and bikes are badly hit. A final decision on whether to restart registrations will be taken on May 30.” Between November and February this year, around 3,500 cars and 9,500 bikes were registered every month and so, around 13,000 new vehicles could not be registered in the past one month, he said. “We are however registering transport vehicles,” said transport commissioner Avinash Dhakne.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/for-rto-rs-25cr-tax-revenue-loss-rs-225cr-for-auto-sales-in-mumbai/articleshow/82813413.cms||Somit Sen

However, those in the industry say that the loss could be much higher. State minister for fisheries, Jawahar Chavda, said that department officials have been carrying out a detailed survey of the losses and the exact amount will be ascertained in two or three days. Akhil Bharatiya Fishermen Association president Velji Masani said that the cyclone wind speed was in excess of 150 km per hour at the coast, and several boats which were anchored together, piled up due to the strong winds. “Many fishermen are still trying to locate their boats. The loss to the fisheries sector is much more than what the government has estimated,” he said. Masani said that, apart from boats, the business of dry fish is also a huge industry with items worth crores of rupees being exported every year. “The cyclone blew the stock away, causing huge losses to fishermen,” he said. Bharat Modi, former president of Porbandar Fishermen Association, said that boats in Vanakbara, Veraval, and Diu have been damaged the most. “We have not been able to assess the exact loss yet,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/tauktae-cost-to-fisheries-sector-pegged-at-rs-160-crore/articleshow/82810388.cms||---

Senior inspector Jagannath Kalaskar of the Bharati Vidyapeeth police said, “Around 5.30pm, the watchman was cutting onions in front of his room in the parking lot when he noticed his eldest son and daughter quarrelling over some issue. He intervened and separated the two siblings and reprimanded them for quarrelling.” Kalaskar cited preliminary investigation and said, “Angered at being scolded, the boy picked up a knife, used by his father to cut onions, and stabbed him in the stomach.

Due to the volume of cases, civic authorities declared the premises at Kothrud’s Dahanukar Colony as a Covid-19 hotspot.In its order, the PMC said the canteen facilities at the plant, where all employees would gather to eat during their breaks, may have contributed to the rise in cases. The order further required Cummins to speed up vaccination of its employees, undertake regular sanitization of its premises and equipment, and close its canteen area for use. The PMC also asked Cummins to make face masks and face shields available to all employees working at the plant.“PMC officials visited the campus of the company, following which the notice was issued,” said Anjali Tilekar, ward medical officer of Kothrud ward office.In a statement to TOI, Cummins confirmed of receiving the PMC orders to shut operations. However, it disputed PMC’s active case count, and claimed that chances of infection at the premises are low.“Since last week, we have found only four positive cases. We have only 11 active cases as on date in the employee strength of 2,000-plus employees. But all these cases have been detected outside the workplace,” the statement from Cummins read.(With inputs from Prasad Kulkarni)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-shuts-firm-till-sunday-after-240-staffers-turn-ve-over-2-mths/articleshow/82812824.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

Rahul Dhall, senior manager from Taipa told TOI that four of their towers were damaged in the last 10 days, especially in Rohtak and Jind areas, and there has been threat to 15-20 towers operating in rural areas. In a letter to chief secretary Vijay Vardhan on Thursday, Dhall said various fake and misleading messages, and recorded audios/ videos are being circulated on social media linking the spread of the Covid with telecom networks and 5G network testing. It is resulting in protests by the public against the installation of telecom towers. “The impact of this misleading campaign has led the telecom infrastructure providers to face huge issues in the operation and maintenance of existing telecom towers and installation of new telecom towers due to the increasing resistance from the miscreant elements,” he said. T R Dua, director general of Taipa, said, “Such incidents if not brought under control may significantly impact the telecom connectivity at large and deprive the general public/government bodies from getting uninterrupted telecom services at crucial junction of Covid-19 when telecom and internet connectivity are essential for enabling work from home, virtual meetings, e-commerce, e-education, e-health and various other initiatives of the government including the vaccination which requires technology and connectivity support for various purposes.” The letter reads that to counter these fake and misleading messages, the department of telecommunications (DoT) have already clarified that there is no link between 5G technology and spread of Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mobile-towers-in-haryana-damaged-due-to-5g-rumours/articleshow/82812806.cms||Sat Singh
---||Mumbai||Are you making a mockery of education system?: Bombay HC to govt||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Thursday came down heavily on the state government for its decision not to hold SSC exams.  The HC heard a PIL by Dhananjay Kulkarni, a retired teacher from Pune, which stated that cancelling of SSC exams can lead to problems for Class XI admissions as different boards declare results based on different formulae. Government pleader Priyabhushan Kakade said the state is waiting for suggestions from the State Council of Educational Research and Training in a week, after which it will come up with a formula. “Are you making a mockery of the education system?” asked Justice Kathawalla. Kakade said the decision was taken due to the pandemic. “What are you talking? Pandemic. Pandemic,” said Justice Kathawalla, adding that on one hand, the state is saying Covid-19 cases are lessening. “In the name of the pandemic you cannot spoil the career and future of our children... It is not acceptable,” he said. The judges questioned the discrimination in holding HSC exams for 14 lakh students and not SSC exams for 16 lakh students, adding that “things are done as per whims and fancies of so-called policy- makers.” Told by Kakade that it was a policy decision taken by the government not to hold the SSC exams, Justice Kathawalla remarked, “You are just destroying the system.” Kulkarni’s advocate Uday Warunjikar said that for Classes I-VIII, there were no exams and even for Class XI. “The complete batch is without any examinations,” he said. Advocate Madhaveshwari Mhase, for an intervenor Anubha Sahai, said Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu had cancelled SSC exams. She said the Madras HC had even dismissed a challenge to the decision. “It is not binding on us. We care about the future of our students, who are the future of the country. They cannot be promoted year after year,” said Justice Kathawalla. The SSC board’s advocate Kiran Gandhi said it is awaiting a formula from the state. “You are not prepared with anything. Just cancel the exams and sit tight!” said Justice Kathawalla. The judges will pass an order on the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/hc-to-govt-are-you-making-a-mockery-of-edu-system-in-mumbai/articleshow/82814521.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Pune||Pune: Responding to calls for help, day and night||PUNE: Raju Rajpure (42) owns 25 ambulances but often doubles up as a driver, responding to distress calls for help to either drop patients to hospitals or bring oxygen cylinders from far-off places. “Recently, a senior doctor of a hospital in Hadapsar said they were facing oxygen shortage and requested me for help. He provided me with an address in Jejuri. We immediately went there and brought 12 oxygen cylinders to the hospital. There have been similar instances in the past few days,” he said, adding, “Currently, I receive around 15 to 20 phone calls daily from people requiring ambulances from the earlier 30 to 40.” In the past few days, Rajpure has responded to urgent calls for help without bothering much about payment. “If I don’t get paid, my business will shut down, which will mean less ambulances in the city. But one cannot always think about money. Doctors request us to bring oxygen cylinders from far-off places at times and we oblige without taking immediate payment. Similarly, I have also instructed my drivers to be sensitive to the situation. Payments can be delayed, but transporting patients to hospitals is a priority,” Rajpure said. Asked about the recent rise in instances of assault on doctors and nursing staff by family members of patients, Rajpure said it was a worrying trend. “I know most people are worried and tense because of the rapid spread of the virus, but they should also realise that we are trying our level best, taking risks and working without rest all day and night. We do deserve some respect,” he added. With the second wave of the pandemic raging, Rajpure has had to turn into a driver more than once. “The number of patients seeking ambulances is high. If all my ambulances are on the road, I source from one of my contacts. If there are no drivers, I drive. There have been times when I have received calls late in the night and early morning and I haven’t been able to contact my drivers. In such a scenario, I consider it my responsibility to drop patients to hospital,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/responding-to-calls-for-help-day-and-night/articleshow/82812846.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: More classrooms required for Class XI||AHMEDABAD: A large number of classrooms are likely to be added this year for Class XI after the government announced mass promotions for Class X students due to the Covid-19 situation in the state. The education department has communicated to the school administrators to make an application to the government for additional classrooms that are required for the academic year 2021-22, said sources. The Federation of Self-Financed Schools, Gujarat, has also asked all the schools to submit their requirement for additional classrooms to the state government before the schools start on June 7, said sources close to the development. The state government had earlier this month announced the cancellation of Class X board exams due to the Covid-19 situation in the state in line with the CBSE’s decision to cancel its exams. The decision was aimed to give relief to about 8.7 lakh regular students in Class X at schools affiliated with the Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB). The government had earlier declared mass promotions for Classes I to IX and XI. The government’s decision for mass promotions is only for regular students and does not include about 3.6 lakh external students. The government has also formed a committee to look into the challenges and issues arising from mass promotion to Class X students and find solutions. One of the major challenges would be in enrolling students who plan to pursue diploma engineering or ITI studies after Class X.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/more-classrooms-required-for-class-xi/articleshow/82810449.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Cyclone Tauktae: Onion dehydration units in Gujarat stare at Rs 300 crore in damage||AHMEDABAD: Battered by Cyclone Tauktae, the onion dehydration industry at Mahuva in Bhavnagar district is staring at losses of Rs 250 crore to Rs 300 crore due to the damage caused to processing units, cold storages, finished goods and raw material.  “The damage to onion dehydration units is much more than what we estimate one day after the cyclone made landfall,” said Manoj Ram, president, All India Dehydration Association. “Going by the devastation wrought to the industry, the damage could be in the range of Rs 200 crore to Rs 250 crore,” added Ram. The industry had estimated damage at Rs 40-50 crore on Tuesday, after the cyclone had struck. Murtuza Badami, the owner of Murtuza Foods in Mahuva, pegged the loss at Rs 250 crore to Rs 300 crore on account of damage to cold storages and processing units’ infrastructure besides finished goods stored at the cold storages and raw or fresh onions procured for processing. According to onion processors, Mahuva has about 45 cold storages and 80% of them have been damaged with their roofs and side walls being blown away. There are about125 dehydration units in and around the town. “About 50,000 tonnes of dehydrated onions or finished goods was stored in cold storages. Some 20% of that has been exposed to rainwater and is feared damaged. The value of such stock is estimated to be Rs 125 crore,” added Murtuza. “How much of the water-damaged goods can be restored remains to be seen,” he said. Apart from this, 15 lakh bags of fresh onions were stockpiled by processors and farmers, and were lying in open spaces and in sheds. “Some 10 lakh tonnes got wet, which must be processed over the next two weeks to minimize the damage,” Murtuza added. Meanwhile, processing units and cold storage roofs have been blown away. The infrastructure loss is likely to be Rs 50 crore, said onion processors in Mahuva. Power supply to onion processing units in Mahuva has remained off for four days now. Units are unlikely to resume operations within a week. “This means a further loss of production,” said Manoj Ram. Industry players also said that they will have to process their existing stocks before the monsoon. “If we are unable to do so, it will mean an additional loss to us,” added Ram.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/onion-dehydration-units-stare-at-rs-300cr-in-damage/articleshow/82810472.cms||---

Dattatray Zende, traffic manager of the transport body, said MNGL has sent a letter about the dues. “The PMPML has to pay Rs 53 crore to MNGL against the CNG they supply. At present, the PMPML cannot pay. They have said the supply will stop after June 1. This could mean that the current emergency services we are running can halt,” the official told TOI. The utility is operating 137 CNG buses as part of its emergency services. The transport body has got more than 500 diesel buses too. “The cost of a litre of diesel around is Rs 90 and that of CNG is Rs 55. Moreover, for the diesel buses we have to pay the oil company in advance for the fuel which has not been the case with MNGL. We will not be able to sustain if we switch to diesel. Only the PMC has paid us some amount and payment from PCMC is awaited,” another official said.  If buses ply from June 2, they will have a bigger crisis in the absence of CNG buses, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mngl-to-stop-gas-supply-for-pmpml-buses-from-june-1/articleshow/82812870.cms||Joy Sengupta

Around 300 employees of various departments have worked round the clock to track, test and treat Covid-19 patients across the district under the ICCC. With the re-emergence of Covid-19 crisis in the city in the first week of April, the district health authorities had taken up a drive to ensure tracking of Covid patients, their proper treatment, care and isolation and also steps to prevent further spread of the infection. The coordination of various departments under ICCC has helped health authorities to track, test and treat all Covid patients. A three-member team including nodal officer (Covid-19) and additional CMO, Dr. Rishi Sahai, additional CMO and nodal officer (RRT) Dr. Anil Kumar and senior medical officer and deputy nodal officer (RRT) Dr. Anupam Dwivedi maintained round the clock surveillance to track, test and treat the patients either in home isolation or Covid level 2 and three hospitals. eputy nodal officer (Rapid Response Team) Dr. Anupam Dwivedi told TOI, “Joint efforts of five department including health, PMC, police, education and ambulance wing have brought desired results to check the spread of the disease. While PMC authorities were handling sanitization in micro and macro containment zones, police officials managed to maintain strict surveillance in containment zones and help health workers take seriously ill patients to hospitals.” He further claimed, “Teachers under the banner of the education department were assigned to call covid patients (undergoing home isolation) in morning and evening hours and asking them about their well-being. The team of doctors sitting at ICCC were giving consultation as sought by the patients under home isolation." Moreover, a helpline was also set up at ICCC and medical and para-medical staff attended the calls to guide patients and answered their queries. Dr. Dwivedi said, “As soon as the portal/website of a district surveillance officer shows information about a person being tested positive by government or private lab at ICCC, medical teams swing into action and connect with the patient, compile his/her details, and track their current health status.” “When the medical team finds the condition of patient serious, it immediately connects with ambulance staff /service and the patient is shifted to Covid level 2 or 3 hospital for treatment,” said Dr. Dwivedi adding, “An RRT (Rapid Response Team) is assigned to visit the house of the patient if he or she seeks approval for home isolation.” ACMO and nodal officer (RRT) Dr. Anil Kumar said, “Since most patients seek home isolation, RRTs were assigned to inspect requisite facilities, care at home of a patient. The permission for home isolation is granted only after RRTs inspect the house of a patient and approve the facilities, living conditions and presence of a caregiver.” Dr. Kumar, however, said that only asymptomatic patients below 60 years were given approval for home isolation if they had the requisite facilities at home and were also able to avoid contact with other family members. “For home isolation, patients were asked to have a home quarantine kit comprising a pulse oximeter, thermometer, masks, sterile gloves, sodium hypochlorite and tablets of ashwagandha, giloy and vitamin C,” he added. Currently, as many as 63 RRTs, including 15 in the city and 48 in rural areas (trans-Ganga and trans-Yamuna) are working to approve home isolation for patients. Officials said, “Patients suffering from any other serious ailments are not eligible for home isolation.” Data from the health department claimed that a total of 67,751 patients were approved home isolation till now and 66,327 of them had already completed home isolation and recovered. Currently, 1,424 patients are undergoing home isolation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/various-depts-under-iccc-worked-24x7-to-check-spread-of-covid-in-sangam-city/articleshow/82812319.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: No walk-ins today & Saturday, 80% slots for Covishield 1st jab||Mumbai: Vaccination will be through online appointments only on Friday and Saturday, meaning people cannot walk-in to the centres on both these days, said the BMC. Vaccination will be held from 10am-3pm. The arrangement is part of the larger strategy adopted by the civic body this week to avoid crowding at vaccination centres. Civic chief I S Chahal had passed an order on May 12, saying vaccination on Monday to Wednesday would be only through walk-ins for citizens above 60 years, while that on Thursday to Saturday would be exclusively through online appointments for all above 45 years. Since Monday’s drive was cancelled due to the cyclone, the walk-in drive was extended till Thursday. The BMC announced that on Friday, 80% of the slots will be kept for those coming for the first dose of Covishield, while 20% will be for those eligible for the second dose of Covaxin. The same will be followed on Saturday as well. The civic body will start administering the second dose of Covishield after May 24. Vaccination numbers dipped again on Thursday after seeing a jump the day before when 29,607 got vaccinated. The response to the walk-in drive, said many ward officials, was not as great as they had expected. On Tuesday, a day after the cyclone, merely 16,754 had taken the vaccine although walk-in was allowed for 60-plus citizens. Municipal councillor from F north ward Nehal Shah has written to the BMC asking it to open walk-in for people between 45-59 years too. The centres were not using their resources optimally as the footfall of people above 60 was less. “As BMC, we are spending a lot on recruiting staff, setting up vaccination centres by installing new computers, tabs and printers… The entire machinery is not being utilised at 100%. By opening walk-in for all above 45 years, we will be efficiently able to utilise all resources,” she wrote to Chahal. However, vaccine shortage was one of the main reasons why the drive was not scaled up in a big way. About the lukewarm response to walk-ins, additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said it will improve soon as they start giving the second dose from May 25. “Currently, the number of those who qualify to take the first dose has reduced since most senior citizens may have taken the shot already. We expect to see a rush from next week,” he said. The city didn’t receive any doses on Friday, but it is expecting stocks in the next few days. The state vaccinated merely a lakh (1,01,098) on Wednesday. It is the fourth day in a row that vaccination has been sluggish. On Tuesday, 1,04,661 people were vaccinated, while the number did cross a lakh in the previous two days. State officials said they have no stock of Covaxin. In Mumbai, most hospitals didn’t have Covaxin doses for those waiting for the second dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-walk-ins-today-saturday-80-slots-for-covishield-1st-jab/articleshow/82813005.cms||---

Head of epidemiology division at ICMR Dr Samiran Panda told TOI symptomatic persons can test at home so that they can spot Covid-19 early instead of waiting for the lab results.“Home-based tests definitely enable quicker testing and such kits are being considered,” he added. Managing director of Mylab Discovery Solutions Hasmukh Rawal said they plan to release the kits in the market across the country in less than a week. Company officials said they can ready 70 lakh kits per week and scale it up to one crore per week in 14 days. It is the first such kit for self-use and comparable to the RATs already in use. State task force member Dr Shashank Joshi said such kits were necessary considering the pressure of testing on laboratories. “Self-tests should be encouraged, but those having symptoms even after the test is negative should get RT-PCR tests conducted,” he said. Since it is ICMR approved, citizens can use it and the state should look at more such tests including salivary tests, he said. Former ICMR scientist Dr Lalitkant said home-based tests are transforming healthcare and empowering the patients. “They save time and eases he pressure on laboratories. Several other home tests are widely used in India for glucose and pregnancy. Coviself’s approval comes when Covid-19 infection is rapidly moving into areas where getting RT-PCR is a challenge,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rat-kit-for-home-tests-in-markets-next-week/articleshow/82812884.cms||Nisha Nambiar

On May 19, the NMC suffered a loss of Rs6.31 lakh for plying 66 Aapli Buses on all routes, including some tehsil places like Kalmeshwar, Katol, Koradi etc, as per data obtained from NMC’s transport department. In January, the NMC’s earning per km was Rs28 when it used to run 170 buses. In May, it dropped to Rs11.49 per km, said a senior official from the department attributing it to the lockdown-like restrictions imposed to check spread of Covid-19. As per an agreement with the three bus operators, the NMC pays them Rs60 per km. Before the restrictions kicked in, the NMC used to operate 360 buses on over 80 routes across the city and ferried 1.40 lakh commuters on an average daily. In April, the earning was below Rs10 per km, which was the lowest since the NMC took over the city bus operation. Due to such poor revenue generation, the NMC also reduced the number of buses on roads. The NMC is currently operating only 66 Aapli buses. On May 19, it spent Rs 7.92 lakh to operate them, as per the data. Jitendra Kukde, former chairman and member of transport committee, admitted that the earning per km of Aapli Bus is very less and needs to improve. He blamed this on poor monitoring system. He said the NMC will implement a plan wherein a commuter can travel for an entire day for Rs50 on procuring a daily pass. The system will allow one to travel on any route from 6am to 11pm. According to him, the Rs50 per day pass system will also curb alleged ticket money pilferage being done by some unscrupulous conductors. “The NMC’s monthly expense used to be around Rs18 crore per month as against mere Rs6 crore income when it operated its entire Aapli Bus fleet. The monthly viability gap funding is more than Rs12 crore,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-incurs-rs48-50/km-loss-on-running-aapli-bus-data/articleshow/82810466.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

While work is progressing, over 80% of the workers have left. We have kept the airport authorities in the loop and are trying to not allow the work to stop as construction materials like cement, steel beams, etc, are affected by the weather,” the official said.Construction of the project had begun in January 2020 and soon ran into a roadblock due to the nationwide lockdown. The work had resumed once the restrictions were relaxed.“We are roping in workers from other sites to make up the shortfall, and we don’t anticipate a major delay — two or three months at most. We are doing our best to avoid any delay and ensure timely completion. We are still eyeing an early 2022 completion date,” the official said.The facility is coming up on Parking Lot 1 of the airport, which has led to a shortage of parking space. This, in turn, has forced the airport authorities to urge people to not bring their personal vehicles to the airport.“We expect the project to be completed on time. It will be able to hold around 1,000 cars and will be connected to the terminal building via a skywalk,” an airport official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/covid-exodus-hits-multi-level-parking-project-at-pune-airport/articleshow/82812909.cms||Joy Sengupta

Booking queries for the combo package of Russian holiday and shots exceed the frequency of flights, so wait until May-end and hope for this second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic to subside. Micro and small travel agent association president Gurpreet Chawla said: "The Russia package includes shots of Sputnik V for the 18-plus, with certificate, besides 24-night stay in a 4-star hotel with breakfast. The client can downgrade or upgrade, and add extra meals, sightseeing, and chauffer service. But the two weekly direct flights are full." A prominent tour company’s sales head, Rakesh Sharma, said: “We hope it will be better after May. Besides Ludhiana, other cities are also calling in. Mostly, those are families and groups, as the sharing price is cheaper than the Rs 30,000-to-40,000 cost for singles.” There are also Rs 80,000 and Rs 1.25 lakh packages. Local facilitators in Russia have a tie-up with its government clinics but boarding the flight takes RTPCR negative report not more than 72 hours old. Travel agent Sanjay Mehra said it was lockdown in almost all international destinations, while Russia was open. The package includes daily breakfast in hotel, airport-to-hotel transfer, two doses of Sputnik with certificate, two pre-vaccination medical check-ups, all transfers and doctor’s visit with English-speaking guide, invitation letter for tourist or medical visa (subject to approval), Russian Visa fee (also subject to approval). Extra meal costs Rs 950 and includes continental buffet and Indian food. Mehra launched the combo offer with seven bookings. Since Sputnik V has arrived in India, many travel agents see their business opportunity waning. A local travel agent said: “The Russian vaccine is expected to be available in India soon but since people haven’t been able to go out for long, they might prefer our package." Russian health and disease-control regulations since April 28 require all passengers from India to be tested for Covid-19 after passing immigration. They need no wait at the airport to get the result.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/russian-holiday-vaccine-seekers-and-travel-industrys-best-shot/articleshow/82812881.cms||Shariq Majeed
---||Rajkot||Under Tauktae influence, Diu drowns in low spirits||Diu: Barring monsoon when heavy rains pound Saurashtra coast, Diu always used to be teeming with lakhs of tourists. Guzzling down chilled beer and lazing around on pristine beaches, tourists, most of them from Gujarat, were the main drivers of this scenic Union territory's economy. One could never get enough of the simple ride on rented scooters as they traversed the roads lined up with coconut trees, which epitomized the beauty of this place. But drive through the town today and you are greeted with depressing scenes of uprooted trees, hotels with glasses and windows shattered and blown away shades. According to officials, nearly 7,000 trees are lying uprooted on the roads. The beach town famed for its Portuguese style architecture is a pale shadow of its past glory. Never before in the last several decades has Diu witnessed such a devastation left behind by Cyclone Tauktae that roared into Gujarat from this coast on Monday night. Tauktae pounded Diu for nearly nine hours with wind speed of nearly 170-180 kmph beginning Monday evening. The only people seen are teams of administration who are painstakingly trying to clear the roads of trees. It was only in October last year that Ghoghla beach in Diu had earned the prestigious ‘Blue Flag’ certification granted to clean, safe and environment-friendly beaches, marinas and sustainable boating tourism operators. In fact, the administration persevered to earn this coveted title and spent around Rs 22 crore in 2018 to meet the criteria for Blue Flag tag. Chandresh Solanki, Ghoghla beach manager, said, “Several structures including canopies, showers, toilet blocks, and changing rooms were shattered by the cyclone. The beauty of this beach was the plantation which has also flattened.” A team of 32 people were engaged in managing the beach after getting the Blue Flag status, but currently there are around 11 only since March-end due to Covid-induced situation. Besides its cleanliness and safety, Ghoghla beach was preferred by tourists as liquor is not permitted here and guards are constantly on the move to ensure there is no nuisance. Amenities on the beach were developed as per the norms of Foundation of Environmental Education (FEE) that awards the Blue Flag status. The beach has a demarcated swimming zone, bamboo canopies for seating, showers, changing rooms for men and women, toilet blocks, a well-developed garden and recreation facility for children. There is a watch tower where a guard is deputed to see that nobody drowns while swimming in the sea. It has now gained more popularity over Nagoa beach. “To retain the status of Blue Flag for Ghoghla, we have to apply every year. This year we have already applied for it and before the team of certification visits, we will restore the beauty of this beach.” 'Will allow tourists in 15 days' The Diu administration is determined to reclaim the glory. “Within 15 days, we are planning to allow tourists with Covid protocols and within one month, we aim to re-beautify Diu as much as possible,” collector Saloni Rai told TOI: “Our motto is ‘Green Diu, Clean Diu’ and we will plant three times more trees than those flattened by cyclone,” Rai added.  Mad rush at charging points Entire town is without electricity since May 18 night as one grid line coming from Gujarat is damaged and chances of immediate restoration are bleak. Huge rush of people was witnessed at seven mobile charging points erected at seven government buildings in Diu. As mobile towers also require electricity, the administration provided DG sets so that communication infrastructure can be restored. Double whammy for hotels Already reeling under Covid-induced situation for over a year, the hotel industry in Diu has now been battered by the cyclone. Yatin Fugro, president, Diu Hotels Association said, “The hotels were already closed since the March-end and the business is expected to pick up in August-September if there is no third wave.” There are 65 registered hotels in Diu.  Solar panels shattered In 2018, Diu was the first island in India to shift to solar power. The two solar parks - one of 3MW and other with 6MW- that were fulfilling 33% of Diu’s electricity consumption were flattened. “The solar park generating 3MW has suffered 80% damage. The panels in both parks were installed at the cost of around Rs 60 crore. Switching to solar had resulted in savings of 10-12% in electricity bills of hotels, hospitals, government buildings, fish warehouses and others. The first phase of 3MW was made operational in 2015 and the second one was made operational in 2018.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/under-tauktae-influence-diu-drowns-in-low-spirits/articleshow/82810545.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

Following the incident, police raided several shops in the district for Chinese manjha and arrested two wholesale traders with a huge consignment of the banned manjha. Police have, meanwhile, warned the locals that action would be taken if anybody was found using the banned Chinese manjha.Police said Mohammed Kallu, a resident of Ganj area of Rampur city, was on his way home when he noticed a kite string attached to a kite was hanging from an electric wire. As he tried to clear his path by removing the string, he got electrocuted, said police, adding that Kallu was immediately rushed to a hospital, but he died during the treatment.Meanwhile, police raided several kite shops and seized 92 pulleys of Chinese manjha from the shop of Babar Khan and his brother Nahid.Ganj police station SHO Ramveer Singh said, “According to the accused, the cost of a manjha pulley is Rs 90 and it is being sold for Rs 230 because of the strength of the manjha. We have booked the accused under sections 420 (cheating), 336 (negligent act to endanger human life), 269 (negligent act likely to spread the infection of any disease), 270 (malignant act likely to spread the infection of any disease) and 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by a public servant) of the IPC and under the Epidemic Act, 2020.”“We will take strict action against people using Chinese manjha, which is also a conductor of electricity,” added Singh. Chinese manjha is coated with glass and metal dust that makes it a good conductor of electricity. The sale of Chinese manjha is still rampant in all UP districts despite a ban by the National Green Tribunal and Allahabad high court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/youth-electrocuted-after-coming-in-contact-with-chinese-manjha-hanging-from-high-tension-electric-wire/articleshow/82808488.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Delhi||Covid-19: Cannot take third wave lightly, says Delhi HC||NEW DELHI: A mere reduction in the number of Covid-19 cases can’t lead to the pandemic be taken lightly, Delhi High Court told the AAP government on Thursday, pointing out to the projections of a third wave that may hit “people even harder”. With an eye on future availability of hospital beds, tankers to supply medical oxygen and buffer stock of these along with key medicines, a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh passed a slew of directions. It asked all big hospitals/nursing homes in Delhi (central, state government or private) with 100 or more beds to install Pressure Swing Absorption (PSA) oxygen plants to create buffer stock, saying the bitter experience everyone had faced due to the acute shortage of oxygen had left a lesson to be learnt. While examining the progress of the installation of eight PSA plants set up by the Centre and Delhi government, the court stressed that such hospitals must have a buffer of twice their normal needs for which they must set up the plants. “Most of the plants have to be made functional and their installation should be prioritised to meet the demand if another wave comes,” said the bench, asking for a status report from both governments. Delhi government’s principal secretary (Health) was asked to file a status report by May 27. The court also took into account smaller hospitals and nursing homes with 50-100 beds saying they should have PSA plants of their normal requirement capacity. The court further warned private hospitals and nursing homes that failure to comply with the directions to update data on occupancy and availability of beds on a regular basis in their institutions would invite penalty. The bench asked the AAP government to furnish a list of errant hospitals and nursing homes and said it hoped they fell in line and updated data every two hours. “We would like to avoid taking any unpleasant action against them. However, we make it clear that if we find any willful or deliberate defiance of our orders, we will not shy away from taking precipitate actions to ensure compliance of orders,” the high court observed. During the marathon hearing, the court also dwelt on capping of treatment charges for hospitals and noted that a meeting was held between Delhi government and representatives of hospitals to rationalise the rates. Amicus curiae and senior advocate Raj Shekhar Rao told the court that while one set of hospitals had suggested fixation of basic fees for beds and other facilities and payment as per DGHS rates, the other set were in the favour of formation of a committee to discuss the charges. The court left it to Delhi government since a discussion had already taken place between the stakeholders, but said a decision should be taken keeping in mind the interest of hospitals and patients by May 24. The high court bench also examined the status of dedicated oxygen tankers for the city where it asked the Centre to inform of steps taken in this regard. While Delhi government claimed it was in talks abroad to purchase six tankers, it said a buffer stock of 419 metric tonnes had been created. But the court noted that the Centre had not disclosed as to what steps had been taken to fulfill its obligation towards Delhi in terms of the Supreme Court’s order. “If you have not taken steps, we will chase you again. We are telling you, we mean business. Please don’t take it lightly, we are again warning you,” cautioned the court, saying both governments had to make sure the capital was not caught unprepared again.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-cannot-take-3rd-wave-lightly/articleshow/82812979.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmadabad: Dropping oxygen level in Lambha lake kills fish||AHMEDABAD: The sight of hundreds of dead fish floating in a lake in Lambha village on Thursday morning sent panic through the residents. Many suspected it was due to rise in water pollution. However, after testing water samples in the laboratory, AMC officials clarified that nothing was fishy. The deaths had occurred due to reduced level of oxygen in the lake. When residents went to the lake on Thursday morning, they saw hundreds of dead fish floating on the surface. The resident immediately suspected it to be the result of chemical water released into the lake from nearby industries. They informed the AMC South Zone office. Witnesses said that AMC workers initially began cleaning the lake with small nets. However, the sheer number of dead fish forced the team to get a boat and a bigger net to collect the dead fish. The officials said that it took nearly two hours to clean the entire lake. Deputy municipal commissioner (South Zone) Rakesh Mehta said that, prima facie, it appears that the fish had died due to lack of oxygen in the lake due to cloudy atmosphere. However, to rule out pollution, samples have been taken and sent for analysis, he said. The AMC also installed pumps in the lake to aerate the water. The officials said that, in the past, pollution had killed thousands of fishes in Ghodasar lake and even the Sabarmati river.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/dropping-oxygen-level-in-lambha-lake-kills-fish/articleshow/82810594.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Punjab readies for third wave, to train doctors||CHANDIGARH: Amid projections of a possible third wave of Covid and its impact on children, Punjab has ordered its health department to go into ‘mission mode’ with preparation, which will include specialised training of all doctors by the end of Juneand, houseto-house surveillance to control the current spread of the disease in the rural areas. Reviewing the Covid situation in the state during a virtual meeting, chief minister Amarinder Singh on Thursday directed the state expert group head Dr K K Talwar to look into all aspects of medical education, and to get training modules prepared for the health department. He underlined the need to ensure that all medical officers in the state are trained to deal with Covid-19, especially in treating children. Expressing concern over the spread of Covid in rural areas, the chief minister directed that teams of health and other departments immediately start house-to-house surveillance in every village. The teams should be equipped to give basic medicines without delay, and RAT testing of symptomatic persons must be done at the earliest, he said. He also directed that some CHCs in each district be prepared as L2 facilities, with oxygen concentrators and doctors with proper treatment protocols. Stressing the importance of involving sarpanches in this exercise, the chief minister ordered their prioritisation, along with that of panches, as well as block samiti and zila parishad chairmen and members, in vaccination. The police department must also provide support, especially through their village police officers, he added. Capt Amarinder directed the concerned officials to take strict action against private hospitals overcharging Covid patients and said they should also be made to refund the payments received. He asked DCs to coordinate with the health department to track all such complaints. The private hospitals should be asked to display the official rate prominently, and the same should be widely publicised, he stressed. The CM expressed satisfaction at the measures taken by the Control Room for Oxygen, in support with district administration, to manage the situation and prevent any mishap due to oxygen shortage. He lauded the officers stationed at Bokaro and Hazira in ensuring this, while directing the health department to continuously pursue with the Centre the issue of oxygen shortfall, which stands at 700 MT, as well as tankers. He expressed gratitude to HMEL for assisting the state with 4 oxygen tankers, which are expected to arrive within the next few days. Markfed has started working with the railways to run oxygen trains, and four such trips have already been made both from Hazira and from Bokaro, he said. Taking note of the fact that some hospitalised patients need oxygen support for a few days after discharge, the chief minister asked the health department to allow their 5-litre per minute concentrators to be used for this purpose on a temporary loan basis. He also asked the department to set up a bank of oxygen concentrators for this. The positivity rate during May 2-8 week stood at18.5% but had since declined. On testing, he said that in the last one week, 2.13 lakh RTPCR tests had been conducted, with average testing time of a little over 7 hours per test. Health secretary Hussan Lal said the cumulative positivity on Wednesday stood at 6.2%, with Mohali and Malwa regions continuing to show high numbers. Dr Talwar said to ensure that the cases continue to decline, the current restrictions should be followed for the next 2-3 weeks. He said while the genome sequencing of March samples had shown 96% UK variant, only one double mutant case was found in the April samples.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-readies-for-3rd-wave-to-train-doctors/articleshow/82812946.cms||---

---||Pune||Bed availability for Covid patients improves in Pune Metropolitan Region||PUNE: Bed availability for Covid-19 patients in the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR) has considerably improved in the third week of May, after a severe shortage throughout April, following the rise in the recovery rate. PMR data on Thursday revealed that 7,316 beds of the over 14,156 reserved for Covid patients were available in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits. In the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) limits, around 6,227 of the total 10,563 beds were available. These beds include ones with and without oxygen support and also ICU beds with and without ventilator support. Hospitals in the PMC areas had zero ICU ventilator-supported beds for most part of April. The number has gone to around 20. In the PCMC limits, 43 ICU ventilator support beds were available as on Thursday evening. Subhash Salunke, adviser to the state government on Covid-19 and former director general of health services (Maharashtra), told TOI, “We are witnessing a decline in the number of Covid cases. But there is a chance that the number can fluctuate too, just like it is happening in a few districts of the state. The only exception to it is Mumbai, where they have seen a rapid decline.” Salunke said the administration and citizens cannot afford to be complacent. “It is a good sign that we are seeing an overall improvement. But we should be cautious, at least in the present situation,” he said. Authorities from the dedicated Covid hospitals in the Pimpri Chinchwad areas — Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial Hospital and the Autocluster hospital — shared the same view. A senior official from the PMC’s health department confirmed that the bed availability has significantly improved, especially in private hospitals. He, however, admitted that ventilator beds were still a concern. Sanjay Patil, chairman of the IMA’s hospital board of India, said though the number of Covid cases was going down, critical patients were a worry. “That number is the last to be reduced and it needs to be worked upon. Now that the number of patients is going down, small and medium-sized hospitals can see a breather,” he said. According to the district health office data, Pune had 21,856 hospitalised active cases and 43,227 people were in home isolation on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bed-availability-for-covid-patients-improves-in-pmr/articleshow/82812963.cms||Piyush Bhusari

A special ward presently having eight beds has been set up for treatment of the disease at the medicine department of the SN Medical College. Doctors suggested that people having diabetes are highly vulnerable to getting infected. Meanwhile, the state government has determined treatment protocol for the black fungus patients. District magistrate Prabhu N Singh said, “Required arrangements for tests, treatment of black fungus have been made at SNMC. Surgical procedures can also be done on patients in critical condition. Presently four suspected patients of black fungus are under treatment. Out of them one is an active Covid-19. The other three had also suffered Covid-19 infection in the past. All the suspected patients are in the age group of 40 to 70 years. A team of doctors are providing them with the required treatment.” District in-charge for black fungus treatment, Dr Akhil Pratap Singh said, “All the four suspected patients of black fungus have been suffering from diabetes. Steroids were given to them for treatment of Covid-19. We have done surgical procedure on a critical patient who is also Covid-19 positive. Samples all the four suspected patients have been sent for testing at the pathology and microbiology lab” Chief medical officer (CMO) of Agra district, Dr RC Pandey, said that black fungus is an invasive infection caused by a group of molds known as mucormycetes. “These fungi are ubiquitous, naturally occurring in our environment, mainly in soil. Humans get the infection by inhaling the fungal spores floating around in the air and in the dust. These spores get deposited in the nasal passages and sinuses and cause disease in that area. The black fungus becomes worse when people are affected with other health problems or take medicines that can lower the body’s ability to fight germs and sickness.” Dr Singh said that early diagnosis of the disease in diabetes patients is important, or else it could be life threatening. "We have developed a dedicated ward for treatment of mucormycosis, named Mucor ward. Located at the medicine department, presently the ward has eight beds. We have an in-house facility to conduct all the required tests for detection and drugs for treatment of black fungus patients available with us. Most patients in early stages do not know that they have the disease, progression is very rapid. For diabetes patients, this is life-threatening. Early diagnosis is important for treatment and better outcomes,” he said. SNMC principal Dr Sanjay Kala said that the symptoms of the black fungus vary from person to person. “For some patients, the infections can start with strong headache, fever, nasal congestion, facial pain, while for others, it can be loss of vision, toothache, swelling in cheeks or upper jaw, eyes, black crusts in the nose, and sometimes face paralysis. There is a serious chance of dying if the infection reaches the brain.

Refusing to accept the pleas of petitioner Kanumuri Venkata Subba Raju, Justice Abhinand Kumar Shavili issued notices to the Centre, immigration officials and sought their replies within two weeks. The judge was hearing a petition of Subba Raju who said that the immigration officer at the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport affixed a stamp on his passport indicating that it stood cancelled. Stating that a person who defrauded a bank should not talk about rules and procedures when he was facing a lookout circular and was prevented from flying to the US, the judge said: “You cheat a bank and when the aggrieved bank writes to the Centre and got a lookout circular issued against you, you are now talking about rules and procedures. I cannot accept this.” The judge asked the petitioner to make UCO Bank a party. Subba Raju’s counsel argued that there was no criminal case against him and that it was not right to stop him from going to the US as he had already acquired the US citizenship. “It is unlawful to prevent him to leave India,” he said, and added that all this was done at the behest of UCO Bank, Kolkata. The judge then asked the petitioner why did not he make the bank a party to his petition. Subba Raju is a resident of Kavuri Hills near Madhapur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-man-fails-to-get-hc-relief-to-fly-to-us-over-bank-fraud/articleshow/82812995.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Mumbai’s Covid positivity rate drops below 5%, but areas in MMR still at 20%||MUMBAI: The city’s daily Covid positivity rate dropped to 4.8% on Thursday, the lowest it has been since February, raising hope that normal life could resume sooner than later. The highest was 28% on April 3, when Mumbai registered its highest single-day tally of 11,206 cases. But experts cautioned that the rest of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) should also see lower transmission before restrictions are eased. In MMR, the daily positivity rate is hovering between 3.3% and nearly 20%. BMC’s additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said the corporation plans to wait and watch for now. “While Mumbai’s positivity rate has been reducing, we have to watch the rate of the MMR before taking any decision of reducing restrictions after June 1,” said Kakani. The civic body may not even close the Covid centres till the disease trend is clear during the monsoon, he added. The WHO has advised governments that before reopening, rates of positivity in testing should remain at 5% or lower for at least 14 days. Mumbai’s daily positivity halved from 20.8% on April 1 to 9.9% on April 30. In May, despite testing witnessing a decline from April’s average, the positivity rate has not shot up. It has remained under 10%, dropping to 5.3% on Tuesday and 5.9% on Wednesday. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, technical adviser to the state government, said Mumbai cannot afford to resume normal life completely till satellite cities in MMR have settled. The most worrying in MMR right now is Palghar, with a positivity rate of 19.3% on Wednesday. “However, cases have reduced to half of its peak of 18,000,” said district collector Dr Manek Gursal. The Vasai-Virar region also continues to be a hot spot, with the peri-urban areas witnessing a spike in cases since last month. The positivity rate in Mira-Bhayander is around 8-9%, said a doctor. Thane’s positivity rate was 7.4% on Wednesday as 223 patients tested positive from among 2,985 people tested. Thane was mentioned in the briefing of the central health authorities on Thursday as the positivity rate fell from 22% in the April 21-27 week to 9.4% in the May 12-18 week. From a positivity rate of 10% a fortnight ago, the NMMC’s rate is now down to 3.3% now. At Thursday’s press briefing, central health authorities in Delhi said Maharashtra is among the 13 states with positivity between 5% and 15%. From a positivity rate of 25.2% in the April 23-29 week, the state’s ratio has fallen to 14.1% in the May 14-20 week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/citys-positivity-rate-drops-below-5-but-areas-in-mumbai-metropolitan-region-still-at-20/articleshow/82813056.cms||---

The victim was identified as Lavanya, 22, wife of Satyam, a welder, from Pedda Kanjarla village in Patancheru mandal. Lavanya along with Satyam went to visit her grandparents at Mokila village near Shankarpally on Wednesday. Around 5 pm, an argument broke out between Lavanya’s relatives Bhikshapati and Pentaiah, who were neighbours of her grandparents. The argument over a mischievous act by the children of one family was the reason for the trouble. Family members of Pentaiah and Bhikshapati started assaulting each other and when Lavanya’s grandmother Lakshmamma tried to intervene, she was also assaulted by one of them, Shankarpally inspector G Gopinath said. Lavanya rushed to support her grandmother and she accidentally tripped during the scuffle and fell on the floor. Around 9 pm, when she suddenly became unwell at home, family members rushed her to a nearby hospital where she succumbed while undergoing treatment, the inspector said. Though the family of Lavanya mentioned that she was pregnant, police said they were not able to establish it. “There were no external injuries on the victim. A doctor who performed the autopsy, also did not mention that she was pregnant. We have sent the viscera for lab analysis. The cause of death is yet to be ascertained,” the inspector said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/tiff-ends-in-womans-death/articleshow/82813096.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

This is the fourth consecutive day that the figure remained below the 5,000-mark. The positivity rate dipped to 5.5%, which is the lowest since April 4. However, the number of Covid fatalities remained high at 233. The last time Delhi saw lesser number of cases in a single day was on April 1, when 2,790 fresh cases were reported from the 78,073 tests. The positivity rate then was 3.57%. According to Delhi health bulletin, 58,744 tests were carried out in the past 24 hours, including 43,914 RT-PCR and 14,830 Rapid Antigen Tests. At 7,831, the number of Covid patients recovered in the past 24 hours was more than double the number of new cases recorded during the same period. The number of active cases stood at 40,214, compared with 45,047 on Wednesday. This is the first time in two months that the number of active cases has come down below the peak of 44,456 recorded on November 13, 2020. The active case number has seen a dip of 59.7% from the all-time high of 99,725 reported on April 28. There are 23,851 patients recuperating in home isolation currently, while 12,462 are admitted to hospitals. Of the 24,424 Covid beds, 11,962 are vacant, while 5,685 of the 6,282 beds at dedicated Covid care centres and 515 of the 606 beds at Covid health centres are vacant, stated the health bulletin. Of the 6,872 Covid ICU beds in Delhi, 1,640 were vacant at 9pm on Thursday, including 353 ICU beds with ventilators, stated the government’s online corona dashboard. The steady dip in Covid cases and positivity rate has also resulted in hospitals seeing fewer new admissions compared with the number getting discharged since May 13. The 7-day moving average of the number of patients getting discharged has remained around 1,200 since the beginning of the month. The 7-day moving average of new admissions has seen a sharp decline from around 1,700 at the beginning of the month to around 1,000 at present. Health minister Satyendar Jain on Wednesday said the downward trend in cases was due to the lockdown, but Delhi must strive towards having a positivity rate below 5%, and preferably around 2%. “We cannot afford complacency and must follow Covid-appropriate behaviour by all means,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/daily-tally-hits-a-50-day-low-233-deaths-a-worry/articleshow/82813051.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Choked drains caused water to enter shops and houses in half a dozen localities. Besides, caved-in roads left vehicles stranded at over a dozen places in the district. In rural areas, the electric supply remained disrupted. Besides Agra, neighbouring Mainpuri, Firozabad, Kasganj, Hathras, Aligarh and Etah districts also witnessed heavy rainfall. Cool breeze and rainfall, however, brought the maximum temperature down below 30 degrees Celsius in Agra region. In Agra, water-filled potholes on city roads made riding two-wheelers dangerous. Adding to it are non-functional streetlights across all the 100 municipal wards of the city. In major parts of the city, where drainage cleaning was conducted, locals complained of sub-standard work quality. Sanjay Place, Subhash Bazaar, Bodla, Shanganj, Roshan Mohalla, Shastripuram, Bijlighar, Johri Bazaar, Awas Vikas, Albatia road, Dayalbagh, Balkeshwar, Lohamandi, Deewani, Mughal road, Namner, Arjun Nagar, Trans-Yamuna, Kamla Nagar are marketplaces in the city where water entered shops and warehouses. There are 32 major and 400 small drains across 100 municipal wards in Agra, which discharge into the Yamuna. As many of these drainages are interconnected, clogging affects large parts of the city. Additional municipal commissioner KB Singh said, “Waterlogging took place in the city after heavy rainfall, but the water kept receding slowly. Zonal sanitary inspectors have been asked to pump out water and make other required arrangements in the localities where water has entered houses and business premises.” On Thursday, the maximum temperature in Agra district was recorded at 29.8 degrees Celsius, 12 notches below the normal, while the minimum dropped to 22.5 degrees. According to the Indian Metrological Department (IMD), the sky will remain partly cloudy on Friday and the temperature is likely to increase.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/heavy-rainfall-inundates-agra-water-enters-shops-houses/articleshow/82808695.cms||---

Now, it will begin on June 7, instead of June 1. The date was earlier fixed as May 15, which had to be postponed due to the rising number of Covid cases. The testing method will be the online open book examination. However, students and teachers had been demanding that the exams be cancelled, as many students have been affected by the virus and several teachers have lost their lives. A notice by DU’s exam department said: “It is hereby notified for information of all that the final or annual semester examination May/June to commence from June 1 are hereby postponed and will same shall start from June 7.” The old datesheet has been withdrawn. The guidelines for the exam will be provided to the students soon. A Miranda House student said that postponement will only increase the impending anxiety around the exams. “The examinations should be cancelled since many students, professors, non-teaching staff and other stakeholders have either lost their lives or loved ones. In this situation, it seems almost cruel to expect students to gather the will and focus to study for their final exams and it is even worse to expect that the teaching and non-teaching staff would be in a position and mental space to correct the papers,” said Shristi Sensarma. Second-year students will be promoted on the basis of the internal assessment. However, there is no clarity on when the exams of the first year students will be held. the university is yet to take a decision as their semester will end only in August.

---||Chandigarh||Jabbed or not? Drive-through centres fail to provide certificates||Mohali: Even though Tricity residents are enthusiastic about going to Mohali’s two drive-thru vaccination centres to get jabbed, many of them are in a tussle as they have not received certificate of the same even after a period of one week. On Wednesday afternoon, Mohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan took to his Twitter handle and informed people that those who have been vaccinated and did not receive a certificate, will have to fill a form. The link of the same was mentioned in his Tweet. Niharika Arora, a resident of Sector 37, Chandigarh, said, “I and my husband went to Mullanpur for vaccination on May 14. We have made several rounds regarding certificate, but in vain. When we were jabbed, we were promised that we will receive a message on our mobile phone, but to no avail. Along with us, many people came with a hope that their issue will be resolved. How will we go for the second dose without the certificate of the first one?” The Mohali administration launched the two vaccination drive-thru centres on May 12 - one at the Sports Complex at Sector 78 and the other one at the Picadillia, Mullanpur. “I and my wife got vaccinated on May 14 at the Mullanpur drive-thru centre. They made us fill a form with all our details. We both don’t even know which vaccine we got. We made several rounds only to get our issue resolved. Despite getting vaccinated, we don’t have any proof of the same. How will we go for our second jab?” said Loveleen Kumar, a resident of Dhanas. Another resident of the Mohali city, on the condition of anonymity, said he went on the first day at the Sports Complex. “I don’t know which vaccine was administered to me. It has been a week, but I haven’t received any proof of the same,” he added. When asked about the issue, the DC said, “Some details were missing in the slips given and without it, the entry could not be made. We have prepared a form for the public and the issue should be rectified by Friday.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/jabbed-or-not-drive-through-centres-fail-to-provide-certificates/articleshow/82813094.cms||---
---||Kolkata||In 2nd wave, youngsters are in the eye of cytokine storm||KOLKATA: A large number of young Covid patients aged between 18 and 45 are suffering from severe symptoms this time, partly due to their stronger immune system that has been generating a cytokine storm, affecting their organs, say doctors. A cytokine storm occurs when the body starts attacking its own cells and tissues in an attempt to kill the virus. It is suffered by the elderly as well, but due to their relatively weaker immune system, the impact is milder and often not fatal. Another reason why young patients have had more severe symptoms during the second wave is the fact that they have been late in seeking medical advice or hospitalization. By the time they did, their conditions had often turned serious. Patients in their late twenties and early thirties have had very severe symptoms this time, pointed out CMRI Hospital director of pulmonology Raja Dhar. “They are healthy individuals and very few had comorbidities. From last year’s experience, we have seen such patients suffer a very mild disease but many of them have succumbed to Covid this time. One of the reasons is cytokine storm. Lungs have been the most affected organ, followed by the heart, kidneys and the liver. That is why breathing distress has been the first severe symptom of Covid for these youngsters,” added Dhar. RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) interventionist Souren Panja agreed. “While the number of affected has been very high this time, a large number of youngsters have had a very serious disease. Hundreds have suffered pneumonia and breathing distress after a week of contracting Covid. For the rest, a severe weakness has persisted for weeks. Cytokine storm is a reason. It has hit vital organs, leading to death,” said Panja. According to National Institute of Biomedical Genomics associate professor Sreedhar Chinnaswamy, the young population had been spared in the first wave because of the innate or natural immunity. “Because Indians are constantly exposed to different types of intracellular pathogens, our immune system is always under alert and trained to combat intracellular pathogens. In the first wave, the innate immunity was sufficient to guard against a less fit Wuhan strain,” said Chinnaswamy, Since the elderly and the middle-aged are already vaccinated, the young remains the most vulnerable part of the population, according to Belle Vue Clinic internal medicine consultant Rahul Jain. “They are not only unprotected but also suffer from a complacency that they will have a mild disease. But the second wave has been different from the first and the severity is much more this time. Unlike last time, it has not been sparing those without comorbidities. In fact, a majority of our patients are youngsters which is very depressing,” added Jain. With the virus mutating to a more fit strain during the second wave, triggered a pathological, exaggerated and off-targeted immune response. “This is primarily by way of the release of a host of chemicals known as cytokines. These lead to two types of injuries — hyper inflammation and hyper coagulation or clotting,” explained Dr Santanu Tripathi, director (clinical research) at John C Martin Centre for Liver Research & Innovation, Kolkata. Bed scarcity has contributed to many deferring their hospilization and eventually landing up with a severe form of Covid, said Dhar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/in-2nd-wave-youngsters-are-in-the-eye-of-cytokine-storm/articleshow/82810739.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Neighbourhood shops, fish vendors keep their clients safe and deliver to doorsteps||KOLKATA: Competing with online platforms and in an effort to stay in business amid pandemic-induced restrictions, many local grocery, fruit and vegetable and fish and chicken stores have shifted gear and started delivering their goods to doorsteps. These neighbourhood shops, which usually have a regular clientele, have been taking orders on phone and reaching all the items—sometimes, even of very low value, like a packet of noodles or a bottle of sauce—to homes within an agreed-upon period. Manoj Kumar Pasari, a chartered accountant who lives on Cornfield Road, has been getting all the groceries home-delivered from his favourite Punjab Stores. “I dictate him all the items over phone the previous night and by 7am, the goods are at my doorstep. If anything goes missing, they send again,” he said, adding Shakeel Fruits, a vendor on Broad Street, delivered milk, bread, fruits and frozen vegetables, too, within half-an-hour of calling them. To manage all the deliveries on time, shops have employed youths to tackle the growing demand. Ratan Sarkar, who owns a grocery store on Swinhoe Lane, has taken in four men to serve the Kasba neighbourhood. “A large number of senior citizens live in this area and they are happily ordering from me, now that going to malls and supermarkets has become difficult,” he said. Subol Pal, who has been selling fish at Dumurjala in Howrah for 40 years, has been delivering fish to his clients’ home. He has also employed some boys who has been reaching the fish on their cycles. “I have actually seen a jump in sales in these difficult times,” Pal said. For 73-year old Rina Ghosh, a resident of Lake Gardens, her Abha Stores and “Suresh er dokaan” can do what the big super markets can’t. “They are ready to bring any item that I order and even allow me to check the goods before I pay. I love the personal touch with which the essentials come home and am happy to be part of the livelihood ecosystem in these times,” said Ghosh, referred to as “mashimaa” in the area. The sentiment is echoed by Sumitra Ray, a retired teacher who lives at BF Block in Salt Lake. Hanuman Stores in CF Block has been catering to her needs. “We don’t have to lift a finger other than to dial the number and place the order. The delivery is prompt and we get a good discount on the MRP,” she said. Many fish sellers with stalls in markets across the city have started home delivery. There’s a huge demand for local catch these days and many vendors are visiting neighbourhoods, leaving their numbers at homes. “I am ordering my rui-katla, prawn, along with the local catch of parshe, tyangra and bata, from my fish seller, Sanjit, by calling him on phone. He delivers the fish, cut and cleaned,” said Luna Bhowmick, a resident of EC Block in Salt Lake.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/neighbourhood-shops-fish-vendors-keep-their-clients-safe-and-deliver-to-doorsteps/articleshow/82813196.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

The present curfew was ordered on May 9 and will be in force till Monday morning. During the period, shops selling essential commodities have remained open from 7am to1pm and takeaway kitchens from 7am to 7pm.

It is up to him to decide how many more days he would like to continue with it,” Tanavade told TOI. The state cabinet is likely to take a decision in the matter on Friday even as ministers have demanded that the curfew be extended till the end of May. “We want Covid-19 cases in the state to continue to decrease,” a minister said. Science and technology minister Michael Lobo suggested that the restrictions that are currently in place be lifted in a phased manner. “People are now at home and if we reopen, they will not maintain social distancing, stoking fears of a rise in Covid-19 cases all over again. Transport minister Mauvin Godinho too said he would convey his sentiments at Friday’s cabinet meeting. Opposition leader Digambar Kamat said the state had seen the benefits of the curfew and the consequent drop in Covid-19 cases. “There are still two more days remaining for the state government to take a befitting decision in the matter,” he said.

Rohida said his mother was admitted to hospital on May 11 and he had provided all the medicines as prescribed by the doctors. He alleged the nursing staff Manoj Raiger, in connivance with other employees, administered glucose injection instead of remedsiver that led to his mother’s death May 14, Jawahar Nagar police station circle inspector and investigating officer of the case Ramkishan Verma said. Verma said the accused nursing staff of the hospital was later arrested red handed while black marketing of remdesivir injections for Rs 20,000 and held the nursing staff and management including the MD of the hospital responsible for his mother’s death, the CI said. The hospital management had also lodged a case earlier in this connection against its nursing staff alleging theft and black marketing of medicines of the hospital and inquiry into the case was forwarded to Mahavir Nagar police station for further investigation, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/case-against-pvt-hosp-for-giving-glucose-jabs/articleshow/82810811.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Nagpur||Gadkari writes to Tope, requests him to save BAMS docs’ jobs||Nagpur: More than 800 doctors with Bachelor of Aryuveda (BAMS) degree, who were appointed as medical officers (group A) in several rural health centres across the state are on the verge of losing their jobs. The state government has decided to replace them with fresh MBBS graduates as part of their mandatory bond service in rural areas. More than 300 such doctors are in Vidarbha’s 11 districts. After they called on Union minister Nitin Gadkari on May 16, he wrote a letter to Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope requesting him not to discontinue their services. “These doctors have been serving patients in the pandemic since 2019. As per government rules, when an MBBS candidate takes over the post of medical officer (group A) at rural health centres, the services of a BAMS candidate discontinues. But, these doctors deserve to be in the system,” the letter reads. Gadkari has specifically mentioned in his letter that the state government should consider the present rural spread and the projected third wave before ending services of these experienced doctors. Dr Akshay Zaweri from Wardha said BAMS doctors have enough experience of handling Covid-19 patients since over 20 months now. “We have been doing literally every work related to Covid. Each one of us has done works right from stamping quarantine patients, conducting rapid antigen tests, collecting samples for RTPCR tests, contact tracing of positive patients, to door-to-door service to positive patients in home quarantine,” he said. Dr Vikrant Gandhe from Amravati, who has been serving at a primary health centre in Shiraka village, said many BAMS medical officers have already lost their jobs. “Our service ends right on the day an MBBS candidate joins bond service duty. We have been serving here for months while the bond service candidate will be here for 11 months only. We should continue along with them,” he demanded. BAMS medical officers are ready to serve in any other capacity at the vacant posts in rural hospitals. They have enough experience to treat Covid-19 patients. TOI contacted senior officials in the health department who confirmed that Tope is aware of BAMS doctors’ issue. “Any decision in this regard will be taken in a state cabinet meeting after consultation with other ministers and the chief minister,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/gadkari-writes-to-tope-requests-him-to-save-bams-docs-jobs/articleshow/82810835.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Meerut||Kin claim hosp put patient on ventilator after death to ‘extort’ money, home ministry official intervenes||Meerut: A ruckus ensued after a private hospital here allegedly denied handing over the body of the deceased to the attendants demanding clearance of Rs 3 lakh dues. Rajesh Bhatia, 55, a trader hailing from Pandav Nagar locality, was admitted to a city-based hospital on May 9 after testing positive for Covid-19. Later, he was shifted to a ventilator as his condition deteriorated. Bhatia’s family, however, alleged that the hospital had put the patient on a ventilator after his death in a bid to extort money. Besides, an amount of Rs 1.05 lakh was added to the medicines that they had purchased from a chemist outside the hospital, they alleged. The Meerut district administration, meanwhile, said the charges were being probed into. “Initially, they were not ready to hand over the body saying the patient was put on a ventilator. But, when we told them that we could not afford the hospital services and wanted to shift the patient elsewhere, the hospital told us that the patient had died. They asked us to get a body bag,” said the patient’s niece Swati Bhatia. Soon after the ordeal of the family was shared on social media, it merited the attention of Sanjeev Gupta, secretary, Inter-State Council Secretariat, Ministry of Home Affairs. “Additional CMO and SDM went to the hospital. They spoke to me after examining the bills. The cost of all medicines which were wrongly included in the bill has been removed and the issue has been resolved,” Gupta tweeted. Meanwhile, the district administration has launched a probe into the charges levelled by the family. “I have ordered an additional district magistrate and assistant chief medical officer to probe the matter and submit a report,” said Meerut district magistrate K Balaji.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/kin-claim-hosp-put-patient-on-ventilator-after-death-to-extort-money-home-ministry-official-intervenes/articleshow/82806101.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: CoWin portal unlikely to get Covid status check feature||Pune: The CoWin system is unlikely to have a feature that will ask citizens booking appointments for vaccination about their Covid-19 status or disable appointments for those who had the infection but did not complete the three-month period after recovery.Chairperson of the empowered committee on Covid-19 vaccination and head of the CoWin platform, RS Sharma, told TOI, “All such aspects cannot be integrated. What if a person did contract Covid, but does not report the same on the system, if at all such a feature is introduced? It will not be practical to ask crores of people booking appointments for vaccination if they have contracted Covid recently. It is for people to follow this advisory and cannot be enforced via CoWin.”On Wednesday, the health ministry had said those infected with Covid, including persons who contracted the infection after receiving the first dose of the vaccine, should take the jab three months after recovering from the disease. Sharma said people have been told to follow the advisory and have to choose the vaccination period in accordance with the advisory. “We are depending on its publicity and communication by the government to ensure that this advisory is followed. CoWin can only provide flexibility, it cannot force,” he said.A senior official from the health and family welfare ministry told TOI, “Carrying proof such as a test report to the vaccination centre to prove one has completed three months after recovery may be difficult, hence healthcare workers in districts will have to be told to ensure implementation of the advisory by disseminating information to service providers as well as the general public and training vaccination staff.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-cowin-portal-unlikely-to-get-covid-status-check-feature/articleshow/82813172.cms||Neha Madaan

An officer from the Chinchwad police said the woman contacted the suspect over call in February and gave him tips about to invest in the share market. “After gaining the complainant’s confidence, the woman lured him to invest for more profits in the share market,” the officer said. The woman told him to open an offline account in Gujarat and invest in the market through it. “The complainant then transferred Rs50 lakh to the bank accounts of the suspects between February and March,” the officer said. “The complainant only received Rs10 lakh as returns. After that, the suspects stopped responding to him,” the officer said. Despite repeated attempts, when the man failed to contact them, he lodged a complaint on Tuesday, the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/57-year-old-duped-of-rs-40l-cops-book-four/articleshow/82810844.cms||---
---||Goa||Government: Goa Medical College will provide black fungus drug to private hospitals on request||PANAJI: Even as Amphotericin B vials, the anti-fungal used to treat Mucormycosis, is out of stock at private hospitals and pharmacies, Goa Medical College (GMC) will provide it if a request is received. “If any private hospital needs to administer the drug to its patient, it will be given on merit,” health secretary Ravi Dhawan told reporters. On Thursday, one private hospital was provided with Amphotericin B following a request. He said that GMC has a protocol in place to provide medicines like Remdesivir and Tocilizumab injections to private hospitals if they are not easily available. The two injections are given to Covid-19 patients showing signs of respiratory distress. Dhawan said that the Centre has allocated 100 vials of Amphotericin B to Goa, and they will be received at the earliest. Currently, GMC is treating five patients who were diagnosed with black fungus last week, and only this hospital has stock of the vital drug. GMC dean Dr S M Bandekar said that they have adequate stock of Amphotericin B. This week, they had not seen any fresh cases. However, he said that people should not abuse steroids and ensure that their diabetes is under control, as the incidence of black fungus was found to be high among such patients. One of the six patients of black fungus who were under treatment in GMC has died. Bandekar, however, said although he had black fungus, his chest CT score was high. “His CT severity was as high as 24. His death is not attributed to black fungus, it was an incidental finding in him,” he said. Replying to a question, he said he was not aware of how many cases of black fungus are treated by private hospitals. But as of Thursday, he said, one hospital had approached them for the drug and the request was granted to save a life.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gmc-will-provide-black-fungus-drug-to-pvt-hosps-on-request-govt/articleshow/82813170.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: No target set, testing driven by demand, says Iqbal Chahal||MUMBAI: The BMC never set any targets for Covid testing and it was always demand driven, said municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal. “Our single-day highest testing between March 2020 and February 10, 2021 when the second wave started was 24,400. The average was around 12,000 to 14,000,” Chahal told TOI. Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis has accused the BMC of reducing testing to cover up the actual number of Covid patients in the city. He also accused the BMC of trying to keep case numbers low by conducting more Rapid Antigen Tests rather than the more accurate RT-PCR test. “In Mumbai where RT-PCR testing capacity is one lakh per day, the average per day testing is around 34,191 of which 30% tests are RAT,” said Fadnavis. Chahal, however, said, “During the second wave, we touched 56,000 tests (per day), but testing dropped to 45,000 on an average after the lockdown as testing in malls/corporate group testing stopped.” The majority of the daily 45,000 tests was demand driven through home testing calls when positivity touched 31%, said the civic chief. Chahal said the demand for tests has naturally fallen as infection has come down. “Once positivity touches 3-4%, testing is likely to fall further,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-target-set-testing-driven-by-demand-says-chahal/articleshow/82813216.cms||Clara Lewis

---||Delhi||Scout the globe for black fungus drug: Delhi HC||NEW DELHI: The Centre should “scout the globe” to import a key drug required to treat black fungus, Delhi High Court said on Thursday. It directed the central government to file a status report detailing the steps taken to import amphotericin B while noting that “time and human lives are precious” and local manufacturers won’t be able to meet the demand even if they double their production. “You have to get the medicine from wherever in the world. You have to take steps right now. Wherever it is available, get it, scout the globe,” remarked a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh, which was assured that the Centre has already started taking steps to import the medicine. The court’s nudge came after the Centre said that as on May 19, there were over 7,000 black fungus cases in India and nearly 200 in Delhi while five manufacturers had been asked to ramp up their production. At least 20,000 vials have been ordered from abroad through Gilead and other avenues are being explored, it added. The court noted that the domestic production was far less than the demand. “Looking at the shortfall in the supply, we are afraid that mere doubling of production will not suffice. It is not clear by when the augmented production will come inactual production, you have to bridge this gap.” The Centre has been asked to file a status report on the present production capacity, details of producers licensed to produce the medicine, and by when it would be manufactured with the increased capacity. Read AlsoCoronavirus black fungus infection: Signs, symptoms and everything we know about the deadly fungal infectionThe high court also sought details from the central government on the present and expected case loads of mucormycosis in two weeks. The case load in the national capital is 3% of the entire country as per which it is being allocated the drug, the Centre said, adding that stocks had been released in three tranches and Delhi had been allocated 3,150 vials as of now. Delhi government said it was a serious issue as there was a huge demand due to the number of rising cases and the drug shortage. The government said the Centre had allocated 2,150 vials till May 31 while 15,000 vials of 50mg were the projected weekly demand for Delhi as on May 18. It also said a team of four doctors of Maulana Azad Medical College was vetting hospitals’ demands and meeting four times a day to clear applications.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/scout-the-globe-for-black-fungus-drug-hc/articleshow/82810918.cms||Abhinav Garg

---||Nagpur||GMCH doctor flies to Doon, serves in govt hospital to save dad & others||Nagpur: The pandemic has brought with it numerous depressing stories of deaths and bereavement, but at the same time, it has given us many heroes. Last 20 days in the life of Dr Neetish Sinha, a resident doctor from anaesthesiology department of Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) Nagpur, too has introduced a hero within him to all. Dr Neetish, himself a Covid-recovered patient, travelled all the way to Dehradun from Nagpur on May 2. He got his Covid-19 positive father admitted to the government hospital and also got permission to serve in the same ward as a doctor. While being with his father boosting his morale, Dr Neetish also used his experience in GMCH Nagpur to save many patients in the hospital. Recently, his father has got discharge from the hospital. Dr Neetish is still in Dehradun looking after his father at home and many others in the hospital as Uttarakhand is still experiencing the peak of Covid-19. Neetish’s father Anoop Sinha, who works in the Opto Electronics Factory at Dehradun, was down with Covid-19 since April last week. At the same time, Neetish, who was serving in the Covid-19 ward here in GMCH, got infected. Despite consulting local doctors and getting continuous advice from Neetish, his father’s condition deteriorated. “His SPO2 level was between 30-40% and many private hospitals in Dehradun denied admission to him. My younger brother and mother had no option but to keep him at home and pray for his health,” Dr Neetish recalled. At the same time, he was waiting desperately to become Covid-free so that he could travel to Dehradun. Finally, Neetish got the RT-PCR negative report on May 1 and immediately booked a flight. “Our senior colleagues from GMCH and Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) members booked a flight for me. While I was flying home, they continuously kept in touch with my family and the local authorities to get a bed for Papa,” said Neetish, who finally got a bed at the hospital. His request to serve in Covid ward and assist the team of doctors was also accepted by nodal officer Dr Dhawal Gotecha there. “Due to this, it became easy for me to look after my father. I also got an opportunity to help doctors there in treating many serious patients,” said Dr Neetish. According to him, Covid conditions in Uttarakhand worsened after the Kumbh Mela and hospitals are overburdened now. “My experience of working in such a tense situation in Nagpur proved handy and we could save many serious patients,” he said. He said many patients, less critical than his father, died in the Covid ward as they were missing their loved ones and feeling lonely. Dr Gotecha appreciated him for his services in these testing times. Dr Neetish’s father recovered from Covid and got discharge a day before. He is at home now, resting and recovering from weakness. “I have decided to stay here for some more time. I feel this hospital needs my services,” Dr Neetish added.

---||Goa||In a first for Goa, pockets go 100 hours without power||PANAJI: For the first time in living memory, some pockets of Goa faced an unprecedented 100-hour wait for power to be restored after Cyclone Tauktae decimated the state’s infrastructure. From Pilerne to Anjuna-Caisua, Canacona to Balli and Hollant to Sancoale, residents were forced to adapt as power supply continued to remain elusive well past the fourth day. In Pilerne, architect Arvind D’Souza was more than relieved when his supply was finally restored at 4pm on Thursday. “The credit goes to the men on the ground, the linesmen and the junior engineers,” he said. “They performed very well under pressure and without proper equipment.” Over the past four days, D’Souza’s family went back in time, drawing water from the well, conserving it, cooking just enough food for the day, and living sustainably. He wasn’t the only one. In Moira, pianist Jason Quadros only got his power restored at around 3.30pm on Thursday. He told TOI the ideal solution would be underground cabling. “But as long as there are overhead lines, efficient plans need to be put in place,” he said. “From wood-cutting equipment, safety wear, light sources for nightwork, ladders which are safe to climb...” He added that they need to keep reviewing and checking their methods for efficiency. “Politicians go abroad for ‘study tours’,” he said. “Perhaps it would be better to send the engineers for these things if we want to see improvement in Goa.” Meanwhile, in the Anjuna-Caisua panchayat area, power hasn’t yet been restored, and department engineers were unsure of when it would happen. The cyclone saw the entire village plunged into darkness, as well as water problems due to a rupture in the pipeline. Youth from Vagator got together to clear fallen tree branches and facilitate traffic movement. “The people of Anjuna-Caisua don’t have electricity, but the government machinery and the panchayat are sluggish in working towards restoring electricity and water supply,” said social activist Raju Shirodkar, adding that no one has been trying to solve these problems. Areas in Chorao, too, suffered without power for days, with more than 20 electricity poles fallen and damaged at different places. Pockets in Canacona, Balli, Hollant and Sancoale also waited in hope for power supply to be restored, with the department facing a huge shortage in manpower. In Assoy, Chicalim, several senior citizens moved out after power supply hadn’t been restored by Wednesday. The residents gave the department time, understanding their situation and the damage caused by the cyclone and considering theirs wasn’t a very populated area, but on the third day, they decided they had had enough. “We discovered that there was absolute neglect of our area, and although there are around 50 families, we had been neglected,” said resident Chenoa D’Costa. “Disaster management has been lacking in Goa. We need a higher level of preparedness. Our approach to the cyclone was very laid back.” “If the government knows a cyclone is expected, why not go around and take a look at branches which could fall and trim them before the monsoons. If there’s a cyclone coming right before the monsoon, it doesn’t hurt to speed up the work. We definitely need better preparedness in terms of disaster management.” Porvorim resident Juino De Souza said that power consumers should be compensated for the disruption in electricity. “Where is the quick response team? Why is the government talking like it’s doing the people a favour by restoring power? Consumers cannot just be left in the lurch for such long hours, it’s the duty of the government to provide the essential commodity of power,” he said. The department doesn’t take any preventive action of pruning of branches that are dangerously close to power lines despite this being brought to their notice on several occasions, he said. “Prevention is better than cure. Why aren’t trees near power lines pruned and trimmed during the pre-monsoon work when the power supply is shut down for half a day? In the name of the disaster, the government can’t be lethargic. Does it take four days to restore electricity? Where is the response of the disaster management teams?” he asked, adding that the Electricity Act doesn’t require the department to obtain permission for cutting of branches which cause obstruction to electricity supply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-a-first-for-goa-pockets-go-100-hrs-without-power/articleshow/82813198.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Pune||Pune: Fund shortage forces PMPML to postpone boom barrier project||PUNE: The Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited has put off its plan to install boom barriers at the BRTS corridors, citing paucity of funds. “The project has been postponed for now. The transport body is presently facing a severe fund shortage. The money which comes from both the municipal corporations is not forthcoming. The situation presently is such that if the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation don’t provide funds, we will not be able to pay salaries to our employees for May. In December, we received some funds, but still there was a shortfall of Rs100crore,” Rajendra Jagtap, chairman-cum-managing director, PMPML, told TOI. TimesViewThe unguarded Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) corridors are highly unsafe for traffic. Several accidents have taken place in these corridors and citizens have lost lives. It is highly unacceptable that the two civic bodies, PMC and PCMC, which collectively have an annual budget outlay of over Rs 15,000 crore, cannot spare funds to help the PMPML install boom barriers to regulate the entry of vehicles in the high-speed zones. The civic bodies are custodians of taxpayer’s money. All safety infrastructure projects should receive funding on priority.Another PMPML official said that presently guards have been discontinued at BRTS corridors. “Only a few PMPML buses are plying under essential services. We haven’t given a thought to deploying men to guard the corridors,” the official said. The PMC and the PCMC provide funds to the PMPML on 60:40 ratio. Hemant Rasane, the PMC standing committee chairman, said that funds would be provided to the transport body as and when the PMC receives it. “Based on the funds the PMC gets, it will be provided to the PMPML,” he said. Transport activists slammed the idea of doing away with guards at BRTS corridors. “In February, a biker died at Yerwada-Wagholi corridor following a collided head-on with the bus, which caught fire. The same month, four persons sustained injuries after an autorickshaw crashed into a bus at another corridor of the city. The pandemic has resulted in many people becoming jobless. Why cannot the PMPML hire a few of them if their boom barrier plan isn’t working?” said PMP Pravasi Manch activist Sanjay Shitole. Meanwhile, the PMPML officials said that 50 air-conditioned midi buses were likely to begin operation from June. “These buses have been provided to us by the PMC standing committee chairman. These air-conditioned buses will run in the core city areas like Swargate, Poolgate, Deccan, Shivajinagar and Pune station. The fare for this bus is Rs 10,” PMPML traffic manager Dattatray Zende said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/fund-shortage-forces-pmpml-to-postpone-boom-barrier-project/articleshow/82810872.cms||Joy Sengupta

The incident occurred outside a food joint in Hinjewadi late on Tuesday night. Police said the man had an argument with another delivery executive employed with the same company at the same location. “After noticing the bike with the food delivery company’s logo on the box fixed on the back seat, the man set it ablaze and fled,” an officer from the Hinjewadi police told TOI. Gaikwad said, “My motorcycle is beyond repair. Since Wednesday, I have not been able to go for the work as I have no alternate mode of conveyance.” Narrating the entire incident, Gaikwad told TOI, “On Tuesday around 9pm, I had gone to a food joint in Hinjewadi, from where I had to pick up multiple orders. While parking my motorcycle, I noticed that a man was arguing with another delivery personnel, associated with the same company as mine. As I was in hurry, I ignored it and went to pick up the orders.” When he came out, there was no one around and everything seemed to be in order. “After an hour, I was assigned another pick-up from a restaurant at the same spot. I reached there around 10pm. While I was waiting for the parcel, a person came to me and told me that my motorcycle had caught fire,” Gaikwad said. Gaikwad said he was informed by locla residents that his motorcycle was set on fire by the person, who had been arguing with the delivery personnel some time ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/man-torches-wrong-food-delivery-agents-bike-after-argument/articleshow/82810908.cms||Mihir Tanksale
---||Nagpur||Coop registrar suspends Anandam Society prez, secy & treasurer||Nagpur: The joint registrar of cooperatives has ordered a housing society to charge only Rs25,000 as transfer fee for a flat sale. Registrar RD Kausadikar also suspended the president, secretary and treasurer of ‘Anandam Tower-A Housing Society’, for allegedly harassing Charanjit Singh Arora and his wife, and forcing them to pay Rs1.74 lakh as transfer fee on purchasing a flat in their scheme. The registrar also declared the three office bearers ineligible for occupying any post till end of their tenure. They were charged with not complying with earlier orders of the deputy registrar, who also ruled in the flat owner’s favour. Arora, 76, had purchased a flat in the upmarket flat scheme in 2018. He got the order in his favour some 2.5 years after he filed a case with the joint registrar for cooperative housing societies. Arora, who did not appoint a lawyer for his case, told TOI such issues are rampant in housing societies, with many senior citizens harassed under one or the other pretext. He is now set on helping other citizens facing similar issues. Anandam Society president Rajendra Choudhari, however, termed the registrar’s order ‘faulty’, claiming Arora had failed to pay maintenance charges since 2018. “The charges were towards maintenance dues, and it was the collective decision of society members to stop their services for recovery, and not to allot them share certificates till then. Till date, he hasn’t paid the maintenance even after being directed by the registrar. We were surprised by the registrar’s order,” he told TOI, adding they will again approach Kausadikar with more proof. Arora had purchased Flat no. 1504 from builder Goldbricks Infrastructure Limited on August 13, 2018, with his retirement savings. It had been earlier allocated to Amit Agrawal, but the registry wasn’t completely, so it was sold to Arora. Four days later, the society issued him notice to pay Rs1.74 lakh as transfer fee. Even after he pointed out that he had purchased the flat directly from the builder, the society office-bearers rejected his claims and stopped his garbage collection and other services. Arora approached the deputy registrar’s office contending that transfer fee should either be 2.5% of the price or Rs25,000. In December, the deputy registrar directed the society not to charge more than Rs25,000 from the applicant. The society was also told to transfer the security deposit, corpus fund and other amounts in Arora’s name as early as possible and also enrol him in the members’ list. After the society failed to comply with the orders, Arora moved an application before the joint registrar, who summoned its office bearers on March 3. Their lawyer informed that the deputy registrar’s decision had been challenged in the high court. Kausadikar then sought the opinion of Nagpur District Cooperative Housing Societies Federation, which granted no objection for action against Anandam Society, since the latter wasn’t its member. Anandam Society also failed to produce any record of its claim that registrar’s order was challenged in the HC. Kausadikar then asked Arora to deposit maintenance charges with the society, which would not charge any transfer fee from him and restore all services to him available to other flat members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/coop-registrar-suspends-anandam-society-prez-secy-treasurer/articleshow/82810927.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

In the past 20 days, 218 patients have succumbed to the virus and the active case count dropped by 2,092 cases. Mohali DC Girish Dayalan said the graph was declining by the day and soon Mohali would become a safe district. He said, “We have the best recovery rate in the state, which is improving by the day. Mohali is also among the top districts in sampling and testing.” The recovery rate has once again inched to 85.51%, which was 79.42% on May 1 and had fallen to as low as 75% last month. The recovery rate had touched 95% in January, but thereafter started falling gradually. The positive case count has risen by 15,770 cases in just 20 days, but the recoveries have also increased by 17,644 cases. The positive cases, which were 47,506 on May 1, reached 63,276 by May 20. Similarly, the recoveries, which were recorded at 37,733 on May 1, have reached 55,377, a rise of 17,644.These 17,644 recoveries in 20 days come to approximately 882 patients defeating the deadly virus daily. Mohali saw approximately 20 people succumbing to the virus daily with 218 deaths recorded in the past 20 days. The DC said the mortality rate was much higher in patients over the age of 55 years and 85% of them had comorbidities. He said the mortality rate in the age group of 18 years to 44 years was very low. “The cause of death in the age group of 18 years to 44 years, according to doctors, is primarily either obesity or excessive smoking. Otherwise, in senior citizens the major causes of death were diabetes, hypersensitivity, cardiac surgery, kidney transplant, cancer and other such diseases,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mohali-drop-in-active-cases-deaths-rise/articleshow/82810914.cms||Barinderjit Saluja
---||Goa||Goa: Vaccination doses for 18-44 expected in June, gap before slots opens again, say Dr Rajendra Borkar||PANAJI: The Union health ministry has allotted to the state 36,580 more doses of the vaccine for the 18-44 age group, state immunisation officer Dr Rajendra Borkar said on Thursday. “We will have to request the Serum Institute of India (SII) for these and make an advance payment, after which we will receive these,” said Borkar, adding that the government initially requested 5 lakh doses. These are likely to be administered in June, he said, adding that there is likely to be a gap before vaccination slots open up again for this category. Centres are doing their best to eliminate wastage of vaccines, he said. The state, which initially received 32,870 doses, now has around 4,000 doses left for the 18-44 age group. “We will then take a decision and draw out a plan for the usage of these 4,000 doses,” he said. Meanwhile, the state government has received complaints from residents regarding people from outside Goa booking slots in the state. Health secretary Ravi Dhawan told reporters that the government doesn’t discriminate. This policy holds for Covid admission or for a Covid test, and the same logic is applied to those booking a vaccine. “The government has taken a considered decision not to discriminate against anyone when it comes to administering vaccines in Goa, and this is in line with what all other states have done,” he said, adding that it is not true that the network outside the state allows people to book faster than in Goa. The doses are being procured at Rs 300 per dose, and being administered to the 18-44 age group for free, he said. Borkar also asked people to cancel their vaccine appointments before 9am if they are unable to show up for the vaccine on that given day, so that somebody else can benefit. He said there must be a gap of 90 days or three months between doses, adding that the portal doesn’t accept a person trying to slot their second dose earlier than allowed. This includes the people who took their first dose before the 12-16 week gap was announced. Those who had Covid or any other serious illness must wait three months/90 days before getting vaccinated and before taking their second dose, he said, adding that lactating mothers can also take the vaccine. The state government is considering various groups of vulnerable people for the vaccine, including persons with disabilities, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vax-doses-for-18-44-expected-in-june-gap-before-slots-opens-again-borkar/articleshow/82813237.cms||---

These were some of the suggestions submitted by various associations of traders and industrialists to a panel chaired by UT deputy commissioner Mandip Brar. The UT administration, on May 17, had not provided any relaxation in the Covid curfew and extended it till 5am on May 25. The different options, like opening of shops on odd-even basis, were discussed in the review meeting chaired by UT administrator VP Singh Badnore, but all were rejected. In the meeting, the UT administrator had directed that a panel headed by deputy commissioner Mandip Brar would hold a meeting with market welfare and industrial associations to solicit their views and suggestions regarding relief that could be provided to them due to losses suffered. Brar held meetings with different associations, including Chandigarh Beopar Mandal (CBM) and Chandigarh Udyog Vyapar Mandal, in the last two days and would submit his report to the UT administration. There were demands that shops dealing in non-essential items should be allowed to open immediately, at least on evenodd basis, since closure of markets for a long time would prove fatal for the conventional retail businesses. Associations said if banks, offices and industries could open and public could move freely during this partial lockdown, there was no justification in keeping the shops closed. It was very difficult for the medium and small shopkeepers to survive as they have liabilities of paying rent and salaries, apart from household expenses, traders submitted. Traders’ body also sought waiver on cess and charges like electricity, water, property tax and lease payment applicable on commercial buildings, which were closed completely or partially during the lockdown period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/allow-shops-to-open-for-5-hours-or-on-odd-even-days-say-bizmen/articleshow/82810958.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti
---||Mumbai||Pre-arrest bail: Two to pay Rs 5k to CM fund for flouting Covid curbs||MUMBAI: In a unique instance, while granting anticipatory bail to two men, a sessions court on Wednesday directed them to pay Rs 5,000 each towards the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund–Covid-19, for violating the restriction rules and playing cricket earlier this month. Goregaon (East) residents Prashant Ade (26) and Muralidhar Jadhav (36) were booked after they allegedly got into a fight and assaulted a man for cheering the opponent’s team. Granting them relief, the court said they were willing to make the contribution. The court reasoned the second wave had struck civil society hard and the virus had neither differentiated between men and women nor young and old. “...By this time the virus has engulfed the whole world, therefore, the guidelines issued by the government from time to time have to be followed by the citizens, as they are issued only in public interest and to control the spread of pandemic. Since both the applicants have violated the directions, they owe duty towards the society to compensate for the same,” the court said. It also pointed out while cops had booked the accused for offences relating to the assault, they and others playing cricket were not charged for violating lockdown norms. An FIR was registered at the Aarey police station on May 5. It was alleged the accused and others were playing cricket on the open ground at Aarey Colony. The victim claimed around 5.40pm when he went to see their cricket match and applauded the batsman who hit a six, the accused who were fielding became angry. He alleged Ade hit him with an empty liquor bottle and bit him. Jadhav is alleged to have hit him with a bat. The other players then separated them and the victim treated his injuries in a private hospital. The accused denied the allegations and claimed the victim was drunk and he had assaulted them with the bottle. Both the prosecution and the victim opposed the accused pleas. The prosecution said the weapons were yet to be recovered. The victim alleged he was threatened and told to take back his complaint. The court, though, said the arrest of any person in any crime brings stigma particularly when he does not have a past criminal record. The court said while the bottle was shattered and there was no question of its recovery, the accused were willing to give the bat to the cops. It said the accused were willing to cooperate with the probe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/pre-arrest-bail-two-to-pay-rs-5k-to-cm-fund-for-flouting-covid-curbs-in-mumbai/articleshow/82811340.cms||Rebecca Samervel

---||Goa||Goa: Officials peg agriculture loss in Sattari at Rs 40 lakh||VALPOI: The zonal agricultural office of Sattari has estimated a loss of around Rs 40 lakh in the taluka, with most of the plantations being damaged completely due to the recent cyclonic winds. Keri, Rawan, Sanvordem, Mauxi and Guleli villages in Sattari have been most affected by the high velocity winds and heavy rains. In rural places of Sattari, most of the villagers are involved in agriculture and depend on agricultural income. Farmers, who are in the midst of harvesting their summer crops, experienced their worst time of the season and now hope for the best compensation from the government as soon as possible. Devendra Gawas, a resident of Keri, said that different types of plantations in his village have been completely damaged and due to which, heavy losses were suffered by the farmers. “It was a heartbreaking moment for me to see my banana plantation getting destroyed in the cyclonic winds,” he said. Zonal agricultural officer of Sattari Vishwanath Gawas told TOI that banana, arecanut, mango, cashew and coconut plantations have been damaged in different parts of the taluka, however, arecanut and banana plantations are affected the most. “My officials and I have inspected all the plantations which are damaged due to the gusty winds and estimated a loss of around Rs 40 lakh,” he said. The zonal officer further said that he has submitted the estimated report to the deputy collector of the taluka and the agriculture department. “We will receive the complaints of the farmers, who can now apply in the prescribed format to claim the compensation,” he added. Health minister and Valpoi MLA Vishwajit Rane said that he has been in touch with all the panchayat members, zilla panchayat members and zonal agricultural officers of Sattari to assess the ground situation on loss of crop damage. “I have asked all our people to submit photographic evidence so that a proper report can be prepared and sent to the agriculture minister and the chief minister for their consideration to ensure maximum compensation is paid to the farmers for their loss” Rane said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/officials-peg-agriculture-loss-in-sattari-at-rs-40-lakh/articleshow/82813287.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Deshpande, whose bamboo art & commerce moulded lives of Melghat tribals, succumbs to Covid||Nagpur: Sunil Deshpande (52), one of the pioneers in the bamboo sector, who developed various aspects, from artisan skill up-gradation to building and designing low-cost housing to the marketing of handicraft products, succumbed to Covid-19 in Nagpur on Wednesday night. Deshpande was admitted to a private hospital here and was on ventilator a day after he was brought here from Lawada, 285km away in Melghat. He used to run his NGO Sampoorna Bamboo Kendra (SBK), providing employment to local youths based on bamboo for the last 25 years in Melghat. A known figure in the sector, many expressed shock over his untimely death. He is survived by mother, wife, and a daughter. Deshpande had been suffering from fever and cough from April 23. He did an RT-PCR test on April 30, and tested positive. He was admitted to Dr Ashish Satav’s MAHAN Trust Hospital in Melghat for 10 days, but did not respond to treatment. When highways minister Nitin Gadkari learned this he advised shifting Deshpande to Nagpur. “He was admitted to a private hospital on May 14 in Nagpur. In the last three days, he was on ventilator as his CT score reached 22 and oxygen level was 70,” said Ajay Thombre, who was associated with Deshpande since 1995. SBK under Deshpande trained over 10,000 people in bamboo handicraft in Lawada, and many have generated employment through this art. He had also set up Gram Gyanpeeth for developing Indian ancient knowledge regarding tradition, culture, art, science, and folk art using artisans from Melghat. “The former ABVP leader was committed to the welfare of Melghat tribals till the end. It is a big loss for the bamboo sector,” said Union minister Gadkari. Deshpande and his wife Nirupama, who is a Tata Institute of Social Sciences graduate, could have got a comfortable job but both chose to live in remote Melghat since 1997 when there were no roads and communication network. Many times both fell ill due to weather conditions there but they slowly built up SBK focusing on bamboo craft and housing. “He was peeved by the plight of people suffering malnutrition and this was one of the reasons he shifted to Melghat. His centre was visited by VIPs to see his art and his innovation of bamboo rakhis made him very popular. He also organized ‘Karigar Panchayats’ for all artisans. In March, Gondwana University had chosen him for DLit for his services to tribals,” said V Giriraj, ex-principal secretary, water conservation. “We were almost ready with the notification to confer DLit on Deshpande. We will be missing him,” said Shrinivasa Varakhedi, Gondwana University vice-chancellor. Veteran bamboo expert Sunil Joshi recalled, “Deshpande and I were disciples of late architect Vinoo Kale, who introduced bamboo to us and ignited the spirit of exploring it for social, environmental, industrial and economic good of society.” “It was difficult then to imagine that someone would use bamboo as a tool for tribal development in Melghat. A diehard RSS swayamsevak, Deshpande wove thousands of tribals in accomplishing what was imagined to be a ‘mission impossible’ together with his wife Nirupama,” said Joshi, member, National Governing Council, Bamboo Society of India (BSI). “His untiring efforts to promote bamboo, and humanitarian contribution will be remembered forever,” said bamboo expert Anand Fiskey. “His departure is a big loss to the bamboo sector. His NGO had constructed more than 1,700 low-cost bamboo houses out of which 742 were at Kutch in Gujarat’s quake-affected region. He had started his mission by constructing 200 bamboo houses for Kolam tribals in Yavatmal,” said Kishor Rithe, Satpuda Foundation. “It was not only about livelihood to tribals but Deshpande played a key role in advocacy for amendment in the national and state bamboo policy. His absence will be felt by one and all,” said Pratap Goswami, bamboo consultant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/deshpande-whose-bamboo-art-commerce-moulded-lives-of-melghat-tribals-succumbs-to-covid/articleshow/82810981.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

---||Delhi||Delhi govt to open treatment centres at three hospitals||New Delhi: Scaling up preparations to tackle the rising cases of black fungus (mucormycosis), Delhi government has decided to open treatment centres at Lok Nayak, Guru Teg Bahadur and Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality hospitals. Teams of specialised doctors would be constituted at each centre for efficient functioning. The government will also prepare a detailed plan and issue special standard operating procedures (SOP) on raising awareness among Covid-recovered people for prevention of the disease. The decisions were taken in a high-level meeting convened by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday. It was also decided that the government would ensure adequate medicines used in treatment of the fungal infection caused by a group of moulds known as mucormycetes and spread awareness regarding prevention measures. Talking to mediapersons while visiting the kin of a frontline worker who died fighting Covid-19, Kejriwal asked all hospitals and doctors to use steroids in a controlled manner because it was causing black fungus in Covid patients after getting mixed with blood sugar. According to experts, steroids used in an uncontrolled manner can cause blood sugar levels to spike in people, especially those suffering from diabetes. This happens because the liver cannot process the high amount of sugar. The CM hoped that the Centre would provide Delhi with a sufficient number of injections for black fungus. According to the SOPs, Delhi government has formed a team of doctors to give injections to affected patients. The team has received 84 applications from different hospitals for the injections. The nodal minister for Covid management deputy CM Manish Sisodia, health minister Satyendar Jain, chief secretary, senior officials from the health department and experts were also present in the meeting to discuss the preventive measures. “Delhi is the national capital, so people from outside also come here for treatment. We should have a sufficient quantity of medicines to cater to everybody coming for the treatment of black fungus,” the CM stated in the meeting. Kejriwal said the government would try and stop the disease from growing and those who were getting affected had to be given better treatment as soon as possible. Since the fourth Covid wave affected a large number of people and up to 28,000 cases were reported in a single day during its peak, many patients turned serious. As a result, the number of patients who received steroids is huge. The increasing number of cases of black fungus has left such people scared. The government wants to create awareness among them so that they know the symptoms and seek proper medical attention to check the disease before it's too late.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-govt-to-open-treatment-centres-at-three-hospitals/articleshow/82811072.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Pune||BORI adds 7L pages from 16k rare books to digital library||Pune: The Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute (BORI) in Pune has digitised seven lakh pages of 16,000 rare books to create a digital library. BORI aims to finish digitisation by end of this year.This collection covers several languages and scripts such as Sanskrit, Prakrit, Indian regional languages, Classical, Asean and European languages. The digitisation process started five years ago and the library was made open to the public on subscription basis in 2019. Established in 1917, BORI is home to more than 153,000 rare books and 28,000 manuscripts collected over 90 years. It includes collections on topics such as the Vedas, Ayurveda, Buddhism, Jainism, Sanskrit and its grammar, and Ancient Indian philosophies.Honorary secretary Sudheer Vaishampayan said, “As the institute approached its centenary year in 2017, we recognised the need to evolve in a new direction and to protect the treasure in our care, and also the significance of making it accessible.”Vaishampayan said although a majority of rare books are being digitised, there are at least 8,000 more in process and they intend to finish the work by the end of this year. “The pace has been hampered due to Covid and a lack of skilled manpower. It will be completed in one year,” he added.The digital platform has been mainly been helpful to scholars, researchers and enthusiasts who are studying manuscripts. BORI tied up with Nyansa as their digital partner. Chinmay Bhandari of Nyansa, said, “The primary catalyst of digitisation was preservation and secondly, overseas scholars who would visit BORI only to read four to five books at one point of time. Researchers can subscribe to take advantage of the treasure.”Bandi said they chose rare books not available anywhere and at least eight years old. The oldest book digitised by BORI was 180 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bori-adds-7l-pages-from-16k-rare-books-to-digital-library/articleshow/82810963.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

There are reports that a new KPCC president, opposition leader, and UDF convener are likely to take over the reins of the party that faced its worst-ever defeat in the recent assembly election. According to party sources, V D Satheesan is tipped for the post of opposition leader, K Sudhakaran for the KPCC president role, and P T Thomas is being considered for the UDF convener post. The announcement of a new opposition leader is expected on Friday as the assembly session is beginning soon. A report tabled by high-command observers Mallikarjun Kharge and Vaidyalingam is the reason for the party considering a replacement for Ramesh Chennithala, sources said. The AICC observers met MLAs, MPs, and senior leaders one-on-one on their choice of leader for the party in the state assembly. Even though Chennithala received the support of former chief minister Oommen Chandy and his supporters, most of the young MLAs, MPs, and other leaders demanded a shuffle, even in the KPCC. It is learned that the high command is also in favour of a change in the leadership in the state in the wake of the dismal performance in the assembly polls in which the Congress-led UDF managed just 41 seats out of 140, a drop of six seats from the previous term. It is understood that Rahul Gandhi has personally favoured a generational change in the party in the state. When both the CPM and CPI have come forward with a makeover in the cabinet, the AICC leadership is too keen on doing the same to create an impact and bring back confidence among its cadre. To rejuvenate the party at the grassroots level, K Sudhakaran is favoured to replace Mullappally Ramachandran. There is reportedly a push from within the party ranks to make Sudhakaran the president of the KPCC. The need for a fresh face in the convener role of the UDF is the likely reason why PT Thomas is being considered for the convener role. However, sources said that K V Thomas has also expressed interest in the post.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cong-state-leadership-set-for-an-overhaul/articleshow/82810986.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Those with appointment, elderly should get priority for jab: Bombay HC||MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Thursday directed that people who have confirmed appointments for vaccination through CoWin portal “shall be given preference” over on-spot registrants at vaccine centres.  The HC in an interim order also said that authorities must “make an earnest endeavour to ensure that elderly citizens are not made to wait in queues at vaccination centres for long and that immediate steps are taken to vaccinate them.” The HC also called for vaccinating healthcare workers and frontline workers in the age group of 18-44 years on priority basis. The HC passed the orders in two PILs. While the PIL filed by Yogeeta Vanzara alleged that the Centre’s CoWin portal was “heavily ridden with numerous challenges” which make its stressful for those attempting to get appointments, another by Siddharth Chandrashekhar raised similar concerns for orderly administration of vaccines. On a plea by Chandrashekhar’s counsel, advocate Anita Castellino, the HC said the elderly and senior citizens in wheelchairs should not be kept waiting for vaccination. In the other PIL, advocate Jamsheed Master, at the hearing via video conference, shared the CoWin screen with the court and showed how “bookings open at different times and only one day in advance”. He said despite getting appointments after hours of trying, several people have found that the centre assigned to them lacks vaccines. He said despite getting a pre-noon appointment for vaccination, his senior citizen father had to wait for eight hours in the queue. Vaccine centres have huge crowds, he said, adding the issue could be resolved if more centres were opened up. Master sought interim orders to ensure those with appointments get vaccines before walk-in vaccine-seekers. The HC bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Kulkarni agreed to his request. The civic lawyer then said the BMC was already following that as a procedure. The bench said, “If you are, then you would have no problem following our interim order.” Additional solicitor general Anil Singh said that the Centre has already given instructions to open vaccination centres on a weekly basis along with advance notice on how many doses will be available. The HC directed the Centre, state and BMC to respond to both PILs by May 31, and adjourned the matters to June 2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/those-with-appt-elderly-should-get-priority-for-jab-bombay-hc/articleshow/82813285.cms||---

India meteorological department (IMD), Delhi, has forecast that a low pressure area is likely to form in north Andaman Sea and east central Bay of Bengal on May 22. It will then develop into a cyclonic storm during the next 72 hours and is likely to move towards Odisha and West Bengal coast by May 26, the bulletin states. While the state is recovering from the trail of widespread destruction from the system that originated in Arabian Sea, there might be some relief that the new system on the other side of the coast may not be significant to Goa’s weather. “It is not expected to have any impact over Goa,” Rahul M, scientist, IMD, Panaji said. The overcast skies are slowly clearing up after Tauktae ripped barely 150km from Goa’s coast on Sunday. After the heavy rain on Sunday and windy conditions for a few days, the weather at the peak of summer has been pleasant during the last couple of days. On Thursday, IMD recorded a maximum temperature of nearly five degrees below normal at 28.7 degrees celsius and a minimum temperature of 24.4 degrees celsius.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/another-cyclone-yaas-to-form-in-bay-of-bengal-goa-safe-imd/articleshow/82813254.cms||---
---||Meerut||Three school kids start helping Covid patients in Meerut, 250 join them in class action||MEERUT: Typical of teen lingo, the name three school kids thought of for an online student group was 'Studomatrix'. But the purpose was loftier. As Covid-19 hit a high in April and hospitals were overwhelmed with requests for admission, and WhatsApp groups inundated with unconfirmed messages about availability of oxygen cylinders, Ansh Garg knew he had to plug the gap between fact and fiction. It didn't take long for his two friends, Avani Singh and Rishay Gupta, to join hands. Before they knew, 250 students from across India had volunteered as foot soldiers. Soon, two WhatsApp groups were floated -- 'Covid-19 Sahayta Kendra' and 'Sahayta Kendra Volunteers'. The first was for students who were ready to devote time every day to find verified leads on hospital beds, ventilators and oxygen cylinders across states. The second group then worked on the genuine information, connecting patients with their needs -- from Meerut to Nagpur, Kolkata to Bengaluru. They have by now helped hundreds. “The strategy was simple," Ansh, a resident of Saharanpur and student of class XII, told TOI. "Good information has the power to save lives. So, in the first week of May, we floated Studomatrix. Avani and Rishay, both from Meerut, came in. We had to develop a database of verified leads that could be passed on to people in need, and on time.” Avani, 17, added, “Whenever a demand arises for something, a hospital bed in Chandigarh perhaps, we immediately contact our network source in that city who has access to the real data on beds there. We then quickly call the hospital for confirmation and the needy person is directed to that facility.” Some 110 volunteers in the primary Whatsapp group continuously keep track of leads and update the database. Then the other group takes over. TOI contacted some of the families, in different parts of India, who had got help from these students. Devraj Khunteta, a Jaipur resident, was one of them. “My grandmother was in dire need of a ventilator. Most hospitals had beds but no ventilator. It was then that I sent across messages to my friends and one of them connected with this group. I was immediately sent verified information and I got a ventilator.” In Delhi, Anoma Jayant got a bed for her uncle in the nick of time. And in Bengaluru, Elakkana P got AB negative blood. One of the volunteers, Sripriya Chowdhury, 18, said she takes care of the 'Kolkata region'. “I generate authentic leads for my city," she said. "It is a strenuous task. But then it is a matter of life and death. If someone gets an oxygen cylinder within time, it saves a life. It's a noble cause and spending two hours daily is not a big deal.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/3-school-kids-start-helping-covid-patients-250-join-them-in-class-action/articleshow/82806185.cms||Sandeep Rai

---||Kochi||Black fungus attack: Nine persons currently under treatment in Kerala||KOCHI: In the second wave of Covid in Kerala, nine persons — of whom eight are Covid patients — were pushed back into the ICUs and surgical wards after a deadly attack of mucormycosis (MM), also known as black fungus. Of these, five MM cases were confirmed on Thursday raising concern about the sudden surge in MM cases amongst Covid-affected persons in the state — both recovered and under treatment. With the health system totally focused on Covid treatment and beds in all hospitals full, health experts said that surge of MM is an additional challenge as most of the MM patients are “surgically high-risk patients”. To get the complete picture and plan ahead, the state government has asked hospitals to give details of MM cases reported from January 2021. “Preliminary investigation shows that MM is seen in young patients and elderly too. With more number of critical Covid patients with diabetes, more number of patients on steroids and more people in an immunosuppressed state, we are likely to see an increase in MM cases too,” said state medical board chairperson Dr Chandini R. All nine patients had to undergo surgery, with two losing their eyesight, and are under treatment at the hospital. The highest number of MM cases are reported from Thiruvananthapuram district (three) followed by Kottayam (two) and one each from Kollam, Ernakulam, Palakkad and Malappuram. Majority of them are diabetic. Even before Covid, MM was seen in patients with uncontrolled diabetes and post-transplant patients, with the state reporting about seven to eight cases in a year. During the Covid first wave, MM was seen in one or two patients and they were cured. But in the second wave, MM is also seen in patients who are not diabetic and treating doctors urged that rampant use of steroids during the pandemic needs to be rationalized. “Our aim is to detect MM early so that we can completely cure a patient. Black fungus is there in the environment and being an opportunistic infection it attacks us when our immunity is low due to Covid added with insidious use of steroids,” said Dr Suma R, additional professor, ENT surgeon, Manjeri Medical College Hospital, which is treating three patients with MM. The sudden rise in MM cases has forced the state government to rush to procure amphotericin B, a key drug used to treat MM. “At present we have stock of only 150 vials of amphotericin B. There are three companies manufacturing the drug and we had placed an order. But now central government has informed that they will allocate the drug to each state and the states need to then purchase the allocated drug from the drug manufacturer. We have now requested for more vials of amphotericin B and may soon receive 50 vials allocated to us,” said Kerala Medical Services Corporation Ltd general manager Dr Dileep Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/black-fungus-attack-nine-persons-currently-under-treatment-in-state/articleshow/82811033.cms||Preetu Nair

A video of D’Souza cutting down a tree with a chainsaw only served to further fuel the annoyance of locals, with many terming it a PR stunt. They accused D’Souza of being too late to respond to the situation. “He was not to be seen when he was needed the most and now his PR stunts had further delayed the work,” a local said on a social media platform.

---||India||Government makes RAT key tool to track Covid in rural areas||NEW DELHI : In the wake of a second wave of Covid and the need to track the disease in rural areas with a sparser dispersion of laboratories, government is making the Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) a key pillar of its Covid strategy of mobile vans, 24X7 RAT booths in schools, colleges, community centers and RWA offices to make testing easier and faster. Though the RT-PCR tests remain the gold standard of testing, the Centre sees RAT, even with lesser reliability, an impotrtant tool to improve tracking and therefore containment. While Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) aims to increase total testing capacity to 45 lakh tests a day by end of June from an average of 19 lakh on May 14, share of RAT is likely to increase three-fold from 7 lakh to 27 lakhs a day, said ICMR director general Balram Bhargava. The Council has also approved a RAT kit for home testing which will soon be available in the market. Bhargava explained that an individual can test at home and upload a screen shot of the reading to an app to recieve a report on Covid status. The tests that are being rolled out will cost Rs 250 each but the price will vary as per manufacturer. The change in approach is aimed at tackling the upsurge and the ingress of the infection in rural areas. RAT will not only help in early detection of positive cases, but also enable isolation to reduce transmission and timely treatment to reduce deaths. When the first phase of Covid-19 spread was mostly concentrated in urban areas like cities and towns, the government promoted RT-PCR testing which requires around 24 hours and a laboratory to get the results. Since most laboratories are concentrated in urban areas and the viral infection seems to be progressing -- as compared to the first wave -- quicker in rural setting, RAT with a faster turnaround time is seen as a feasible option. It is felt it can provide a good indicator of infection in villages and more remote tribal areas helping public health experts plan containment measures. The government has mandated that all RAT and RT-PCR results have to be uploaded on ICMR portal. While there was an upswing in Covid-19 cases during the second wave, testing increased gradually. In April- May, an average of 16-20 lakh tests per day were conducted with the highest 20.60 lakh samples tested on May 19, Bhargava said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/government-makes-rat-key-tool-to-track-covid-in-rural-areas/articleshow/82817079.cms||Sushmi Dey

Currently, he is the secretary of the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi.The petitioner’s counsel submitted that Ameen was involved in two cases in 2002 and 2007, but now leading a peaceful life. Though he was not involved in any other criminal case, the historysheet which was opened in 2007 and expired in 2018, it is still being renewed periodically. Police are making surveillance and harassing the petitioner stating that the historysheet is now extended.The government advocate submitted that the petitioner is a habitual offender and was closely associated with one Imam Ali, who was involved in many cases on religious issues. Due to this, police surveillance is very much necessary and no case has been made out for removing his name from the historysheet.Justice G Ilangovan observed that as per the guidelines, valid materials must be available on record and the officer must record the reasons based upon both objective and subjective satisfaction.The judge said that it is clear that the police are not in a position to inform the court with regard to the materials available for extending the petitioner’s historysheet, the petitioner has got a valid case.The judge observed that the main allegation against the petitioner is that he was closely associated with Ali and was also giving protection to him. “But, now, the Imam Ali saga is over and more than 10 years have elapsed. It is also seen that the petitioner is now settled and leading a peaceful life and became functionary in a political party. He is not involved in any other criminal case after 2007,” observed the judge.Observing that continuing the historysheet will amount to abusing the process of law, the judged disposed of the petition, and directed the police to remove Ameen’s name within a month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-directs-police-to-remove-name-of-man-from-historysheet/articleshow/82813364.cms||Kaushik Kannan

A fake message circulating since last year that claims a US pharma giant owns both a Chinese lab that “created” the virus and a major vaccine against Covid-19. Such false claims have been circulating ever since the pandemic broke in 2019. Experts have urged citizens to rely on verified information, and not on social media, for advisories on the coronavirus and Covid-19. Since its launch April 30, the Times Verified service has helped readers bust nearly 400 fake messages. The banana claim, shared as a video clip, has been found on Facebook and WhatsApp. “Australian researchers find that bananas can help prevent Covid-19,” it said. However, it later emerged that the video was doctored from a news report by an Australian news channel. The scientists cited in the “video” later refuted the claims. Another false claim linked a US pharmaceutical company, a lab in Wuhan and the Pfizer vaccine. The message — certified as fake by Times Verified — stated that the pharma company owns both the lab and the vaccine against Covid. But Pfizer is owned by a range of shareholders and the China virology lab is funded by the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Social media has been flooded with falsehoods and conspiracy theories that threaten to de-legitimise efforts to contain the pandemic.

The judicial magistrate (JM) court at Thiruvaiyaru, in 2013, convicted and sentenced him to undergo two years simple imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs 5,000 offence under Section 304(A) of IPC and imposed a fine of Rs 500 for offence under Section 279 of the IPC.When he filed an appeal, the same was dismissed by the Thanjavur principal sessions court by confirming the order of the JM court in 2016. Hence, the petitioner moved the HC Madurai bench by filing this present revision petition in 2017, seeking to set aside the orders of the trial court.Justice Sathi Kumar Sukumara Kurup observed that on perusal of records, it is seen that there was no representation from the petitioner during the past few hearings. The revision petition is from 2017 and by now the case ought to have been disposed of. “The Constitution of India guaranteed its citizens the right to speedy trial. Here, having suffered conviction, the accused is indulging in activities, which are against the principles of speedy trial,” observed the judge.The judge observed that the petitioner who is the accused in a case was convicted by the JM court and his conviction was also confirmed in his appeal by the principal sessions court. After filing this revision, instead of cooperating with the court, he is not cooperating with the court. This cannot be entertained, observed the judge.Hence, the judge dismissed the petition and directed the JM court to execute the warrant of conviction and remand the accused/petitioner to undergo sentence as per the order in 2012.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-dismisses-plea-of-petitioner-who-tried-to-delay-case/articleshow/82813354.cms||Kaushik Kannan

---||Goa||Goa: Power mantri blows fuse, says Michael Lobo should focus on own waste portfolio||PANAJI: A day after minister Michael Lobo hit out at his own government for power issues post the cyclone Tauktae, power minister Nilesh Cabral said Lobo’s claims were unfounded. “It is a natural disaster and 40 teams are in place, but it is difficult to know where the damage will take place,” said Cabral. He said Lobo should focus on his own waste management portfolio instead of criticising cabinet collegues. The power minister said that by Thursday evening all areas of Goa will see their power supply restored. Cabral said that it will take eight to ten days to put permanent infrastructure in place to restore the crashed transformers and electricity poles. “We are not god. We arranged around 40 teams with each having six people and you do not know where the damage will take place. He should focus on doing something in his portfolio of waste management and not advise others on what to do. All our people are working tirelessly for last ten days. It is created by nature and it takes time,” said Cabral. Cabral said that even staffers of the electricity department who have been working in the office for last 20 to 30 years have witnessed such damage to power supply infrastructure for the first time in their working life. He said the work of erecting crashed electricity poles again is a strenuous job, which takes around three to four hours to complete. But power department staff have managed to carry out the jobs is much lesser time spans, he said. “Each one should focus on his own work before commenting on others. Our people have done tremendous work. It is all physical work and pulling the lines sitting atop the poles in the rain and gusty winds is not easy,” said Cabral. He said Caisua in Anjuna was the last area by Thursday night left to receive its power supply again. The minister, however, said that the power has been restored through temporary arrangements and work of putting permanent infrastructure in place will start now. “Our real work starts now. Over 800 poles, six-seven towers, some transformers have been damaged. It will take us eight to ten days minimum to put the permanent arrangements back in place. We have drawn temporary cables for kilometres and it is not going to be easy. We will plan a meeting on Saturday on how to go about it. We will give the estimate of all damages to the CM for the works required to be carried out,” said Cabral.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/power-mantri-blows-fuse-says-lobo-should-focus-on-own-waste-portfolio/articleshow/82813357.cms||---

Though the peri-urban areas are reporting less number of cases, their positivity rate is double or even more than that of Nagpur city. The city’s positivity rate reduced by over 50% from last week’s 13% to 5.98% on Thursday. The Covid wave can be said to be over if the positivity rate is below 10%, but doctors in city feel it needs to be below 5% consistently for at least 10 to 12 days before it can be safely said that the surge is over. Doctors also warned that as the novel coronavirus variants in circulation are more virulent and infectious, victory shouldn’t be declared unless the positivity rate reduces to zero. In May, the district has so far recorded positivity rate of 14.21% as 47,747 positive cases were detected from 3.35 lakh tests. Between May 15 and May 20, the district’s postivity rate was 6.82%. Surpringinly, in Nagpur rural it was at 47% on May 15 which suddenly crashed to 8% the next day. After that, it has remained under 15%. Infectious diseases specialist Dr Ashwini Tayde said that possibility of sampling error can’t be ruled out if fluctuation is such huge. On district’s falling rate, she said in between the district may see some spikes in cases. Clinicare Diagnostic Lab director Dr Rajkumar Rathi said testing at private lab has gone down by 50% . “Now the positivity rate is 15% to 20%. In April it had reached 40%. Today it was 15%. It can be said cases are plateauing. But we must aim for less than 1%. Let us see what happens after lockdown. If people don’t follow norms, there may be a resurge,” he said. Crescent lab director Dr Sarfaraz Ahmed said the decline suggests maximum symptomatic and positive cases have been tested. “The disease has been contained. Transmission has stopped and the chain has been broken. Most of the positive cases have now recovered. But we shouldn’t celebrate until eradication of the disease. The virus has become highly infectious and virulent now. So, even if one patient goes unchecked, it has potential to bring back the havoc,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/dists-positivity-rate-falls-nearly-7-city-sees-50-drop-in-a-week/articleshow/82813400.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Delhi||Universities in Delhi lose leading lights to Covid-19, DU the worst hit||NEW DELHI: Former Delhi University dean of examinations Vinay Gupta lost his struggle against Covid-19. Almost immediately, his father too succumbed to the infection. In Jawaharlal Nehru University, former dean of admissions and professor of biotechnology Deepak Gaur was claimed by the dreaded infection too. Covid has taken the lives of 35 teachers in DU, two in JNU and five in Jamia Millia Islamia, while many are still recovering from the infection. DU lost a few other stalwarts besides Gupta. Veena Kukreja, head of the political science department, lost her battle against the coronavirus despite having become well enough to have been shifted out of the ICU. Kukreja, 65, was in hospital from April 27 to May 13, according to fellow teacher Bipin Tewari, she couldn’t survive the infection. “We don’t know what happened, that too all of a sudden,” said Tewari. Joint registrar Sudhir Sharma also lost his life to Covid. The lives of several teachers in DU constituent colleges were claimed by Covid too. At Aryabhatta College, Ravi Bhushan, ad-hoc teacher in the psychology department, and at Deshbandhu College, Chandra Shekhar, teacher in the mathematics department, could not fight back the infection. Manoj Sinha, principal of Aryabhatta, said, “Bhushan’s wife is also an ad-hoc teacher at Kamala Nehru College. We are also working out something to help the family.” Unable to get a hospital bed in Delhi, Bhushan had been taken to AIIMS, Jhajjar. At Deshbandhu College, besides Shekhar, Dharmendra Malik of the botany department too lost his life. Malik is survived by his wife and two children studying in classes XI and XII. “The staff is discussing how best to help the bereaved family,” said Ashwini Shankar, associate professor. Rakesh Gupta of Indira Gandhi Institute of Physical Education and Sports Sciences did not get a bed in Delhi and was taken to Ludhiana, where he passed away. Sri Venkateswara college too lost G Poornachandra Rao, its teacher-in-charge of the botany department, a few days ago. At Ram Lal Anand College, two senior teachers died recently. “The college is reeling from the loss of Kusum Gupta, associate professor of microbiology, who was in a hospital in Dwarka. She had only recently lost both her parents, her mother to cancer and her father to Covid,” said Rakesh Kumar Gupta, college principal. “We also lost Devendra Kumar, associate professor.” Jamia has lost some young teachers. One of them was Nabila Sadiq, assistant professor at the Sarojini Naidu Centre for Women's Studies. “She was a nice person, so many people went out of their way to help her, but couldn’t save her,” said Waqar Azam, Sadiq’s former student. The young teacher’s mother succumbed to Covid and her father is yet to recover from it. Azam added, “We were with her till the end when she passed away in a hospital in Faridabad. Even when in that perilous state, she kept smiling till the end.” The other teacher claimed by Covid in Jamia was Rizwan Qaiser, professor in the department of history and culture. He died two weeks ago due to Covid. The professor had faced difficulties in finding a hospital bed for some days. His wife and Jamia colleague, Farah Naz, told TOI, “He was finally admitted to Jamia Hamdard, where he was under treatment for 20 days and was recovering. But we don’t know what happened. His condition suddenly deteriorated and he passed away. For many days, all of us were in shock; we hadn’t expected hi to leave us forever.” JNU too is reeling from the death of senior professor Deepak Gaur. The university held a condolence meet on Friday, a day after his death. Gaur, 49, was a professor in the School of Biotechnology and was a recipient of a number of awards, including the 2017 Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, one of the highest awards given for science in India. JNU Teachers’ Association issued a condolence statement for Gaur, who was also the former Director of Admissions. “He was internationally recognised in the field of malaria and vaccination research and was always polite and courteous while interacting with colleagues. Professor Gaur’s departure is not only an unimaginable loss to his family, friends, colleagues and students, but also leaves a big void in the world of science in the country,” JNUTA said. The other faculty member that JNU lost was Satyamurti, teacher in the School of Sanskrit and Indic Studies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/city-univs-lose-leading-lights-to-covid-19-du-the-worst-hit/articleshow/82843471.cms||Shradha Chettri

---||Mumbai||Employers must face punitive action: Kin||MUMBAI: As the distraught relatives of dead or missing seafarers who fell victim to Cyclone Tauktae sought information from the authorities Friday, it was difficult to fathom which was worse—the anxiety of swinging between hope and despair or their anger over losing a loved one, in part to negligence. Many of them demanded punitive action against the employers, report Mateen Hafeez, V Narayan & Pradeep Gupta. Among the tragic tales is that of two brothers, Pappuram (32) and Amraram Ranawat (30). Pappuram’s remains have been recovered while Amraram is missing. The duo from Pali in Rajasthan were the family’s breadwinners. They left their two children each and family to work on P-305 last October. Their cousins from Rajasthan will arrive with the father on Friday. “We have not informed him of Pappu’s death as he is a 70-year-old heart patient. We said he is being treated in JJ Hospital,” said cousin Kishore. Families furious with ONGC over pre- and post-mishap actionsRelatives of dead or missing seafarers who fell victim to Cyclone Tauktae sought information on Friday. Kishore, cousin of brothers Pappuram Ranawat and Amraram Ranawat, blamed ONGC for the sinking of the barge, asking why the authorities did not recall the ship to shore when cyclone warnings were issued days in advance. “Kya logon ki laashon par bhi paisa kamaana zuroori hai? (Is it necessary to earn money over dead bodies),” he fumed. Kumar Abhinav, activist from Badlapur, visited J J Hospital on Friday at the behest of the family. “I have never met the brothers. But I have two photos to identify them. Why are no lists or pictures of the dead bodies, rescued and missing persons being displayed here? All families are making the rounds of J J,” he said. The body of Pune resident Nilesh Pitale (44), a fire safety officer aboard P305, lay in the J J Hospital mortuary. He had asked his brother-in-law Ramesh Waghule to pick him up around May 25. He was happy to be returning home after six months. His wife, teenage daughter and 11-year-old son have not been informed of his death. Pitale was reportedly distributing water and biscuits to crew members when the ship went down. “We will not claim the body until the company informs us of the compensation in writing. Why did they not act on the cyclone warning?” asked a relative. Over at Ambernath, young Vishal Katdare (32) died barely two months after his marriage. He had tied the knot on March 3 and resumed duty on April 3. Vishal, who was posted as QC engineer aboard the P305, lived with parents and elder brother Mandar in Kher section. Mandar said, “The agencies must probe who ordered the captain to sail despite the cyclone warning.’ He said no one from the company informed them of the mishap. “We ourselves traced his body to J J Hospital and brought it home,” he said. Vishal’s funeral was performed early Thursday. His parents, relatives and neighbours, who had gathered to celebrate his wedding weeks ago, milled around in stunned silence. Joseph Edwin, a 27-year-old mechanical engineer from Sakthikulangara in Kerala's Kollam district, remains missing. He last spoke with his father Edwin on May 15, two days before Cyclone Tauktae hit the barge. In fact, he rang to ask about its effect in Kerala. “He complained that his company was not taking the weather warning of May 11 seriously. The barge was anchored at Bombay High despite the alert. Now we don’t know his fate. It is already four days and the company has not responded to our distressed inquiries. We are praying for his safe return,” said uncle Anthony Daniel. Daniel blamed Afcon’s negligence and demanded punitive action. His parents tried to contact Afcon but to no avail. Meanwhile, Jaison Nedampallil from Kerala was all praise for the Indian Navy’s effort to save his son’s life, Joyal, a mechanical engineer, who swam for two days before being rescued. Another missing victim, Rakesh Kumar, has a wife and one-year-old son back home in Bihar who are extremely anxious. The 28-year-old is an oiler on the tug boat Varaprada that capsized too. His brother Mukesh, employed with the ministry of defence in Pune, went to J J. He said the tug boat had in fact returned to shore on the night of May 13 but either drifted back or was recalled to the sea. “There are several loopholes in the safety protocol that must be highlighted across the country,” he said.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Kin of missing men run from pillar to post, land at JJ to identify bodies||Mumbai: Relatives of missing personnel on board the ill-fated barge P-305 spent agonising hours trying to identify the bodies brought to the J J Hospital mortuary on Thursday. Distraught and angry, they queued outside the mortuary till late on Thursday evening to get a glimpse of the bodies to confirm if their relatives were among them. Among the missing is Arjun Pandey (28; pic, below), a welder on P-305. Till late on Thursday, his relatives did not know of his status. “So far, we have been told he is missing. I have been struggling to find him since Tuesday. I went to the contractor’s office in Nerul, then to the hostel where the survivors were brought. No one has given us any details and there are no lists at all to check the names of the victims,” said Ambuj Pandey (28), Arjun’s brother-in-law who lives in Kalyan. Arjun hails from Gopalganj in Bihar. His wife is pregnant. Ambuj is an autorickshaw driver and Arjun lived with him whenever he came to Mumbai before going to sea. Arjun went to work on P-305 this January. Meanwhile, Jyoti Singh, a relative of Ajay Singh (39; pic, above), a rig holder on the barge, rushed to J J on Thursday afternoon on learning he was missing. “We came from Dombivli to check if Ajay was alive. We have been waiting for hours to check. They showed us some photos but we couldn’t identify him from these. Ajay’s wife has left from Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh to look for him here,” Jyoti said. Ajay, who has worked on the sea for around 10 years, has one son and one daughter. Congress functionary Mathew Antony who is helping victims’ families access details and coordinating with the authorities alleged none of the companies that had hired the men were cooperating with their families. “There is no help desk and no list of the victims. Family members are struggling and there is a complete mess. They have not even provided a simple help desk to help relatives, or a list of the victims, those who are dead or alive. Angry relatives are waiting for hours and they have not even been offered water,” Antony said. “There is no arrangement for RT-PCR tests on the bodies to carry them to the hometowns. It’s been three days but relatives have not been able to find if the family members are dead or alive,” he added. — Chaitanya Marpakwar||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-kin-of-missing-men-run-from-pillar-to-post-land-at-jj-to-identify-bodies/articleshow/82813452.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||Nashik||Doctor, staff assaulted in Ahmednagar; 2 booked||NASHIK: A doctor who has created an ICU ward for Covid-19 patients in his private hospital in Ahmednagar was allegedly assaulted by the relatives of a 72-year-old patient who died around Wednesday midnight. The Topkhana police station have registered a case against two suspects, who, they said, were not yet arrested as they were busy in the last rites of the deceased. Deputy superintendent of police Vishal Dhume said this is the first case in Ahmednagar city where any medical professional has been attacked after the death of a Covid patient. Appropriate action will be taken against those involved in the incident, he added. The doctor, Rahul Thokal (24), a resident of Sarol Kasar in Ahmednagar, has stated in his complaint that two relatives of the patient assaulted him and his staff, hurled abuses and even damaged the equipment in the ICU of the hospital, said police. Police have registered cases under the various sections of the Indian Penal Code along with sections of The Maharashtra Medicare Service Persons and Medicare Service Institutions (Prevention of Violence and Damage or Loss to Property) Act, 2010. According to police, Tanaji Gadakh, a resident of Takli Kazhi, Ahmednagar, was admitted to the private hospital after testing positive for Covid-19 on May 8. The patient would often remove the oxygen and hence one of his relatives had been allowed to stay with him. The relative was, however, told to wait outside for some time around 11.30 pm on Wednesday because the doctors in the ICU were busy with other patients, said police. Thokal was busy setting up the ventilator of another patient while another doctor was attending to a critical patient on the adjacent bed when the relative was told to wait outside, said police. “Meanwhile, Gadakh removed the oxygen supply, following which the doctors quickly set things right but the patient became unconscious. We informed the relatives of the patient about the incident. About an hour later, the patient expired. This was also explained to the relatives,” the doctor has stated in the complaint. However, the relatives of the patient allegedly created a ruckus at the hospital, throwing equipment at the doctor and other staff. The staff immediately called police. The body of the deceased was handed over to his relatives, added police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/doctor-staff-assaulted-in-ahmednagar-2-booked/articleshow/82806213.cms||---

---||Delhi||Professor Dinesh Mohan: Brain behind BRT project dies of Covid||NEW DELHI: A passionate road safety and injury prevention expert and the man behind the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project in the capital, Professor Dinesh Mohan, died following a cardiac arrest at St Stephen’s Hospital, where he was being treated for Covid-19, on Friday morning. He was 75. For many who knew him, their most cherished memory was sitting in his old Mercedes car and discussing science and human rights issues. Professor Geetam Tiwari of IIT-Delhi’s civil engineering department, an old friend and associate of Mohan who was at his cremation, said in December they were out in the field for a project. “Even at his age, he was always insisting on field visits. And he would look out for street food and was often found eating chhole-kulche,” she added. “He was also a crusader for civil rights, which is a rare combination. We would laugh at his 40-year-old Mercedes, but he would defend buying old cars. He was passionate about public transport and road safety. When I joined IIT-Delhi in 1991, I saw him bringing together people of different backgrounds and departments for doing research,” said Tiwari. Like all change makers, he would often find himself up against popular opinion but persist with his ideas because of his convictions. The Bus Rapid Transit corridor in the city was one such project which became quite unpopular because of its unconventional approach in prioritising road space for public transport i.e buses at the expense of cars. It was eventually scrapped by the AAP government. Prof Mohan was quite pained by the entire controversy and never changed his views. He was an alumnus of Doon School and got a mechanical engineering degree from IIT Bombay. He then did his masters in aerospace engineering at University of Delaware followed by a PhD in biomedical engineering at the University of Michigan. He worked at the Institute of Highway Safety in Washington before returning home. He was with IIT-Delhi since 1976, where he was made an honorary professor in 2017. He was also the Emeritus Volvo Chair Professor for Transportation Planning and Safety at IIT-D from 2010 to 2015 and the founder of the Transportation Research and Injury Prevention Programme (TRIPP). Speaking to TOI, IIT-Delhi director Ramgopal Rao said he was going to call Mohan to inform him that the IIT board of governors had approved the conversion of TRIPP into a full-fledged centre on Thursday. It will offer masters and PhD courses. “He fathered the programme and connected with industries, government authorities and international organisations for it. His sudden death is saddening,” he added. A recipient of several distinctions and awards, Mohan was on several committees on traffic safety, in India and abroad, besides being on editorial boards of top journals. He authored and co-authored several books and articles. He will be remembered for the Delhi Declaration on People’s Right to Safety, push for safe motorcycle helmets, campaign for three-wheeled scooter taxis and for being the founding member of the Pakistan India Forum for Peace and Democracy, established in 1994. Etienne Krug, director, social determinants of health at WHO, tweeted: “Deeply shocked to learn about the passing of a giant of #injury prevention. Dinesh Mohan was an innovate, driven and fun leader in the field. Co-founder of the series of World Conferences and visionary #roadsafety champion. He leaves a huge legacy. Rest in peace my friend.” Historian Irfan Habib tweeted: “Extremely sad to know that professor Dinesh Mohan, dear friend and former IIT-Delhi faculty, succumbed to Covid. Lots of memories of serious discussions on history and science. My sincere condolences to his wife, Peggy Mohan.” NGO Urban Voices also tweeted: “Sad to know that Prof Dinesh Mohan of @iitdelhi is no more. A big loss for the sustainable transport community. We still remember his lecture a few years ago, when he pointed directly at the then DCP-Traffic and said, “If you want to save lives, slow them down!”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/brain-behind-brt-project-dies-of-covid/articleshow/82843496.cms||Mohammad Ibrar

According to Ardad, different zones of the MSEDCL are providing help in the form of manpower and infrastructure to restore power supply in Konkan. As a part of it, the Aurangabad zone has arranged poles for Sindhudurg. Earlier, Maharashtra energy minister Nitin Raut held a review meeting with different divisions and pressed for quick measures to restore power supply in the coastal areas of the state that have been affected by the cyclone. During the meeting, which was attended by MSEDCL joint managing director Naresh Gite, it was decided to source manpower for Konkan from neighbouring districts and infrastructure from other districts. Notably, MSEDCL Aurangabad zone had deployed five engineers and 50 linemen to Sindhudurg, Ratnagiri and Raigad when these districts in Konkan were hit by cyclone Nisarga in June last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/abad-msedcl-sends-650-poles-to-konkan/articleshow/82806243.cms||---

Officials said that medical oxygen consumption on usual days was 117.4 MT with 79 MT being used daily for Covid care and 38.4 MT by non-Covid patients. According to the petroleum and explosives safety organization (PESO) that monitors oxygen supply in the state and coordinates with the Centre, in the last eight days, the total medical oxygen supply (gaseous and LMO) to hospitals was around 257 MT, of which 172 MT of LMO was supplied directly to hospitals. “The LMO production at Inox India limited was increased from 149 MT to 188 MT per day," said R Venugopal, deputy chief controller of explosives and nodal officer (medical oxygen), Kerala and Lakshadweep. "We suggested it be done by reducing nitrogen production. Three ASU (air separation unit) plants at Thiruvananthapuram, Palakkad and Malappuram districts supported the gaseous oxygen cylinder supply in Kerala thereby reducing the LMO load in the last one week." He said that PESO had earlier advised the district collectors in Kerala to seize all the industrial oxygen cylinders from industries across the state and 2,473 cylinders were seized. “This helped in reaching out to rural areas because often urban areas would get immediate access. As of now, Kerala is having 45,454 D-type cylinders and 5,228 B-type cylinders in its custody for filing medical oxygen,” he added. Venugopal said that there is no scope for misuse of cylinders because the tracking of their movement across the state is done across the state. “The industrial cylinders being used are mostly by the food industry.” Meanwhile, the three air separation plants in Palakkad, Thiruvananthapuram and Malappuram that were cleared by PESO have become fully functional since last week. Auxilium Products LLP plant in Wadakkanchery can produce 260 m3/hr gaseous oxygen. Peenya Industrial gas, Thiruvananthapuram is filling 7.08MT. They have also converted their 20KL Argon tank to a liquid medical oxygen tank. A total capacity of 40KL LMO tanks is available at this new plant. The ASU plant at Vattaparambu, Malappuram that was closed in 2015, has now restarted and is filling 2.76 MT of gaseous oxygen into cylinders per day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/state-sets-record-in-covid-o2-usage/articleshow/82811181.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

Zonal agriculture officer, Salcete, Shariff Furtado, who also holds charge for Mormugao, said that preliminary assessment of the damage to crops was under way, even as he urged affected farmers to contact their respective zonal agriculture offices to report losses sustained by them. Farmers who had opted for late sowing of paddy have been affected the most as water-logging due to rains coupled with high velocity winds have flattened crops in many areas, mostly in Chandor, Macasana, Paroda, etc. “In other parts, harvesting of paddy was almost completed before the cyclone hit and thus survived the impact,” Furtado said. Preliminary survey has tagged the estimated area that suffered loss of paddy crop at 22 ha in Salcete. Vegetable crops like ladyfinger, brinjal and sweet potato have also suffered damage owing to large amounts of water-logging in fields, it was informed. Areas of Nuvem, Raia, Curtorim, and Cuncolim are worst affected, as per the preliminary survey. An estimated 16 ha under vegetable cultivation has sustained loss owing the cyclone in Salcete, Furtado said. As regards plantation crops, Furtado said that mango, banana and coconut plantations have been damaged in many parts of Salcete and Mormugao owing to the cyclonic winds. He added that the estimates could rise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/farmers-in-salcete-hit-following-cyclone/articleshow/82813456.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: A clear & present danger, but not all Covid patients will get black fungus||NEW DELHI: As sinister as its name sounds, black fungus, or mucormycosis, a rare fungal infection, is a reality now in Delhi. Around 200 patients infected by the fungus are now in hospitals just weeks after they fought off the novel coronavirus. Most patients are above the age of 50 and have one or more comorbidities. In the past three days, the influx of patients has grown, private hospitals claimed, and at least two black fungus-related surgeries are being undertaken in each hospital every day. Doctors told TOI that the sudden infection was due to unwarranted use of steroids in treating Covid. “Post-Covid, some patients not only got the black fungus infection, but also showed fluctuating sugar levels probably due to the high doses of steroid they were given,” said Dr Vidit Tripathi, senior ENT consultant, Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj. “Surgery is essential if the infection spreads to the brain through the eyes. Some patients have lost their eyesight.” Read AlsoCoronavirus black fungus infection: Signs, symptoms and everything we know about the deadly fungal infectionNot all who have Covid will end up with black fungus, assured Dr Alok Thakar, ENT head, AIIMS, where five mucormycosis-related surgeries are being done every day. “One must understand that black fungus is not usual in Covid,” he explained. “There is a high-risk group involving people with uncontrolled sugar levels and they should be careful, keeping a watch for symptoms and reaching out to doctors immediately if these appear.” Explaining the three-step approach to treating the life-threatening infection, Dr Ameet Kishore, senior ENT consultant, Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, said, “We initially start with antifungal medications and high doses of antibiotics to control the spread of infection. We also simultaneously try to keep the sugar levels in control and monitor the immune status closely. A surgery is required when uncontrolled diabetes leads to the fungus invading the tissues and stops blood supply. When blood supply is obstructed, the tissues die and create black patches in the affected area. Surgery removes the fungus from the dead tissue, bone, sinus tissue because if left unattended, the fungus can spread to other parts of the body.” Apollo currently has 20 black fungus patients. Black fungus patients are under treatment in Manipal, Max, Saket, Aakash Healthcare and Ujala Cygnus hospitals. Dr Ashish Vashisth, ENT consultant at Manipal, said most of the patients had those who had recovered from Covid around three weeks to a month ago. “Now when we discharge Covid patients in the high-risk group, we advise them to be alert to mucormycosis symptoms. Almost 80% of black fungus patients are above the age of 50 and have other health issues too,” said Vashisth. Dr Sumit Mrig, ENT head, Max Hospital, Saket, admitted, “Yes, the rate at which black fungus cases are increasing is alarming. We have carried out 12 operations in the last three days. Unfortunately, three patients lost their eyesight. This time the Covid strain is severe and affects immunity. Doctors are forced to administer steroids to save lives, while in some cases, people are self-medicating at home with steroids. This is dangerous.” Max currently has 25 patients in all its units across Delhi and many more are contacting the institution every day in panic. At Aakash Healthcare, Dwarka, therefore, the ICU team keeps a constant check on the use of steroids and constantly monitor the patients’ sugar levels. “We had five patients, two of whom were operated upon. Of the two, one lost his life,” said Dr Aashish Chaudhry, managing director of the hospital. “None of the Covid patients treated in this hospital have returned with black fungus infection. But, we received referral cases from outside Delhi, who were infected by the fungus 3-4 weeks after recovering from Covid and returning home from hospital. They presented in our hospital with loss of vision, drooping eyes and severe pain on one side of the face.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/a-clear-present-danger-but-not-all-covid-patients-will-get-black-fungus/articleshow/82811245.cms||---

The India meteorological department (IMD) said that this is because of the effect of Tauktae, which has now weakened into a low pressure area. “The rain in Goa is caused because of the southwesterly and westerly winds, which were set along the west coast when a strong system like Tauktae moved across the coast,” IMD scientist, Rahul M said. A fishermen warning has been issued for boats venturing near the Maharashtra-Goa coast. IMD has forecast squally weather with strong winds with speed reaching 40-50 kmph gusting to 60 kmph likely to prevail over south west Arabian Sea up to May 24. Fishermen are therefore advised not to venture into these areas during this period. The meteorological departmen forecast also stated that thunderstorms accompanied with lightning are very likely at isolated places in Goa till May 21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-cyclone-thunderstorms-likely-today-fishermen-warning-till-may-24/articleshow/82813490.cms||---
---||Nagpur||CCC started in rly coaches vacant, all patients discharged||Nagpur: Even as Covid-19 positive cases and deaths are declining in the city, there are no immediate plans to close down the Covid care centre (CCC) started in the 11 railway coaches stationed at the erstwhile Ajni Inland Container Depot (ICD) at Narendra Nagar. Sources said if there are no patients, the Central Railway and the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) will have to withdraw the facility as the running cost of the coaches may be over Rs3 lakh per month considering the staff and facilities being provided. According to the sources, the contract for various facilities provided in the coaches is till June 10. If the facility stays the contract will have to be extended. Secondly, the coaches have been put on a siding which is still in use for transporting goods like foodgrains, tractors, sand etc. Though there is no immediate commercial impact, in the long-term it will hit railway revenue, they said. The CCC was started on May 2 and till now only 20 patients have availed of the benefit. On Thursday, there was no patient in these coaches. All patients have been discharged after recovery. They were all praise for the services offered by the Central Railway and NMC. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B told TOI that though cases have gone down, we need to remain alert. “We don’t know what will be situation after the lockdown is withdrawn or restrictions are relaxed after June 1. Hence, as our preparedness, we need to continue with the facility even if there are no patients,” he said. Additional DRM Jay Singh said the NMC has to take the final call. “We have no problem in continuing the facility. It has been a good learning experience for us. The matter is sub-judice and it was only after the high court’s directions the coach facility was started. We have 17 more such coaches at Amla and Wardha. We are ready to deploy them too if the agencies demand,” he said. On the low usage of the railway coaches, NMC nodal officer Dr Narendra Bahirwar said, “The facility is working well. Had the facility been started in April when there was a huge crisis of beds, it would have been fully occupied. By the time it started on May 2, several other Covid care centres had come up in the city.” “Though the facility was for mild and asymptomatic patients, the doctors even treated those who reported with a CT score of 10. A couple of them were also referred to either IGGMCH or GMCH,” said Kunal Mourya, volunteer with NGO Together We Can which is doing the hand-handling part. Recounting their experience after they tested positive, Prakash and Amita Gajbhiye from Trimurti Nagar said, “There wasn’t enough space at our home, so we preferred to isolate ourselves in these coaches. We were treated well and served food and breakfast free of cost. The doctors and nursing staff also took good care.

Suhas informed the Prime Minister that the district could successfully fight the second phase of Covid so far. The number of active Covid cases in the district has come down to 47,369. Kerala has adopted a strategy of decentralized activities which are led by the local bodies concerned to fight the pandemic. The same strategy has been implemented in Ernakulam district also. Surveillance mapping, reviewing of severity of the disease in each area, proper testing, etc. are part of the Covid control measures. Ward-level committees properly monitor the situation and help the authorities in implementing the measures in their limits. “The test per million (TPM) in the district is 4,500 which is the best in the country,” Suhas said. There are Covid first-line treatment centres (CFLTCs) or domiciliary care centres (DCCs) in all the local bodies in the district. There are Covid treatment centres in all the taluks in the district. The system of diagnosing the disease with the help of the outpatient wing of government hospitals has helped reduce the spread of the pandemic. “Oxygen supply to the hospitals is being ensured with the help of a war room. There is a system for oxygen auditing at every hospital so as to avoid its loss. The death rate in the district is 0.2%, which is very low compared to that across the world,” Suhas said. On Thursday, 3,336 fresh cases of Covid-19 have been reported from different parts of the district. Of these, 3,243 patients contracted the disease through local contact. A total of 4,418 recoveries have been reported in the district on the day. There are 2,682 beds available in the Covid treatment centres in the district. Of the total 5,096 beds earmarked for Covid treatment, 2,414 beds are occupied. Of the total 2,332 beds in the DCCs, 820 are occupied. A total 241 beds have been arranged in Covid second-line treatment centres in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/pm-apprised-of-covid-control-measures/articleshow/82811218.cms||RK Sreejith
---||Delhi||Delhi: QR codes track distribution of O2 devices from donors||NEW DELHI: Using technology and volunteers, Dialogue and Development Commission has coordinated the delivery of 2,300 oxygen concentrators from donors to Delhi government hospitals. It has developed a unique QR code-based system to track and distribute oxygen concentrators received from donors to various Delhi government hospitals and to monitor their usage. Another 1,700 oxygen concentrators and 100 ventilators are in the process of being supplied. DDC vice-chairperson Jasmine Shah said the move was initiated after chief minister Arvind Kejriwal appealed to all sections of the society to come forward and support Delhi government’s efforts to fight Covid-19. “Several donors have come forward to give critical medical supplies to Delhi government hospitals. At the same time, the donors were keen to ensure that these equipment are used efficiently,” said Shah. For this purpose, DDC collaborated with Boston Consulting Group and Blowhorn to develop a state-of-the-art QR code-based tracking system for donated medical equipment. “The move will ensure transparency and optimal utilisation of these life-saving medical equipment,” said Shah. The streamlined process involves vetting medical equipment once received through donors, attaching a unique QR code and then supplying them to various hospitals as per their needs. The QR code can be scanned to track the location as well as usage patterns of these life-saving medical equipment. It is also aimed at enabling the hospitals to carry out physical audits of these equipment in future. The DDC vice-chairman thanked the contribution of volunteers and organisations in the relief effort and stated it was also crucial to ensure timely and efficient delivery of these medical equipment to the hospitals. “DDC roped in the support of Delhivery, Uber and Portr, which contributed resources free of cost to ensure seamless delivery of these life-saving medical equipment to hospitals. Invaluable support was provided by school management committees,” Shah added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/qr-codes-track-distribution-of-o2-devices-from-donors/articleshow/82843510.cms||---

---||Nagpur||SC relief to over 2,000 workers of Murli Ind in take over by Dalmiya Cement||Nagpur: The Supreme Court came to the rescue of over 2,000 workers employed at a city company, and saved them from getting retrenched after a take over by another firm. The apex court upheld the resolution plan (instrument for taking over a corporate debtor, paying its creditors’ debts, and completing its recovery and restructuring) submitted by Dalmiya Cement (Bharat) Limited for taking over Murli Industries here. However, the former would need to give an undertaking that the closure of the existing paper, solvent extraction and cement units, along with retrenchment of their workers, will be done only in accordance with law, said the workers’ counsel Sudheer Voditel. The orders came while hearing an appeal filed by Prashant Talmale and other workers under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016. The case was listed before the bench comprising justices L Nageswara Rao and S Ravindra Bhat. The petitioners contended that Dalmiya Cement sought permission from the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court for winding up petitions contending that a provisional liquidator had been appointed. They submitted a resolution plan before the National Company Law Tribunal’s (NCLT) Mumbai bench, assuring that an amount of Rs44 crore has been kept aside for the outstanding dues of the workers. However, a uniform reduction of all outstanding dues had been accepted and a conditional approval granted for closure of units and retrenchment of workers upon payment of compensation to be obtained from the state ministry of industries and mining within a year. The workers contended that the reduction of their dues was illegal and without obtaining their permission, Murli Industries could not have been taken over by Dalmiya Cement on September 25, 2020, nor their services could have been terminated. The top court, however, upheld the resolution plan on Dalmiya Cement’s undertaking that the 2,026 workers would continue to be on the rolls of the company, till their dues are settled as per the laws. Senior counsel KV Vishwanathan appeared for Dalmiya Cement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/sc-relief-to-over-2000-workers-of-murli-ind-in-take-over-by-dalmiya-cement/articleshow/82811216.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

It started pouring on Wednesday morning and continued till Thursday morning. People, meanwhile, staged a protest after they found a temple wall damaged. They alleged that the temple wall fell due to the beautification work being carried out for the Smart City project. The soil on the banks of Achal Sarovar was removed that weakened the foundation of the temple wall, they claimed. Meanwhile, a few small deities placed by the temple authorities also got submerged in the water. Assistant municipal commissioner Raj Bahadur Singh said, “We are trying to save the temple premises.” Singh, however, admitted that works were being carried out in the vicinity of the temple under the Smart City project. The downpour also inundated several localities, giving a harrowing time to residents as the electricity supply in most parts of the city remained disrupted throughout the night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/temple-wall-damaged-in-downpour-in-aligarh/articleshow/82809010.cms||---

The model forecast shows arrival between June 4 and 10 in the state. Last year, monsoon officially arrived in Mumbai on June 14 instead of the normal onset date of June 11. Weathermen, though, said it is too early to comment on when monsoon will officially reach the state. IMD, though, has said this year the onset over Kerala is expected a day in advance, on May 31 instead of June 1, with a model error of plus/minus 4 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/tauktae-may-not-delay-rains-in-maharashtra-imd/articleshow/82811302.cms||Richa Pinto

We will act as per the inquiry details,” he said. Patil, who would be reviewing the law and order situation in the city on Friday, also said the alert was sounded across the state ahead of the cyclone and preparations were also undertaken but even then the deaths and damages caused were unfortunate. The minister, when asked about the Maratha reservation issue, said the matter was sub-judice. “A sub-committee has been formed to interpret the judgment of the Supreme court.

---||Delhi||Green activists rue loss of one of their top voices||New Delhi: Throughout his life, his office was in the forest, while his homes were different rest houses. This is how conservationist activist Pushp Jain (68), who died battling Covid-19 on Thursday night, was remembered by environmentalists and activists. Known for his simple nature and sense of humour, Jain’s specialisation was his love for nature. His work involved doing everything that could help conserve wildlife and forests. Over the past decades, he was associated with various projects planned by the government as well as NGOs. During his association with Project Tiger, he documented tiger reserves in India for the Union ministry of environment and forests and climate change (MoEFCC). He was associated with the wildlife trade monitoring network TRAFFIC-India and he also documented the trade in medicinal plants. In 2011, he took up a full-time job as director of EIA Resource and Response Centre, a programme of Legal Initiative for Forest and Environment (Life). In his 1960s, Jain took up a task that he had never done before — analysing Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) reports for mining, hydro-electric and other projects. “He sent detailed submissions to various expert committees of MoEFCC, including the Forest Advisory Committee and the Expert Advisory Committee. Using his knowledge about forests, he would critique proposals involving diversion of forest land. His submissions led to many systematic changes. Cumulative impact assessment was directed to be done by MoEFCC based on his submissions, illegalities were probed and further studies were done,” said advocate Ritwick Dutta, founder and managing trustee, Life. Jain did not confine himself to only submissions and academic work. At the age of 65, he became an active litigant. In 2015, he challenged the dilution of the EIA Notification, 2006, which exempted building and constructions projects from the purview of EIA. NGT finally quashed the amendment. In 2018, he challenged the dilution of the wetland rules and Supreme Court is currently hearing the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/green-activists-rue-loss-of-one-of-their-top-voices/articleshow/82843525.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

Earlier this week, Asif (25) was lynched by a mob while he was out for purchasing medicines in Mewat, Haryana. Ever since the incident happened, several activists have taken to social media while demanding action against the accused.The Ambad police registered the offence against Usmani based on a complaint by Hindu Jagran Manch’s regional coordinator, Ambadas Ambhure.The youth has been booked under IPC sections for deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs and also for deliberate intention of wounding the religious feelings of any person.

Regarding the tweet by the Delhi professor which has been retweeted by over 1,200 handles and liked by over 3,000, the officer said the matter is being transferred to the cyber crime branch for carrying out a probe.The Pune police had registered a case against Usmani under IPC Section section 153 (A) (promoting enmity between different groups) over his speech made during the Elgar Parishad conclave on January 30 this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/activist-booked-for-forwarding-offensive-tweet/articleshow/82806297.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The list of the deceased includes a 35-year-old man who died on May 6 but appeared in the list 14 days later. The 14-day time gap for confirming a Covid-19 death is dumbfounding given the system for testing and death audit being put in place in the state. The majority of deaths happened between May 15 and May 17. There had been instances where death would be confirmed and listed as Covid-related, 10-11 days after the actual day of death, however, Covid death being confirmed after 14 days is one of the rare instances in the district. The case fatality rate in Trivandrum has been peaking at an alarming pace with 116 deaths officially recorded in the district in the past four days alone. Since May 15, an average of 25-28 deaths is being recorded in the district daily. The daily Covid cases also increased in the district and 3,969 cases were confirmed on Thursday. Active cases under treatment have come down to 21,867 in the district. Meanwhile, a woman who was referred to Medical college from Nagercoil had died on Wednesday. She was reportedly diagnosed with the 'black fungus' infection. The Medical College authorities said that they were awaiting culture reports for further confirmation. She was initially treated at Nagercoil after being tested positive for Covid-19. Later, she got discharged and went home. However, she developed complications again and was brought to a Nagercoil hospital from where she was referred to the Medical College.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/33-covid-19-deaths-confirmed-in-tpuram-district-on-thursday/articleshow/82811254.cms||---
---||Delhi||56-year-old woman, son found murdered at home||New Delhi: A 56-year-old woman and her 29-year-old son were found murdered at their home in northeast Delhi’s Karawal Nagar on Thursday morning. The deceased woman was identified as Umlesh, while her son was identified as Ashok. They lived on the first floor of the building and ran a grocery store on the ground floor. Police were alerted about the deaths around 8am and rushed to the spot. Ashok was found lying on the bed, while his mother was on the floor. Prima facie, it appeared they were strangled to death, said a senior police officer. According to the cops, the woman’s husband worked in DDA and had passed away on April 29. He lived with his other son, Sidharth, who had a house opposite to the building where the murder took place. “A case has been registered and the bodies have been sent for an autopsy. Several teams have been formed and all angles are being probed,” the officer said, adding that efforts were being made to find the motive for the murder. Initial probe suggests a property dispute or robbery could be the reason behind the double murder, sources claimed. Meanwhile, a 28-year-old man has been arrested by north district police on the charges of killing his elder brother’s wife due to a family dispute. The family lived in north Delhi’s Civil Lines and the murder had taken place on Monday. In another case in southwest Delhi’s Chhawla, a 45-year-old man was killed by his wife’s lover. The accused, Virender, was out on parole and had been involved in several murders in the past, police said. Cops have also arrested the wife and daughter of the deceased on charges of being part of the conspiracy. Virender wanted to live with the woman, Rajbala, and she and her daughter, Sheetal, also wanted to get rid of the deceased, Ashok. Thus they hatched the plan when Virender came out of jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/56-year-old-woman-son-found-murdered-at-home/articleshow/82811307.cms||---

---||Goa||Bombay high court tears into Goa government for seeking Covid certificate waiver for 5,400 workers||PANAJI: The high court of Bombay at Goa slammed the state government for filing applications seeking to waive the requirement of a Covid negative certificate for over 5,400 persons who travel to Goa every day for employment from neighbouring states, when the positivity rate was 32%. “Even as of May 17, though the positivity rate has fallen to 32.7%, it is perhaps the highest in the entire country. This application for waiver, therefore, cannot be regarded as being made in any public interest or to find some balance between arresting the spread of the epidemic and legitimate economic concerns,” the court stated in its order passed on May 18. According to the government, as many as 3,443 and 1,992 workers enter Goa daily from Maharashtra and Karnataka, respectively. The court said that if there were no restrictions on entry into Goa, the state’s medical infrastructure would completely collapse. While seeking waiver of a Covid negative certificate, the government assured that the workers would be thermally scanned at the respective checkposts. The government tried to make its case by pointing out that as of May 10, hardly 0.25% of the travellers entering Goa had tested positive for Covid-19. “The statistics pointed out in this application are misleading because they refer to the tested cases, which themselves may be few. The tested cases are not restricted to entrants by road alone. The statistics ignore the untested and asymptomatic cases. Therefore, based on the statistics referred to in the application, no case is made out for variation or vacation of our interim order,” a division bench comprising Justice M S Sonak and Justice M S Jawalkar observed. The court noted that even if the workforce of approximately 3,443 people is permitted to enter Goa without a negative RT-PCR certificate, they will require a negative certification from Goa to enter into Maharashtra in the evening. It is not clear as to whether the workforce from Karnataka can actually travel into Goa and thereafter return on the same day without proof of vaccination or an RT-PCR negative certificate, the court said. Advocate general Devidas Pangam said Goa has to rely upon its neighbouring states of Maharashtra and Karnataka for supplies, labour, and workforce. He submitted that the restriction has been affecting Goa’s economy and the smooth operation of industries, including those concerned with combatting the Covid-19 pandemic. The government trying to seek waiver for residents of Goa or persons coming for work into Goa “overlooks the unfortunate fact that the coronavirus makes no distinction between the residents of Goa or persons entering for work into Goa…,” the court stated. To the ICMR advisory placed before the high court by the advocate general stating that the need for RT-PCR tests in healthy individuals undertaking interstate domestic travel may be completely removed to reduce the load on laboratories, the high court pointed out that this was issued on May 4 in context of the general position of the epidemic throughout the country. “To that extent, the focus of the advisory was not on the peculiar situation in the state of Goa. Here, almost 2,000 deaths have been reported since the epidemic raised its ugly head in March 2020, out of which almost 1,000 deaths took place in the last 10 days or thereabouts,” the court stated. “The position of the state-run medical facility, ie GMC, was too horrendous to recall, particularly in the context of overstretched demand on medical infrastructure, oxygen, and even on the medical and paramedical staff,” the court stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hc-tears-into-govt-for-seeking-covid-certificate-waiver-for-5k-workers/articleshow/82813603.cms||---

While naming National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), Mahagenco (power generation and transmission units), and MSEDCL for not responding to HC’s requests, a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Avinash Gharote said they were making attempts to seek funds from the industry with a view to strengthen the health care system, especially in view of Covid -19 pandemic in Vidarbha. “We, therefore, expected, not only from the government, but also from the public sector and private sector companies, to make their contributions for the noble cause. While response from some of the public sector companies like WCL, CIL and MOIL has been extremely good, the same is not with the private companies.” The judges pointed out that there are also big companies like Tiroda Thermal Power Station in Gondia and various cement manufacturing plants at Chandrapur. “When these corporate entities are enjoined with a statutory duty (as per Section 135 of the Companies Act, 2013), it’s expected that they discharge their duties whenever called upon to do so. In our opinion, there could have been no better opportunity than the present time and present cause to discharge such duty.” In the last hearing, WCL counsel Mugdha and Rohan Chandurkar informed that the PSU had released Rs11.88 crore to the collector and requested directives on its spending. Assistant solicitor general Ulhas Aurangabadkar informed that MOIL had made Rs3.35 crore allocation as per HC directives. “A decision regarding spending of this fund on the lines suggested by us earlier shall be taken by the collector. We direct that the funds received from WCL and CIL shall be utilized for setting up oxygen generation plants at GMCH, IGGMCH and AIIMS, as mentioned in their pact with the collector on May 4,” the justices said, while reminding the respondents to take possession of oxygen cylinders of private agencies, including Asiatic Oxygen on Kamptee Road, and make them functional. HC prohibits new interventions in Covid PIL, disposes of existing ones Apprehending burden on the court and also on the amicus curiae if number of interveners increased in the suo motu PIL hearing Covid-19 pandemic cases based on TOI report, the judges directed its registry not to accept any new applications from them. “There are several miscellaneous intervention applications pending as of now. These have been filed by the interveners desirous to assist HC. In some of them, specific directives have been sought and many of these have already been issued. If their number increases, it creates a burden on this court and also on the amicus curiae to manage the files in an effective way. Therefore, it is necessary that a direction in this regard is issued.” While disposing of all the pending intervention applications, the bench directed those desirous of assisting the court to approach amicus curiae Shreerang Bhandarkar, who’s assisted by Nidhi Dayani. “All interveners, present and future, shall approach the amicus with their grievances, inputs and information in the nature of assistance to the court with a request to him to place those before us.

---||Coimbatore||ESI Hospital, CMCH show way to optimize oxygen use||Coimbatore: The ESI Hospital, which has around 400 to 450 Covid-19 patients on oxygen support, consumes only around four kilo litres (4,000 litres) oxygen a day. This is apparently the lowest per capita oxygen consumption in the state, taking the severity of cases being treated in the hospital into account. Things aren’t much different with the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH)Impressed, health minister Ma Subramanian has suggested the ESI Hospital and the CMCH to share their knowledge on reducing and optimizing oxygen consumption with all the private and other government hospitals in the state.Subramanian, who had visited both the hospitals last week, said they had set up a model for optimized oxygen usage, which must be replicated by all the other hospitals treating Covid-19 patients in the state.“We have, of late, been appealing hospitals to use oxygen judiciously because of the shortage. The ESI Hospital has reduced oxygen usage by making patients lie down flat with the chest down and the back up (prone position). This has helped the patients’ oxygen saturation level increase to 95% from 89%-90%,” he said. The minister has asked ESI Hospital dean Dr M Raveendran to create awareness on the technique and its usage to reduce oxygen consumption in private hospitals with the district collector’s guidance. Raveendran said their per capita oxygen consumption was hardly 8 litres per minute per patient. “However, it fluctuates daily depending on the number of very sick patients, who need high-flow oxygen. We plan to keep working on maintaining as low per capita oxygen consumption as possible, while ensuring the recovery of patients.”Using oxygen concentrators and oxygen generators for patients with oxygen saturation level above 85% is one of the techniques to reduce its consumption. “These machines purify oxygen from the atmosphere and reduce the usage of liquid oxygen. They provide oxygen at 2-5 litres per minute,” said another source with the hospital. “We also encourage the prone position for stable patients to improve their oxygenation and reduce oxygen support. Sometimes, the requirement drops anywhere between 10 litres a minute and 5 litres.” The hospital also uses nasal prongs, rather than oxygen masks, to supply oxygen, which is more efficient, and has stopped using high-flow oxygen for patients with saturation level above 85%. “We are targeting saturation levels of 92% to 94%, against the traditional 95% and above,” the source said. The CMCH, which has 750 Covid patients who require oxygen support, consumes only five kilo litres (5,000 litres) oxygen a day. It has set up a team of volunteers and staff exclusively to monitor the oxygen usage and eliminate leakages in oxygen ports. “Besides ensuring that valves are working properly, the team ensures oxygen is switched off when the patient uses the toilet or eats food. We also ask them to keep checking how a patient fares with lower oxygen supply rather than keeping one on five litres through the day,” said Dr A Nirmala, CMCH dean.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/esi-hospital-cmch-show-way-to-optimize-oxygen-use/articleshow/82811356.cms||---

The Covid-19 toll, meanwhile, shot up to 942 with the state including another 20 fatalities that occurred in the district in the media bulletin.Two of the deceased were in their 30s. While one of them, who was aged 30 years, succumbed to the virus two days after admission to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital, the other one, who was aged 37 years and a diabetic, died within minutes after hospitalization. He was taken to the Pollachi district headquarters hospital around 4am on Tuesday with fever, cough and difficulty in breathing, which he had been suffering for three days. He died hardly 10 minutes later.In contrast, a 95-year-old has survived the virus attack. The patient was treated at the Snekaram Hospital at Selvapuram.With the active cases touching new highs every day, the district is now staring at shortage of beds in treatment centres. As per the available data, only two oxygen beds and one ventilator bed were vacant across all the hospitals in the district as on Thursday night. At least 10 ambulances with patients requiring oxygen support were seen waiting at the government hospital on the day. There were, however, 505 normal beds vacant in hospitals and another 322 in Covid care centres in the district.While liquid oxygen had arrived at Madukkarai station at 1.55am in three tankers, details of its distribution are yet to be released.Meanwhile, in a desperate bid to bring down the test positivity rate, the district, with the help of private labs, had collected 14,978 samples. Yet, the positivity rate stood at 22.2%.Dr S Raja, city health officer, said, “We can see the infectivity rate dropping marginally. In the city corporation limits, the positivity rate has dipped to below 25%, from 28% to 30% earlier this week.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/dist-logs-3335-fresh-cases-20-deaths/articleshow/82811338.cms||---

---||Mumbai||A wall caused cylone flooding? Show-cause to 3 BMC engineers||MUMBAI: Three senior engineers of the BMC were on Thursday issued show-cause notices for the flooding in the city on the day cyclone Tauktae affected Mumbai.  The officials — a deputy chief engineer and two executive engineers — from the Storm Water Drains department allegedly failed to remove a cofferdam on time due to which some pumps could not operate at Worli’s Love Grove pumping station. The cofferdam, a concrete structure that serves as a bund, blocked water from flowing out into the pumping station and ultimately into the sea. TimesViewBMC’s claim of making the city flood-free has been proven hollow year after year. This year, with enough warning of the cyclone, BMC should’ve ensured all pumping stations work to full capacity. BMC must now take its probe to its logical end take corrective steps before monsoon. Action is a must against the guilty.Water-logging was reported at Cadbury junction on Peddar Road, Grant Road, near Nair Hospital at Mumbai Central, Kamathipura and parts of Shivaji Park. Warden Road and Breach Candy on Monday morning besides usual flooding spots like Hindmata in Parel and Gandhi Market in Sion. BMC officials said that the load of pumping water out was then on the Haji Ali pumping station where four out of five pumps were functional. “And, at Love Grove pumping station, four out of 10 were working due to some civil repair work... Water was receding very slowly,” said a senior civic official. BMC’s claims of doing de-silting work were entirely washed out, alleged corporator Rais Shaikh from Samajwadi Party, also an MLA. “Love Grove pumping station was not utilised at optimum capacity. Desilting was not completed and there was a sea of trash in nullahs that choked the pumps. This should have been cleared,” said . Additional municipal commissioner P Velrasu said refuted the claim that only four of 10 pumps were working. “There was a coffer dam erected for some civil work at Love Grove pumping station. We have issued show cause notices to engineers responsible for not removing it on time,” Velrasu said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-a-wall-caused-cylone-flooding-show-cause-to-3-bmc-engineers/articleshow/82813687.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

More than a year since then and with Delhi once again under a lockdown imposed to contain the exponential growth in Covid-19 cases, the scene at the ISBT is quite different. Read AlsoDelhi CM Arvind Kejriwal appeals to migrant workers not to leave for native placesDelhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday appealed to migrant workers not to leave for their native places during the 21-day nationwide lockdown in the interest of the country.As inter-state movement by train or buses has not been restricted this time, the Anand Vihar ISBT remains calm, despite some crowding initially. Read AlsoDelhi: Rs 5,000 each to help migrants stay putIn a move to help prevent a migrant exodus from Delhi following the announcement of a weeklong lockdown, Delhi government will give each registered construction worker Rs 5,000, food, medications, shelter and other necessities“Last time, there was too much rush at Anand Vihar and buses of our Delhi Transport Corporation went as far as they could and transported thousands of passengers. This time, there were no problems at the ISBTs at all because there was constant coordination with concerned officials of Uttar Pradesh, apart from Delhi Police also, who have been alert,” Delhi’s transport minister Kailash Gahlot told TOI. “Anand Vihar ISBT was completely contained from the very beginning and our enforcement officials were stationed there round the clock,” Gahlot said. He added that though there is no restriction on the movement of those who want to go, many measures have been taken by the district authorities to ensure that migrant workers staying back don’t face any problem at all. “All district magistrates have been very active from the beginning and the management has been effective, with migrant workers being provided food and items of daily need at the places where they are staying and daily reporting is being carried out on this,” Gahlot said. “More than six lakh people have travelled from the Anand Vihar ISBT alone since the lockdown was imposed on April 19 and a large number of the travellers were migrant workers going to different parts of Uttar Pradesh,” a Delhi government official said. “The number of buses that operated from the ISBT on April 19 was 815, which went up to 1,116 by April 21 and has remained between 800 and 1,000 since then,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-delhi-govt-averted-another-migrant-crisis/articleshow/82843551.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Hyderabad||Only 3 Telangana districts open for jabs, lowest in India||Hyderabad: For the third consecutive day on Thursday, Telangana – the state with the maximum vaccine makers in the country – continued to be the state with the least number of districts giving the Covid- 19 vaccines in the country. The state had the vaccine drive running in only three of its 33 districts according to the CoWin app – Hyderabad, Rangareddy and Medchal. The only other state to have only three districts open for vaccination is Sikkim but it can’t be compared to Telangana as it has only four districts. Although Telangana is among nine other states which have given more than 50 lakh doses, CoWin data shows that even among those states, Telangana is placed eighth. Smaller states like Odisha and Chhattisgarh are ahead of Telangana. Six other states have given more than 1 crore doses. Officials told TOI that with vaccine supply severely restricted, they have no choice but to stop the inoculations, even for those who need to take their second shot. In fact, Telangana has not even started inoculating those in the 18-44 category. Sources said that the state may add more districts soon as it received one lakh Covishiled doses on Thursday. This would take its overall stock to 5.2 lakh doses and includes Covaxin as well. “We are keen to see that the maximum number of people are vaccinated,” a senior official told TOI. “But without enough doses, there is not much that we can do.” During a video-conference with Union health minister Harsh Vardhan, Telangana minister Harish Rao had asked the Centre to allocate 13 lakh Covid 19 vaccines by the end of this month to meet the state’s requirements. He said thatof the 13 lakh, 10 lakh Covishield and three lakh Covaxin vaccines were required. In all, 1.29 crore vaccine doses were needed to vaccinate 33 lakh people with second dose and 96 lakh people with the first dose and cover all those aged above 45 years. Vaccination data shows that till 8 PM on Thursday Telangana had given 3,219 doses, out of which 2,103 doses (mostly second doses) were given in Hyderabad. The other two districts are part of Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation. The daily dose data shows that only Nagaland (983) and Sikkim (1,870) were behind Telangana on Thursday. Small states like Arunachal Pradesh, Goa, Manipur and Tripura have given doses. However, all districts are given vaccines in these states. Experts say that vaccination needs to pick up as much as possible to prevent the intensity of infection spreading in coming days. Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) former director Rakesh Misra observed that efforts should be made to complete the vaccination drive for nearly 80% of the population above 18 years by December this year. But wearing a mask is very important even after taking two shots of the vaccine, he observed. “The unmasking policy adopted by some countries like US is not advisable. They may be doing it to lure unvaccinated people as there is more hesitancy there, but unmasking is like inviting the virus to mutate. No vaccine completely protects from viruses, but gives very good protection against mortality and condition of patients will not become critical,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/only-3-telangana-districts-open-for-jabs-lowest-in-india/articleshow/82812839.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Victim Kinshuk Patel, 33, was about to leave his Dapper Smoke Shop located in Lindenhurst locality at around 9:30pm on Wednesday as per local time when some unidentified persons came there and said they wanted to buy something. Kinshuk is believed to have told them that the shop was closed, which led to an argument. “He was about to pull down the shutter and leave when three or four persons came. They pushed him inside the shop and hit him with a blunt object on his head,” said Ankur Patel, a close friend of Kinshuk living in Bhadran. Ankur said that the assailants then took an unconscious Kinshuk inside the shop and locked him inside. “They left the shop and took some valuables with them,” he said. According to Ankur, when Kinshuk did not return home till late, his family tried calling him. When he did not respond, a relative went to the shop to check on him. The shop was open and the relative found him lying there bleeding badly. An ambulance was called but Ankur said that Kinshuk may have died on his way to the hospital. He added that an autopsy was being performed on the body and CCTV footage from the shop was being examined.  Kinshuk was close to Ankur and they spoke almost every day. “He used to call me on the way to the shop daily and speak for a long time. This had become a routine. He was a simple person and is survived by his father, wife and two children. His mother died in 2018,” said Ankur.

---||Hyderabad||Covid-19: ICMR delists plasma but social media flooded with requests||HYDERABAD: While the central government has removed convalescent plasma therapy from the country’s clinical management guidelines on Covid-19, many are still found seeking plasma donors on social media, to avail of the treatment. When TOI spoke to some of them on Thursday, it learnt that the people were scouting for plasma, for friends and family members, based on suggestions from the hospital. “The hospital where my 55-year-old father is being treated for Covid-19 asked us to get B+ plasma. So, I posted my requirement on social media and even managed to get it,” said a kin of a patient admitted at a private hospital in Somajiguda. Like them, there were others too who said they were getting it in writing from doctors to get plasma units of Covid-19 recovered patients. One such patient had a prescription signed and stamped from a hospital in Kacheguda where the doctor sought 10 units of B+ plasma for the patient on May 19, two days after the ICMR de-listed the therapy. ICMR’s move followed several research studies that failed to find any additional benefits while treating moderate to serious Covid-19 patients through this process. However, despite the guidelines, social media continues to be full of plasma requests. TOI independently verified that some of these prescriptions uploaded by people, were as recent as May 19-20. Volunteering groups too are flooded with plasma requests. “We individually reply to each request that we get and explain ICMR guidelines. Though they don’t seem to know about the rules, they understand after we chat with them personally,” said Vensy Krishna, founder of Hyderabad Covid Resources, an app helping people with Covid-19 resources. Adhering to ICMR guidelines, many volunteering groups who were connecting patients with donors, have now discontinued services. “We no longer accept requests for convalescent plasma. There is no scientific evidence in support of convalescent plasma therapy. We advise patients’ families to exercise caution and due diligence before searching for donors,” read an automated message from C19 Task Force to all those seeking plasma therapy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/icmr-delists-plasma-but-social-media-flooded-with-requests/articleshow/82813296.cms||Preeti Biswas

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra asks HC for partial stay on Deshmukh probe||Mumbai: The Bombay high court, in a late-night hearing on Wednesday, heard an urgent plea by the state government for a stay of the CBI probe into two aspects of FIR against former home minister Anil Deshmukh. The state has sought quashing of two paragraphs in the FIR and a halt to a ‘roving’ probe into dismissed API Sachin Waze’s reinstatement, besides Deshmukh’s alleged “exercise of undue influence” over police transfers and postings. It said the CBI has gone “beyond’ the HC’s April 5 order for a preliminary enquiry into the allegations of ex-Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh claiming malpractices by Deshmukh as minister. Param Bir Singh’s March 20 letter to CM Uddhav Thackeray didn’t refer to Waze or police transfers, the state counsel said, adding that the HC had clearly given Singh liberty to raise his grievances regarding postings and transfers before an appropriate forum. Opposing the state’s petition, additional solicitor general S V Raju, for the CBI, said the HC had observed that “there can be no fair probe by the state”, while ordering the preliminary enquiry. The vacation bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and S P Tavade, who heard the matter after presiding over for 12 straight hours since 11am, asked senior counsel for state Rafique Dada what the urgency was. He said the CBI had, on April 26, sent a letter to police commissioner of Mumbai requesting him to share documents and digital evidence into police transfers and postings, Waze, former state intelligence chief Rashmi Shukla and her confidential report on alleged politician-police nexus in transfers and postings, which was beyond the scope of the April 5 HC order. On May 8, the CBI had served a notice on chief secretary Sitaram Kunte directing him to appear before it on May 11 in Delhi. A fresh notice was sent on May 15 when Kunte expressing difficulty in travelling due to the pandemic. Kunte finally went to Delhi on Saturday, said Dada. The state said, “It is also pertinent to note that the CBI filed an application before the Esplanade court of chief metropolitan magistrate for similar directions to provide a copy of Shukla’s letter dated August 25, 2020, along with digital devices and other documents. The magistrate, on May 13, dismissed the plea, and the CBI said it would file a revision application before the sessions court.” Raju pointed out that the CBI, which is governed under the Special Delhi Police Establishment Act, is not barred from carrying out the probe. “If the entire HC order is read, there is no restriction on the CBI investigating a particular aspect of the matter. The issue is live before the HC,” he said. The HC adjourned the matter to Friday and asked all the parties to give short and sharply written submissions before rising for the day at 11.15pm. Raju also said,"If the entire HC order is read there is no restriction barring CBI from investigating a particular aspect of matter.

---||Delhi||City of gold: Bright spots amid the despondency||NEW DELHI: Amid the gloom created by the Covid-19 pandemic, there is one aspect of the city that is bright and buoyant — the gold-lined streets. The Amaltas tree (Cassia fistula) is in bloom and its shower of dazzling yellow flowers has the power to lift dampened spirits. A middle-sized deciduous and mostly ornamental tree, it bursts into blossoms in late spring and its golden canopy is prominent from April to July. Discarded initially by the British as an avenue tree owing to its nature of shedding leaves annually, the Amaltas today lines the streets across Delhi, including the Lutyens’ zone. Pradip Krishen, environmentalist and author of Trees of Delhi, revealed that the notion the tree was ‘introduced’ to Delhi or that it was brought here by the British are misconceptions. The golden shower, as it is sometimes called, grew in Delhi’s forests long before the colonialists claimed India. “It is native to south-east Asia and commonly seen in this belt, including in Rajasthan or Haryana,” said Krishen, who added that the British had actually favoured species other than the Amaltas as avenue trees. “They wanted a tree that would not shed its leaves but stay green throughout the year,” the environmentalist said. “So, even if planted, it was put up in parks for its showy flowers, but never alongside an avenue. It was only in the 1960s and ’70s that they were used to line the streets and now it is a prominent feature of Delhi’s avenues.” Referring to its unique seed dispersal, Krishen said that in 1920, British forestry expert Robert Scott Troup discovered that the tree relied on jackals and bears to carry its seeds far and near. Krishen said, “Unlike other leguminous trees, whose seed pods split open to scatter the seeds, the tubular Amaltas pod simply falls to the ground. Troup carried out an experiment, keeping some pods on open ground and some under a net. He found that animals such as jackals and bear were attracted to its scent and taste and swallowed the pod. Their digestive tracts weaken the outer layer of the pod and allow the seed to be excreted for germination.” If the pods aren’t opened in this fashion, they simply decay over time. As Krishen disclosed, “Even today, to plant an Amaltas, the pod has to be first boiled to mimic the action of stomach acid weakening its outer layer. Only then can it be planted.” Faiyaz Khudsar, scientist-in-charge, Yamuna Biodiversity Park, informed that the tree starts flowering before the monsoons arrive, showing signs of being under ‘stress’ to complete its life cycle. “The tree is native to the Aravali landscape and thrives in Delhi. It is also broad-leafed and not only looks beautiful, but can trap particulate matter, thus making it an ideal avenue tree,” said Khudsar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/city-of-gold-bright-spots-amid-the-despondency/articleshow/82843640.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

---||Hyderabad||Bharat Biotech eyes 1bn doses output by ’21 end||Hyderabad: Amid a growing clamour for a quick ramp-up of Covaxin capacity, its developer Bharat Biotech has decided to deploy its Chiron Behring facility in Gujarat, to boost output by another 200 million doses annually. This will scale up the production of the indigenous Covid-19 vaccine to nearly 1 billion doses a year by 2021 end, a top Bharat Biotech executive said on Thursday. “The company plans to produce 200 million doses of Covaxin per annum in the GMP facilities that are already operational for the production of vaccines based on the inactivated vero cell platform technology, under stringent levels of GMP and biosafety,” Bharat Biotech joint MD Suchitra Ella tweeted. The move comes at a time when the country is facing an acute shortage of vaccines, forcing the government to go slow on inoculation amid a second wave of the deadly pandemic. In recent months, Bharat Biotech has ramped up its capacity to meet the growing requirement and has gone past its target for the year-end. The Ankleshwar facility was acquired by Bharat Biotech in early 2019 as part of the 100% acquisition of Chiron Behring Vaccines Pvt Ltd from GlaxoSmithKline Asia. The facility manufactures rabies vaccines using the inactivated vero cell platform technology, which is the same technology that is used in manufacturing Covaxin. However, the rabies facility will need to be repurposed for the production of Covaxin. Sources said the Ankleshwar facility is currently working overtime to churn out rabies vaccines as part of efforts to stock up on the crucial vaccine for fulfilling the company’s earlier commitments, after which it will be repurposed and deployed for manufacturing Covaxin. Ella had recently said that Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin manufacturing capacity had crossed 500 million doses a year at multiple facilities across the country in April this year. As part of its ramp up of Covaxin capacities, the company has also deployed a facility owned by a related entity Biovet at Malur in Kolar. The Biovet facility is an animal vaccines plant that has been repurposed to make Covaxin. Apart from these, it has tied up with Indian Immunologicals Ltd (IIL) for manufacturing the crucial drug substance of Covaxin at the company’s Karkapatla facilities in Genome Valley from July onwards. In addition, the Centre has roped in Haffkine Institute and Bharat Immunologicals and Biologicals (BIBCOL) to produce 220 million doses annually and 20 million doses per annum of Covaxin. The two players are currently repurposing their facilities to manufacture the desi Covid vaccine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bharat-biotech-eyes-1bn-doses-output-by-21-end/articleshow/82813151.cms||Swati Bharadwaj
---||Hyderabad||T'gana: Online system for black fungus drugs leaves families of patients in uncertainty||HYDERABAD: The Telangana government’s move to introduce an online application system for allotment of drugs like Liposomal Amphotericin B, Posaconazole and Isavuconazole, for treatment of mucormycosis, seems to have done little good to the family members of those affected. Instead, the new system has left them feeling even more helpless as they can do nothing but wait for officials to respond with no process in place to track the status of their application. In fact, those who received a response on Twitter for their request for the drugs have also been waiting for days now to get the vials. “We received a response from KTROffice on May 16. Subsequently, we were asked to write an e-mail, but till now we have received no response,” said a woman whose father is admitted in a hospital in Kachiguda. While the family has already spent Rs 2 lakh to procure 10 vials for the 53-year-old patient, his daughter said that he needs another another 30 to 40 Liposomal Amphotericin B 50 mg injections. “But the injection is not available even in the black market now. Officials said that they will reach out to us once the stock is available,” she said adding that since the last three days her father has not been administered the medicine. Same is the case with a 49-year-old farmer who is fighting black fungus infection at a hospital in Somajiguda. While his family requested 40 vials, they received only four. Covid warriors helping people with requests for injections, beds, among essentials, said that although they are directing them to approach the state for injections, many are coming back to them claiming the state has no stock. “I have received about 400 to 500 requests for injection in the two to three days. Though several of these requests might be overlapping, since multiple people are trying to procure it for a single patient, the fact remains that many people are unable to get the injections,” said Sai Charan Chikkulla, who has been actively helping people during the second wave. He said that it would be better if a nodal centre is identified in each district so that family members can go with the required documents and get the injections after due verification. One of the members of the committee, scrutinising applications sent for these medicines, said that initially they had to send back many applications as they were not in proper proforma. He said that they have received over 200 applications and cleared about 70 to 80 on Thursday. “There is no reason to panic. Unlike Covid-19, delay in administering injection for four to five days will not do any harm in this case,” said the member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/online-system-for-black-fungus-drugs-leaves-families-of-patients-in-uncertainty/articleshow/82813220.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

---||Delhi||Time is money: How O2 banks in Delhi are saving lives||NEW DELHI: When Manish Srivastava and his wife Preeti were in home-isolation, they learnt that their sister-in-law Mamta (45) too tested positive for Covid-19. “Her oxygen level suddenly dropped to 89 and she needed an oxygen concentrator at home. We cannot afford to purchase one from the market. After we came to know about the oxygen concentrator banks set up by the Delhi government, we contacted the 1031 helpline number and received the concentrator on Tuesday,” said Srivastava. After many patients and their attendants faced problems in procuring oxygen concentrators, the Delhi government set up oxygen concentrator banks in all the districts of the national capital. The 1031 helpline of the government assists people in procuring and setting up the concentrators. Any patient in home isolation or those who need the concentrators after getting discharged from hospitals can utilise this service if they have low levels of oxygen. A government official said 160 people have received oxygen concentrators from the banks so far. The family members of Mohd Arif Khan (60) were happy when they received the concentrator without any inconvenience on Wednesday. The patient’s nephew, Arbaz Khan, said, “When I contacted the helpline number, I was asked to submit some documents. After I submitted the required documents, we received the concentrator in just one and a half hours.” Arif Khan was admitted to a hospital in Munirka for seven days and when he was discharged, his doctor advised him to continue using an oxygen concentrator. “My grandfather died due to complications related to Covid-19 on May 10 and hence, we wanted to arrange a concentrator for my uncle as early as possible,” said Arbaz. Many people said they were facing no inconvenience in using the concentrators. “When we received an oxygen concentrator for my father, those associated with the helpline explained to us how to use it. I made a booking on Tuesday night and received it on Wednesday,” said Jatin Verma who lives in Najafgarh. His father, Vajinder, is on oxygen support. A resident of Shahdara, Soni Devi, has been using an oxygen concentrator at her house for the past three days. Her husband, Pawan Bansal, said, “My wife was hospitalised for 10 days and even after she was discharged from the hospital, she needed an oxygen concentrator. As she is using it, her condition has improved.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/time-is-money-how-o2-banks-are-saving-lives/articleshow/82811463.cms||---

Till now, several employees, including 18 serving faculty members, a large number of retired professors and non-teaching staff, have died due to the virus.In a letter to the members of AMU community, the VC appealed to all the deans, principals, chairpersons, provosts, heads of departments and teaching and non-teaching staff and alumni to motivate and make efforts that all of them and their family members as well as students get vaccinated against the virus. “All studies indicate that vaccines provide protection against serious diseases, hospitalizations and deaths. Vaccination is also required to control the present situation as well as to prevent a potential third wave in the future,” said the vice-chancellor.The VC further said that vaccination can be taken at any approved vaccination centre for persons in the age groups of 45 years and above, and 18-44 years. Two vaccinationcentres are also operating at the JN Medical College (examination centre and auditorium). Professor Mansoor also urged all AMU employees to provide the vaccination status of themselves and their dependent family members to the office of the medical attendance scheme, AMU, in the format circulated by it. “This information will provide us with the information for future health planning and streamlining the vaccinationdrive,” he said.“At personal and community levels, Covid-appropriate behaviour – wearing of masks, physical distancing, ventilation, etc -- is critical for our safety and to ease pressure on the healthcare system during the second wave,” the VC appealed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/vaccine-hesitancy-major-cause-of-covid-surge-on-campus-amu-vc/articleshow/82809258.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The government has posted staff, along with nodal officers in respective private hospitals, for facilitating admission there. Patients or relatives seeking admission in private hospitals can verify the bed availability by dialing the 24x7 helpline no 2494545 or visit www.goaonline.gov.in, North Goa nodal officer Nikhil Desai said . “People are going from pillar to post to check for availability of beds. The system has been simplified by offering a helpline that will provide information on bed availability at private hospitals. The person placing a request will be directed to proceed to the hospital of his choice if a bed is available. This will help reduce confusion,” Desai told reporters. At the hospital, the patient will be examined by the doctor on duty. “If the doctor feels admission is not required at that stage, the patient will be given medication, asked to go home and advised home isolation,” Desai said. If a patient fails to get admission to a private hospital of his choice, there is always the option of going to a government hospital, he said. Prasad Lolayekar, who has been appointed nodal officer for South Goa said that a coordinator each has been appointed for 13 private hospitals in South Goa, while three joint coordinators have been appointed for each of the two big hospitals - Victor hospital and SMRC. “If any person is denied admission in any of these hospitals, they can contact the respective co-ordinator,” Lolayekar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-officers-to-handle-bed-allotment-at-pvt-hospitals/articleshow/82813847.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Study finds radioactive gases in abundance near Nalgonda hamlet||Hyderabad: Radioactive gases Radon and Thoron, capable of causing lung cancer and other health hazardous, are found in much higher levels at Buddonithanda, a tribal hamlet which is located near a proposed uranium mining site in Nalgonda. A study by Osmania University Department of Physics Researchers published in ‘Nature’ magazine, revealed that that around nine villages near Chitrial area of Nalgonda have higher levels of the two gases. Radon and Thoron are found to be 94 becquerels per cubic meter (Bq m3 ) and 121 Bq m3 in the study area. Radon is more than twice the global average of 40 and Thoron is 12 times above the global average of 10. The researches said that the annual average inhalation dose exposure to the two gases to the locals in the investigated area is found to be relatively higher. One of the researchers and Osmania University registrar, professor Ch Gopal Reddy said, “Atomic Minerals Directorate has found uranium deposits in Chitrial area near Devarakonda. It has been identified as future milling and processing site for uranium fuel.” “Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) assigned a scientific study to us,” Reddy added. “We have installed Radon and Thoron detectors in the houses of the tribal hamlets and villages around Chitrial. We collected the readings year long. Radon and Thoron are in gaseous form and inhaled by people. They get deposited in the lungs and emit radiation. They cause damage to human cells. If radiation is beyond permissible limits, they are carcinogenic. Human health studies are yet to be done.” AERB is collecting baseline data for reference. “Chitrial is the continuation of Cuddapah basin. Lambapur and Peddagattu are the other areas with uranium deposits. When we spoke to the villages in the current study area in around nine villages, they didn’t reveal any health impacts so far. But we need to conduct health studies,” Reddy said. The levels are high in the region due to the decay of uranium and thorium from the rocks underneath the earth. Researchers G Suman, K Vinay Kumar Reddy, M Sreenath Reddy and P Yadagiri Reddy of OU were part of the study. Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration and Research, Hyderabad, has conducted several geological studies in the area. “The mining activity may enhance the environmental nuclear radiation levels in the adjoining areas,” researchers said. Exposure to Radon in workplace and houses increases the risk of developing lung cancer. “Exposure to indoor radon and its isotopes is the second leading cause of lung cancer after tobacco smoking,” the study says. The concentration of Radon and Thoron inside the houses is majorly determined by the type of material used for construction, lifestyle of dwellers, geology and meteorological conditions of the study area,” the study adds. “The houses are constructed with bricks, stones, mud, dried grass, leaves, and a few are with cement and asbestos. Radiation levels are higher with the houses built with mud.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/study-finds-radioactive-gases-in-abundance-near-nalgonda-hamlet/articleshow/82811496.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

The attached properties include interest accrued on the already attached 105 fixed deposits, bank balances, mutual funds and gold jewellery found in the locker of key accused Pawan Malhan, MD of eBiz.com, and his son Hitik Malhan. On September 17, 2019, the ED had provisionally attached immovable properties worth Rs 34.6 crore and bank balances of Rs 242.2 crore from 124 different accounts belonging to eBiz.com and its promoters. After the PMLA adjudicating authority confirmed the attachment, the ED took possession of the properties. The ED initially booked a PMLA case based on FIRs registered by Telangana police. A money laundering investigation by the ED revealed that the accused were running a pyramid fraud in the guise of direct selling multi-level marketing network. The accused tried to sell CDs containing free computer education packages to camouflage pyramid fraud as a direct selling product company. The ED alleged: “The promoters conducted mega conventions and flaunted their lavish lifestyle and used social media to lure gullible investors. They collected Rs 1,064 crore from 12 lakh subscribers through a chain of agents spread across the country. The funds were illegally diverted into the personal accounts of the directors, their family members and other associates under various expenditure heads, including dividends and high salaries.” It may be recalled the ED had already filed a preliminary prosecution complaint against the accused persons on March 12 this year before the principal special sessions judge of Rangareddy court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ed-attaches-rs-31-cr-worth-assets-in-ebiz-scam/articleshow/82811465.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

While it appeared that the inquiry into the incident had reached a logical end when taluka-level health officer on May 18 formally indicted these teachers after a probe found them guilty for dereliction of duty, the in-charge of Primary Health Centre (PHC) concerned came out with a clarification within the next 24 hours stating that they were present and discharged their duties diligently. After dramatic turn of events, the teachers — Sachin Kate, Anil Surnar and Pandurang Solanke — have said they were made scapegoat in the entire incident and their suspension has not been revoked. “On April 30, we were given the responsibility of entering details of vaccine beneficiaries in the CoWIN app at the PHC located in Shrishti village. However, we were facing technical issues in accessing the portal and informed the same to the Community Health Officer (CHO). The CHO then said he would make a manual note of the beneficiary details and feed the same into the portal later in the evening. Therefore, we were nowhere involved in either recording the credentials or vaccination history of beneficiaries,” Surnar said. The trio, in their defence, also produced a letter given by the CHO on May 19 that absolved them of all charges levelled against them. “The ZP administration should punish those guilty by carrying out a fresh probe and revoke our suspension immediately,” the trio said. When contacted, Jalna ZP CEO Pratap Sawade said teachers were suspended as per inquiry report submitted by the taluka level health officer. “I have not come across the clean-chit given by CHO to the three teachers. We will seek more details into the whole incident afresh,” he said. Meanwhile, Dattatraya Waghmare, the senior citizen who received mixed doses of the vaccine, was said to be stable and did not report any health issues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/jalna-3-teachers-get-clean-chit-in-vax-goof-up-case/articleshow/82806567.cms||Prasad Joshi

Across India, an estimated 10lakh ASHA workers are expected to join the protest.  “In the second wave, ASHA workers are put on 24 hours’ duty almost, without leave. They are told to conduct surveys, report cases, get medical help to the infected, monitor patients, follow up with recovered ones and so on. This is in addition to the vaccination duties for almost 8-9 hours a day,” said Anandi Avaghade, head of ASHA workers’ union in Satara.  In Maharashtra particularly, ASHA workers complained that they have been deprived of a regular supply of masks or sanitisers, leave alone PPEs. “Some gram panchayats provide those, but there is no support from the state,” she said, adding that they were given masks and sanitizers just once in the second wave in several districts. “ASHAs have been doing co-morbidity surveys since last year. We demand that the government pay Rs 300 per day,” she said. They are also demanding the Rs 50 lakh insurance cover to be extended, a compensation of Rs 10 lakh for all those who got infected; insurance and coverage of treatment for Covid-19 for the entire family.

---||Meerut||3 school kids start helping Covid patients, 250 join them in class action||Meerut: As Covid-19 hit a high in April and hospitals were overwhelmed with requests for admission, and WhatsApp groups inundated with unconfirmed messages about availability of oxygen cylinders, Ansh Garg knew he had to plug the gap between fact and fiction. It didn't take long for his two friends, Avani Singh and Rishay Gupta, to join hands. Before they knew, 250 students from across India had volunteered as foot soldiers. Soon, two WhatsApp groups were floated -- 'Covid-19 Sahayta Kendra' and 'Sahayta Kendra Volunteers'. The first was for students who were ready to devote time every day to find verified leads on hospital beds, ventilators and oxygen cylinders across states. The second group then worked on the genuine information, connecting patients with their needs -- from Meerut to Nagpur, Kolkata to Bengaluru. They have by now helped hundreds. “The strategy was simple," Ansh, a resident of Saharanpur and student of class XII, told TOI. "Good information has the power to save lives. The idea was floated and Avani and Rishay, both from Meerut, came in. We had to develop a database of verified leads that could be passed on to people in need, and on time.” Avani, 17, added, “Whenever a demand arises for something, a hospital bed in Chandigarh perhaps, we immediately contact our network source in that city who has access to the real data on beds there. We then quickly call the hospital for confirmation and the needy person is directed to that facility.” Some 110 volunteers in the primary Whatsapp group continuously keep track of leads and update the database. Then the other group takes over. TOI contacted some of the families, in different parts of India, who had got help from these students. Devraj Khunteta, a Jaipur resident, was one of them. “My grandmother was in dire need of a ventilator. Most hospitals had beds but no ventilator. It was then that I sent across messages to my friends and one of them connected with this group. I was immediately sent verified information and I got a ventilator.” In Delhi, Anoma Jayant got a bed for her uncle in the nick of time. And in Bengaluru, Elakkana P got AB negative blood. One of the volunteers, Sripriya Chowdhury, 18, said she takes care of the 'Kolkata region'. “I generate authentic leads for my city," she said. "It is a strenuous task. But then it is a matter of life and death. If someone gets an oxygen cylinder within time, it saves a life. It's a noble cause and spending two hours daily is not a big deal.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/3-school-kids-start-helping-covid-patients-250-join-them-in-class-action/articleshow/82806668.cms||Sandeep Rai

Deaths are also reducing in numbers. The focus is to expand healthcare facilities across the state and recruit health consultants and assistants,” said a health department official.

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Cyclone likely to hit land earlier than expected||KOLKATA: The cyclonic storm brewing over the Bay of Bengal is yet to form but the Met officials expect that it will advance the movement and hit the Bengal Odisha coast earlier than it was predicted. On Wednesday, the Met officials had said that the cyclonic storm was expected to reach the Bengal and Odisha coast by May 26 evening. But it is expected to hit by morning on May 26. “There is an advancement of about 12 hours in its time of the cyclonic storm crossing the Bengal Odisha coast,” said GK Das, director (weather) at Regional Meteorological Centre Kolkata. Weather scientists said the weather models, through which they are tracking the system, shows that it is moving very fast over the sea. According to them, this is a good sign because if the system moves at a slow pace, it gets time to gather more strength. “Less amount of time spent on the sea means its intensity, while approaching the land, will get restricted,” said a weather scientist. In such a case, the Met officials said that the cyclone might not create the kind of destruction that Amphan had done last year in May. But IMD is keeping a close track and will issue updates from time to time. “It is still too early to predict its landfall and intensity. Let the low pressure system form first. We are tracking the system continuously,” said Das. The low pressure is likely to form over North Andaman Sea and adjoining East Central Bay of Bengal on Saturday. The system will then intensify gradually into two other stages — a well-marked low pressure and a depression — before it takes the form of a cyclone. Met officials have predicted that heavy downpour will hit coastal and Gangetic Bengal from May 25. Squally wind reaching the speed of 40-50 kmph gusting up to 65 kmph may hit North Bay of Bengal along the Bengal-Odisha-Bangladesh coast from the evening of May 25. If the cyclone forms, it will be called Yaas and it will be the second tropical cyclone to hit Bengal in a consecutive year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cyclone-likely-to-hit-land-earlier-than-expected/articleshow/82811534.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Delhi||Gahlot seeks report in a month on road cave-in||New Delhi: Transport minister Kailash Gahlot has sought an inquiry into the incident of cave-in near the under-construction site of Dhansa Stand Metro Station following heavy rain on Wednesday. The inquiry will be conducted by special commissioner (Transport) KK Dahiya and the report has to be submitted within a month. Gahlot visited the area near the station and Khaira Crossing on Thursday morning and was accompanied by Delhi Metro Rail Corporation’s (DMRC) managing director Mangu Singh. The minister advised Singh to review the safety precautions being taken at the site as well as the other ones to ensure no such accident happens due to any lapses on the part of contractors or officials again. Singh said that Delhi Jal Board pipelines at the caved-in portion would be restored by DMRC by May 23. The transport department officials said Gahlot also noted that the marshals of DMRC, who were deployed at the site, did not take any preventive action to avoid the incident. An official said that during his visit on Thursday, the minister found that the cave-in was so huge that it precariously exposed the foundation of an adjacent building. The minister noted that DMRC did not take lessons from the previous lapses, and therefore, strict action had to be taken against the officials who put the life of public in grave danger, the official said. Gahlot has also directed the executive engineer of public works department to conduct a survey and assess the nature and extent of damage done to the property and the ones adjoining it for a fair compensation to be paid to the affected owners by DMRC. PWD has also been directed to assess the structural stability of the damaged building on top priority. In case the structure is found to be unstable, the department will take up the matter with the local body to get it demolished immediately.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/gahlot-seeks-report-in-a-month-on-road-cave-in/articleshow/82843668.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||Fund crunch forces T to opt for Rs 1,500 cr in bonds||Hyderabad: Faced with a severe fund crisis in the midst of a raging pandemic, the state government is raising bonds worth Rs 1,500 crore. The state had already raised Rs 5,000 crore through bonds at the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in the last two months. Telangana, in fact, had asked the RBI to allow it to raise Rs 8,000 crore towards loans in the first quarter even as its debt burden touched Rs 4 lakh crore. Senior government officials said income generation took a beating in the second wave of Covid-19. With the lockdown extended till May 30, the state’s income is set to dip further. With welfare schemes like Rythu Bandhu and Rythu Bima breathing down its neck, the government needs at least Rs 7,500 crore within two months. Also, the state will be weighed down by another Rs 2,500 crore, which will go towards purchasing Covid-19 vaccines. While it has stopped or delayed several payments, the latest figures on the closure of the last financial year released by Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) have got very little for the state to cheer about. Telangana earned Rs 99,000 crore income as against the target income of Rs 1.76 lakh crore, almost a cent per cent fall in its expectations. The budget income during the financial year was Rs 1.45 lakh crore. The state’s own tax revenue which used to be around Rs 400 crore a day also dwindled drastically. “This is mainly due to the lockdown-induced loss. Though the state recovered quickly with hectic economic activity after the lockdown last year, economic slowdown has set in due to the second wave and ongoing lockdown,” a finance department official said. Amid demands from the opposition parties, officials said Covid-19 treatment, if it is brought under Aarogyasri, will need around Rs 3,000 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/fund-crunch-forces-t-to-opt-for-rs-1500-cr-in-bonds/articleshow/82811520.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Recently, the experts asked the civic authorities to ensure early detection of the infection among the vulnerable population. According to the reports, around 34% of the Covid patients succumbed to infection within 48 hours of being admitted to the hospitals. Kadambari Balkawade, the civic administrator said, “We have deployed most of our staff on the ground. They visit door-to-door and conducted rapid antigen tests of the suspected Covid patients. The suspected patients are zeroed in based on the six-minute walk test done to check the drop in the oxygen level. Also, regular screening for body temperature is done. We are also reporting several Covid patients, who are at home and are not taking any treatment. Early detection and reducing mortality rates are the main aims of the drive.”  In the last few days, around 3,700 comorbid patients have been screened and tested, of them, around 180 have tested positive through rapid antigen test and RT-PCR test. The authorities said there are around 14,000 such patients with comorbidity and their screening will be done by next week. “First, we are focusing on the Covid hotspots for the door-to-door screening. It will help to contain the spread at the source ,” said Balkawade. Every day, Kolhapur city is reporting over 300 Covid cases, which is the highest in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-begins-drive-for-early-detection/articleshow/82806643.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: Navneet Kalra sent to judicial custody for 14 days||NEW DELHI: Stating that courts couldn’t be expected to get carried away by public sentiments and authorise detention merely on the basis of some stringent and non-bailable sections invoked against the accused, a city court on Thursday remanded businessman Navneet Kalra, arrested in an alleged case of hoarding and black marketing of oxygen concentrators, to 14 days in judicial custody. Duty magistrate Akanksha Garg observed that the offence was of a grave nature and had serious implications on the society at large. “In these testing times, when utmost humanity and compassion have been exhibited by people, a few miscreants in the society have resorted to vices like hoarding and black-marketing of essential drugs and medical equipment that could otherwise have averted so much death and destruction,” the court noted. However, the order stated, “Courts are not expected to be carried away by public sentiments and, therefore, cannot authorise detention merely because some stringent and non-bailable sections have been slapped upon the accused by the prosecution. It is their sacrosanct responsibility to apply their judicial mind and delve into the said question deeply.” The court highlighted that according to police, incriminating material against the accused had been recovered and what remained was merely his confrontation with the material. “This court is of the view that police remand of the accused is not warranted,” it observed. Earlier, public prosecutor Atul Shrivastav had sought five more days of Kalra’s police custody arguing that “huge” transactions were carried out by him. “There are 23 banks involved in these transactions. We have served notices and received statements from some of them. He needs to be confronted with the statements. A total of 516 transactions are there,” he submitted. The prosecutor said a mirror image of Kalra’s phone also had to be made. The oxygen concentrators had deteriorated the health of people by obstructing the flow of oxygen, he added. Appearing for Kalra, senior advocate Vikas Pahwa stated that his submissions should not be treated as an impediment to the investigation. He explained his client’s cooperation elaborating on his visits with police to his properties. “I showed my farm. I myself showed the contents of the phone,” he added. The counsel pointed out that for creating a mirror image of his client’s phone, his physical presence wasn’t required by police. “My technical assistance is not required. These data are available on laptop and phone. They have to segregate on their own. Bank details are to be connected to the alleged sales. That the bank has to provide,” submitted Pahwa. Advocate Vineet Malhotra, who too appeared for Kalra, said a social media post of actor Salman Khan showed that even he had imported the same machines. He argued that the allegation that Kalra sold sub-standard or malfunctioning machines was, therefore, negated. “Machines were bought by police officers and judicial officers,” he added. Shrivastava contested the claims submitting, “Salman Khan distributed them free of cost. He did not do business. Charity is not a crime. He never claimed they were premium oxygen concentrators and sufficient for two people. Kalra fooled police officers also. We are confirming if death has occurred or not.” The magistrate noted, “The contention that the mirror images of the recovered mobile phones are yet to be created, or the data from the laptop is yet to be segregated and, therefore, requires the custody of the accused is flawed and I do not find any force in it. Even if the accused is remanded to judicial custody or enlarged upon bail, nothing whatsoever is an impediment upon the investigating agency to confront or interrogate him.” The court further underlined that because replies of banks were awaited, it couldn’t be a ground to deny Kalra his valuable right. “Whatever substantial had to be achieved by the investigating agency through the police remand has already been achieved and no fruitful purpose would be served by extending the police custody of the accused. Therefore, I hereby reject the police remand application,” it was held.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/kalra-sent-to-judicial-custody-for-14-days/articleshow/82811539.cms||Aamir Khan
---||Delhi||Only 2 days’ stock of Covaxin, 9 days of Covishield left: Atishi||New Delhi: Flagging vaccine shortage, AAP MLA Atishi on Thursday said Delhi has only two days’ stock of Covaxin, and nine days of Covishield left for the 45+ age group and stressed that without the supply being replenished, the group might not be able to get Covaxin after two days. In a press conference, the MLA said Delhi has less than a day’s stock of Covishield left for the 18-44 age group and more than 140 sites of the vaccination centres in city will be shut beginning Friday due to lack of doses. She added that in the current Covid wave, many young people are getting affected, and requested the Centre to immediately send Delhi the required amount of vaccines. On May 19, a total of 68,604 vaccines were administered, which is lower than usual. The reason behind that was that no vaccine was administered at government dispensaries on Wednesday. On Wednesdays and Fridays, government dispensaries are engaged only in routine immunisation of children. “The total number of first doses administered yesterday was 61,494, of which about 50,000 doses were administered to the 18-44 age group. Around 7,110 people received the second dose of the vaccine yesterday,” Atishi said. So far Delhi has vaccinated 48,69,640 people and 11,01,742 are fully vaccinated. For the 45+ age group, Delhi government has now opened walk-ins in schools. “For people who are facing difficulties in registering online, the walk-in facility is open, and we request everyone to get vaccinated,” Atishi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/only-2-days-stock-of-covaxin-9-days-of-covishield-left-atishi/articleshow/82811597.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||HC declines interim relief to retired IAS Acharya||Hyderabad: The Telangana high court on Thursday refused to stay the ongoing proceedings of the special CBI court against retired IAS officer BP Acharya in the Lepakshi Knowledge Hub (LKH) part of the quid pro quo case. Justice K Lakshman was hearing an interim application filed by the former bureaucrat, who was named as an accused in the case. Acharya was then MD of APIIC while allotting 9,000 acres in AP’s Anantapur district to industrialist Indu Syam Prasad Reddy’s LKH. Syam Prasad along with his Indu Projects Ltd was also made an accused in the case. Acharya is challenging the trial court order on the ground that his petition seeking review of the decision to accord sanction for his prosecution was pending with the Centre. CBI counsel K Surender argued that the sanction order came five years ago and the trial court made an inordinate delay in passing a cognisance order. “We cannot be held responsible for the delay,” he said. Justice Lakshman said he would post the case for a final hearing and decide the issue even as he sought counters from the Centre and the CBI on the matter. The judge, however, refused to stay the trial court process till then and adjourned the case to June 17. The CBI’s argument was that Acharya had failed to protect the interests of the state and allowed Syam Prasad to unduly enrich himself at the cost of the land belonging to the state. “The knowledge hub did not come up as promised, but Syam Prasad had succeeded in generating a huge amount of loans from banks by mortgaging 9,000 acres allotted to him by the state,” it said. The trial court took into cognisance the chargesheet against Acharya on March 10 following the sanction order from the Centre to prosecute the former bureaucrat under the Prevention of Corruption Act and after a stay order against his case stood vacated. Acharya contended that the state had already rejected the permission, while the Centre was yet to decide on the matter. “There was no decision from the central government in the last five years and there is no hurry for the trial court to rush the matter,” he said. The Act was amended in 2018 and the amended provisions have to be complied with now, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-declines-interim-relief-to-retired-ias-acharya/articleshow/82811559.cms||---

A corporation official said that all those who tested positive are asymptomatic. There are 86 inmates in the home and all were tested recently, after a nurse staying in the same premises tested positive. Eight nuns and 14 workers in the facility were also tested and test results showed that all of them are negative. A corporation official said that the nurse had all the symptoms but did not undergo a test. Recently, she developed health complications resulting in hospitalisation. As she tested positive in the hospital, all the inmates and workers of the home were tested. The 14 workers are staying outside the premises. Since the elderly people are also mentally retarded there will be difficulty in shifting them to a hospital. They have been isolated on the same premises and their health is being closely observed. Corporation commissioner S Visakan inspected the premises and distributed tablets and immunity boosters to the inmates. He insisted they wear double masks. He instructed the doctor to check the oxygen level once in every hour. They can contact the corporation officials at any moment for medical help, he said. Another official from the corporation said that all the elderly and children’s homes’ have been asked to report any fever cases and Covid-19 symptoms immediately.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/20-inmates-of-elderly-home-test-positive-for-covid-19/articleshow/82813855.cms||---

On Wednesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the price of diammonium phosphate (DAP) fertiliser, which was increased to Rs 1,900 per 50 kg bag, has been reduced to its earlier rate of Rs 1,200 per 50 kg bag. The central government has granted a subsidy to the manufacturing companies to keep the prices unchanged after receiving flak from the farmers across the country. However, many companies have already sent the fertizers bag with hiked minimum retail price (MRP) rates to the dealers. The dealers are insisting that the farmers should buy the DAP and other chemical fertizers at the new rates as printed on the bags. Dyandeo Wakure, Kolhapur district’s agriculture superintendent said, “The dealers cannot sell the fertizers above the price declared by the central government irrespective of the MRP cost printed on the bag. If the dealers continue to do so, we will have to cancel their license. We also demand the companies send the old stock at the earliest.” The district requires around 1.10 lakh tonne of non-urea fertizers, which includes around 23,000 tonne of DAP and muriate of potash (MOP) each. Also, the mixed fertizers — fertizers with different combinations of the nutrients — is also required in large quantity. Currently, the farmers confused over whether the prices of only DAP has been slashed or the prices of MOP and mixed fertizers have also reduced. According to the price list available at the dealers, the prices of MOP is increased from Rs 75 to Rs 100 per bag. Also, the prices of mixed fertizers of various combinations of nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium have been increased. Raju Shetti, president of Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana said, “We have studied the notifications of last two years regarding the fertiliser rates. We have found the rates of MOP are also unchanged, however, we will have to check whether the MOP is sold at the unchanged rate or the rates hiked by the companies."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/fertilizers-being-sold-at-hiked-mrp-say-farmers/articleshow/82806708.cms||---

The MP was on a two-day tour of Nashik city when he met the community members and discussed the current situation about the Supreme Court refuting the reservation to the community. He told the media that people’s lives are more important so this was not the time to fight for their reservation on the streets amid the Covid situation. “If we are losing people, I don’t think the fight for the reservation should be initiated on the streets right now. I urge the community members not to fall prey to anybody, who is trying to instigate, and wait till May 27 when I meet the chief minister Uddhav Thackeray,” the MP said. He said, “After having discussed in person with all the leaders of the community, I will keep the community’s demand in front of the CM and the leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis which itself will decide the future course of action,” The MP also said the state government was yet to provide appointment letters to all the members who had received the benefit of the reservation that the state government had given till September 2020 despite the Supreme Court allowing the same. He also raised about the running of Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj Research, Training and Human Development Institute (SARTHI), Pune which has been chocked due to lack of funds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/will-fight-for-reservation-of-maratha-community/articleshow/82806744.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The power generation corporation is waiting for machinery from Japan to complete the restoration of the unit. As a result, Genco may not utilise the unit for generation of hydroelectricity which starts in July and lasts till October or November. Genco chairman and managing director D Prabhakar Rao said import of machinery had been delayed because of the pandemic. “The unit IV machinery and spares need to be imported from Hitachi company from Japan which may cost Rs 25 crore. We are planning to complete restoration of the leftover unit as soon as possible,” he told TOI. He said all the other units that were destroyed in the fire had been restored at a cost of Rs 20 crore. “The unit IV may not become operational this monsoon season due to the pandemic. It requires a minimum of one month for installation after getting manchienry and spares from Japan,” Genco officials said. Officials said the hydroelectric project, which was kicked off in early 2000, has machinery mostly imported from Japan. The fully-automated plant generators and controlling systems were supplied by Mistubishi while turbines, auxiliaries, GIS and 400 kV cables were supplied by Hitachi. Some parts like inlet valves and excitation system were provided by BHEL. The fire occurred on August 20 last year. It started in unit VI and spread to unit IV. Two units I and II were partially damaged and restored within two months of the accident and started power generation. The 900 MW installed capacity power station has six units each with 150 MW.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/unit-iv-of-srisailam-power-station-yet-to-be-restored/articleshow/82811596.cms||Koride Mahesh

Criminologist Vijay Raghavan from TISS suggested that senior citizen inmates and those who have comorbidities be given preference for vaccination.The HC told Raghavan and senior counsel Mihir Desai for Peoples Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) to submit suggestions on ways to decongest jails and reduce the risk of Covid-19 among inmates by June 2.Public prosecutor Deepak Thakare submitted a detailed affidavit by Chhering Dorje, special inspector general of police (prisons) in Byculla, on compliance of the HC’s May 12 order to undertake vaccination of inmates without insisting on ID cards, as per the latest Centre’s standard operating procedure (SOP). He said that directions were issued to all prison superintendents not to release any inmate on emergency parole or bail without his/her consent. Thakare conveyed the state government’s efforts at trying to fill in 63 of the 175 vacant posts for medical officers and staff across prisons. As many as 12 doctor posts are vacant, 13 for compounders and 30 for nurses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/state-should-try-to-give-part-of-2l-vax-for-prisoners-bombay-hc/articleshow/82813902.cms||---

Corporation has taken the decision a bit late. However, officials are confident of completing the work in a couple of days. An official from the revenue department said that they have visited some of the grounds and surveyed the facilities. Sanitation, lighting arrangements, drinking water and hand washing facilities need to be created at the makeshift markets.“We shifted markets to roadside places, grounds of schools and colleges last year. The wholesale market was shifted to Amma Thidal at Ring Road. It helped create a safe environment for customers and retailers,” he said.Although markets in the city are not as crowded as last year, crowds might start to throng them if the lockdown is extended for a few more days. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-corpn-in-the-process-of-decentralising-crowded-markets/articleshow/82813882.cms||V Devanathan

Failure to comply will result in stringent legal against the pharmacies, Tirunelveli district collector V Vishnu warned.“The first interface for any average citizen is not the government primary health centre but the local pharmacy shop or local doctor. They are not advising properly and treat it with tablets like any normal fever due to which the individual is not getting tested. The tablets supress the original Covid-19 symptoms while the lung is continuously infected,” he told TOI.The administration has also made it mandatory for private hospitals to subject all the patients approaching them with symptoms to be subjected to Covid-19 test on the first day for early detection. Action will be initiated against erring hospitals under sections of the Epidemic Diseases Act, they warned.Tirunelveli also launched an initiative to cover rural habitations and hotspots for screening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/pharmacies-told-not-to-sell-fever-tabs-over-the-counter/articleshow/82813900.cms||M K Ananth

Other constituent colleges of MKU have implemented the order, they said.Around 60 faculty working in the college who were recruited in 2019 based on UGC qualification guidelines, continue to receive their old salary of Rs 15,000. “As per the UGC guidelines, salary for a guest faculty is Rs 50,000. The state government has taken a decision to provide only Rs 15,000. The government has enhanced the amount to Rs 20,000 three months back and ordered the colleges to implement retrospectively from January 2020. We are yet to get the enhanced salary or arrears,” said a faculty member.There are more than 4,500 students studying in the college. The revenues generated by the college per year is anywhere between Rs 8 and Rs 10 crore.Another faculty said that there are no benefits like provident fund like regular staff. Recently, Balaji Kumar, a young guest faculty died. His family did not receive any monetary benefit after his death. The pandemic has exacerbated the worries of family members of the faculty.As per the resolution passed by the academic council, salary has to be provided for May. But it is not being given. Moreover, the college administration is refusing to provide them with identity cards.

Rajesh Bhatia, 55, a trader hailing from Pandav Nagar locality, was admitted to a city-based hospital on May 9 after testing positive for Covid-19. Later, he was shifted to a ventilator as his condition deteriorated. Bhatia’s family, however, alleged that the hospital had put the patient on a ventilator after his death in a bid to extort money. Besides, an amount of Rs 1.05 lakh was added to the medicines that they had purchased from a chemist outside the hospital, they alleged. The Meerut district administration, meanwhile, said the charges were being probed into. “Initially, they were not ready to hand over the body saying the patient was put on a ventilator. But, when we told them that we could not afford the hospital services and wanted to shift the patient elsewhere, the hospital told us that the patient had died. They asked us to get a body bag,” said the patient’s niece Swati Bhatia. Soon after the ordeal of the family was shared on social media, it merited the attention of Sanjeev Gupta, secretary, Inter-State Council Secretariat, Ministry of Home Affairs. “Additional CMO and SDM went to the hospital. They spoke to me after examining the bills. The cost of all medicines which were wrongly included in the bill has been removed and the issue has been resolved,” Gupta tweeted. Meanwhile, the district administration has launched a probe into the charges levelled by the family. “I have ordered an additional district magistrate and assistant chief medical officer to probe the matter and submit a report,” said Meerut district magistrate K Balaji.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/kin-claim-hosp-put-patient-on-ventilator-after-death-to-extort-money-home-ministry-official-intervenes/articleshow/82806745.cms||Piyush.Rai

While the recovery rate rose to 84 %, the case positivity rate increased to 35% as against 31% on Wednesday. The state currently has about 20,800 active cases. While there has been a dip in new cases since Saturday, health secretary Ravi Dhawan said that a wait of few more days is warranted to know if Goa has seen its peak. Goa Medical College (GMC) dean Dr S M Bandekar, said that there’s been a drop in admissions. Thursday saw 68 Covid patients admitted. Also, there were no patients either on the hospital floor or on trolleys, he said. The state’s Covid-19 toll meanwhile rose to 2,273, with 44 casualties recorded over the past 24 hours. Of these, 22 deaths were reported at GMC, 12 at the South Goa district hospital, five from private hospitals, one casualty each from the sub-district hospitals of Ponda and Chicalim and one death reported from the primary health centre, Chicalim. Three deceased had been vaccinated, with one even receiving both doses. Meanwhile, the state government has decided to implement a technology-based system to regularly track and follow-up on patients under home isolation. “We have selected an agency, Step One, that is providing this service in 11 other states,” Dhawan said. While the agency’s service is free, the government will incur the cost of call charges, which will be paid directly to BSNL, he said. The first call to the patient will be made through health services to obtain details, which will be entered in the portal. From the second to the tenth day, calls will go from the system and the patient will be questioned about five parameters to monitor their health status. If the response to any two questions is “yes” the patient will get a red flag, and a backend team of doctors will follow-up so there is timely intervention before their condition deteriorates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/states-recovery-rate-at-84-but-thursday-sees-44-deaths/articleshow/82813948.cms||---
---||Dehradun||With 1.25 lakh migrants returning to Uttarakhand, govt plans to restart CM Swarozgar Yojna||DEHRADUN: The Uttarakhand government had launched CM Swarozgar Yojna during last year’s lockdown with an aim to encourage migrants to stay back in Uttarakhand by helping them start their own ventures. Close to 10,000 people had applied under the scheme. With 1.25 lakh migrants back in Uttarakhand in the last two months, officials said that the government plans to invite fresh applications under the scheme. According to the official data provided by the industries department, last year a total of 9,310 applications – with the maximum of 1, 273 from Uttarkashi and 911 from Pauri – were received for registration under the CM Swarozgar Yojna. Of these, the loans have been approved for 3,904 projects. While the bank has rejected 3,265 applications, 168 applications are still under process. Of the 3,904 projects approved by the banks, 3,193 applicants have deposited their share of money and the banks have released the loans for 3,186 people. The maximum projects of 461 have been approved for the district of Uttarkashi followed by 374 approvals by banks in Pauri districts of the Garhwal region. Industries director Sudhir Nautiyal told TOI, “The project met with a positive response in 2020. Migrants who had returned showed interest in starting their works in Uttarakhand itself and as a result close to 10,000 applications were received.” He pointed out that with a high number of people returning to Uttarakhand, the department was planning to invite fresh applications. “At present, the focus of the government is on saving lives and fighting Covid – especially in the hills. Once things settle down properly, we will invite applications to help people start their own work,” added Nautiyal. Former CM Trivendra Singh Rawat – who was behind the project in 2020 – said, “The scheme has received a positive response from people, who want to stay back and start their own work. We are confident of a better response from migrants in future as well.” Any person who has returned during the lockdown is allowed to register under the scheme. Under the scheme, one can start a project up to Rs 10 lakh in the service sector and up to Rs 25 lakh in the construction sector. For projects above Rs 25 lakh, the state government would provide the relief through MSME policy. A subsidy ranging from 15% to 25% – in accordance to the project cost – is given to the applicants. The maximum applications were received for homestays, agri-related projects, processing units and setting up private works.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/with-1-25l-migrants-returning-to-ukhand-govt-plans-to-restart-cm-swarozgar-yojna/articleshow/82809351.cms||Kautilya Singh

---||Delhi||Huts submerged, residents blame Central Vista debris||New Delhi: Shanties and huts in Chilla Khadar near Mayur Vihar Phase I in east Delhi got flooded after Wednesday’s downpour, with residents alleging that it is caused by the dumping of excavated soil from the Central Vista project around the settlement. The residents say they have been drawing Central Public Works Department’s (CPWD) attention since February as the surrounding areas have become several feet higher due to the dumping and rainwater is accumulating into their homes. Locals allege trucks from the Central Vista project have been coming at night, though CPWD has refuted the allegation. A senior CPWD official told TOI on Friday that no excavated soil had been dumped from the Central Vista site at any place in the last two months. “Excavation for the new Parliament Building was over in mid-March and excavated soil from Central Vista Avenue is kept at the site only for reuse in backfilling,” said the official. However, an NGO, Housing Land Rights Network, which has been working with the locals for the past few months, says it plans to file an additional application in Delhi High Court soon for their rehabilitation at the earliest. Dev Pal, a field researcher at the NGO, said while requests were made earlier to stop the dumping, it had continued, often at night. “Dumper trucks would bring the soil after 10pm and only after locals started raising complaints due to the noise being generated at night, did this activity reduced a bit,” said Pal. “At present, there is no way for the water to escape,” he added. Meena, a resident, said while water had started reducing, they had difficulty in sleeping these last two days. “As water levels kept increasing, we realised that there is no outlet left for the water to escape. All outlets have been blocked by earthern mounds and it may still take a few days for the water to dry up,” she pointed out. TOI had reported in March how soil and debris were being dumped in the area, but CPWD had denied all allegations. “On the public works department’s request, we have filled excavated earth in its Barapullah project site within clover leaves and the slip road area. This is far away from the floodplain,” it had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/huts-submerged-residents-blame-central-vista-debris/articleshow/82843722.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

After chairing the first cabinet meeting of his new government here on Thursday, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan told media that Ragesh will be his private secretary and former private secretary R Mohan will continue in the office of the chief minister as officer on special duty. A native of Kanhirode in Kannur, Ragesh who had grown in the party through the youth wings of the party, had in March this year completed his tenure in Rajya Sabha. CPM Kannur district secretary M V Jayarajan had earlier served as the private secretary to the chief minister. Jayarajan was then replaced by R Mohan, a former civil servant, when he was appointed as the district secretary of the CPM. The first cabinet meeting of the newly sworn in LDF cabinet led by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan also appointed senior high court lawyer K Gopalakrishna Kurup as the advocate general of the state. The cabinet also appointed senior advocate T A Shaji as the director general of prosecutions and V K Ramachandran as the vice-chairman of the state planning board. CPM state committee member Puthalath Dinesan will continue to hold the post of the political secretary to the chief minister. Hailing from Kottayam district, Gopalakrishna Kurup had obtained law degree and enrolled as a lawyer in 1976. He began practising at the Kerala High Court in 1984 under advocate N Raghava Kurup, who was his uncle and an MLA. He had served as the state prosecutor from 1999 to 2001. In 2005, he was designated as a senior advocate by the high court. Senior advocate TA Shaji had graduated from Ernakulam Law College and had been practising as a lawyer at the Kerala High Court since 1986.

---||Mumbai||HC ‘aghast’ at BMC stand of waiting for doorstep vaccination nod||MUMBAI: Expressing disappointment at the BMC’s stand on not introducing doorstep vaccination unless the Centre permits it, the Bombay high court bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni said: “We are aghast…we are very disappointed by your stand.’’ Civic counsel Anil Sakhare said the BMC has issued a global expression of interest for "procurement of 1 crore vaccines'' on May 11 and the affidavit says that once shortage ends, it will abide by the court orders. The bench questioned why the BMC was being “selective’’ in administering vaccines. The HC was hearing a PIL by advocates Dhruti Kapadia and Kunal Tiwari on doorstep jabs for the elderly, bedridden or disabled and helplines to assist them and had on Wednesday said that if the BMC was willing to start door-to-door for the elderly and bedridden people, it would permit it. On May 15, the Centre-appointed expert panel had proposed transporting the elderly to special jab sessions. But the Centre’s submission was that adverse event following immunization (AEFI) was a concern and the protocol required a 30-minute wait period post-jab. Petitioner Kapadia said that Berhampur had successfully launched door-to-door vaccination for senior citizens and disabled on May 17, but additional solicitor general Anil Singh said it was stopped now. The HC said it appears to not have been stopped due to AEFI instances. In fact, when Kapadia read out a minister’s response on the floor of the Parliament that the percentage of AEFI was just 0.2 with 7,580 cases for vaccinations till January 31, 2021, the bench told the ASG, “This is what your minister is saying and you are using AEFI not to start door-to door vaccination. Your minister’s statement has entirely demolished this reason.’’ The kinds of adverse events were fever, pain, rash or headache and dizziness, noted the HC, and deaths were 12 or 0.0003%. The court’s concern was that no person, howsoever frail and senior, be left out of the vaccination process. It reiterated what it said in April of not leaving old disabled people with the choice of “devil and deep sea’’. “They will either die of Covid or comorbidity…’’ The HC wanted to know if there was any scientific data on complications post-jab and the extent. “If the UK can go door to door, where the vaccination is the same as Covishield, then why not here?’’ asked Justice Kulkarni.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-aghast-at-bmc-stand-of-waiting-for-doorstep-vax-nod/articleshow/82813941.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Cov shadow: Dip in online presence of students in college classes||Kolkata: Professors from many city colleges have informed their principals about a dip in online attendance with several students either suffering from Covid-19 themselves or taking care of their family members down with the disease. The pandemic situation has impacted the mental health of some students who often request their teacher to excuse them as they find it difficult to focus on their studies. Principals and professors are speaking to these students and counselling them with an assurance for help. In many cases, online classes have stopped as some professors are also down with the disease or recuperating from it. “Many of my students are going through a very difficult phase. Either they are down with the virus or someone else in the family is infected with it. They are the primary caregivers and some of them are unable to attend classes while others are logging in but finding it difficult to focus amidst such gloom and uncertainty,” said Sujay Ghosh, a professor of zoology, Ballygunge Science College. There have been instances when students had requested their professors to allow them to take a leave from online classes because they were too stressed with the news of people suffering from Covid-19 in their extended families. Colleges have been shut from March 2020 due to the pandemic and classes are being held online. After some initial hiccups, both the students and professors adapted to the medium. Even the odd and even semester examinations were conducted online. With a spike in Covid cases during the second wave in the past few weeks, which has triggered a scramble for hospital beds and oxygen, the student community has been affected with adverse effects in their minds. “The situation is taking a toll on the minds of the students. They cannot step out to meet friends. The news of people in the extended families, neighbourhood or in the friend circles getting infected and struggling is telling upon their mental health. Many students have broken down in the middle of the class and sought permission to log out. I have allowed them to do so and offered to speak to them over calls after the class,” said a professor of Jadavpur University. College principals have requested the teachers to look out for the students who might need a pep talk. Even principals have offered to speak to such students. “The atmosphere is of fear and uncertainty and it is natural for the students to be affected. We regularly speak to our children and tell them to approach us if anything is bothering them,” said Christine Coutinho, principal of Loreto College.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cov-shadow-dip-in-online-presence-of-students-in-college-classes/articleshow/82811664.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: With scarcity, fungus experts suggest alternative drug||AHMEDABAD: The severe scarcity of Amphotericin B injections, the drug of first choice, and the unavailability of isavuconazole and posaconazole, alternative drug for treatment of mucormycosis (MM) which is also known as ‘black fungus’ and is currently rampant in Covid-19 patients, has gripped the state and country. The unprecedented shortage has led to hospitals, doctors and patients’ kin hitting the panic button. In such a scenario, top infectious diseases specialists of the country under the aegis of Fungal Infection Study Forum (FISF) have advised the use of alternative anti-fungal drugs that can be used for MM when availability of Amphotericin, isavuconazole and posaconazole is limited. Dr Arunaloke Chakrabarti, chairman of FISF and president of the International Society for Human and Animal Mycology told TOI that they have recommended to the government the use of the anti-fungal drug itraconazole for treatment of mucormycosis patients when Amphotericin B is not available. It is to be used as the fourth drug of choice if other alternatives like isuvuconazole and posaconazole are also scarce or unavailable. “Mucormycosis in Covid patients has become a national concern — there are an estimated 10,000 patients across India. Their woes are compounded as the drug of first choice Amphotericin B has become very scarce. In such times, we have listed out treatment options using other drugs including isuvuconazole, posaconazole and now itraconazole,” said Dr Chakrabarti. Infectious diseases specialist and FISF co-chairman from Gujarat, Dr Atul Patel, said FISF has studied in-vitro drug susceptibility of mucormycosis to itraconazole, which is currently widely available in the market. “It was found to be effective in 90% of cases while the fungus does not respond in 10% of cases. When we have no option, FISF has recommended its use as the fourth drug of choice to give some medicinal benefits to mucormycosis patients till Amphotericin B availability issues are sorted out,” said Dr Patel. He added that the drug is simply not available in the private sector and other drugs like isuvuconazole and posaconazole are also very scarce.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/with-scarcity-fungus-experts-suggest-alternative-drug/articleshow/82813984.cms||Radha Sharma

It is the largest ever donation of oxygen concentrators made by a donor to the state. Sidhu, who is the CEO of American-based company Solar Diagnosis, came as a saviour for Hanumangarh district as he sent 335 oxygen concentrators to the district on the request of Sangaria MLA Gurdeep Singh. These concentrators were distributed to various CHCs and hospitals. ACMHO Dr Pawan Chimpa informed that out of the 335 concentrators, 100 were sent to the district hospital, 50 in Bhadra tehsil, 25 in Nohar, 25 in Rawatsar, 30 in Pilibanga, 20 in Tibbi, 40 in Sangaria and two CHCs of Hanumangarh, 5 each at Pakka Saharana and in Dholipal. He said 25 machines have been kept in reserve at the CMHO office. With the efforts of the district collector, the state government exempted 12 per cent GST on the machines. The gadgets reached Hanumangarh from Delhi last Tuesday with the help of area MLA and district collector. Sidhu’s mother and Dhaban sarpanch Simarjit Kaur said her son sent these oxygen concentrators with the hope that these will help save lives of people. Sidhu’s brother Ramandeep said when his elder brother saw the condition of people in Delhi, he decided to send 1,000 oxygen concentrators to India of which 335 were sent to Hanumangarh, 335 to Khalsa Aid and 330 Delhi International Service Committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/nri-hanumangarh-resident-donates-335-o2-concentrators/articleshow/82811657.cms||Joychen Joseph
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Post-Covid care missing as 2nd wave plays havoc||JAIPUR: During the first wave of Covid-19 till November 2020 when the virus infection was at its peak, Rajasthan was reporting around 2,500 cases daily. The state health department had made arrangements for post-Covid care centre for patients getting discharged. Here, they consulted qualified specialists for issues like heart ailments, lung problems, etc. However, this time around when daily infections are fluctuating between 16,000 and 18,000 post-Covid care has gone for a toss. Till November patients admitted in Covid care centres were getting discharged in 14 days. But now, to serve patients with severe to very severe symptoms, hospitals are discharging patients in seven days or even less. After being discharged the patients and their relatives must deal with many issues when they need doctors’ advice. This is clearly missing this time. TOI on Tuesday spoke to the authorities and recently recovered Covid-19 patients to know how things are going for them “I got discharged from a private hospital two days ago. My saturation was around 85 when I was admitted. Now I feel tired and have high pulse rate. I went to SMS hospital and found there was no post-Covid care centre. I need to consult a pulmonologist and a heart specialist. Also, I am told many hospitals are also not running their OPD due to fear of infection,” said Ramesh Singhal, a chartered accountant living in Polo Victory area in the city. Relatives of Covid survivors are jittery and are unable to find a single-window guidance. “Doctors while discharging told us that Remdesivir given to my father may elevate sugar level, but they did not tell us how to manage it during post-Covid care,” said Sulochana Singh, a native of Khatipura. When contacted, Siddharth Mahajan, secretary, medical and health, said, “Though our Covid care centres at various government hospitals and satellite hospitals are working, I will still look into the matter. If needed the order in which every hospital was asked to arrange for post-Covid care centres would be re-issued.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/with-surge-in-patients-care-for-those-recovered-from-covid-goes-for-a-toss/articleshow/82811629.cms||Ashish Mehta
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: ‘No merit in arguments over Shailaja’s exclusion, say Sitaram Yechury||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury here on Thursday said there was no merit in the arguments that K K Shailaja was excluded from the second Pinarayi government for any ulterior reasons. Speaking to reporters ahead of the new government’s swearing-in ceremony, Yechury said the decision to induct all new faces into the new cabinet was the outcome of a principled stand taken by the CPM in Kerala. Selection of candidates for ministerial berth is the prerogative of the respective state committees. “They are the matters within the domain of the respective state committees. And that is the party structure. So, we have taken a principled decision and that decision I think would be good for the long-term interest, not only for the CPM and LDF, but also for the state of Kerala,” he said. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had said that the CPM collectively took all decisions regarding the government formation. He also turned down the reports that the central leadership was upset over the decision to drop Shailaja from the cabinet, despite her sterling performance as health minister in the first Pinarayi government. CPM leaders claimed that the party decision to deny seats to all those had contested two elections consecutively and to drop all former ministers from the first Pinarayi government were taken to rejuvenate the party and nip the possibilities of certain leaders emerging as power centres. A similar drastic change in the CPM’s organizational positions is also on the anvil is what they claims.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/no-merit-in-arguments-over-shailajas-exclusion/articleshow/82809455.cms||---

The residents and shop owners had been demanding to open the grocery shops for at least two to three days a week to avoid crowds at the shops. However, the government has only extended the time by two hours for the convenience of the people. Dipa Uniyal, a resident of Race Course, said, “The extension of time will help us go out to the market and bring our weekly stock of groceries and other essentials. We hope that further relaxations will be made as the situation normalises.” A ration shop owner in Paltan bazaar said, “I am unsure how much this relaxation will help us as the crowd is not going to be less. The administration will have to think of an alternative plan if the curfew extends.” The shops will remain open from 7am to 12pm on Friday. Meanwhile, the Dehradun district administration has created 116 containment zones to contain the spread of the virus. Among these, nine zones are in the rural areas of the district. District officials claimed that the creation of micro-containment zones and putting restrictions on the movement of people have paid off in reducing the burden of Covid-19 infections in the district. The officials also added that creating containment zones in rural areas of Vikasnagar in villages — including Lakhanwala, Suddhowala, Thakurpur, Lakhanwala Newat, Buddi Moja, Chotuwala Badamwala, Sahaspur and Nawabgath Majra — have helped in bringing down the total number of positive cases. To prevent the locals in these containment zones from moving out, the health department, the police and the district administration arranges for the supply of essential commodities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/govts-grocery-shop-decision-a-relief-for-locals-shop-owners/articleshow/82809394.cms||Abhijeet Singh

The supply of vaccines to the state has also gone down drastically with just 2 lakh doses of vaccines coming in a single lot. “We have received just 2 lakh doses of vaccines on Thursday. The lots arrive at an interval of 2-3 days. Initially (when the vaccination drive started in the state), we even received 10-12 lakh doses of vaccines per day. The situation will improve by June if the companies increase their production of vaccines,” said a government official. “The single lot of vaccines that we receive gets over in one or two days,” he added. However, the state government is not considering door-to-door vaccination of citizens as of now. “As per the guidelines of the Centre, door-to-door vaccination is not permitted,” said the official. Another official said, “18 lakh doses of vaccines have been received in the month of May so far. We have made payments to the government of India and the companies for the procurement of more vaccines. The Centre decides the quota for the distribution of vaccines in the states. But we are also waiting for the vaccines to arrive.” Meanwhile, Thursday was the last day for submitting bids for global tender to procure vaccines from international manufacturers. The manufacturers of AstraZeneca (UK) and Sputnik V (Russia) vaccines had evinced interest to participate in the global tender process to sell their vaccines to Rajasthan. Action against14 shopsOn Thursday, the legal metrology department inspected 18 medical stores and 25 grocery stores during a campaign to prevent activities like blackmarketing and profiteering.

---||Jaipur||Squeezed for space, 6 young RTR tigers in relocation limbo||JAIPUR: A proposal to relocate six tigers from the congested Ranthambore Tiger Reserve (RTR-1) is hanging in limbo as senior forest officials have not yet decided on where to shift the big cats. Young tigers at RTR-1 can neither find territories within the reserve nor have a safe habitat to be relocated across the state. As tigers in the reserve are squeezed for territory due to high density, the chief conservator of forest (CCF) had put forward a proposal to relocate six of them. Three tigers and three tigresses, aged between 2.5 years and four years, were zeroed in for shifting and the proposal sent to the chief wildlife warden (CWLW). The list consisted of male tigers T-113, T-121 and T-123 and female tigers T-119, T-124 and T-126. But many believe the proposal will never see the light of the day as Rajasthan does not have a safe habitat to relocate these tigers. Speaking to TOI, chief wildlife warden Mohan Lal Meena said, “We have received the proposal to relocate tigers and it's under consideration. However, before shifting we have to critically examine various aspects, including habitat development, prey base augmentation and village relocation, to provide safe habitat for tigers in the new reserve.” According to a source, these young tigers are living on the periphery of the park due to severe space crunch. The problem has to be addressed urgently to prevent increasing human-tiger conflicts and deaths in territorial fights. “Last year, young tiger T-123 mauled a man to death in a village near Baler. Similarly, in Lahpur region, T-121 is facing pressure from three tigers T-96, T-120 and T-57. As they remain at risk, an action plan is the need of the hour.” Officials say there are 52 adult big cats (30 tigresses and 22 tigers) in RTR-1, the highest in its history. As per the estimates, 7-8 adult tigers are jostling for space in less than 100sqkm area. “Out of total 934sqkm area of RTR-1, only 700sqkm is used by tigers. As per a rough estimate, a male tiger requires an area of approximately 25sqkm and a female about 15sqkm. This shows how the big cats are cramped for space,” said an official. “In the past, the forest department failed to develop Kailadevi Wildlife Sanctuary and Ramgarh Vishdhari Wildlife Sanctuary, adjoining the forest areas of Ranthambore. This was the best possible solution. In the present scenario, these are regions where big cats can be relocated. Work should be initiated with immediate effect to develop Kailadevi till Dholpur and Ramgarh,” said a senior official. According to an official source, the proposal to declare Ramgarh as protected area has been long pending before the state government. Moreover, the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) is at loggerheads with the state forest department to shift tigers to Mukundra Hills Tiger Reserve (MHTR). “As inbreeding is suspected in Sariska, it will not be feasible to relocate all the big cats there in the reserve.” Dharmendra Khandal, a conservation biologist, said, "Conservation of forests is not an important priority for the state and central governments as it's an expensive affair. The forest department is helpless in improving the habitat due to the absence of funds. Serious efforts to develop other areas for tigers should be made and funds allocated for the purpose.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/squeezed-for-space-6-young-rtr-tigers-in-relocation-limbo/articleshow/82813981.cms||Ajay Singh

Three Congress legislators and one CPM minister from dalit community had previously handled the department. All of them had handled the portfolios regarding welfare of dalit communities along with devaswom for relatively brief periods. Congress man Vella Eacharan was the first dalit minister to hold devaswom ministry. Under C Achutha Menon, he served as devaswom minister between 1971 and 1977. Eacharan was elected to the assembly in 1970 from Trithala constituency and in 1977, from Wandoor. Along with devaswom, Eacharan was the minister for Harijan welfare and community development. He was also entrusted with colonisation and settlement portfolio. He was actively involved in Harijan upliftment and Bhoodan work. Eacharan had also served as a member of the first and second Lok Sabha, according to assembly records. During his tenure as devaswom minister, Eacharan introduced bills like The Guruvayoor Devaswom Bill, 1971 and The Koodalmanickam Devaswom Bill, 1971 and The Travancore–Cochin Hindu Relgious Institutions (Amendment) Bill, 1974. Another senior Congress leader and former executive member of KPCC K K Balakrishnan was also given devaswom portfolio along with Harijan welfare and irrigation in the AK Antony ministry during 1977-1978. M K Krishnan, was the first dalit communist leader to become devaswom minister in the E K Nayanar ministry from 1980 to 1981. He introduced The Madras Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (Third Amendment) Bill, 1980. Krishnan also handled the portfolio of Harijan welfare. Congress had another minister from dalit community who was the devaswom minister. Damodaran Kalassery served as the minister for Harijan welfare and community development in the P K Vasudevan Nair ministry from 1978 to 1979 and devaswom was his additional portfolio. Political historians and officials with the legislative assembly said that devaswom was such an insignificant portfolio that it was not usually tagged to the name of the ministers. It was only towards the middle 90s, that ministers publicly attached devaswom to their portfolio. There had also been an instance when chief minister K Karunakaran broke the stereotype and handled the portfolios for the welfare of SC/ST communities himself. Till then, legislators from the same community was given that post. When asked about the impropriety, Karunakaran is said to have remarked; there was no better person to represent their cause.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/5th-dalit-min-to-handle-devaswom/articleshow/82809485.cms||Aswin J Kumar

On April 1, NDMC had hiked the licensing fees of shops by 10%. The decision was severely criticised by shopkeepers then. Virender Singh Kadian, AAP MLA from Cantonment area and member of the council, said that the matter for waiving of 10% increase in licensing fee was raised in the meeting. “But no concrete decision was taken. The council members, however, looked convinced and we hope some decision would be taken soon,” he said. “We had high hopes that the CM would take some decision in regard to the issues highlighted for the benefit of traders. We are the worst sufferers because of the pandemic and no one is thinking about us. We are paying GST, income tax, property tax on time and despite this, the government/municipality is not ready to help us,” said Atul Bhargava, president of New Delhi Traders’ Association. In the meeting, approval was given for providing financial assistance to children of regular, contractual or daily wage workers. “Reimbursement of school fees up to the age of 21 years of children and other facilities will be provided to them,” said an NDMC official. It was also decided to regularise 4,000 contractual/RMR employees in three months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/licensing-fee-no-relief-for-traders/articleshow/82843739.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Kolkata||CESC stays on guard for cyclone||Kolkata: City power supplier has a bigger challenge on its hands than it had last May due to the Covid situation as it prepares for the cyclone, Yaas brewing over the Bay of Bengal. While CESC is required to ensure uninterrupted power supply to all major hospitals and critical establishments like drainage pumping stations, the list has expanded to include over 100 Covid facilities and nursing homes across the city, where patients are admitted. According to the utility spokesperson, all Covid facilities have been mapped and arrangements are underway to ensure alternative supply by way of DG sets, particularly in the locations, where there is no underground network. Around 20% of the CESC network catering to around a quarter of its 34 lakh consumer base is overhead and vulnerable to disruption during cyclones. These include the areas in south-east (Kasba, Santoshpur and Garia), south (areas along NSC Bose Road), south-west (Behala-Thakurpukur) and parts of north-east Kolkata (Lake Town-Bangur and the areas off VIP Road), Howrah and parts of Hooghly. Though there were disruptions in north, central and south Kolkata, where the CESC network is serviced by underground cables, they were far fewer in number when compared to the disruption in the localities serviced by overhead connection with some localities experiencing outages for almost a fortnight. Most of it had been caused by the uprooting of trees and snapping of heavy branches that fell on power lines, snapping them and causing poles to buckle under the weight. “We have repaired and restored the entire network that was damaged including more than 1,000 poles. They are sturdy on their own and should withstand cyclonic winds. But if trees fall on them, there will be disruption. We are coordinating with civic agencies and police to clear trees and branches as swiftly as possible so that power lines can be restored. We are aware that many patients are at home and a power outage will impact them as well,” said the spokesperson. Unlike last year when the Amphan had wrecked havoc right in the middle of an unprecedented lockdown, CESC is better prepared in terms of manpower with nearly twice the force this time. “We will station teams all over the city,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cesc-stays-on-guard-for-cyclone/articleshow/82811737.cms||Subhro Niyogi

Mishra, an English teacher, was posted at a government school in Kalyanwas in East district. Kejriwal said that the deceased continued to serve people till his last breath. He also promised a job to Mishra’s elder son and said that he would stand with the family always. “Sheoji Mishra was a very hardworking and dedicated teacher in a Delhi government school. He passed away after getting infected while being on Covid duty last year. I can understand the pain and grief of his family. While we cannot bring him back, I, on behalf of Delhi government, have provided him with the monetary support of Rs 1 crore,” the chief minister said. Mishra is survived by his wife and two sons. “The government will provide his elder son with a job. We will also stand beside them in any assistance that they shall need in the future,” Kejriwal announced. Mishra got infected on June 4, 2020 and was admitted to Safdarjung Hospital, where he died three days later. He was a resident of Delhi and joined the service in 1999. Delhi government had last year announced that it would provide Rs 1 crore financial assistance to all frontline workers who get infected with Covid while on duty and pass away. The government’s move motivated frontline workers like police personnel, healthcare workers, etc to work hard. Many frontline workers have been given the compensation amount by the government since the announcement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cm-gives-rs-1cr-to-kin-of-teacher-who-died-on-covid-19-duty/articleshow/82811837.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The cops nabbed the four persons after laying a trap based on a complaint filed by the drug inspector which said that information was received that a few persons were selling Amphotericin B injections without a permit to sell them. Moreover, they were charging Rs 10,000 per injection against the printed maximum price of Rs 314.86. Police arrested Pragnesh Patel, Vashisht Patel, Nirav Panchal and Smit Raval. One accused person, named Hardik, is yet to be arrested in this case. All the accused were booked for cheating a relative of a mucormycosis patient by hatching criminal conspiracy to gain financial benefit by taking undue advantage of the shortage of the medicine. They were also booked for violation of the Essential Commodities Act and the Disaster Management Act. According to the FIR, one Ramji Patel from Surat needed Amohtericin B injections for a relative who is suffering from the black fungus. Pragnesh Patel offered to sell him the injections for Rs 10,000 each. Ramji approached the drug inspector, who informed crime branch on Tuesday and a trap was laid by the department in the presence of a police party at Ankur Crossroads in Naranpura, where Pragnesh came to deliver eight injections. They were valued at around Rs 2,500, but he charged the complainant Rs 80,000. Pragensh was then duly nabbed by the cops. Upon inquiry about where he got the injections from, a chain of suppliers was unearthed. Three others – Vashist Patel, Panchal and Raval were arrested from their homes. Raval told the cops that he used to get the injections from Hardik, whose whereabouts were not known. Hardik sold the injections at Rs 4,000 apiece. According to the complaint, all eight injections have been seized and four have been sent for analysis under the provisions of law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/four-held-for-black-marketing-of-mucormycosis-drug/articleshow/82814033.cms||---

An office-bearer of All Rajasthan Intern Doctors’ Association said that they have been demanding from the state government to increase their stipend, but it has not resolved the issue. “In October last year a committee formed under the principal and controller SMS Medical College, which had accepted their demands of increasing their monthly stipend. But the decision has not been implemented till date,”said the office-bearer. A celebration erupted at the Sawai Man Singh Medical College on Monday, where the intern doctors have been protesting for the past five days, sitting on hunger strike. They called off the hunger strike, after a committee formed by the principal and controller SMS Medical College, accepted their demands of increasing their monthly stipend. In October last year, too, the intern doctors had protested and they had sat on hunger strike on October 15. Following which, a committee was formed by the SMS medical college and intern doctors called off the strike at that time. “The promise which was made with us in October has not been fulfilled. We are getting just more than Rs200 per day as stipend. In no other medical colleges of the country the intern doctors are getting this amount of stipend. Today we met senior officials of health department and medical education department but we got only verbal assurance,” said one of the agitating intern doctor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/intern-docs-to-go-on-strike-over-stipend/articleshow/82811769.cms||---
---||Delhi||North corpn orders survey to check dangerous structures||New Delhi: North Delhi Municipal Corporation on Friday ordered a survey of dangerous and unstable buildings in its areas in view of the pre-monsoon showers hitting Delhi. The survey has to be completed within a week. The corporation has several areas, such as Walled City, with old constructions that hadn’t been repaired in a long time. Incidents of building collapse were reported in these areas last year. In an order issued by the corporation commissioner, Sanjay Goel, the survey has been ordered in all zones to prevent collapse of any dangerous or unstable building due to the continuous downpour during past 24 hours and the forthcoming monsoon season. “The task has to be completed by the building department by May 28 and an action-taken report will be submitted to the commissioner’s office,” stated the order. The order also stated that appropriate arrangements should be made in time at all identified vulnerable points, roads/areas as informed by the traffic police and the places where waterlogging occurred during previous years. “Proper functioning of portable pump sets and pumping stations to prevent accumulation of water in situation of continuous downpour, round-the-clock functioning of zonal and central control rooms, and deputation of sufficient manpower with requisite tools for attending the complaints of waterlogging, falling of trees etc” have been specified as key points in the commissioner’s order. Regarding desilting of drains and connecting points under the public works department (PWD) and the irrigation and flood control (I&FC) department, north corporation mayor Jai Prakash has written to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. “After recent showers in Delhi, no major complaints of waterlogging were reported due to timely action. We are still working dedicatedly to complete desilting of all drains more than 4 feet deep but waterlogging can be avoided only when their connected PWD, DSIIDC and I&FC department drains are cleaned and silt is removed on time,” Jai Prakash said. Following requests from residents and officials, the mayor added, he had visited certain drains where work had still not started. “Things were a little laid-back due to Covid pandemic, but now we have started the desilting exercise diligently again.” The north, south and east municipal corporations claimed to have completed 40-50% desilting at 192, 269 and 221 drains, respectively, and have kept June 15 as the deadline to complete the work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/north-corpn-orders-survey-to-check-dangerous-structures/articleshow/82843771.cms||Vibha Sharma

The 50-bedded facility caters to patients with comorbid conditions and ensures that their condition remains stable. Health officer of Cansaulim PHC Dr Soccour Quadros said that in the past 11 days, since the step-up facility was set up, no Covid patient with comorbidities has died. “The hospital does not have ventilators and so we admit Covid-19 positive patients with comorbidities with normal oxygen levels,” he said. It has 17 oxygen cylinders and four oxygen concentrators. “We admit patients from nearby areas i.e. Cortalim constituency, but also those from other areas on call. Patients with diabetes, or fever for 6-7 days, who have tested positive, are admitted here. Sometimes patients are referred from other hospitals,” Quadros said. The Verna Industrial Estate, as part of its Corporate Social Responsibility, has helped the hospital with free supply of medicines. From May 10, since the hospital commenced operations as a step-up Covid Care Centre it has had 49 admissions in all. Of these, 25 have been discharged after recovery. Ten have been referred to other hospitals like ESI, Margao or Goa Medical College for further treatment. At present, as of Thursday, only 11 are undergoing treatment at the Cansaulim centre, including two children. Meanwhile, the newly constructed Cansaulim PHC also provides general OPD facilities to villagers. In the basement area, they carry out antigen and RT-PCR tests to detect Covid. The first and the second floors are dedicated to Covid-19 patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cansaulim-facility-helps-avert-deaths/articleshow/82814010.cms||Ruvina Khan

Jakhar’s statement comes at a time when a section of party MLAs, including Cabinet ministers, have been holding meetings to pressurise the chief minister into acting on the issues of sacrilege and police firing. Without naming anyone, Jakhar said that by giving “false figures” of party MLAs who are attending their meetings, some leaders were creating the illusion of leading a campaign which is a “figment of their own imagination.” On Tuesday, Congress Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa claimed that five ministers and seven MLAs met cabinet minister Charanjit Singh Channi to express support to him following the state women commission’s move to revive a case of harassment against him. He also said in an interview that party MLAs would decide their next course of action if there was no visible action in 45 days. Jakhar said, “At present, the biggest challenge before us is to save people from the wrath of Covid pandemic. Any attempt to divert attention from this core issue cannot be termed as public interest.” “After the decision of the High Court to inquire afresh into the sacrilege related issue, of course the people of Punjab as well as Congressmen were more than concerned regarding the case but the Punjab government and the Congress High Command were very serious about it and justice will be assured in the case. In such a challenging time, the behaviour of a few leaders trying to further their own agenda cannot be justified in any way,” he asserted. Jakhar advised all party leaders to focus on government efforts to check Covid and to observe former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi’s death anniversary on May 21 by doing service to prevent the spread of Covid. BOX: ‘High command trying to resolve issue’ “If some senior leaders are perturbed, the party high command is working to sort out the issues in an amicable manner. The high command is seized of the issue and working to resolve it soon. At present, there should be no misunderstanding and attention should not be diverted from the battle against Covid as we are accountable to millions of people, they expect us to control the surge in pandemic effectively,” he said. BOX: ‘Tell high command the truth’ Former Cabinet minister Navjot Singh Sidhu continued to raise the issue of sacrilege. On Thursday, he tweeted, “In 2019, I began & ended my Election Campaign in Punjab seeking - Justice for Sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib Ji & punishing the culprits & the ONE shielding them... Now, Our MLAs & Party Workers must go to Delhi & speak the Truth of Punjab to our High Command, as I regularly do !”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/jakhar-cautions-against-opportunistic-leaders/articleshow/82813986.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Newborn fights back Telangana’s first mom-to-foetus Covid case||HYDERABAD: Telangana reported its first case of vertical transmission of coronavirus infection from mother to the foetus after a neonate recorded Covid antibodies score of 98 (Immunoglobulin-M (IgM) antibody 94.5 and IgG 2.6). The baby survived the post-Covid-19 complications after a 15-day battle at a children’s hospital in the city recently and is now recuperating at home. The newborn’s feat brought back smiles on the faces of parents of the little one and doctors. The baby was rushed to a city hospital with symptoms of multi-system inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C), which usually happens 4-6 weeks after coronavirus infection. While cases of newborns acquiring the infection have been reported, so far it was believed that the transmission antenatally (from mother to baby in the womb) was not happening. During the second wave, 3-4 cases have been reported from Surat, Pune and Mumbai, according to experts. “The baby had presented with seizures on Day 2 and went into coma. We had to ventilate the baby for four days and discharged last week after 15 days of treatment. The baby is now at home on oxygen support. We had run antibody tests thrice on the baby and each time it returned positive for the IM antibodies," Dr Satish Ghanta, neonatologist and paediatric intensivist, Little Stars Children’s Hospital, told TOI. "There is no way of denying that this is a case of vertical transmission and this is among the handful of cases reported in the country,” he added. The fact that antibodies were detected on Day 2 indicates that the baby was infected while in the womb and had post Covid complications immediately after birth. Apart from this proven case of vertical transmission, a few other ‘clinical’ cases are there but aren’t proven ones. In one case, a 27-week premature baby was born with Covid fingers (purple to black coloured fingers) and had presented with all symptoms of MIS-C in children, while in the other a premature baby had intestinal perforation. These babies, however, did not have antibodies as premature babies do not have antibodies. “The transfer of antibodies happens from the mother to the foetus in the third trimester (32-34 weeks). While proving a vertical transmission is very difficult, we can only call it a vertical transmission if the IgM antibody is found to be positive,” Dr Dinesh Kumar Chirla, director intensive care services, Rainbow Children’s Hospital, who has seen over 74 cases of babies with Covid-19 and MIS-C, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/baby-cheer-newborn-fights-back-ts-1st-mom-to-foetus-covid-case/articleshow/82814843.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Kochi||A seven-step path to better governance||The second Pinarayi Vijayan government takes oath with an unprecedented mandate. It has a chance to rewrite the history of Kerala like no other government in the past 50 years. Here is my humble advice for the newly-elected CM. 1. Minimise interference: Kerala has been immensely successful with a decentralized, participatory model of governance. But, from time to time, bureaucratic bungling, in the form of interference in pushing the rule of the ruler ahead of rule of law, has caused much misery. 2. Make health, education, and wealth creation key governance issues: Kerala has the potential to be the number one state in India in all three parameters. Although it has done exceedingly well on wealth and wellness, it lags behind its potential in education and entrepreneurship. 3. Do not make great ideas a prisoner of ideology: Despite his ideological underpinning, Vijayan’s government has made remarkable progress in investing in techno-commercial enterprises that has helped raise the quality of lives of its people. One hopes that he will continue to embrace and act on good ideas irrespective of their origin. 4. Kerala for All: Kerala cities will need to become more cosmopolitan and multilingual to compete in the changing world. This government should encourage professionals from different parts of the world to work and live here. 5. Strike a balance between stability and change: Governance is not the same as a government. Government is a blunt instrument designed to enforce the will of the many over the few. All living systems have this tension between being conservative and progressive. By swearing in a young cabinet, the government has taken the first progressive step. The young leaders should be allowed to implement some of their change ideas. 6. Start CM’s research fellowships: The one-year fellowship programme follows a ‘field research and forum’ approach, wherein, researchers spend six weeks in the field in their respective districts, following which they gather together at IIM campus in Kochi, Kozhikode to collate their findings, brainstorm solutions and prepare their presentations to the CM. Their work is further structured into three essential workstreams — Modules, Capsules and Pilots, each designed or facilitated by IIM and other academic institutions. 7. Open and share data transparently for good governance: The story of governance, at least in the past few hundred years, is also that of a move towards democratization and transparency. Data in general, but government-produced data in particular is and should be on a path towards democratization. This means that data should be open. Open data from government-sponsored research projects can lead to advancements in healthcare or even in entrepreneurial activities.

The doctor, who performed the surgery, said luckily his eyesight has been saved as the infection did not reach up to there. However, a 55-year-old Alwar resident who tested negative five days ago and was on a high dose of steroids developed pain in the left side of his face four days ago. He was a diabetic and had no other ailments. When government doctors examined him, he was found suffering from mucormycosis. The doctors at a government hospital in Jaipur found he had lost his vision and conducted his surgery to save his life. “Left side endoscopic surgical debridement with modified denker’s approach and orbital decompression was done,” said Dr SS Ranawat, superintendent, Jaipuria Hospital. Like him, there are patients in different hospitals with such problems of mucormycosis.

It also involves optic nerve in some cases. When the optic nerve is involved due to mucormycosis, it becomes difficult to save eyesight as we need to conduct orbital exenteration,” said Dr Tarun Ojha, professor and head ofthe department (ENT) at a private medical university. Dr Ojha operated upon 12 patients in the last few days, in which he had to conduct orbital exenteration. Even after three weeks of recovery from Covid, patients are coming to Dr Ojha with mucormycosis. A 42-year-old man from Alwar, who was tested positive on April 4 and recovered on April 24, reached hospital on May 15 with orbital swelling. Doctors conducted left endoscopic medical maxillectomy by Denkers approach with bilateral sinus debridement of maxillary, ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses with left orbital exenteration. A 52-year-old factory worker from Jagatpura in Jaipur, who tested positive on April 20 and recovered on May 18, complained of nose bleed and facial heaviness. Doctors diagnosed him with mucormycosis. On Thursday, doctors performed right middle maxillectomy with bilateral sinus debridement with posterior septectomy. SMS Medical College has appealed to doctors not to use steroids for treatment of Covid indiscriminately as it may cause mucormycosis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/even-after-three-weeks-of-recovery-from-covid-patients-suffering-from-mucormycosis/articleshow/82811773.cms||Syed Intishab Ali

The department has also clarified that individuals having lab test proven Covid illness should defer vaccination by three months after recovery. A video conference of the health department was held on Thursday in which officials discussed the issue of wastage of the vaccine. Officials said individuals who have received the 1st dose and contracted the infection should defer the second dose by three months from the date of recovery. Persons with any other serious general illness requiring hospitalization for ICU care, must wait 4-8 weeks before getting the Covid-19 vaccine. “The issue of wastage of vaccine doses was discussed at the meeting. Some of the districts claimed that the wastage shown in CoWin App was not accurate as there is some error in feeding the figures. Such districts have been asked to conduct error correction,” reproduction and child health (director) Dr Laxman Singh Ola said. The wastage rate shown in Churu district is 26% and state’s average wastage of vaccines stood at 5%. Besides, Jaipur’s vaccine wastage shown is 15% in the CoWin app. For vaccination of 18 to 44 years age group, wastage is negligible. The health department officials said the companies give one dose extra in a vial of 10 doses, keeping in mind that one can go waste while administering it to beneficiaries. But the health department is now making efforts to use the extra dose to prevent wastage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/staff-deployed-in-covid-vaccination-asked-to-prevent-wastage-of-doses/articleshow/82811800.cms||---

Water also accumulated at smart city project sites. The situation was more severe at ISBT where the water filled up potholes and open manholes. Sanjeev Tarun, a commuter at ISBT, said, “The civic authorities which include municipal corporation and public works department have ample time to repair roads and clean the drains during the curfew and make the city ready for monsoon. But the splash in the past 24 hours has exposed the preparedness.” Manisha Bachani, another commuter at Clock Tower, said, “Water can be seen overflowing even on the city's main streets. This is a reminder that the drains must be cleared before the monsoon season hits the state.” Officials from Dehradun Municipal Corporation said, “The drains have been cleaned some time ago before the arrival of monsoon.

---||Mumbai||Be bond between estranged mumbai, dad: HC to 2 kids||Mumbai: Be a bond between your parents, the Bombay high court said on Thursday while counselling two children of a city-based estranged couple. The girl and boy are 14 and 10 years old. A vacation bench of Justices Shahrukh Kathawalla and Justice Surendra Tavade heard a plea by the father that his wife had been depriving him of access to their children and that he had not met or spoken to them since March 2020. The judges asked that the wife and children join the virtual hearing. The wife said he used to talk to them on video call and in November 2020 they spent quality time at a mall with him and his sister. She said thereafter due to the pandemic, she did not let them meet him. He was angry and sent a divorce notice. She said he has not paid Rs 12 lakh arrears of Rs 50,000 maintenance ordered by the Family Court and she is dependent on her mother and brother. The judges asked the children why they had not been talking to their father. “Parents do fight. It is unfortunate. We should not stop talking to our parents. You should try to be a bond between them,’’ said Justice Kathawalla. The daughter said they were talking to him and even played online games with him. “Then how can he say such things?” she asked, crying. Justice Kathawalla said, “You should convey to him. We’ll also talk and convey your feelings to him. Do not close avenues forever. He is, after all, your father.” The judges explained that in matrimonial disputes, statements are made. “As we grow, we feel strongly about our mothers. Especially when she is wronged. At this time, please talk to him.” The children agreed to speak to their father. “Thank you. Nice to meet you,” the daughter said happily. The father’s advocate, Gayatri Gokhale, said he has a mining business which is hit due to the lockdown. “If he was staying with his wife and children, could he say ‘chalo hawa khao’?” asked Justice Kathawalla, adding that no estranged husband wants to pay for his wife and children. The judges said if the father wants love and affection from his children, he should make them feel secure by performing his duties as a father. “He cannot exercise his rights if he fails in his duty,” said Justice Kathawalla. In their order, the judges said both are “very good, matured and disciplined children” but very much disturbed, realising that their father wants to divorce their mother. Gokhale thanked the judges “for opening up the lines of communication’’ and on Friday will inform if he will clear the arrears and pay the maintenance regularly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/be-bond-between-estranged-mumbai-dad-hc-to-2-kids/articleshow/82814038.cms||Rosy Sequeira

The decision comes close on the heels of the state government designating two hospitals as nodal centres for the treatment of the infection. In the notification order, the government asked all government and private health facilities to follow guidelines for screening, diagnosis and management of mucormycosis, as asked by the Centre and the Indian Council of Medical Research. Authorities also made it mandatory for all government and private health facilities to report all suspected and confirmed cases to the state health department, the order from the director of health services, said. ENT Hospital running at full capacity:Medical superintendents of all government and private hospitals have been directed to ensure strict compliance and send daily reports to the health department. The number of mucormycosis cases continues to surge in the state and the government-run ENT Hospital at Koti is running at full capacity now. A three-member expert committee has been formed to decide the treatment protocol and injections for black fungus patients. Private hospitals treating such patients have been asked to apply to the committee and based on their permission, they can get injections from private stockists. The health department is prescribing two injections for treatment of black fungus, followed by medicine for some more time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/state-declares-black-fungus-as-epidemic/articleshow/82814878.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat declares mucormycosis an epidemic||AHMEDABAD: After over 1,500 cases of mucormycosis, also identified as black fugus, across the state, Gujarat on Thursday announced the fungal infection – having high fatality rate – as an epidemic under the provision of Epidemic Diseases Act, 1857. According to government sources, the state has witness over 250 deaths so far directly attributed to the fungal infection. The decision was taken by the Covid core committee chaired by CM Vijay Rupani on Thursday evening. Earlier on Thursday, the Union health ministry had asked the states to cover mucormycosis under the Epidemic Diseases Act in a letter. Several other states such as Rajasthan and Telangana had already declared it an epidemic. What does the inclusion change for the treatment? A senior state health department official told TOI that the treatment protocol must be followed from top to bottom. “The screening, diagnosis, treatment and overall management of the fungal infection would now be carried out according to the guidelines set by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR),” said the official. “Moreover, like Covid-19, the data on the suspected and confirmed patients would be sent to the Union ministry daily.” Experts said that after Covid-19, the fungal infection has emerged as a major health threat primarily for those who got recovered from the viral infection. “It enters the sinuses or oral cavity through any opening in the skin and starts proliferating rapidly. Earlier seen rarely among diabetic patients, this time the numbers have hit the roof due to the lowered immunity of Covid patients, coupled with aggravated sugar levels,” said Dr Devang Gupta, a city-based ENT surgeon. The letter by the Union health ministry mentioned that the treatment needs a multi-disciplinary approach that includes specialists from eye, ENT, general surgery, neurology and maxillofacial surgeons. “Apart from diabetes and high use of steroids, the oral and nasal hygiene of Covid-19 patients remained an issue, primarily when the number of patients was very high in the past few days. We also urge the citizens not to take steroids without prescription for Covid-19 treatment,” said Dr Neeraj Suri, an ENT surgeon with Gandhinagar Civil Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-declares-mucormycosis-an-epidemic/articleshow/82814028.cms||---
---||Udaipur||Rajasthan: Woman plots acid attack on colleague for not marrying her||UDAIPUR: Hiran Magri police on Thursday arrested three people, including a woman, for throwing acid on a person for turning down the marriage proposal of the woman. Naija Hussain, the woman, allegedly gave Rs 40,000 to her boss to have acid thrown at her colleague by a third party. The boss chose his younger brother to do it, police said. Abhishek Singh, the victim, son of one Samundar Singh Rathore and a resident of Sector 3 in the city, is an engineer at a cement factory at Dabok and Naija is his colleague. On May 7, he informed police that an unidentified man threw acid on his back when he was waiting for his boss, Roshan Singh Rathore, to pick him up for work at Sevashram bridge. Later, police arrested the woman, Roshan Singh, and his brother Vikram for the crime. Ram Sumer, SHO of Hiran Magri, said Abhishek and the accused woman, Naija Hussain, a resident of Silawatwadi in Udaipur, were engineers and Roshan their boss at the cement factory at Dabok. Abhishek and the woman were close friends. However, his family fixed his marriage with some other girl and the wedding was due on May 23. Abhishek called off his relationship with Naija when she exerted pressure on him for marriage, police said. “This infuriated the woman who wanted to teach Abhishek a lesson. She befriended Roshan and became close to him, so that she could take revenge. Abhishek used to go to work by bus, but since the lockdown, Roshan used to pick him at Sevashram bridge and they went together. Taking advantage of the situation, she convinced Roshan to get acid thrown on Abhishek's body so that he could be hurt but not killed,” the SHO said. Roshan took his brother Vikram into confidence and assigned him to carry out the attack, said police. “Roshan provided the acid from his factory and Vikram threw it on Abhishek's back and fled from the spot,” the SHO said. Abhishek returned home and when Roshan called to ask why he wasn't at the bridge, he told about the attack. Roshan expressed sympathy and picked him up from home and took him to a hospital for treatment. The CCTV footage from the crime spot showed up Vikram in the area. When he was picked up for questioning, he spilled the beans, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/udaipur/woman-plots-acid-attack-on-colleague-for-not-marrying-her/articleshow/82814001.cms||---
---||Delhi||Good heavens! Delhi sees cleanest air day||NEW DELHI: Delhiites woke up to clear blue skies on Thursday — reminiscent of what was seen during the novel coronavirus-induced lockdown last year. The visual treat was accompanied by Delhi’s cleanest air in 2021 as the air quality at most monitoring stations turned “good” for the first time this year. A day after the national capital received “very heavy” rainfall, the air quality index (AQI) dropped below 50 at several places during the first half of the day. While the overall AQI for the day was recorded at 58, which is classified as “satisfactory”, this was still the city’s lowest AQI so far this year. An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory” and 101 and 200 “moderate”. According to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)’s Sameer application, at least seven stations in the capital were in the “good” category, even until the evening, with Najafgarh recording an AQI of as low as 30 at 7pm. Last year, Delhi had recorded five “good” air days with four of these coming in the month of August following spells of rain. A good air day was also recorded in March last year as traffic volume went down and industries were shut down due to the nation-wide lockdown. Data according to the CPCB’s central control room showed Delhi-NCR’s 24-hour average PM 2.5 concentration dropped to as low as 23 micrograms per cubic metre at noon on Thursday, while the average PM10 concentration was recorded at 35.5 micrograms per cubic metre. The standards for PM 2.5 and PM 10 in India are 60 and 100 micrograms per cubic metre, respectively. System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) — a body under the Union ministry of earth sciences — forecasts the air quality to remain in a similar range in the next 24 hours. “The overall Delhi air quality has improved to the ‘good’ category as forecast. Widespread rainfall helped to remove suspended particles through the washout process. Surface winds are currently north-westerly and high and the overall AQI is forecast to stay between the ‘good’ and the lower end of the ‘satisfactory’ category for Friday,” SAFAR stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/good-heavens-delhi-sees-cleanest-air-day/articleshow/82809537.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: May rain record broken, by twice as much||NEW DELHI: Delhi received light to moderate intensity rain, caused under the residual impact of Cyclone Tauktae, on Friday morning. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said thunderstorm with light to moderate intensity rain and gusty winds with speed of 30-60 kmph to occur in parts of the city on Friday. It rained cats and dogs...Who would have thought the streets of Delhi would be waterlogged and air conditioners would be turned off in the middle of May! But India Meteorological Department’s orange alert for moderate or heavy rains in Delhi on Wednesday proved correct. Cyclone Tauktae’s influence continued through the night to Thursday’s morning hours, and the 24 hours between 8.30am on Wednesday and 8.30am on Thursday, the weather laboratory at Safdarjung, Delhi’s base station, recorded 119.3mm of rainfall — an all-time record for the highest precipitation in a single day in the month of May. In fact, the rainfall recorded was almost double the earlier high of 60mm on May 24, 1976. IMD classifies rainfall above 64.5mm in a single day as ‘heavy’ rainfall and above 115.6mm as ‘very heavy’, so Thursday’s spell was very heavy. Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at IMD and head of the Regional Weather Forecasting Centre, Delhi, explained that two factors played a key role in this unusual weather event, the result of Tauktae’s remnants interacting with a fresh western disturbance over the region. “This interaction led to more rainfall than was expected,” said Srivastava. “The fact that this trough was moving quite slowly led to continuous rain in the region and its movement progressed in the evening, bringing more rain after 5.30pm.” While the Safdarjung station recorded a precipitation of 119.3mm, the station at Lodhi Road logged even higher rainfall in the same window at 124.4mm. Ayanagar and Palam stations received 97.9mm and 63.8mm of rainfall, respectively. The highest monthly rainfall for May was noted in 2008, when Delhi received 165mm of rainfall. Wednesday’s downpour alone accounts for nearly two-thirds of that. So far this month, the city has received 123.6mm of rainfall, including Wednesday downpour, IMD stated. The unprecedented rains on Wednesday cooled Delhi’s summer heat dramatically. The maximum temperature was a mere 23.8 degrees Celsius that day, a whopping 16 degrees below the normal. On Thursday too, the capital’s temperature was comfortable, being, at 31.4 degrees Celsius, eight degrees below normal for this time of the year. Thursday’s minimum temperature too reflected the rain-soaked air, being 19.3 degrees Celsius, a full seven notches below normal. Met officials forecast, however, that the mercury would now start rising over the next 24 hours. The prediction is for the temperature to rise of 35 degrees Celsius on Friday and 38 degrees by Sunday.

---||Kochi||Kerala needs special industrial regions||To focus on a few areas, which could contribute to industrial development, the number one area is infrastructure. We should use road, rail, inland navigation, coastal shipping and airways, fully. K-Rail will take care of the goods and passenger transportation. Once inland navigation is completed within five years, the slow-moving, large-volume will move to that, decongesting roads. The movement of hazardous materials and bulk carriers could be shifted to coastal shipping. Secondly, regarding the ease of doing business (EoDB), we have a long way to go. What has been done in the past is, rightly, that we are trying to give approvals faster. But fundamentally, I have a difference of opinion, because I feel that many of these licences are not necessary. We just need to do three things: A) Remove unwanted approvals, licences, NOCs and restrictions after a review of all requirements of licensing and approvals. B) Procedure for giving these could be simplified. C) The process should be automated, bringing human interaction to a minimum. Singapore Government gives time limits for licences in hours, not days – four hours is the time needed for starting a new company there. One drawback I noticed in EoDB is that we are depending on in-house agencies to deliver these. We need the help of a professional external agency to maintain software and monitoring systems round the clock. So, EoDB should be done in PPP mode with one of the best professional consultants coming on board. How was China able to transform itself so quickly, while they had far greater bureaucracy compared to our country? The architect of economic reforms in China, Deng Xiaoping, did something great. He created huge special economic zones (SEZ), which for all practical purposes were almost independent. The SEZs in India have failed, so we have to move to the next level, Special Industrial Region (SIR). Kerala could start with one and replicate later. We have already committed to Kochi-Coimbatore Industrial Corridor and requested the Centre to extend it to Thiruvananthapuram. Once we do that, we need to fully integrate transportation, communication, manufacturing, IT, tourism, and economic services. Over a period, the whole region will become an integrated SIR. We need to create a similar one from Kochi to Kasaragod also. All this can’t be done with the funds available locally. We need to really tap the international financial pool, technical pool, and also talent pool. The new legislation should take care of that. SIR is not just about factories or industries, it is about transforming the quality of life in cities. We should not hesitate in dreaming big and then doing bigger things. People expect this government to do that. (The writer is former additional chief secretary [Industries and IT].

Admitted at the dental college on Civil Hospital campus, Bhavsar’s condition is deteriorating. “The hospital arranged for as many injections as they could, after which we were told to see if we could get the required number of injections. We are still struggling to get them,” said her brother on Thursday.As cases of mucormycosis grew exponentially, patients’ relatives are running from pillar to post to arrange for the injections and medicines such as posaconazole. “We are waiting for a new batch to come to the market. We were told that the tablets, to be taken after the injections are over, will be available only after May 23,” said Snehal Shah, a resident of Satellite, whose mother-in-law is admitted with the condition.“We have tried almost every medical store to secure 14 injections, which we could manage only after several attempts. But it came at a price – we paid almost double the retail price to get it. We had no other way.

Some of them have started taking orders on phone for home delivery in the neighbourhood so that they can at least pay the salaries of their employees. A webinar was organised on Thursday by Mishti Udyog, an association of sweet sellers in the city to discuss how to survive the present situation without folding up totally. It was pointed out at the webinar that even big sweet shops like KC Das have closed down because sales have almost been nil between 10am and 5pm. “We have a huge infrastructure and have been unable to reach even break even. So, we have temporarily shut down,” said Dhiman Das, owner of the brand and president of Mishti Udyog. Several shops at Mishti Hub in Newtown have also shut like the one owned by Mithai. “We have decided to request the chief minister to look into the matter so that the 7am to 10am timing can be given,” said the owner, Nilajan Ghosh. In a day 6 million tonnes of milk is used by sweet makers in Bengal. With so many shops shutting down, a huge surplus will soon add to the existing problems as it was highlighted at the webinar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/many-sweet-shops-down-shutters-for-unfit-timing/articleshow/82811912.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

Justice Rekha Palli also rapped the hospital for leaving the deceased unattended after he was taken to an isolation ward as he was suspected of being infected with Covid-19. “You (hospital) need to explain what happened, how did he get away? Just because it is a government hospital, you cannot leave people unattended. Why are you taking people in, if you are allowing them to go anywhere they want?  The court directed the medical superintendent of the hospital to personally file an affidavit giving the exact time when the man, Tanvir Singh, was taken to the isolation ward, whether he was accompanied by any staff, whether any staff was present in the ward and if there were any other patients there. It directed that the report be filed in three weeks by police and listed the matter for hearing on July 7. pti||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-rap-for-cops-hospital-over-suicide/articleshow/82843851.cms||---
---||Delhi||After road caves in at Delhi Metro site, transport minister Kailash Gahlo orders probe||NEW DELHI: A large portion of a road near the under-construction Dhansa Stand station of Delhi Metro’s Dwarka-Najafgarh Grey Line caved in on Wednesday night during heavy rain, damaging some nearby buildings. No casualties have been reported so far. Transport minister Kailash Gahlot visited the area near the station and Khaira Crossing on Thursday morning, accompanied by Delhi Metro Rail Corporation’s (DMRC) managing director Mangu Singh and senior officials of Delhi government. A statement from the minister’s office mentioned that a truck also fell in the huge pit caused due to the cave-in. Gahlot has ordered an inquiry into the incident and said strict action would be taken against negligent officials. He has directed transport department officials to find reasons for repeated incidents and take necessary steps to prevent such incidents. The statement said DMRC had already started filling up the caved-in portions of the road and marshals deployed at the site had been instructed to keep constant vigil till the restoration work was completed. Officials of the public works department (PWD) have been directed to conduct a survey for assessing the nature and extent of the damage to the nearby properties so that the adequate compensation can be paid to the affected persons by DMRC, the government said. The statement added that DMRC had assured to restore the damaged pipelines or drains of Delhi Jal Board and PWD by Sunday so that water supply could be resumed to the affected colonies. Gahlot also directed Singh to expedite work on the Dhansa Stand Metro station so that it could be made operational within one month of lifting of the Covid-19 lockdown measures. The 5.4km-long Grey Line is being extended to the Dhansa bus stand on the Delhi-Haryana border but the work has been hit by the pandemic. DMRC spokesperson Anuj Dayal said that the portion of the road had caved in after a drain burst in the area due to excess flow of continuous rain water, causing partial damage to an adjacent building. He said senior DMRC officials were at the site to supervise the repair work. “Delhi Metro Rail Corporation is now filling under the road with additional concrete to avoid recurrence of this problem in the future,” Dayal added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/after-road-caves-in-at-delhi-metro-site-gahlot-orders-probe/articleshow/82809555.cms||---

However, in the last 10 days, the number of daily cases has fallen by over 65%. The number of active cases has fallen below the 25,000-mark after a long time. Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) data shows that on May 1, the city reported 4,980 new cases. The number fell by 35% and was 3,194 on May 10. With the number of daily new cases falling by 65%, and with the number of patients discharged from hospitals or from home isolation also increasing considerably, the number of active cases in the city, which was around 55,000 on May 10 has dropped by more than 50% to 24,800 as of 11am on May 20. There were 139 Covid deaths in the city in the last ten days, rising to 3,169 on May 20 against 3,030 on May 10. Officials in the corporation said with active surveillance and increased testing, the AMC has been able to reduce cases. AMC officials said that in the last fortnight the number of tests conducted at private laboratories has also gone down considerably and when drive-through RT-PCR testing was introduced, one could find long queues, but these days the number of persons seeking tests has also gone down. Officials said that there has been no change in the pattern of spread and western Ahmedabad continues to account for 60% of Covid cases. The majority of the cases in the east are being reported from the South Zone of the city from areas such as Maninagar, Danilimda, Behrampura, Vatva and Isanpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/number-of-active-covid-cases-in-city-falls-below-25k-mark/articleshow/82814023.cms||Himanshu Kaushik
---||Delhi||Desilting not over, Delhi gets monsoon preview||New Delhi: A day-long incessant spell of rain on Wednesday led to waterlogging, road cave-in and partial building collapses across the city, bringing the spotlight back on the lack of preparedness for the monsoon, which is just a month away. NEW DELHI The desilting projects are nowhere close to the targets and, with less than 50% of the work being done, the public works department, irrigation and flood department and the municipal corporations, which oversee the drainage network of the national capital, now need to work on a war footing. The official monsoon reports of the three corporations show that complaints of large-scale waterlogging were received from 27 colonies while cases of tree felling were reported from 29 spots across the city. The incessant rain also further weakened dangerous portions of old buildings and led to partial collapse at seven locations. The partial building collapses were reported from Gali Godiwar Kalan in Walled City, Manohar Bagh in Karol Bagh and Rani Bagh and Pratap Bagh in the Keshavpuram zone. The East Delhi region witnessed such damages in J Block of East Vinod Nagar, Jwala Nagar and New Modern Shahdara Colony. The maximum cases of tree felling were witnessed in the South zone where nine trees were damaged, followed by the Central zone where six such complaints were addressed by the horticulture department. While larger drains in the city fall under PWD and the flood department, 665 drains with width less than 4ft are managed by the corporations. Only 40-50% of the desilting targets have been met. While many inner colony and low-lying areas faced waterlogging on Wednesday, the official reports cite complaints from 27 areas, including Priyadarshini Vihar, ITI Hari Nagar, Mayapuri Chowk-Raja Garden stretch, Tagore Garden Metro station and Minakshi Garden-Tilak Nagar. South Delhi areas like Sarvpriya Vihar, B Block of Malviya Nagar and Paryavaran Complex also witnessed larges-cale waterlogging. A cave-in was reported near Najafgarh while, like every year, Pul Prahaladpur faced severe waterlogged. Due to the sudden collapse of a drain at a Metro site at Khaira More in Najafgarh, the 800mm feeder water supply line to the Daulatpur and Ujwa underground reservoirs has been damaged, leading to closure of both, Delhi Jal Board said. The supply will affected in the areas for a few days, it added. A senior PWD official said that suction pumps installed last monsoon were used on Wednesday and Thursday to clear the roads. He added that waterlogging was reported on a few stretches and steps were being taken to avoid any such situation during the monsoon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/desilting-not-over-city-gets-monsoon-preview/articleshow/82809545.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Experts focus on teacher-student bond to break the chain in projected 3rd wave||Nagpur: Top paediatricians feel teachers should play a key role and take up cudgels to sensitize students in the 0-18 age group to fight off any phobia related to Covid-19. Teachers should also help students internalize Covid appropriate behaviour before the anticipated third wave during or post-monsoon, they said. The experts also felt the children and adolescents must be made aware about the disease through proper knowledge regarding prevention, precaution and protection. They emphasized on making children and adolescents aware about the threat of exposing self to the virus at public places, playgrounds, while meeting friends, playing outdoor games and so on. Teach them importance of yoga, breathing exercises like pranayam and right diet to build up immunity and how to isolate self if a family member tests positive, the experts said. Reiterate the importance of wearing mask, physical distancing and sanitization, which is already taught to the students, feel the experts. The concerns regarding the anticipated third wave affecting children and young adolescents had also came up during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s online interaction with 60 collectors across the nation on Thursday. Professor Dr Dipty Jain, head of the department of paediatrics at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), said teachers must take online classes to ensure students are well-informed about the disease and its prevention. “The course should be well framed, structured and uniform. Ideally, there should be a teaching manual too,” she said. Dr Jain, also member of the district’s Paediatric Task Force, said that training of the workforce at different levels, including teachers, would be one of the most crucial modules of the planning to fight the projected third wave.Well-known paediatrician Dr Kush Jhunjhunwala, also member of the task force and honoraray professor of Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMCH), said young school-going children respond more positively to teachers than their parents. “Teachers can play an effective role in creating awareness regarding Covid among students to prepare them for the anticipated third wave,” he said. According to Dr Jhunjhunwala, the task force is contemplating training of teachers and roping in association of headmasters. “We have already discussed the significance of training them in standard operating procedure (SOP) to prevent the third wave from hitting the children. The district collector is mulling forming social media groups of doctors, paramedical groups and others including teachers too,” said Dr Jhunjhulwala. Dr Chandrakant Bokade, head of the department of paediatrics, IGGMCH, suggested teachers can be involved in creating awareness among children as well as parents through online media during or after the vacation. “The education department can play a proactive role here along with organizations like Indian Academy of Paediatrics (IAP), NGOs and also media,” he said. Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, vice president of Academy of pediatrics, Nagpur, said the school managements must involve teachers and also experts from different fields like yoga teachers, nutritionists or paediatricians. “Students should be told not to panic. Take multi-dimensional approach to teach them various things including behavioural therapies so that they can enjoy staying at home and remain safe,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/experts-focus-on-teacher-student-bond-to-break-the-chain-in-projected-3rd-wave/articleshow/82809567.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Pune||Infection status check or disable slot features unlikely on Co-WIN system||Pune: Co-WIN system is unlikely to have a feature to prompt or ask citizens booking appointments about their Covid-19 status or disable appointments for those who had the infection but did not complete the three-month period after recovery. R S Sharma, chairperson of the empowered committee on Covid-19 vaccination and head of the Co-Win platform, told TOI, “All such aspects cannot be integrated with Co-WIN. What if a person did contract Covid but does not report the same on the system if at all such a feature is introduced? It will not be practical to ask crores of people booking appointments if they have contracted Covid recently. Therefore, it is for the people to follow this advisory and cannot be enforced via Co-WIN.” The ministry had on Wednesday announced that individuals with lab tests proven SARS-COV-2 should defer their vaccination by three months after recovery. Sharma said people have been told to follow the advisory and have to choose the vaccination period in accordance with the advisory. “We are depending on its publicity and communication by the government to ensure that this advisory is followed. Co-WIN can only provide flexibility, it cannot force,” he said. A senior official from the National E-Governance Division , electronics and information technology ministry, told TOI, “There would be no option on Co-WIN portal to prompt users about their Covid status before scheduling appointments. Co-WIN will not restrict appointment booking on the basis of this. Such a feature has not been planned and will not be put on the portal.” The official added, “Healthcare workers at vaccination sites will advise prospective beneficiaries and may also put up a note at the centre to convey that those who have had Covid can take the vaccine three months after recovery.” After the recent announcement by the Centre, experts have said it would be difficult for the government to implement this “as there is no way of knowing on Co-Win or at jab centres if a beneficiary recently contracted Covid-19 and has completed three months after recovery”. A senior official from the health and family welfare ministry told TOI, “Carrying a Covid proof, such as test report to the vaccine centre, to prove that one has completed three months since recovery may be difficult to follow. Hence, healthcare workers in districts will have to be told to take necessary action for the implementation of the advisory via dissemination of the information to service providers as well as the general public and training of the vaccination staff.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/infection-status-check-or-disable-slot-features-unlikely-on-co-win-system/articleshow/82814058.cms||Neha Madaan

According to TAFI representatives, the decision will help boost tourism in the state. “In the past one year, varying rules imposed by state governments for travellers has not just led to confusion but also hampered tourism.

Goa Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education chairman Bhagirath Shetye said that the board has taken a ‘wait-and-watch approach’ for now. No discussions have been taken up yet on the new schedule for the Class X and XII exams, he added. Having entered the 13th month preparing for their Class X and XII examinations and studying the same syllabus for the academic year 2020-21, students are now anxious to know the exam dates. Over 19,000 students have registered for the 2021 Class XII examination and around 24,000 for the Class X examination. In a normal year, the Class XII board examination would begin in the last week of February and end by mid-March. The Class X exam was usually conducted in April. But the pandemic has delayed the academic schedule. Physical classes for Class X and XII students were only allowed from November 21, 2020 during the current academic year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/board-yet-to-discuss-new-exam-schedule-for-classes-x-and-xii/articleshow/82814035.cms||---
---||Delhi||2 held for O2 hoarding get bail, ‘punishment after conviction’||New Delhi: Two men arrested and jailed on charges of hoarding and black marketing of oxygen concentrators have been granted bail by a court, which observed that they had been in jail since April 28 and it would serve no purpose if they continued to be imprisoned. “Further, there is a presumption of innocence in our criminal system...there is no other criminal involvement of present accused persons,” noted additional sessions judge Naveen Kumar Kashyap. Ayush Handa and Himanshu Handa, through senior advocate Vikas Pahwa and advocate Sanya Kapur, had argued that the oxygen concentrators seized from them were meant for a hospital in Faridabad and it was a bona fide purchase. Pahwa argued that except Section 420 (cheating) IPC, all other alleged offences were bailable. He further submitted that as there was no complainant or victim in the case, necessary elements such as wrongful loss was absent and, therefore, the charge of cheating couldn’t be invoked. Claiming that it was a bona fide purchase for Sarvodaya Hospital, the counsel placed the related documents on record and argued that there was no complaint of selling the alleged articles to any public member. The public prosecutor claimed the accused had taken undue benefit of the pandemic situation in a “well-planned” conspiracy and tried to sell oxygen concentrators and other related items at an inflated price. The prosecutor alleged that the accused had hoarded the Covid-19 resource equipment. The accused were termed “influential persons” who could threaten witnesses and tamper with evidence. The investigation officer, however, informed the court that the provisions of Essential Commodity Act, invoked in the case, had been removed on the advice of senior officials. The court observed, “The object of bail is neither punitive nor preventive. Deprivation of liberty must be considered a punishment unless it can be required to ensure that an accused person will stand his trial when called upon. The courts owe more than verbal respect to the principle that punishment begins after convictions, and that every man is deemed to be innocent until duly tried and duly found guilty.” It was, therefore, underscored that it was necessary that the order didn’t suffer from non-application of mind and at the present stage a detailed examination of evidence and elaborate documentation of the merit of the case was not required to be undertaken. Noting that both “have roots in society”, the court granted them regular bail subject to furnishing of a Rs 50,000 personal bond each with one sound surety of like amount. The case is now registered under IPC sections 420, 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 188 (disobedience of order promulgated by a public servant), 34 (common intention), 120B (criminal conspiracy) and Section 3 of Epidemic Disease Act, 1897.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2-held-for-o2-hoarding-get-bail-punishment-after-conviction/articleshow/82811947.cms||Aamir Khan

With its decommissioning, a glorious era will come to an end. INS Rajput, the lead ship of Kashin-class destroyers built by the erstwhile USSR, was commissioned on May 4, 1980.The fighter ship will be decommissioned at a ceremony at the Naval Dockyard in Visakhapatnam. Owing to the pandemic and lockdown restrictions, the ceremony will be a low-key affair and attended only by in-station officers and sailors with strict observance of Covid-19 protocols. The destroyer was constructed at 61 Communards Shipyard in Nikolaev (present day Ukraine) under her original Russian name ‘Nadezhny’, meaning ‘Hope’. The keel of the giant destroyer was laid on September 11, 1976, and ship was launched on September 17, 1977. The ship was commissioned as INS Rajput on May 4, 1980 at Poti, Georgia, by IK Gujral, then ambassador of India to USSR with Captain Gulab Mohanlal Hiranandani as its first commanding officer. Over its four decades of glorious service to the nation, the ship has had the distinction of serving in both western and eastern fleets of the Indian Navy. With the motto ‘Raj Karega Rajput’ firmly etched in their minds and indomitable spirit, the gallant crew of INS Rajput have remained ever vigilant and always ‘on call’ to protect the maritime interests and sovereignty of the nation. The ship has participated in several operations aimed at keeping the nation secure. Some of these include Operation Aman in Sri Lanka to assist IPKF, Operation Pawan for patrolling duties off the coast of Sri Lanka, Operation Cactus to resolve the hostage situation in Maldives, and Operation Crowsnest in Lakshadweep. In addition, the ship participated in numerous bilateral and multi-national exercises. It was also the first Navy ship to be affiliated with an Indian Army regiment — the Rajput Regiment. In its 41 years span, the ship saw 31 commanding officers at the helm, with the last commanding officer taking charge of the ship on August 14, 2019. When the sun sets on Friday, the Naval Ensign and the Commissioning Pennant will be hauled down for the last time onboard INS Rajput, symbolising the decommissioning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/end-of-an-era-ins-rajput-indian-navys-first-destroyer-sails-into-history-today/articleshow/82814901.cms||---
---||Mumbai||It moved only 200M, says Afcons, passes buck to owner||New Delhi: The ill-fated Afcons barge Papaa (P-305) moved only 200 metres away from the unmanned offshore platform off Bombay High where it was working, a distance the vessel’s master appears to have considered safe as per projections of cyclone Tauktae’s wind speed and depression, Afcons, which had chartered the vessel for an ONGC contract, said in a statement on Thursday. Going by the statement, it now appears the barge would not have capsized had it moved further away and had the master considered a bigger margin for error in predicting cyclones that are known to be fickle and can change projected course and ferocity. Once the anchors snapped, the barge hit the platform and suffered damage on the starboard. The vessel capsized after taking in water. There were 99 floating vessels working for ONGC in the western offshore when the IMD’s first alert came in on May 11. On May 13, ONGC ordered all 243 fixed installations into ‘sea survival mode’ and asked floating vessels to move to safety. All did, except five vessels, including the three Afcons barges. Breaking its silence for the first time since the incident, an unsigned company statement laid the responsibility of the master’s decision on the vessel’s owner. “Durmast (Enterprises Ltd) is the owner and the responsibility for marine operations rests with the vessel owner and his marine crew stationed on the vessel.” So why did Papaa 305 not move further away, whereas others did? Afcons appeared to put the entire blame on the master, who, it said, wanted “to remain at that location, deciding this as a safe location since the maximum predicted wind speed was only 40 knots and his location was 120 nautical miles away from the eye of the storm”. Were the master and the marine crew under pressure not to move further away since that could cost four-five days in the movement, while only two-three days’ work was left? “Unfortunately, the weather conditions deteriorated rapidly from the evening of 16th May 2021, reaching levels far worse than predicted on the 17th May 2021. The sudden deterioration of weather left no time at all for any further action to be taken by the Master of the vessel,” the Afcons statement said. The chief engineer on P-305, Rahman Shaikh (48), blamed the master or captain for not adhering to the cyclone alert relayed on May 11. He said he had asked the captain as well as the barge company to take the barge to the safer location, but they did not pay heed. A source from the committee headed by the Director General of Shipping that is now probing the incident told TOI, “All vessels are fitted with Global Maritime Distress Safety System (GMDSS) that gets the warning relayed from IMD. In this case, the barge captain should have taken a decision immediately. The inquiry will help to know why the barge owner did not allow the captain to take the barge to the shore.” (Inputs by V Narayan)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/it-moved-only-200m-says-afcons-passes-buck-to-owner/articleshow/82814897.cms||Sanjay Dutta
---||Dehradun||Beacons of hope: Good Samaritans helping villagers with relief supplies||MUSSOORIE: Amid spiralling Covid-19 cases, several citizen groups and social organisations have started providing medical equipment, medicines, masks, ration and other aid to the Covid-affected villages in the Tehri Garhwal district. Mussoorie-based Aseem Varma, who recently set up 'The Helping Hand', a citizen group that is helping seven villages in the Thatyur block of Tehri Garhwal, is providing village communities with thermometers, oximeters, face masks, sanitizers, oxygen concentrators and nebulizers. He said that he has been receiving overwhelming support from his school group – All Saints and Sherwood – and the Nandini club of Delhi. “Besides, several individuals across India and even from abroad are helping us in crowdfunding,” he added. Similarly, the authorities at the Landour Community Hospital (LCH) in Mussoorie are training locals in Covid management. “We have already trained local volunteers and youth in Covid management and in the coming days, we plan to provide oxygen concentrators, oximeters, thermometers, sanitizers and masks to a large number of villages,” Dr George Clarence, senior administrative officer of LCH, told TOI. Notably, LCH has been working with communities in Tehri Garhwal and Uttarkashi districts since the 1980s. “LCH will facilitate the setting up of community kitchens in villages which have been affected the most by the pandemic. Plans are also afoot to provide vaccination support to the communities in the next few weeks,” Dr Clarence added. A citizen group ‘Devalsari Paryavaran Sangrakshan Samiti’ is carrying out a similar drive in several Tehri villages. Arun Gour, a member of the group, told TOI, “We have constituted a team of 150 volunteers who will assist Asha health workers and distribute essential kits in remote villages. We are also distributing medicines, rations, thermometers and oximeters in the villages.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/beacons-of-hope-good-samaritans-extending-a-helping-hand-in-hill-villages-aid-pours-in-the-form-of-medical-supplies-masks-ration/articleshow/82809565.cms||Anmol Jain

R S Sharma, chairperson of the empowered committee on Covid-19 vaccination and head of the Co-Win platform, told TOI, “All such aspects cannot be integrated with Co-WIN. What if a person did contract Covid but does not report the same on the system if at all such a feature is introduced? It will not be practical to ask crores of people booking appointments if they have contracted Covid recently. Therefore, it is for the people to follow this advisory and cannot be enforced via Co-WIN.” The ministry had on Wednesday announced that individuals with lab tests proven SARS-COV-2 should defer their vaccination by three months after recovery. Sharma said people have been told to follow the advisory and have to choose the vaccination period in accordance with the advisory. “We are depending on its publicity and communication by the government to ensure that this advisory is followed. Co-WIN can only provide flexibility, it cannot force,” he said. A senior official from the National E-Governance Division , electronics and information technology ministry, told TOI, “There would be no option on Co-WIN portal to prompt users about their Covid status before scheduling appointments. Co-WIN will not restrict appointment booking on the basis of this. Such a feature has not been planned and will not be put on the portal.” The official added, “Healthcare workers at vaccination sites will advise prospective beneficiaries and may also put up a note at the centre to convey that those who have had Covid can take the vaccine three months after recovery.” After the recent announcement by the Centre, experts have said it would be difficult for the government to implement this “as there is no way of knowing on Co-Win or at jab centres if a beneficiary recently contracted Covid-19 and has completed three months after recovery”. A senior official from the health and family welfare ministry told TOI, “Carrying a Covid proof, such as test report to the vaccine centre, to prove that one has completed three months since recovery may be difficult to follow. Hence, healthcare workers in districts will have to be told to take necessary action for the implementation of the advisory via dissemination of the information to service providers as well as the general public and training of the vaccination staff.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/infection-status-check-or-disable-slot-features-unlikely-on-co-win-system/articleshow/82814083.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Pune||Prison officials take up over 16k bail matters with courts||Pune: The superintendents of jails across the state are taking up with their respective district courts the issue of deciding 16,751 bail applications on priority as part of the Supreme Court-mandated high power committee’s (HPC) directives to decongest prisons to prevent the spread of Covid-19 infection.The committee, headed by a sitting high court judge and comprising additional chief secretary (Home) and a top prison official, met in-person on May 7 and through video-conferencing on May 11 in the light of the second wave of the pandemic and the need to decongest the jails.Grant of emergency bail to under trial prisoners (UTPs) involved in offences attracting punishment of less than seven years and emergency parole to convicts serving less than seven years sentence has been suggested, among other things, by the HPC.Additional director general of police (prisons) Sunil Ramanand told TOI on Thursday that they have collected a total of 16,751 bail applications of UTPs from 60 jails and filed it with the concerned district and sessions courts for decision on priority. The Bombay HC has also circulated the HPC guidelines to all subordinate courts to implement the same on priority, he added. “Some more such releases are expected to happen as the superintendents of all jails pursue the matter with the courts. The process will pick up speed in the days to come and it will help us in decongesting jails and managing its affairs in a better way to contain the spread of Covid19 virus among the prisoners and jail staffers,” he added.Meanwhile, Pune’s additional commissioner of police (crime) Ashok Morale told TOI, “The detection branch of all 32 police stations have been instructed to monitor the current activities of criminals/convicts after they are released from jails. We have also asked the crime branch to randomly visit their residence to ensure that they do not breach the bail conditions and sensitise them to deter them from committing new crime.”Morale said, “We will be starting exercise to question criminals/convicts by filling interrogation forms in a prescribed format containing details like what will be their activities after being released from jails etc. We will be instructing criminals to alert police if there is change in their present/current activities. We are ensuring that they give attendance at the police stations as per the bail order. We will take action against criminals if they commit new crime or breach bail conditions.”“Around 269 criminals/convicts were released on bail/parole as per the HPC guidelines last year in Pune. We have taken action against six criminals for committing new crime and sent them back to Yerawada jail,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/prison-officials-take-up-over-16k-bail-matters-with-courts/articleshow/82812761.cms||Asseem Shaikh
---||Hyderabad||Virat Kohli reaches out to KS Sravanthi Naidu, gives Rs 6.77 lakh||HYDERABAD: Former Indian cricketer KS Sravanthi Naidu, who is struggling to raise funds to meet the medical expenses of her Covid-hit parents, received an unexpected help from Indian captain Virat Kohli, who contributed Rs 6.77 lakh. To help Sravanthi, several people from the sports fraternity have come forward and are doing their bit. While the Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA) has sanctioned Rs 5 lakh, the Handball Federation of India (HFI) president Arishnapally Jagan Mohan Rao provided Rs 2 lakh to Sravanthi’s family on Thursday. Sravanthi’s precarious financial situation came to light after R Sridhar, the Indian fielding coach, put out a tweet, asking for help. “Former India and Hyderabad cricketer Sravanthi Naidu’s parents are fighting Covid-19. She already spent Rs 16 lakh and is in urgent need of funds for hospital expenses,” read his tweet. Soon, Indian cricketer G Hanuma Vihari, who has been helping people while playing county cricket for Warwickshire, started crowdfunding for Sravanthi’s mother’s treatment. The initiative, however, could raise only Rs 80,000. Badminton star Jwala Gutta also tweeted asking denizens to support Sravanthi. “My mother is in a critical position while my father is also in the ICU. They are fighting for their lives. I thank HCA for their immediate response,” Sravanthi told reporters. While Sravanthi’s mother is undergoing treatment at a corporate hospital in Secunderabad for the past 11 days, her father is hospitalized in a Somajiguda health facility. Sravanthi’s friend and former India cricketer Archana Das told TOI that Sravanthi’s father is recovering, but her mother is not doing very well as she suffered a brain haemorrhage and heart attack. Das, who also played for undivided Andhra Pradesh and HCA, said that it would be great if the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) comes forward and helps the former cricketer. “I believe she even contacted BCCI. We can’t spend Rs 30 lakh to Rs 40 lakh in a jiffy as we do not have that kind of money,” she added, underscoring how back in the days, women cricketers were not paid much. Sravanthi made her debut in 2004 and played 11 international matches-- one test, four one-dayers, and six T20 matches.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kohli-reaches-out-to-sravanthi-gives-rs-6-7l/articleshow/82814933.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

---||Mumbai||Search For Rest 26 Crew Members Continues, 11 On Tug Also Missing||Mumbai: The Indian Navy’s search and rescue teams recovered, by Thursday evening, 49 bodies of crew members of the barge Papaa (P-305) that sank 70 km off the Mumbai coast in the wake of cyclone Tauktae. The search for 26 personnel still missing continues with six naval warships, P8I maritime surveillance aircraft, and Chetak, ALH and Sea King helicopters involved in the effort. The barge had 261 personnel on board, and 186 of them had been rescued by Wednesday evening. Bodies of 27 victims were brought to Mumbai on board INS Beas on Thursday, while INS Kochi and INS Kolkata had on Wednesday brought back 22 victims and all the rescued personnel. Among those still missing is barge captain Balwinder Singh. While Yellow Gate police have registered a case of accidental death in the P-305 case, they have registered another case of persons missing after 11 crew members of a tugboat, Varapradha, were untraced. Two of its crew members were saved by INS Kolkata when it was undertaking search ops for P-305.Family members of one of the P-305 personnel who died, quality control engineer Vishal Katdare (37), said they learnt from his colleague Deepak that the barge captain had been firm about carrying on the waters as he was sure the cyclone would not harm them. But as the barge started sinking, the captain jumped into the waters without a life jacket, the survivor told Katdare’s family. Katdare was in the waters for almost 12 hours and died after he was rescued.A defence official said the rescued crew members were very weak after having been in the waters for several hours with their life jackets on. As they need to overcome the trauma, counselling will be provided by the agency concerned before they are allowed to go home, the official said. All those brought back to Mumbai’s shores have been placed in quarantine and will undergo medical examination. Most rescued crew members said they had lost all their belongings in the barge that sunk. The marine crew on P-305 was owned and operated by M/s Durmast Enterprises Ltd. A spokesperson for the barge company Afcons, the contractor in this case, said, “As per the international standard vessel chartering terms, the responsibility for the marine side of the operations, namely safe vessel operation, navigation and vessel management come under the scope of the vessel owners, carried out through the vessel’s master, officers, and the crew appointed on the vessel by the owner. Evacuation of the vessel is an extreme step only resorted to in case the vessel is in distress.” The naval warships still engaged in the search and rescue (SAR) operations are INS Kochi, Kolkata, Beas, Betwa, Teg and Talwar. The Glory Ship Management Pvt Ltd, owners of the tug Varapradha, approached Yellow Gate police and lodged a missing complaint about 11 crew members and the tug on Wednesday. Two crew members—Francis Simon (51) and Sahebsapan Bhutia (23)—have been rescued. “The two survivors told us there were a total of 13 people in the tug. They said the 11 others might have drowned. The two were able to climb on the life raft and survived. They were brought to Mumbai,” sources said. The two survivors told the police they had been seeking permission to come back on May 17 (Monday) but lost contact with the company at around 2.30pm. The tug captain, Nagendra Kumar Prajapati (59), is also missing. The other 10 missing crew members are in the age-group of 22 to 46. The sister and brother-in-law of one of those missing, Rakesh Kumar, arrived from Pune to Mumbai on Wednesday to find out details. Rakesh’s wife and one-year-old son stay with his parents in Darbhanga, Bihar. “We have registered a case of missing persons,” confirmed Suhas Hemade, senior inspector of Yellow Gate police station. Meanwhile, the Maharashtra Congress on Thursday demanded the resignation of petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan on moral grounds over the death of P-305 crew members and termed it a “manmade tragedy”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/search-for-rest-26-crew-members-continues-11-on-tug-also-missing/articleshow/82814959.cms||Mateen Hafeez
---||Trichy||Cops accused of harassing public||Trichy: Thirty-year-old Syed Ibrahim from Seshasayee Nagar in KK Nagar ventured out of his house on his two-wheeler to buy mutton from a shop on Wireless Road opposite to the Trichy airport on Wednesday. The shop was closed, and as he was returning home around 9 am, police stopped him and seized his motorcycle for moving out of his locality. He had gone to the shop to buy mutton on credit, as he was friendly with the traders. Despite explaining that he was not having enough money to buy meat from his locality, police seized his two-wheeler. But, he was fortunate to get his motorcycle back the same day thanks to the intervention of an assistant commissioner of police who warned the inspector for his high handedness. Ibrahim’s is not the only incident of police high handedness in dealing with genuine cases. Police personnel restricting people from moving to neighbouring localities for genuine causes has been troubling local people. Those who come out for purchases say that the government allowed them to come out between 6am and 10am, but police are insisting they complete their purchase within their locality. While all the essential commodities are not available in nearby shops, people move out to neighbouring localities to face the ordeal by police. S Saravanan from Mannarpuram said that there are no shops in his locality and he has to go to KK Nagar, Kajah Malai or Kallukuzhi to buy essentials. “In many places, police have blocked the vital connecting roads in the city. We are left with no option but to enter the neighbouring locality to access shops,” said S Senthil Nathan from Bheemanagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/cops-accused-of-harassing-public/articleshow/82811982.cms||Sampath Kumar

The beneficiaries included 350 who were given the jabs at two sites in Aishbagh Eidgah, the city’s first religious place to start a vaccination centre with government support. Besides, 9,120 people in the 18-44 age group took their first shot of the two-dose vaccination course. In the 45-59 age group, 3,538 turned up to take the first jab and 264 the second. Similarly, among elderly (60 years and above) 1,047 and 134 took first and second does respectively. Some frontline and healthcare workers also got vaccinated. In Eidgah, separate sites were set up for beneficiaries between 18 and 44 years of age and those above 45 years in order to ensure social distancing. “To fight this pandemic we need to be both alert and cautious against getting the infection and also get vaccinated as soon as possible to curtail the virus’ growth,” said Imam of the Eidgah and head of Islamic Centre of India Maulana Khalid Rasheed Farangi Mahali. Covid incharge for the district Roshan Jacob also visited the centre. “It is an encouraging initiative from the Islamic Centre of India to become part of the campaign. This will motivate a large number of people to get vaccinated and it will be easier for them to come here too,” she said. The centre will, like all other vaccination sites, accept only those with prior online registrations. The organisers have however stationed volunteers at the help desk to aid people with online registration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/14000-get-vaccine-in-city-350-of-them-at-aishbagh-eidgah/articleshow/82814077.cms||---

---||Delhi||Many fair price shops shut or not giving out items: Activists||New Delhi: The lockdown in the capital has hit the poor the hardest, especially when it comes to food. Fair price shops remain their key hope amid the economic distress triggered by Covid-19, but activists claim many of these shops are either closed or not distributing foodgrains and other items. According to the data provided by activists, 72.7 lakh people or 37% of Delhi’s population have ration cards under the public distribution system (PDS) of National Food Security Act (NFSA). Delhi government recently announced that besides them, anybody being unable to buy foodgrains will be given ration kits for free for this month. The Centre, under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Ann Yojana, has announced an extra five kg foodgrain for free per beneficiary. In the fifth week of lockdown due to the second wave, the poor in the city, mostly daily wage labourers, have lost their sources of livelihood. Proper functioning of ration shops is key to ensuring food security and preventing hunger and starvation, an activist said. “Between May 1 and 12, volunteers of Delhi Rozi Roti Adhikar Abhiyaan and other groups visited more than 100 ration shops and found that ration was not being distributed anywhere, causing intense distress to the poor and marginalised,” an activist said. According to activists, the government announced on May 14 that the free ration would be distributed under NFSA from the same day while distribution of additional entitlements under the central scheme would start from May 17. But the volunteers visited 110 ration shops, many of these more than once, and found nearly 40% of them closed during working hours while only 44 of these were distributing foodgrains. While 23 ration shops claimed they were waiting for the full stock, only 28% of the shops visited between May 17 and 20 were distributing the full entitlement under both schemes. In 100 of the 110 shops, no notice board or banner was found displaying the category-wise entitlement despite the government order. Anjali Bhardwaj, one of the activists who was part of this drive, said the delay was forcing the poor to buy foodgrains from the open market at non-subsidised prices. The government didn’t react to the allegations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/many-fair-price-shops-shut-or-not-giving-out-items-activists/articleshow/82812027.cms||Pankhuri Yadav

Gurgaon’s new model of testing and vaccination was included in ‘best practices’ for dealing with the pandemic. Gurgaon deputy commissioner Yash Garg mentioned testing 14 lakh residents and administering 6-lakh vaccinations, coving 30% of the city’s population. Gurgaon lowered its positivity rate from 35 to 10% and laid 1,500 to 1,800 new beds. The outside patients also take these beds and 40% of those coming from neighbouring states, Delhi chiefly. After 12 days, the city’s active case count of 5,000 has dropped to 1,100 because of a new plan. In Gurgaon’s 144 villages, teams have tested 6,000 people over five days and now they target testing the entire rural population is another five days. Every village has a city-linked Covid hospital of 50 beds. Being an IT hub, Gurgaon developed a portal for Covid coordination and updates, uploaded with the data of 102 hospitals. It shows the availability of doctors, beds, and oxygen. It helped take 10,000 oxygen cylinders to rural areas and another 1,000 cylinders to Gurgaon itself. Besides, a 1905 helpline was started.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pm-applauds-gurgaons-latest-covid-action-plan/articleshow/82814064.cms||---

So far, nine trees have been axed at the garden in south Mumbai for the coastal road project. Following the Bombay high court stay order against removal of 140 trees on Wednesday, locals said this is the first positive move in favour of the green cover. Dr Nilesh Baxi, founder of NGO Society for Improvement, Greenery And Nature, who had filed the PIL challenging the civic tree authority's permission for removal of 140 trees (61 to be cut & 79 transplant) was very happy with the court’s stay order. Several trees from inside and outside the garden were targeted to make way for a parking lot and road widening works. “The issue had started in December 2018 and it’s May 2021, nothing has been done in favour of the garden, but we are thankful for this stay. A few trees have been axed, but we hope other trees can be saved,” Baxi said. Activists said that if the BMC wants to create another green space then why cut the trees here. Zoru Bhatena, activist said that the BMC has been saying they plan to extend the garden towards the sea then what is the need to transplant these 79 trees as approved by tree authority to another location. “These can instead be transplanted in the new proposed garden,” he said. The matter is in the court and is expected to come up for hearing on May 21. In December 218, TOI was the first to report about the BMC's plans to acquire a portion of the garden for its coastal road project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-breach-candy-residents-hope-to-save-more-trees-at-tata-garden/articleshow/82814133.cms||Richa Pinto

On Thursday, the division comprising six districts recorded 14,931 vaccinations against 55,274 on Wednesday.On May 19, health secretary Rajesh Bhushan had forwarded recommendations of National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC) to all state chief secretaries. Considering emerging scientific evidence and experience from across the globe, NEGVAC had recommended deferment of first dose and second dose under certain conditions. The new rules exclude, between 4 weeks to 3 months, administering the vaccine to recovered patients, persons with serious general illness, recipients of convalescent plasma or monoclonal antibodies, and those who have received first dose.In Nagpur city, only 27% vaccination target was recorded as 2,534 took the jab though the civic body had provided 9,400 does for 45+ groups, whose second jab was due.Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi issued a press release stating that the vaccination would be open for 45+ group for both first and second dose on Friday. Paucity of does had forced Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) to restrict the drive to 45+ and that too only those with second jab due for last few days. Joshi also informed that as per the last government order, the second dose would be administered only after a gap of 12 to 16 weeks. All NMC vaccination centres would remain open on Friday and Covishield would be given. At four centres – Ambedkar Hospital Indora, GMCH, Barrister Rajabhau Khobragade Sabhagruh, and NMC’s Mahal Health centre – only the second dose of Covaxin would be given. NMC will also allow second dose to HCWs and FLWs.NMC officials said around 5.5 lakh population above 45+ age is yet to be vaccinated in city limits. Around 3.5 lakh have already been vaccinated while one to 1.5 lakh have tested positive in the last two months.Hence, the turnout at vaccination dropped after the new norms were applied, as very few second dose beneficiaries could make it. Of the day’s 2,534 beneficiaries, over 2,300 took their first dose.Meanwhile, the daily vaccination chart provided by deputy director of health services showed 27 beneficiaries in the 18-44 years group. An official found these were SRPF battalion camp beneficiaries, who were erroneously counted under wrong head instead of FLWs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/sharp-fall-in-vax-drive-as-new-norms-stretch-gap-between-doses/articleshow/82809601.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Nagpur||O2 unit owners gift saplings to customers to repay nature’s debt||Nagpur: The management of the Amohaoxy Industrial Gases Pvt Ltd at MIDC Butibori, an oxygen manufacturing company, has decided to gift 10 saplings each to the hospitals and also other customers so they can give the nature back whatever they had taken from it during the second Covid wave. The requirement of the hospitals and individual customers may have started receding with the wave but the owners of this manufacturing unit do not want the consumers to forget their responsibility towards the nature from where they had been drawing the life-giving gas to defeat Covid. Shekhar Godghate and his wife Shailaja, owners of the company, said they had requested officials of the Forest Development Corporation of Maharashtra (FDCM) to give them free saplings that they can distribute among the customers who took oxygen from their plant.“We want to spread the message that oxygen taken from nature must be given back with gratitude and as a duty as true children of mother nature,” said Shekhar. “An FDCM officer was deputed at my plant for coordination whom we have now requested for free saplings which the hospitals and our other customers must plant during the coming monsoon,” he said.Though the Godghates were upbeat about environment protection, an underlying worry about dip in the business was also palpably felt in their voice. “Now, the plant remains closed for at least four hours a day as the demand for medical oxygen has receded. This has added to our cost of production by way of more maintenance and power charges. The workforce too remains idle for almost half their working hours adding to our losses,” Shekhar said. Tarique Patel of the Jubilee Oxygen plant said the district administration must allow them to now start supplying for industrial use as the demands for the medical use is going down. “Our plant is idle for at least two hours as there are no empty cylinders coming from the hospitals. This is a production and economic loss for us,” said Patel. On the brighter side, district’s oxygen management co-ordinator Pyare Khan, a logistics businessman, said Nagpur now has surplus oxygen and hence is meeting the shortfall in other districts of Maharashtra following government’s order. “We are now supplying to entire Vidarbha and also Solapur,” he said. Nagpur had earlier sent oxygen to Pune too. Khan’s representative Wasim Sheikh said eight tankers liquid medical oxygen coming from Angul in Odisha were sent to Solapur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/o2-unit-owners-gift-saplings-to-customers-to-repay-natures-debt/articleshow/82809614.cms||---

The train was empty and parked in the yard and so there wasn’t any casualty in the incident. However, rail movement was affected for some time. The railways have ordered an inquiry into the incident. “We got a call early in the morning following which we sent four fire engines to the railway yard. It took us some time to reach the burning coaches as the fire engines had to negotiate through rail tracks,” said Parth Brahmbhatt, chief fire officer. Firefighters took nearly 40 minutes to douse the flames but all the four coaches were completely damaged. Reasons for the fire are yet to be known. The railways said that the coaches were isolated during the incident. Senior railway officials too reached the spot to assess the damage. A forensic team is also examining the coaches to ascertain how the parked coaches caught fire.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/four-coaches-of-memu-train-catch-fire-in-railway-yard/articleshow/82806758.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Space shortage forces cops to let violators go, send ‘seized vehicle’ cases to court||KOLKATA: Those flouting the restriction rules and travelling without valid reasons may not get their vehicles seized immediately but they will have to later appear in court and pay a penalty to “free” their cars. The shortage of space at traffic guards and the two major Kolkata Police yards near Vidyasagar Setu and Pragati Maidan has led the cops to adopt a new punishment system. For now, they have started to photograph the vehicles and the documents and letting the violators go. They are asking the owners to hand over photocopies of the original documents. The cops on roads are then sending the seized vehicle documents to local police stations, where the officers are drawing up cases under IPC section 188, and in certain cases, Section 51(B) of the Disaster Management Act, and forwarding them to court. Police said that only in some cases—barely 2% of the total number—where the Motor Vehicles Act was being used, the vehicle was physically seized. The specific law is used when the owner is unable to furnish correct vehicle documents. The danger of this exercise was, said sergeants in north and central Kolkata, some owners were still taking out their “seized” vehicles. The maximum violations were being reported from the Jorasanko, Girish Park, Ultadanga and Beniapukur. A few police stations in the added areas were also contributing to the high numbers.  “Two-wheeler owners were the biggest flouters, followed by that of cars. There has hardly been any challan to public transport vehicle,” said an officer. ‘We have called a tender to sell 304 condemned vehicles lying at our yards and police stations. But till Thursday afternoon, we had seized 1,069 vehicles anew since Sunday. That is a huge a number for us to find open space to accommodate them. We had to develop a system, under which we could identify the offenders and take action within whatever infrastructure is available to us,” said a senior officer of a traffic guard. Police said there was another reason for this format. “We are being repeatedly told by KMC to clean up and sanitize the vehicles around police stations and yards to avoid dengue. So, despite the pandemic, we have decided to sell off as many vehicles as possible and keep physical seizures to the minimum. We have also given a clause that all auctioned vehicles have to be removed within a month of being awarded the contract,” said another officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/space-shortage-forces-cops-to-let-violators-go-send-seized-vehicle-cases-to-court/articleshow/82812062.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Trichy||Doorstep screening to tackle caseload spurt in rural Trichy||Trichy: Covid-19 caseload from suburbs and rural blocks of Trichy is on the rise for the past one week. From reporting around 350 fresh cases daily until last week, the 15 rural blocks of Trichy district now report 800 cases per day. Sensing the drastic spike in the number of fresh cases in the rural area, the health department and civic bodies have planned to extend the door-to-door fever survey conducted in Trichy city to the rest of the district. Five vulnerable blocks will be covered in the first phase.Ever since the beginning of the second wave of the pandemic, Trichy city began reporting more fresh cases than the rural blocks. But since May 14, cases from the rural blocks surpassed the number of cases from the urban areas. From reporting fresh infections in two digits, Thiruverumbur and Manachanallur blocks reported more than 100 cases each per day, a four-fold surge. However, the rural local bodies and town panchayats were reluctant to establish containment zones there. They stated that bulk identification of cases had not happened in their jurisdiction even as more than 100 cases were reported per day. Meanwhile, the health officials attributed the surge to the large-scale movement of people amid the lockdown. Vegetable markets, meat stalls, and hospitals in the districts continue to attract big crowds. Besides, a section of frontline workers and government employees visiting their offices in the city have their residences in the suburbs and rural areas. Local transmission among people commuting between the city and rural areas for medical emergencies and trade-related activities is a major reason for the surge, civic body officials said.“We have identified five blocks including Thiruverumbur, Manachanallur, Lalgudi, Musiri and Thuraiyur as vulnerable. Doorstep fever screening will be conducted by our domestic breeding workers to prevent deaths,” a senior health official said. While manpower is a huge concern for the massive survey in rural blocks, a 30-member team is assigned for every vulnerable block. Conduct of funerals even for non-Covid-19 deaths were also causing spread of the infection. “Even the suspected Covid-19 casualties were taken directly from hospitals to crematoriums. We are in touch with VAOs to prevent such mass gatherings,” a senior official in Lalgudi town panchayat said. Officials said that random sample collection and fever camps are underway in the five blocks to identify positive cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/doorstep-screening-to-tackle-caseload-spurt-in-rural-trichy/articleshow/82812018.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Trichy||Amid lockdown, at least 50 palm trees felled in Tiruvarur||Trichy: Amid the lockdown and restrictions on public movement, environmental activists in Tiruvarur have flagged the continuous felling of palm trees at various locations in the district in the past week. Around 50 palmyra trees were brought down or destroyed by pouring acid to eliminate obstructions caused to commercial or residential establishments nearby or for using as firewood. According to Tiruvarur-based Green Needa environment organisation, palm trees in the district including those near Tiruvarur collectorate, Vilamal and Eravancherry hamlets were targeted by the anti-social elements. For the purpose of using as firewood in brick kilns, palm trees on highways planted by the state highways department decades ago were destroyed. “The trees are made to wither by pouring acid atop and over the barks. In the next few days, the trees crumble. The wood is clandestinely collected and used to burn bricks at the brick kiln,” M Rajavelu, chief coordinator of the NGO said. Besides firewood, shops and residential complexes that consider the well-grown tree as a hindrance to their appearance hire people to get rid of them. Named the state tree of Tamil Nadu, palm trees offer palmyra fruits during summer. Activists opined that the absence of a palm development board in delta districts and lack of emphasis on planting more palm trees despite it being the official tree of the state has cause the targeted destruction. “There is no effort to produce value-added products with palm trees grown near the paddy fields of delta districts,” Rajavelu added. Forest department and district administration officials said they will look into the complaints raised by the NGO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/amid-lockdown-at-least-50-palm-trees-felled-in-tiruvarur/articleshow/82812020.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Chennai||Remit sentence of 7 Rajiv Gandhi assassins and release them, Stalin urges President||CHENNAI: Chief minister M K Stalin on Thursday urged President Ram Nath Kovind to accept the recommendation made by the state government in 2018 and pass orders to remit the sentence of all seven convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case and order their release immediately. In a letter to Kovind, the chief minister said the convicts, S Nalini, Murugan, Santhan, A G Perarivalan, Jayakumar, Robert Payas and P Ravichandran, had suffered untold hardships and agony over the past three decades and paid a heavy price. “There has already been an inordinate delay in the consideration of their pleas for remission. In the present circumstances of the Covid-19 pandemic, courts are also recognising the need to decongest prisons,” Stalin said. On Wednesday, the state government announced 30-day parole to Perarivalan on medical grounds following a request from his mother Arputhammal. Nalini’s death sentence was commuted under Article 161 of the Constitution of India during the DMK regime in 2000. The Supreme Court commuted the death sentence of three convicts, Murugan, Santhan and Perarivalan, to life imprisonment in 2014. “The majority of the political parties in Tamil Nadu have been requesting for the remission of the remainder of their sentence and for immediate release of all the seven convicts as they have been incarcerated for about three decades. It is also the will of the people of Tamil Nadu,” Stalin said. The previous AIADMK government had recommended to governor Banwarilal Purohit on September 9, 2018, seeking remission of the remainder of the sentence of all seven convicts and their early release. The chief minister said the “purported obstacle” for exercise of power of remission was the pendency of the investigation by the multi-disciplinary monitoring agency of CBI. The Union government, as well the CBI, had clarified before the court that there was no connection between the remission of sentence and investigation. “The governor has decided that the President of India is the competent authority to decide on the plea of remission of sentence of these seven persons, and therefore, has forwarded the state government’s recommendation to your excellency’s office,” Stalin said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/remit-sentence-of-7-rajiv-assassins-and-release-them-stalin-urges-prez/articleshow/82812021.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Not 13.5km, MoD likely to give nod to 4.25km-long Shinku-la tunnel||Manali: Ladakh is likely to get all-weather connectivity earlier than the expected time as the ministry of defence (MoD) is reportedly interested in making a shorter highway tunnel below the 16,600ft high Shinku-la pass on Manali-Darcha-Padum-Nimmu-Leh axis. While the detailed project report of 13.5km-long Shinkula tunnel was expected to be completed soon, the MoD is more interested in the old proposal of 4.25km long tunnel, sources claim The work on the tunnel may start this year after completion of formalities and allocation of the required budget. The tunnel is expected to be completed in three years. The remaining work of the road between Shinkula and Nimmu is also expected to complete by 2024, after which Ladakh will remain connected with Himachal and other parts of the country nearly around the year. A Border Roads Organisation (BRO) official said they have not received any official declaration of finalising of the tunnel among two proposed tunnels but they have received a verbal message from the headquarters that shorter tunnel is the likely choice. “BRO did survey of the tunnel near Shinku-la as it was budget friendly and needed less time in completion. We can keep the approach roads till the tunnel portals clear from snow in winter season. Building this tunnel will no longer be a challenge for BRO as we have gained enough experience from Atal tunnel,” he said. Shinku-la pass is 40km from Darcha, a tiny hamlet in Himachal’s Lahaul on Manali-Leh highway. BRO had a proposal of building a 4.25km-long tunnel just 3km before the pass. Last year MoD appointed the National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd (NHIDCL) to prepare the DPR of the tunnel. NHIDCL completely changed the axis of the tunnel in its survey and proposed to build a 13.5km-long tunnel from near Patseo, just beyond Darcha on Manali-Leh highway, with tunnel’s north portal opening at Lakhang at the base of the Shinku-la. This longer tunnel was expected to cut short the distance and also the travel time by about 2 hours. Both BRO and NHIDCL had sent their presentations to MoD and defence minister Rajnath Singh is believed to have favoured the BRO’s shorter tunnel. However, there is no official announcement from the ministry yet. The Manali-Shinkula-Nimmu highway will be the third major highway to connect landlocked Ladakh with the main land after Srinagar-Leh and Manali-Leh highways. This highway being flat with just one mountain pass, Shinku-la, will take much less travel time. Similar to Rohtang, Baralacha and Zoji-la passes, Shinku-la also receives heavy winter snowfall. To make the highway all-weather, a tunnel was needed below Shinku-la. However, the tunnel alone will not make the road all-weather as approach road to the tunnel and entre area to the south of the pass also receive very heavy winter snowfall. Darcha-Shinkula-Padum stretch is ready for mid-size vehicles while widening and blacktopping is underway on a war footing. The Padum-Nimmu section is still incomplete. A large number of bridges are being constructed while huge mountain faces are being blasted to make way for the highway. The road will connect Leh-Kargil highway at Nimmu, 35km from Leh. Nimmu will be around 397km, Leh 432km and Kargil about 580km from Manali via this new road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/not-13-5km-mod-likely-to-give-nod-to-4-25km-long-shinku-la-tunnel/articleshow/82814124.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Covid positivity rate in Maharashtra dips to 10.6% from peak 29%; it’s under 5% in Mumbai||MUMBAI: Signs of the ebbing of the second Covid wave in Maharashtra are apparent as the positivity rate and the number of active cases—two indicators of the pandemic’s severity —have dropped by almost half in a month. On Thursday, the daily positivity rate (percentage of people who test positive among those tested) in the state was 10.6%, the lowest in months. It was 9.3% in mid-February, when the second wave began, and rose to 29% on April 4. With the increase in testing, it has been steadily declining since. In Mumbai, the daily positivity rate stood at 4.8% on Thursday, after hovering at a shade above 5% for a couple of days. WHO advises relaxing lockdown-like restrictions if the rate holds at 5% for 14 days. Officials are wary as the positivity rate in surrounding townships is still as high as 20%. Maharashtra, which had 7 lakh active cases on April 21, reported 3.8 lakh active cases on Thursday. According to central health ministry officials on Thursday, 24 of the state’s 36 districts showed a dip in cases.Maharashtra added 29,911 new cases on Thursday after over 2.7 lakh tests conducted in the 24-hour period. The total caseload of the state stands at 54.9 lakh. Even with the dip in other indicators, the high addition of fatalities continues to remain a concern. Maharashtra added 738 deaths on Thursday, and also added 246 previous deaths taking the cumulative toll to 85,355. The BMC Covid update on Thursday showed a marginal rise in cases --- 1,425 compared to 1,329 on Wednesday and 961 on Tuesday. The city registered 59 deaths, taking the toll to 14,468. While the total tally in Mumbai is 6.9 lakh, the doubling rate is 297 days and virus’s overall growth rate has been 0.23%. Dr Pradeep Awate, who heads the epidemiology cell of the state public health department, said the positivity rate has been declining “quickly” in Maharashtra. “We prefer to check positivity rate over a week as daily rate could be affected by low testing numbers over the weekend. Having said, the positivity rate in the state is dropping fast. From 25.2% a month ago, we are down to 14% this week,” he said.

The vaccines across the PCMC limits, according to its press statement, will be solely available for the 45-plus age group (for first and second dose). Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI that the ongoing situation would improve from the last week of May as they were expecting a steady supply of Covishield and Covaxin from the manufacturers. “We are getting very limited vaccine doses in the past few days. On Tuesday, we got 20,000 Covishield doses and 9,000 Covaxin doses for the entire district, while on Thursday, we got merely 3,000 doses of Covishield for the district,” he said. PCMC commissioner Rajesh Patil’s new SOPs on the vaccination drive stated that the civic body was working on starting the vaccinations for the bed-ridden and super-senior citizens soon, besides the drive-in facility. The civic body has also directed the vaccination site supervisors to prioritise the Divyang beneficiaries first for the vaccination across all the centres, followed by senior citizens, those who are due for their second dose, those who have registered online for the first dose, and lastly the beneficiaries who will register on the spot. The Thursday’s vaccination drive saw inoculation of 6,259 beneficiaries across the district, of which 4,579 were in the PMC limits, while 1,680 were in the Pune rural areas. The PCMC did not conduct the vaccination on Thursday. Due to the increased gap between two doses of the Covishield, the district is once again witnessing the rise in the first dose beneficiaries in the age group of 45 plus. On Thursday, 1,168 senior citizens, and 2,400 general citizens (45plus) got their first shot.

Expressing solidarity with the fight against the pandemic, Kasivilangi fish market and Palpannai private onion market traders in Trichy have announced that they will be shut for a while since they are unable to control the crowds at their markets. Kasivilangi fish market traders in Woraiyur said the market will be shut till May 30 while the onion market will not open for five days from May 24. Fish market traders said people show scant regard for the pandemic while arriving to buy seafood with family members. “Even to purchase a kilogram of fish, people bring children even now. They visit all the stalls here and social distancing is not at all their concern,” K Ashok Kumar, a wholesale fish dealer said. Recently, a few fish vendors tested positive for the infection and have recovered after hospitalisation. Vendors said they were forced to close the market as the suspension of Sunday sales has only brought more people on weekdays. The market was handling 2 MT to 7 MT of seafood every day. The private onion market in Palpannai has 50 wholesale outlets. With a majority of the traders being elderly people, the traders opined that they faced the risk of contracting the infection as buyers are not following standard operating procedures. “At least seven vendors tested positive in recent weeks. Even young people are succumbing to the infection, so we are unwilling to take risks. The closure decision was to support the district administration,” a 70-year-old onion trader said. The traders added that the closure of the onion market will not cause any shortage of vegetables as retail vegetable vendors will continue to sell deploying alternative measures without attracting any crowd.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichys-fish-onion-traders-decide-to-shut-for-more-days/articleshow/82812059.cms||---

Police said the trio were arrested from Khiradkar’s office in Jalna, 60km from here. Besides Khiradkar, the other two arrested are police naik Santosh Ambhure (44) and constable Vithal Kharde (46). Ambhure is presently posted as a writer to the Kadim Jalna police station inspector while Kharde is a writer to Khiradkar. The operation was carried out by a team led by deputy superintendent of police (ACB) Varsharani Patil. The team swooped down on the trio after Ambhure accepted powdered currency notes from the complainant. Aurangabad superintendent of police (ACB) Rahul Khade told TOI, “A man named as an accused in a case registered under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act was allegedly asked to pay a bribe for helping him with the case. Unwilling to pay the bribe, he first reached out to the Aurangabad ACB, but on learning that senior officials were on leave, he approached the Pune unit of the ACB.” Khade said that an ACB team from Pune went to Jalna on two days, Tuesday and Wednesday, to confirm the man’s statement. The team found that Khiradkar had demanded Rs 5 lakh from the man to weaken the case against him. Khiradkar later settled for Rs 3 lakh, Khade said. He allegedly demanded that the first instalment of Rs 2 lakh be paid on Thursday and told Ambhure to collect the amount on his behalf. After their arrest, an offence against the accused trio was registered under relevant sections of Prevention of Corruption Act at the Taluka police station. ACB authorities said the trio will be produced before the court on Friday to seek their custody. ACB’s Pune unit SP Rajesh Bansode told TOI, “The ACB head office in Mumbai had directed us to conduct the operation based on information it had received.” A senior ACB officer confirmed to TOI that Khiradkar had demanded a bribe of Rs 5 lakh but later settled for Rs 3 lakh. “A high level of secrecy was maintained to execute the trap,” he added.

One such city couple not only took to bootlegging to make ends meet but also used ‘a unique formula’ to increase their profits. The couple, Sanjay Bahukiya (26) and his wife Neha alias Sabana (22), was arrested from city’s Jawahar road on Thursday morning while they were on their way to deliver alcohol to customers in the city. Apart from a couple being involved in bootlegging the other thing that surprised the cops was the ‘ingenuity’ the two used to earn extra bucks. The couple used to sell country-made liquor as IMFL. So, how did they manage to fool their buyers in purchasing country-made liquor as IMFL? Simple, the two added black tea to country-made liquor to make it look like IMFL. Later, they packed this ‘home-made’ drink in bottles of different IMFL brands. “We received specific information that a couple was engaged in bootlegging and kept a watch on them. We intercepted a bike and searched them. We found seven bottles of Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL). When grilled, the couple confessed that it was country-made liquor which they had packed in IMFL bottles so as to get higher returns,” police said.The two are residents of Mayor Society in Madhapar village on the outskirts of the city. Sanjay was engaged in imitation jewellery manufacturing sector while Neha was working in a spa. Due to lockdown both were rendered jobless. In order to survive, the couple started bootlegging with a ‘new’ idea of blending their own brew. “Sanjay used to collect empty bottles premium whisky brands and fill them with country-made liquor mixed with black tea to get the right colour. He later sold it to unsuspecting customers. The couple has been doing it for the last six months,” a police official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/jobless-urban-couple-bootlegs-home-made-imfl-arrested/articleshow/82809713.cms||---

HSGMC president Baljit Singh Daduwal said the release of a “dangerous criminal like Gurmeet Ram Rahim” would be at the cost of peace and law and order situation in Haryana and Punjab. He also attacked the Haryana government saying, “Gurmeet Ram Rahim has been convicted in the rape and murder cases and lodged in Sunaria jail of Rohtak. He wants to come out of the jail on different grounds. Even his followers, who are sitting in the government in Haryana, want to bring him out.” “The world knows that Dera head raped his followers and it is confirmed by the CBI court conviction. He is also convicted for life imprisonment in murder case of journalist Ramchander Chhatarparti, who published a daily evening newspaper in Sirsa. He is also facing charges of mass castration of his male followers,” said Daduwal. “After his conviction, private and government property was set on fire in three states and the crimes were committed as per his direction. On August 25, 2017, about 40 persons had lost their life in violence at Panchkula and 10 in Sirsa. The only person to blame for this loss is Dera head Ram Rahim. But some of his followers, who are sitting in the government in Haryana, saved him and did not let police name him as accused in the violence cases,” he alleged. “He wants to come out of jail for 21 days by making his mother’s health as the ground for release There are cases pending against him, including of mass castration of his followers, murder of Ranjit Singh Khanpur Kolian, and Bargari sacrilege case is also in the court,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/daduwal-dera-heads-release-could-disturb-peace-in-haryana-punjab/articleshow/82814141.cms||---

However, Amphotericin-B injections used in the treatment of black fungus have so far been obtained from the old stock of medical stores before the state government placed restrictions on their direct sale. As the demand for select medicines is rising, police are keeping a close watch on the illegal sales. So far, during the second wave, 128 cases have been registered in Telangana for illegal sale of medicines and other items used in the treatment of Covid-19.

---||Mumbai||God save edu system: HC on ‘no SSC exam’||Mumbai: The Bombay HC on Thursday came down heavily on the state government’s decision not to hold SSC exams, questioning whether it is making a mockery of the education system, reports Rosy Sequeira. “Are you thinking of promoting them (students) without examination? Then God save the education system in this country and in this state! This is the only main exam in the last year of school,” said a bench of Justices Shahrukh Kathawalla and Surendra Tavade. “In the name of the pandemic you cannot spoil the career and future of our children... It is not acceptable,” said Justice Kathawalla. They heard a PIL by Dhananjay Kulkarni, a retired teacher from Pune, which stated that cancelling of SSC exams can lead to problems for Class XI admissions as different boards declare results based on different formulae. Government pleader Priyabhushan Kakade said the state is waiting for suggestions from the State Council of Educational Research and Training in a week, after which it will come up with a formula. “Are you making a mockery of the education system?” asked Justice Kathawalla. Kakade said the decision was taken due to the pandemic. “What are you talking? Pandemic. Pandemic,” said Justice Kathawalla, adding that on one hand, the state is saying Covid-19 cases are lessening. The judges questioned the discrimination in holding HSC exams for 14 lakh students and not SSC exams for 16 lakh students, adding that “things are done as per whims and fancies of so-called policy- makers.” Told by Kakade that it was a policy decision taken by the government not to hold the SSC exams, Justice Kathawalla remarked, “You are just destroying the system.” Kulkarni’s advocate Uday Warunjikar said that for Classes I-VIII, there were no exams and even for Class XI. “The complete batch is without any examinations,” he said. Advocate Madhaveshwari Mhase, for an intervenor Anubha Sahai, said Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu had cancelled SSC exams. She said the Madras HC had even dismissed a challenge to the decision. “It is not binding on us. We care about the future of our students, who are the future of the country. They cannot be promoted year after year,” said Justice Kathawalla. The CBSE board’s advocate, Mihir Joshi, said students can appear for exams in July if they are not happy with the assessment. ICSE board advocate Pratik Kothari said it will appoint experts to evolve a formula for assessment of internal exams of Class IX. The SSC board’s advocate Kiran Gandhi said it is awaiting a formula from the state. “You are not prepared with anything. Just cancel the exams and sit tight!” said Justice Kathawalla. The judges will pass an order on the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/god-save-edu-system-hc-on-no-ssc-exam/articleshow/82815093.cms||Rosy Sequeira

On Wednesday, the government declared that only three teachers and a shiksha mitra would be considered for compensation. A day later, the chief minister said, since the state government is bound by election commission’s rules in giving compensation and jobs to kin of deceased, it would now seek an amendment in guidelines. Calling every death “sad” and reiterating the government’s compassionate approach towards each family member, the chief minister said: “The state government can compensate teachers, shiksha mitras, police officials and any other official who contracted Covid during poll duty or died later, as per state election commission guidelines. The poll panel rules are archaic and issued when there was no Corona. Therefore, there is need to take a fresh, sympathetic view.” Chief secretary R K Tiwari and additional chief secretary (panchayati raj) Manoj Kumar Singh have been asked to move the state election commission with a request to amend rules. The state government’s assessment for doling out compensation was based on reports from all districts, said sources. The government had fixed a compensation of Rs 30 lakh, but Allahabad HC had directed the state toreview theamount and pay Rs 1 crore to those who died during poll duty. The CM directed the chief secretary to seek a report from Election Commission in light of changed circumstances. They have been asked to seek a review of the timeframe to compensate those who fell ill during polling duty and later died of Covid. The teachers’ unions have hailed the government’s stand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogi-amend-ec-rules-for-compensation-to-teachers/articleshow/82814156.cms||Neha Lalchandani

Not taking any risk with large number of cattle in Hingonia gaushala, Animal Control Committee of JMC, Greater has written to the mayor to have all the staff tested. Arun Verma, chairman of the committee, said, “It is need of the hour to take some preventive measures. We are suggesting that all the staff members of Hingonia cowshed get tested and have random testing of cattle. This is a serious issue which should be addressed on priority. We are getting calls from some people inquiring about the status of the gaushala and it will be better if final confirmation through tests is received.” At present, thousands of stray and sick cattle are housed in Hingonia gaushala, for which over 50 people are taking care of them. The gaushala is given on contract to Akshay Patra at present. Raghupati Das, programme coordinator of Akshay Patra, said they will be happy to co-operate with the authorities. “We have full support to them. I think this will be a good idea to have everyone tested to be sure about the possible spread of virus.

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: More private hospitals may get vials, to resume vaccination next week||KOLKATA: When the state’s vaccine stock is being replenished, many private hospitals in the city are also expecting their procurement to arrive over the next few days. Many of these private centres are expected to resume their inoculation drive by next week. Two lakh doses of Covishield arrived in Kolkata on Thursday night. It was the state government’s own procurement after Bengal got 2.1 lakh doses from the Centre’s quota on Wednesday. Another consignment of 1.9 doses, which has been purchased by the state directly from the manufacturers, will be flown into the city on Friday night. “This is the first time vaccine consignments are arriving on three consecutive days. If such shipments, even in small quantities, keep coming, the vaccination drive could again pick up pace,” said an official at Swasthya Bhawan. The ILS Hospital group is expecting its order to arrive by Monday. “All units of ILS Hospitals will start vaccination drive again from next week. We also have plans to initiate ‘ work place vaccination’ at residential complexes, banks, factories and corporate offices. Proposals have been pouring in,” said Debasish Dhar, ILS Hospitals group vice-president. “We are expecting 50,000 doses of Covishield by the middle of next week and we intend to utilise about 25% of our procurement for off-site vaccination. We are getting request from several corporate houses,” said R Venkatesh, zonal director (East) Narayana Health. Fortis Hospital is expected to get vaccines in the next couple of days. The hospital’s cold chain facilities have also been evaluated for storing Sputnik V. “We would be able to re-launch the drive. While second doses will be prioritised, we are ready to expand the programme for first dose as well, which will include setting up off-site camps,” said Pratyush Srivastava, zonal director of Fortis Hospital. Currently, three private hospitals — Woodlands, Apollo and Charnock — are conducting off-site as well as on-site vaccination at their hospital. AMRI has already got a consignment of Covaxin. But sources in the hospital said that since the quantity is small, the doses are being utilised for second doses. “Around 50 corporate houses have already tied up with us for vaccinating their employees. But we need a steady supply stream before we start expanding our drive. We expect more Covaxin doses by June first week along with Sputnik V doses,” said Rupak Barua, AMRI Hospitals group CEO. Apart from AMRI, Fortis and RN Tagore too are also expected to start getting Sputnik V supply in about three weeks. “We have completed all procedures for procuring Covishield. We should be getting 3,000 doses by June-end,” said Sudipta Mitra, CEO of Peer-less Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/more-pvt-hosps-may-get-vials-to-resume-vaccination-next-week/articleshow/82809704.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

He said neighbouring states were providing free Covid-19 treatment and also arranging ambulances to the patients at nominal charges. Speaking to reporters on Thursday along with CLP leader Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka and senior leader T Jeevan Reddy, Uttam said ventilators were not available in many government hospitals. Uttam alleged that many people were dying due to the inability of chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in extending proper medical care. He said the government owes an answer to people of the state as to why it had stopped the vaccination drive. Even the RT-PCR tests were not being done so that the government could show less number of cases, he alleged. Jeevan Reddy said the TRS government had failed to put an end to ‘extortion methods’ of private hospitals. Vikramarka said the government had earlier criticised Ayushman Bharat scheme and now joined the scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/uttam-provide-free-treatment-tocovid-19-patients/articleshow/82812257.cms||---

Sharma, who was elected as BJP MLC in January this year, maintained a hotline with Prime Minister’s Office and channelized resources in Covid-hit Varanasi. “Whatever good happened in Varanasi during Covid crisis was because of directions of PM Modi and help from PMO,” Sharma tweeted on Thursday, a day after Modi lauded Varanasi’s Covid management model. In fact, Sharma has been camping in Kashi since April soon after the second wave struck. Sources said, Sharma has been closely coordinating with the state government to roll out relief in major parts of eastern UP districts, including CM Yogi’s home turf Gorakhpur. The other districts where Sharma chipped in were Jaunpur, Chandauli, Ghazipur, Azamgarh, Mau, Sant Kabir Nagar, Basti, Ballia, Mirzapur, Bhadohi, Sonebhadra, Maharajganj, Sultanpur, Kushinagar, Deoria, Ambedkarnagar, Prayagraj, Ayodhya and Siddharthnagar. A senior official in the state government said, Sharma managed to pool in CSR funds to provide around 53,000 medical kits and other aid in east UP districts. BJP sources said, Sharma worked closely with party functionaries and provided inputs on mobilising oxygen and medicines in worst-hit areas. Sources said, Sharma attended meetings with district authorities and shared his administrative experience in crisis situations. BJP had nominated Sharma, a former Gujarat cadre IAS officer, as a candidate for the UP legislative council polls on January 15, a day after he joined the party. Sharma, who took voluntary retirement as secretary of Union ministry of micro, small and medium enterprises, had worked closely with Modi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/pms-aide-at-helm-of-relief-ops-in-east-up/articleshow/82814202.cms||Pankaj Shah

---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Screening for black fungus if on oxygen therapy for over 7 days||PUNE: The state government’s latest guidelines have advised screening of a sizable chunk of hospitalized Covid-19 patients for mucormycosis immediately prior to or after the discharge. This includes patients who have had steroid, oxygen therapy and intensive care unit (ICU) stay for more than seven days in hospitals. Admitted patients with high blood sugar (above 200 mg/dL or glycated haemoglobin (HbA1C) above 8) would also be screened for the invasive fungal infection that primarily affects the sinuses. Patients who were given the anti-rheumatic drug tocilizumab must also be screened. “The objective is to detect the disease early and treat it before it spreads to vital body parts. Treating hospitals should ensure that they are screening such Covid patients without fail,” public health expert Subhash Salunke, advisor to state government on Covid-19, said. The state’s commissioner of health services and mission director, National Health Mission (NHM), issued the guidelines on May 17. “The criteria for examination on discharge by an ENT specialist and, if required, by an ophthalmologist, include any of these factors the Covid patient had during the hospital stay,” the guidelines stated. “Whether diabetic or not, increased blood sugar is the single most important factor in the development of this disease and so, sugar control is of foremost importance. Early screening to rule out mucormycosis among those who had uncontrolled sugar levels during the hospital stay is prudent,” said ENT surgeon Rajeev Yande. Tocilizumab being an immunomodulatory drug and steroids being immunosuppressant drugs too are risk factors. “Hence, early screening is advisable (for those given these drugs),” said internal medicine expert Vichar Nigam. Endocrinologist and Maharashtra task force member Shashank Joshi said seven parameters must be monitored during Covid patients’ in-home care. “A close watch on sugar levels is needed during and after Covid treatment. Efforts must be made to keep the blood glucose level between 140-180. The post-Covid period is of three months,” Joshi said. Maharashtra has recorded 1,500 cases of mucormycosis and 90 casualties so far this year. Almost 80% of the cases were detected between April 10 and May 20. The state government in a GR on May 18, has allowed free treatment of mucormycosis under its health scheme, irrespective of the patient’s financial condition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/screen-patients-for-mucormycosis-if-on-steroid-oxygen-therapy-for-over-7-days-state/articleshow/82824272.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Admitted patients with high blood sugar (above 200 mg/dL or glycated haemoglobin (HbA1C) above 8) would also be screened for the invasive fungal infection that primarily affects the sinuses. Patients who were given the anti-rheumatic drug tocilizumab must also be screened. “The objective is to detect the disease early and treat it before it spreads to vital body parts. Treating hospitals should ensure that they are screening such Covid patients without fail,” public health expert Subhash Salunke, advisor to state government on Covid-19, said. The state’s commissioner of health services and mission director, National Health Mission (NHM), issued the guidelines on May 17. “The criteria for examination on discharge by an ENT specialist and, if required, by an ophthalmologist, include any of these factors the Covid patient had during the hospital stay,” the guidelines stated. “Whether diabetic or not, increased blood sugar is the single most important factor in the development of this disease and so, sugar control is of foremost importance. Early screening to rule out mucormycosis among those who had uncontrolled sugar levels during the hospital stay is prudent,” said ENT surgeon Rajeev Yande. Tocilizumab being an immunomodulatory drug and steroids being immunosuppressant drugs too are risk factors. “Hence, early screening is advisable (for those given these drugs),” said internal medicine expert Vichar Nigam. Endocrinologist and Maharashtra task force member Shashank Joshi said seven parameters must be monitored during Covid patients’ in-home care. “A close watch on sugar levels is needed during and after Covid treatment. Efforts must be made to keep the blood glucose level between 140-180. The post-Covid period is of three months,” Joshi said. Maharashtra has recorded 1,500 cases of mucormycosis and 90 casualties so far this year. Almost 80% of the cases were detected between April 10 and May 20. The state government in a GR on May 18, has allowed free treatment of mucormycosis under its health scheme, irrespective of the patient’s financial condition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/screen-patients-for-mucormycosis-if-on-steroid-oxygen-therapy-for-over-7-days-state/articleshow/82824271.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Giving this information to TOI, RSS functionary Prashant Shukla said, “We have been in touch with doctors at various places who can help us reach out to patients. Our swayamsevaks are also in touch with patients who need oxygen. People too can contact our district offices where these oxygen concentrators have been kept.” The RSS has got the concentrators from an NGO Sewa International. The NGO, which is active in over 25 countries, has purchased the oxygen concentrators from abroad. Sewa International was started as a movement in 1993 to engage the Indian diaspora worldwide. It encouraged Indians across the world to remain connected with their roots through contribution to humanitarian causes locally and in India especially in times of natural calamities like floods, earthquakes, cyclones, tsunamis, pandemics, etc, which cause large-scale distress and need huge resources for recovery. The movement has spread its wings worldwide to more than 25 countries. In India, Sewa International was established in 1997 as a registered non-profit trust. It is headquartered in New Delhi. These days the RSS is extending support to people in need of medicines, food or ambulances.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rss-arranges-oxygen-concentrators-for-all-at-its-district-offices/articleshow/82814213.cms||Neha Shukla

Members of West Bengal Doctors’ Forum (WBDF), Sramajibi Sasthya Udyog (SSU) and West Bengal Prathibandhi Sammilani have set up the facility off EM Bypass. The Covid-19 Interim Relief Centre is not very far from R N Tagore Hospital. There are other private hospitals in the vicinity where serious patients could be shifted out if necessary. “We are in talks with some hospitals to move patients if they turned critical. The onus of finding a bed will be with the patients’ families. We are here to help them in any way we can,” Arjun Dasgupta, ENT specialist and member of WBDF, said. The facility is designed to give medical and oxygenated treatment and support to symptomatic and those with hypoxia. “We are raising funds through donations to run the set-up and pay the nurses and other associated staff,” Dasgupta said. Patients can come here through a helpline. “We doctors decided to set up the facility, considering the gravity of the situation when beds are scarce in the city and Covid patients and their families are running around, harassed to get treatment,” said Koushik Lahri, vice-president, WBDF.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/doc-bodies-social-group-set-up-cov-interim-relief-centre/articleshow/82809761.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh government bars fee hike in all schools in current session||LUCKNOW: The UP government on Thursday directed all schools, irrespective of their board affiliations not to hike fees in the current academic session, keeping interest of students and parents in mind following the Covid-19 second wave. In case of non-compliance by schools, parents or wards can lodge complaints with the district fee regulatory committee. A government order by additional chief secretary (secondary education) Aradhana Shukla stated if any school hikes fee for the new session, the additional amount will be adjusted in coming months. The fee applicable for academic session 2021-22 will be the same as followed by schools for academic session 2019-20. Deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma, who heads secondary education in the state, said many families are grappling with reduced earnings due to the Covid-induced lockdown. “This is a small effort by the government to provide relief to parents, who suffered pay cuts or have low business turnover due to the pandemic shutdown and are struggling to pay school fees,” Sharma said. The order directed schools to allow parents to pay monthly fees if they can’t submit quarterly fees at one go. Since schools have been closed for a longer duration and examinations are not being held offline, schools are barred from charging fees for examination, sports, science, library, computer and annual function. Also, schools cannot charge transport fees. Schools have been asked to consider cases where parents fail to pay fees for a specific month when they or their wards contracted Covid. In such cases, schools must seek written requests from parents and the unpaid fee should be adjusted through instalments in next months. Also, schools must ensure release of salaries to their teaching and non-teaching staff regularly. The district inspector of schools should ensure strict compliance, said the government. “We thank the government for the fee hike ban. At the same time, we request authorities to act against schools who don’t comply with the order,” said Keshav Sharma, a parent who has two kids studying in private schools in Lucknow. Office bearers of UP’s Unaided Private Schools Association (UPSA) said, schools supported parents by following government orders during the pandemic. “The latest order too will be followed in letter and spirit with the hope that parents will pay up dues monthly,” said UPSA president Anil Agarwal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-govt-bars-fee-hike-in-all-schools-in-current-session/articleshow/82814219.cms||Isha Jain

While ACB had arrested Abdul Rauf, the head constable of Bhatta Basti police station, for accepting a bribe of Rs 15000, SHO Rajendra Singh went missing. “A country-made pistol and some drugs were seized from the government quarters of the SHO. We have registered a separate case in this connection. An ACP rank officer is investigating the case. Efforts are on to trace the missing SHO,” said ACP (crime) Ajay Pal Lamba. The ACB, which believes that the role of the SHO is ‘suspicious,’ has failed to trace him. “We are preparing to send him notice for interrogation. We have got concreate clues on his role in this racket,” said a senior officer of ACB. During investigation, it was found that through the head constable, the SHO was allegedly taking a monthly bribe of Rs 20,000 from a local trader selling construction related goods. The trader had urged police authorities that due to lockdown, he was unable to earn much and could not afford to give a bribe of Rs 20,000. After the arrest of the head constable, the ACB in its searches had found one country-made pistol, 1.5 kg ganja and some knives from the government quarters of the SHO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cops-acb-fail-to-trace-bhatta-basti-sho-in-bribery-and-narcotics-case/articleshow/82812396.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Vaccine demand, thirst for travel prompt Russian holiday calls||KOLKATA: Travel agents in the city have been inundated with calls from clients expressing keen interest in travelling to Russia, either for a vacation or combining the holiday with an opportunity for the family to get vaccinated. “There is tremendous interest in a Russian vacation. People have not travelled for over a year and are desperate for a getaway. The Russian consulate in Kolkata has assured cooperation in processing the visas. We are in talks with partners in Moscow and St Petersburg and will come out with packages once the Covid situation improves and restrictions ease,” said Travel Agents Federation of India chairman (east) Anil Punjabi. However, he clarified that combining the vacation with vaccination was not possible yet as Russian authorities were yet to approve vaccination for tourists. But with Russia exporting Sputnik V vaccine and vaccinating a large section of its population successfully, there is optimism among travel agents in Russia that the country will soon allow tourists to be vaccinated to open up tourism opportunities. But there is interest in a Russian vacation even without the vaccination opportunity as travel to other countries remains extremely restricted owing to global fears about the “more contagious” Indian mutant of the coronavirus. An affluent section that has long-term visas in the UK, the US or the UAE, have already flown out there in chartered flights in early April before cases began to rise in India. But there is a sizeable section of the upper-middle class that is willing to travel to Russia for a vaccination vacation. “I received at least 30 calls in the past couple of days with customers keen to fly to Russia. They are not bothered about the budget. The only thing they seek is an assurance that they will get the vaccine,” said Travel Agents Association of India chairman (east) Manav Soni. What seems to be particularly attractive to people are reports of Sputnik V’s higher efficacy vis-a-vis both Covishield and Covaxin. While packages are expected to be priced around Rs 1.2 lakh to Rs 1.5 lakh per head for a 24-day trip, if and when Russia allows vaccination for tourists, travel agents suggest a seven-to-eight-day package of around Rs 50,000 per head to spend four days in Moscow and three in St Petersburg. There is no requirement of quarantine for travellers if they get RT-PCR tests done within 72 hours prior to departure and the report is negative. “Once the restrictions currently in place in Kolkata ease and the mo-od lifts, there will be many takers,” Soni said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vax-demand-thirst-for-travel-prompt-russian-holiday-calls/articleshow/82809767.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Popatrao Pawar’s Hiware Bazar shows the way in Covid mitigation||PUNE/NASHIK: Hiware Bazar, a village in Ahmednagar district with a population of just 1,650 people, shot into prominence more than a decade ago for its watershed and local development programmes effected through public participation. Popatrao Pawar, the village’s long-time sarpanch and the man credited with its progress, has once again shown the way, this time in handling Covid mitigation. His effort, known as the ‘Popatrao Pawar model’, drew the attention of Ahmednagar district collector Rajendra Bhosale who got the district administration to replicate it elsewhere. It also drew praise before PM Narendra Modi during a video-conferencing meeting with a group of district collectors on Thursday. Hiware Bazar, about 115km from Pune, remained Covid-free throughout the first wave between March and December last year. However, on March 20 this year, the village reported its first Covid case amid the second wave. By April 15, the village had 47 cases and two deaths — prompting Pawar and his group of committed activists to look at an effective strategy to curb the spread. By April 30, the village achieved a no-fresh infection status through a series of measures, including door-to-door surveys, tracing of people with symptoms, restricting incoming and outgoing movement, creating separate isolation centres for the infected, reducing their interaction with the local people, testing of farm workers and sustained awareness. “The district health department has not found a single new Covid positive case in its survey in the last 20 days,” Pawar told TOI over the phone, while pointing out that only one patient, infected prior to April 30, was taking treatment in hospital. Collector Bhosale said, “The model adopted by the Hiware Bazar sarpanch was an eye-opener. I had a two-hour discussion with him at the village. We later decided to replicate his model in all 1,300 gram panchayats in the district.” Both Bhosale and Pawar interacted with the gram panchayat members via video conferencing for two days where Pawar explained his model to make villages Covid-free. “My feedback is that these gram panchayats have started implementing the measures,” said Bhosale. Pawar recalled the days of the first few Covid cases in the village and said, “We set up a Covid committee and forming five separate teams involving teachers, educated youth and local leaders. They were given PPE kits, hand gloves, masks and sanitisers for the doorstep surveys, which helped identify those with symptoms. We used rapid antigen and RT-PCR tests to further identify positive people and isolate them in the village quarantine facility. We ensured proper medical care for them. I would call up the patients and their families.” The village also tested over 400 farm labourers, provided them groceries and created accommodation on the farms so that they could continue with their work, Pawar said. “We ensured that people returning from bigger places like Pune and Mumbai were quarantined. Nobody was allowed to enter the village without being tested. Because of this, we found three positive patients before they could enter the village,” he said. Pawar, however, said the village’s achievement could not have been possible without a collective effort and the support of the local youth. Speaking about Modi’s mention of Ahmednagar district’s Covid mitigation effort, Bhosale said, “We felt good as the PM praised our initiatives in combating the pandemic. Such praise means a lot in boosting the confidence of the district machinery in carrying on with our efforts in dealing with the pandemic.” Bhosale said that unlike the first wave when the district had about 75,000 Covid cases, the second wave saw a whopping 1.54 lakh cases in just 45 days or so. “Compounding the problem were issues like non-availability of medical oxygen and Remdesivir. However, the case fatality rate was 0.9% during the second wave as against 1.5% in the first. In absolute numbers, the district had over 250 more deaths than in the first wave,” he said.. Bhosale said there were three oxygen generation centres in the district to cater to about 200 Covid hospitals across the district. “Ensuring a steady supply of medical oxygen to hospitals was a tough task. Senior district officials like me would spend almost 14-15 hours a day streamlining the available medical oxygen. We started giving oxygen to hospitals based on the number of patients needing it.” Bhosale said the district stopped the home isolation policy in the second wave and set up different CCCs with a total of 20,000 beds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/donepopatrao-pawars-hiware-bazar-shows-the-way-in-covid-mitigation/articleshow/82814231.cms||Sandip Dighe

Many infected cops who are living with their families in police quarters have been sent to Covid care centre at Police Lines in Chandpole. Senior police officers are coordinating with hospitals to get beds, oxygen and remdesivir as per the requirement for affected policemen and their family. “It is one of the toughest phases for us too. At least 236 of our colleagues have tested positive. Since we are on duty, attending to people’s complaints in police stations and also checking unnecessary movement on the roads, we have been affected,” said ACP (crime) Ajay Pal Lamba said on Thursday. He added that as many cops and their family members have been found positive in the last few months, the daily attendance at police stations has been 20% down. Talking about arrangements for the infected police personnel, he said, “We have started a Covid care centre at Police Lines in which personnel with mild symptoms and living in small quarters are sent. Since they are living in small quarters we are trying to facilitate them with this Covid care so that they can spend their quarantine period away from their homes and keep their families safe.” Also, senior officers including commissioner of police, additional commissioners and DCPs have been facilitating their men to get beds, remdesivir and oxygen. “We have received more than 1,000 calls so far in which cops needed admissions in hospitals, sought oxygen and even remdesivir,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/236-city-cops-test-ve-woman-constable-dies-in-2nd-wave/articleshow/82812421.cms||Ashish Mehta

Many districts in the state had a total rainfall of 200mm and above which is not seen even during full monsoon season. However, Jaipur Met office stated that on Thursday its impact and presence was almost negligible in the state. According to the Jaipur Met office, many places in the state including Udaipur, Dungarpur, Banswara, Kota, Jhalawar and Bundi had received rainfall varying from 100mm to 200mm in the past three days due to cyclone Tauktae’s impact state. Due to continuous rainfall across the state mercury took a dip of almost 7 notches in day and night temperatures. “It drizzled throughout the day at many places which is quite unusual even during monsoon season. We have had heavy to very heavy rainfall in many districts in the state,” said an officer with the Jaipur Met office. Such was its impact that people had to switch off their air-conditioners and fans from Monday to Wednesday when the cyclone brought heavy to very heavy rainfall. On Thursday people in the state witnessed bright sunny day when the cloud cover vanished from almost every part of the state except a few districts including Dholpur, Bharatpur, Sawai Madhopur, Alwar and Sikar. “If we see normal rainfall which is seen from March 1 to May 20 which is a non-monsoon period we have 14.5mm as normal rainfall. But due to the Tauktae impact we had an average rainfall of 42.2mm,” said a Met official. In its forecast Jaipur Met office stated that mercury will take an upward swing in the state while some places are likely to get partially cloudy sky.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/udaipur/tauktae-brings-unusually-heavy-may-showers-to-raj/articleshow/82821256.cms||---

But Chaagan Dana’s dream crashed on the night of the cyclone and Tauktae made it his worst nightmare — the house turned into a grave for his 7-year-old daughter, while the other four had a providential escape. The village has a population of around 10,000, most of whom are engaged in fishing. All of them own small boats and venture out in the sea for around 15 nautical miles only. Dana’s residence at Saiyad Rajpara village, around 25km from Una town in Gir Somnath district, is worth envying — located exactly on the seashore, his house is sea facing. A labourer in the fishing industry, he was building the house in parts every year from the money he earned annually. Dana gets a fixed income of Rs 1.5 lakh every year, of which he kept some for family’s expenses and the remaining was spent on construction work. As it was pakka house, Dana’s family preferred to stay put in their home and not to go to a shelter house created by the district administration. “The first two hours of the cyclone were frightening, but while we passed through it in great fear, nothing happened. The wind speed became normal for almost an hour but suddenly it packed tremendous speed and turned deadly. My house couldn’t sustain the second onslaught,” emotionally-wrought Dana recalled between sobs, before he choked up. His uncle Ramji Rathod finished the horrific tale: “The house collapsed on his daughter Bhagavati who received severe injury on her head and ear and died immediately. Dana’s wife Lakhu and another daughter Manisha got admitted to Una hospital almost after 24 hours of the incident. They have received fractures on their legs.” Neighbour Savi Majeriya, whose family too had taken shelter at Dana’s house received injuries, recalled, “We started screaming when the house started to collapse, but nobody was in a position to come and help us. Besides me, my daughter Hetal and son Akshay and three more people were injured but could get ourselves no help or relief. The wind was howling continuously and it was the most horrific nightmare.” When the cyclone fury ebbed, neighbours rushed in to help but could do precisely little to ameriolate their woes as it was very dark sans power and even no mobile network. Only the next morning, the two most critically injured people — Dana’s wife and a daughter — could be taken to the primary health centre in a tempo at around 9am. While a few neighbours even went all the way to a neighbouring village to call up 108 ambulance, it too came only at midnight on the second day. Sarpanch of the village, Dinesh Bambhaniya said, “Nearly 80 percent houses and almost all 450 boats in the village have been damaged. Five boats are totally destroyed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/fathers-dream-nest-turns-into-grave-for-his-daughter/articleshow/82809852.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

In fact, with speculation rife over night clubs and lounges remaining shut for a long time this year too, many have already started downsizing and negotiating rents, hoping to stay afloat. Hyderabad has roughly 1,000 bars and lounges that pay an annual license fee of Rs 40 lakh to Rs 56 lakh, which is at least Rs 20 lakh more than any other metro city. While this year, given the six-month-shutdown in 2020, they were given some discount, majority of the pubs had to cough up between Rs 22 and Rs 30 lakh. Add to that are rents — ranging from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 15 lakh (depending on size) — and overhead costs which add up to another Rs 35 lakh to Rs 40 lakh, on an average. “The situation is quite bad on ground. Though most of us managed to sail through 2020 — of course with much difficulty — not many will be able to withstand this blow. We are certain to see a large number of establishments shut shop permanently,” said Ayush Agarwal, co-founder of Air Live, Jubilee Hills, that was expected to start its second space in Gachibowli last November. “We have shelved that indefinitely,” he said, urging authorities to extend some relief — especially with rents and taxes — to help the industry. Pub owners also appealed to the state to revise the license fee and bring it on par with the rest of the metro cities. “This is a good time to re-look at it given that, even after a discount, we are paying a very hefty sum. And if we are indeed shut for a few more months this year — as is being said — are coffers will run dry,” said the owner of another popular club in Jubilee Hills who has laid off 90% of his staff. Agreed Ketan Agarwal, owner of Fat Pigeon that paid Rs 30 lakh towards license fee just about a week before the night curfew was announced.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pubs-lounges-look-towards-govt-to-beat-dry-spell/articleshow/82812517.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||4 cops, 3 villagers injured during raid on illicit liquor smugglers in Patiala||Patiala: Four police personnel and three villagers, including a woman, were injured on Thursday morning at Jagatpura village in Sanaur area of Patiala district after the crime investigation agency (CIA) team carried out a raid on smugglers allegedly involved in the illicit liquor trade. Police said the raid was initially carried out on Wednesday night but was deferred for the next morning after the family members of liquor smugglers tried to overpower the team. A team of around 15 conducted the raid at 7.30 am on Thursday but was attacked by the alleged liquor smugglers, their families and neighbours, who opened fire and also pelted stones on them. Police officials claimed to have opened fire in self-defence, but villagers refuted it. Two persons took bullet hits — a cop and an alleged liquor smuggler. “A case has been registered against 35 persons, including 11 identified, under various sections of the IPC and the Arms Act. However, no arrested has been so far,” said SP (investigation) H S Hundal. Patiala SSP Sandeep Garg said, “Further investigations are on. The injured have been hospitalised and are undergoing treatment.” “Four policemen were injured and three villagers, including a woman. All seven have been hospitalised. Our police team opened fire in self-defence. The accused liquor smugglers are facing around 15 cases of illicit liquor trade, of which six also include charges under the Arms Act. The accused were also involved in robberies in Jalandhar, Patiala and other districts,” the SP added. The injured policemen have been identified as head constable Raja Singh, who got a bullet injury on his thigh, assistant sub-inspector Malwinder Singh and senior constables Harinder Singh and Gagandeep Singh. Refuting police claims of villagers opening fire, Jatinderpal Singh, a resident of Jagatpura, said, “The cops came to arrest my uncle Harbhajan Singh, who is booked under the Excise Act for consuming liquor, and not smuggling. The police team started the raid by breaking the window panes of the house and assaulting the inmates, including women and children. They fired seven rounds while alleging that villagers had started it. But we did not open fire at all.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/4-cops-3-villagers-injured-during-raid-on-illicit-liquor-smugglers-in-patiala/articleshow/82812534.cms||Bharat Khanna

The West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission recently ordered Apex Clinic Pvt Ltd in Behala, along with Good Samaritan Hospital in Park Circus and Ujjivan Hospital in New Town, to stop new admissions, following complaints of gross discrepancies in their functioning. Police said trouble broke out on Wednesday evening, when a patient was turned away. “We learnt about a group vandalizing the hospital and rushed to the spot. We also called in additional force and brought the situation under control. We are awaiting a formal complaint from the hospital, after which we will register an FIR,” said a police officer from Behala division.  Earlier that morning, the health commission had allowed the admission of three critically ill patients at the nursing home following fervent pleas by their families to health commission member Matri Bandhopadhyay. But the facility was reportedly told not to take in more patients and to put up a notice, stating admission was closed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hosp-refuses-admission-after-bar-vandalized/articleshow/82812645.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Mumbai||NCP minister, chief secretary reach ‘truce’ on pending irrigation projects||MUMBAI: A week after the alleged ‘open war’ between water resources minister from NCP Jayant Patil and chief secretary Sitaram Kunte over pending irrigation projects, it appears that truce has been reached. Patil said there was misunderstanding between him and the chief secretary over irrigation projects pending for a prolonged period. In last week’s cabinet meeting, Patil had directly targeted Kunte saying key projects were deliberately delayed and re-submitted to the planning and finance departments. “There was some misunderstanding, now all the issues raised by me in the weekly cabinet meeting have been resolved,” Patil told TOI. There was allegedly a dispute over 70 projects that were pending for a prolonged period and revised administrative approvals for three major irrigation projects in the Vidarbha region. In case of the 70 projects, Patil had submitted the entire list to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, who had forward it to Kunte for “appropriate decision”. On May 18, Kunte had presided over a high-level meeting attended by senior bureaucrats of the finance, planning and water resources departments. According to a bureaucrat, Kunte is expected to submit his report to the chief minister for the final decision in a day or two. Apparently, the main issue pertains to deciding the priority and escalated additional cost of the projects. “It was felt that the projects, which are nearing completion or will take less time, should be taken on top priority, while the water resources department has taken opposite view. It feels that the priority of the projects should be left to the department, instead of either the finance or the planning department taking the decision,” the bureaucrat said. On the revised administrative approval, the bureaucrat said the water resources department on Thursday approved the Garga and Pandhari irrigation projects in Amravati and Katepurna project in Akola district. The original cost of the Garga project was Rs 140 crore in 2008, and is now Rs 494 crore; the cost of the Katepurna project was Rs 69.97 crore in 2007, and now it is Rs 533.81 crore; and the cost of Pandhari project was Rs 179 crore in 2005, and now has increased to Rs 1,109 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ncp-minister-chief-secretary-reach-truce-on-pending-irrigation-projects/articleshow/82814268.cms||---

In a two-page letter to the CM, the association said that due to the night curfew and lockdown many bars were not even getting income to cover overheads. During the night curfew, the timing of wine shops and bars should have been separate and the bars were being kept open in the morning, when there were no patrons. “In addition to this, bars have been facing problems as many workers had returned to their native places fearing extension of lockdown,” the association said. According to the association, during the lockdown last year, each shop had lost up to Rs 30 lakh. “Since you had considered our request to extend licence (period) at that time, we were able to survive,” the letter said. While the annual tax on a bar stands at Rs 40 lakh, they need to generate that much income to stay in the business, the association pointed out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bars-want-sops-to-remain-in-business/articleshow/82812583.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Dehradun||‘Look at the absurdity of thinking’ -- Uttarakhand HC questions rationality of Centre’s oxygen distribution policy||Nainital: The Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Thursday questioned the rationality of the Centre’s oxygen distribution policy when it was informed that despite producing 350 MT of oxygen, the state is being forced to import 40% of its allocated quota of 183 MT from Durgapur and Jamshedpur. Addressing assistant solicitor general (ASG) Rakesh Thapliyal who appeared on behalf of the Centre, the bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma said, “Look at the absurdity of this thinking… I am cultivating wheat in my own house and you are telling me I can’t use my own produce but I should get it from someone else. At least I should be allowed to use my own produce.” The judges termed it a step-motherly treatment, asking the ASG “why are you making us dependent on other states?” The observations came while the court was hearing a bunch of Public Interest Litigations concerned with the state’s handling of the Coronavirus pandemic. During the hearing, health secretary Amit Negi and chief secretary Om Prakash informed the court that the state had written a letter to both the health ministry as well as advisor to Prime Minister, Bhaskar Khulbe earlier this month in this regard but they have not received any reply yet. The officers informed the court that they have not even received any response to the letter asking for around one thousand oxygen concentrators, oxygen cylinders and several other equipment either. The bench said that it is surprised that the secretary of the ministry of health is sitting over an “urgent letter” written by the chief secretary of a state. The Chief Justice added that he is surprised at the callous attitude of the Centre. The bench also expressed its displeasure over the ASG’s submission that no senior official from the health ministry could appear before the court because they were busy. “I am surprised to see that someone has the courage to say to the high court that sorry I am too busy. If he wants I will issue a summon,” said the Chief Justice. The HC had in its last hearing asked an official from the Centre to be present in the court and explain the oxygen distribution policy. At one point, the court also threatened to issue a non-bailable warrant against the officer. The court also cited some of the videos coming out from the Char Dham shrines where priests are seen to be flouting the Covid norms. The Chief Justice asked the tourism and culture secretary, Dileep Jawalkar, to take a chopper to the shrines and personally witness how the SOPs issued by the state are being flouted. “In Kedarnath and Badrinath temples, I have seen videos that social distancing is not at all being followed by the priests. Even if the deity is being worshipped, you can’t let 20 priests enter the temple. Who is the person appointed by the state to monitor this?” the Chief Justice asked. The court said that the Kumbh has already caused enough embarrassment to the state and now, with Char Dham, the country is yet again asking, “What in the world is Uttarakhand doing? Can’t Uttarakhand learn from its mistakes?” Chief Justice Chauhan said that that he feels embarrassed when his colleagues call him and ask what is happening in the state but added that he has no explanations to these questions because he is not a decision maker. “However, I am surprised that those of you who are decision makers are leaving it so carelessly as if it doesn’t bother anyone’s conscience,” he said. The court has now listed the case for further hearing on June 6.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/look-at-the-absurdity-of-thinking-uttarakhand-hc-questions-rationality-of-centres-oxygen-distribution-policy/articleshow/82807954.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Ranchi||26 Dumka workers stranded in Nepal, request CM for help||Dumka: As many as 26 labourers from Dumka district are stranded in Nepal and they put up a video on social media on Thursday, requesting the state government to rescue them. A labourer in the video said that they are stranded in a room at Gauri village in Sindhupal district. They had come to the Himalayan country around two-and-half-months ago to work in an under-construction hydel power project. However, following the deepening of the Covid-19 crisis in Nepal, their employer allegedly abandoned them. The workers also said that many of them are down with Covid for the past several days and have not been given any proper treatment. “We are in abject misery here and cannot return to our village. We have fallen sick and all of us are staying in one room. Neither the Nepal government nor the contractor is paying heed to our problems,” cried a labourer in the video. The video clip also shows saline being administered to some of them while others are lying on the floor beside them. Majority of those labourers belong to Ramgarh block. One Sachidanand Soren, a local social activist who was first contacted by these labourers for help, said that these 26 labourers are part of a group of 50 workers who were brought home from Nepal by the Jharkhand government during the first wave of the pandemic. “They had again gone back to Nepal for work,” he added. Upon contact, the district administration appeared clueless about the incident. “I am yet to be approached by either the labourers or their family members," Ramgarh’s block development officer Amal Ji said, adding that the district authorities would enquire about the stranded labourers by visiting their families. The district labour superintendent, Shailendra Kumar, was unaware of their plight as well while Dumka deputy commissioner Rajeshwari B could not be contacted. Amal-Ji said that the labourers tend to migrate to other places for want of higher wages. “We have been offering MGNREGA jobs to the local labourers that too in their respective villages. Out of the total 26,000 active workers across 27 panchayats, around 8,000 are engaged in the rural employment schemes," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/26-dumka-workers-stranded-in-nepal-request-cm-for-help/articleshow/82809622.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The cops recovered 32 motorbikes from the gang that had been committing the crimes in Vadodara over the last many months. According to the police, the gang used to steal the vehicles and sell them off to earn some quick money. The accused have been identified as Jiluba Chavda, Sohail Malek and Gajendra Chavda; all residents of Khambat in Anand. “We had received information that one of the gang members was planning to sell a stolen motorbike following which our team picked the accused,” said the police. When questioned, the gang admitted to having stolen several vehicles. The police recovered five two-wheelers from Diluba’s home, four from Sohail’s house and three from Gajendra’s place. The trio told the cops that they had stolen total 32 vehicles worth Rs 8.86 lakh. All the motorbikes have been recovered by the police. The gang stole the vehicles from Gorwa, Fatehgunj, Sama, Manjalpur, Makarpura, J P Road, Harni, Padra and Karjan. The police is now investigating if the gang was involved in any other crimes in the past.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/gang-of-vehicle-thieves-busted-32-bikes-recovered/articleshow/82806787.cms||---

Under this system, the fine amount will be collected through electronic transfer to avoid physical exchange currency notes and payment receipts. The cops will be provided with 50 handheld devices to collect fines. Cops of the rank assistant commissioners of police, police inspectors and sub-inspectors will be able to collect the fines for 51 offences in a contactless manner. Those who don’t want to pay through electronic mode, will be able to pay cash as well.

---||Ranchi||Jharkhand moves SC to get nod for own vax app||RANCHI: The Jharkhand government on Thursday moved the Supreme Court to scrap the Centre's Co-WIN app, saying it is too technical apart from the lack of digital literacy, smartphones and internet connectivity in rural areas of the state. The government also pleaded with the apex court to allow the use of its "user-friendly app amritvahini.in" for the purpose of vaccinating people in the age group of 18 to 44 years for free in the state. In a petition filed before the apex court signed on May 16 in Delhi, the state government said CoWIN app requires too many paraphernalia which is not possible for all to comply with. The state is inhabited largely by tribals and has seen low human development indices apart from suffering from a low digital literacy rate. Under its Phase III drive of the vaccination policy for 18 to 44 years, the state government targets to inoculate 1.4 crore beneficiaries. However, many of these beneficiaries are not tech-savvy as they are from the rural areas and coupled with the lack of internet access, the Centre’s app will hamper the drive, the government said. According to the petition, the Amritvahini portal has a unique feature allowing both online and offline registration. The system allows "walk-in" for the beneficiary and will reduce the waiting period at a vaccination centre, it said. Additionally, a beneficiary doesn't need to register and get the vaccine at a particular centre but at his or her closest centre, unlike the Co-WIN app, the petition added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jharkhand-moves-sc-to-get-nod-for-own-vax-app/articleshow/82810674.cms||---

Sharma said among the beneficiaries, most people are aged between 18-44 years. The vaccination drive for the beneficiaries of this age group began in Jharkhand from May 14. Besides the Ranchi airport, special camps are currently running in state government secretariats in Nepal House and in Project Building, Jharkhand Vidhan Sabha and the Jharkhand high court. “These are temporary camps and will be closed once all the employees at the respective offices are vaccinated,” Ranchi civil surgeon Dr Vinod Kumar said on Thursday. He added that these camps have been set up at the instructions of the state health department. The special camps come at a time when all the 596 session sites meant for vaccinating beneficiaries in the 18-44 age group across the state are witnessing long queues. On the other hand, the state government is mulling the closure of several session sites across the state owing to depleting stocks. “In Ranchi, we do not have shortage of vaccines. None of our session sites have been shut. The beneficiaries who have registered and booked their slots are getting their jabs,” district immunisation officer SB Khalko said. Khalko, however, said that the special camps will not offer on the spot registrations for non-government employees and their family members. However, senior officials said that there is an acute shortage of Covishield vaccines in the district. “The little we have is being used to provide second doses to those above 45 years,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/special-vax-camps-for-airport-staff-govt-employees-in-ranchi/articleshow/82809644.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Ranchi division suspends 3 rail staff after derailment of Rourkela-bound train||RANCHI: The Ranchi railway division of South Eastern Railways (SER) on Thursday suspended three railway personnel posted at Kanaroan railway station in Simdega district and constituted a high-powered committee to probe the reasons behind the mishap of the Hatia-Rourkela passenger train. Sources in the division said among the suspended personnel are Kanaroan station master Mukesh Kumar, points-man Rishikesh Singh and cabin man Aman Kumar. “Depending on the outcome of the committee’s inquiry, further action will be taken against the railway personnel if they are found guilty of dereliction of duty,” a senior official said. Around 8:20pm on Wednesday evening, the Rourkela-bound passenger train from Hatia deviated from its main line and rolled into a slip siding line. Breaking through the wall, the train’s engine rolled into soft earth and stopped 50 metres short of the local Dev Nadi River. As many as 84 Rourkela-bound passengers were on board the train when the mishap occurred. The loco pilot and assistant loco pilot of the train sustained mild injuries. “The train had just chugged out of Kanaroan station and its momentum was comparatively lesser. Hence, the engine came to a halt and stopped in the soft earth along with two coaches. If the momentum was high, the train could have dived straight into the river and led to a disaster,” a senior official said on Thursday. A relief train, which left Hatia with experts, senior officials and equipment around 9:15pm, reached Kanaroan around 11:15pm. Two hours later, six coaches were separated from the stranded train and were sent to Rourkela with the passengers after tugging it to another engine which arrived from Rourkela. On Thursday evening, another coach from the stranded engine was separated and sent to Hatia station. However, the engine, which is badly damaged and weighs over 120 tons, will be pulled out of the earth on Friday, officials said. “None of the passengers was injured in the mishap. We are probing from all angles to find out the reasons behind the accident,” Ranchi divisional railway manager Neeraj Ambasth said. Preliminary probe, however, points at human error. Railway sources said the train was stopped in Kanaroan a bit longer than its stoppage time to give pass to a freight train as signalling systems were reporting a snag. The cabin man reportedly gave the train’s pilots a manual route chart. However, giving the protocols a miss, the points-man did not link the train’s route with the main line before the pilots were given the route chart. When the train started, it rolled into the siding line instead of the main line.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/ranchi-div-suspends-3-rail-staff-after-derailment-of-rourkela-bound-train/articleshow/82810464.cms||Dhritiman Ray

Popularly known as the ‘medicine man’, Dhananjay Kumar Putush, who calls his initiative ‘Aao madad kare’ (come let’s help one another), delivers medicines, vegetables and ration to around 20 persons daily. Every morning, after the Covid patients inform him of their requirements on the helpline number, he hops onto his scooter and leaves for the market to buy medicines and other items. Impressed by his noble gesture, most of the shopkeepers now give him a handsome discount to support the cause. When asked what prompted him to take up the cause, Dhananjay, who is the president of Ramgarh Bachao Sangharsh Samiti, said, “A few months ago, I received a call from a couple admitted at a Covid care centre in Ramgarh, requesting for help. I delivered some medicines and food items to them, which made me think that there could be hundreds like them requiring help and I decided to launch the Ao Madad Kare initiative.” He added, “I shared my contact number (9835971420) on social media, asking the Ramgarh residents to get in touch with me if they need medicines or ration. Many of thbe patients don’t have anyone to help at home and most of the calls come from them.” His work has earned him the accolade of former chief minister Babulal Marandi who tweeted his picture recently and called him ‘a real Covid hero’. As many as 2 of his school friends have also joined the initiative now and are extending financial support to the cause.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/covid-patients-in-ramgarh-dial-medicine-man-for-help/articleshow/82810604.cms||N K Agarwal

The probe was initiated after TOI reported the matter. The uncle of the dead patient, Kumar Rounak, complained that he has been getting regular calls about his nephew testing positive even after his death on May 1. Zeeshan Qamar, nodal officer for Covid testing in state, said: “We have instructed the 104 control room to remove the deceased’s data from the call centre so that the family does not get any calls inquiring about him. We have also forwarded the matter to the Ranchi district administration for investigation.” According to ICMR portal, the SRF ID for the message received by Rounak’s family on Wednesday was generated by a lab of CCL Central Hospital, Gandhinagar. When TOI visited the hospital on Thursday, the lab officials said they did not collect the samples of any Kumar Rounak on May 19. “The name is not in our records for the last month,” a lab staff said. Dr D K L Chouhan, in-charge of the hospital, said: “We will conduct an investigation into the data mismatch.” The Ranchi district administration has also started a probe into the matter. “We are trying to get to the bottom of this,” Ranchi SDM Utkarsh Gupta said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/probe-begins-in-dead-mans-covid-test-case/articleshow/82809612.cms||Gaurav Pandey

Last week, the bishop of Simdega diocese Father Vincent Barwa of the Roman Catholic Church issued an appeal to the residents to take the jabs to ward off the infection. Following his footsteps, many other priests are now urging people to take the shots and not to believe in rumours surrounding the vaccines. Father Sanjay Kujur of Kasdega-Pandripani village, said, "Rural people especially tribals are reluctant to take the vaccine as they have misconceptions about it. They feel that they will fall sick if they take the vaccine. Some also believe that the vaccines are not effective after hearing about fake posts on social media." The clergy, who heads the St Clement Dadhjharnaa institute that provides skill development training to rural women, is optimistic that the situation will slowly improve in the villages. "We are spreading the message orally as they trust us and we are doing all that is needed to motivate them." He added that about 30 villagers took the vaccine on the premises of his institute. Similarly, Father Marianus of Kusumbeda church in Thethaitnagar block and Father Paulus Bage, principal of RC Middle School in Karangagudu village, the hockey hub, are taking up awareness campaigns. After Bage took the vaccine, 30 others, including nuns and panchayat representatives among others of the village took their first doses on Wednesday. Bage, who is also a parish priest, asked the villagers to take the vaccine without any hesitancy. Simdega GEL church bishop M Bilung is also appealing to people to take the vaccine. He said, “All priests and functionaries will soon take the jab at a special camp.” Simdega SDO Mahendra Kumar also held a meeting with Bilung on vaccination the drive on Wednesday. Kumar, who has been inspecting vaccination centres and meeting religious priests of all communities in the district, said," The priests are inspiring the people to take the vaccine and contributing to the inoculation drive in the district.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/church-leaders-in-simdega-motivate-villagers-to-take-jab/articleshow/82809693.cms||K A Gupta

The chief minister, who addressed the assembly after the 2021-22 budget was presented in the House, said the government has been doing its best to contain the pandemic and improve health infrastructure in the state. “The government plans to set up 53 oxygen plants in community health centres across the state. There was not a single testing centre when the Covid-19 hit the state in March last year. We have established 150 testing laboratories in the last one year with the state conducting over one lakh tests daily. The number of Covid hospitals has also been increased to 649 in the last one year with an overall capacity of 47,285 beds,” Jagan said. The government has so far spent Rs 2,229 crore on Covid care alone, he informed. “AP was also the first state to float global tenders to procure vaccines. Vaccination would be administered to all people in the state free of cost once the required quantity of vaccines is procured,” he added. Earlier, governor Biswabhushan Harichandan opened the budget session with a virtual address from the Raj Bhavan. Expressing concern over the severity of the second wave of Covid-19, he said the country has been witnessing more deaths during the second wave. “But life has to go on despite the pandemic. I appeal to all to strictly adhere to Covid-19 guidelines to contain the spread of this deadly virus and save the human race,” he said. The House passed a resolution thanking the governor for his address, besides passing appropriation bills and four bills connected to health and municipal administration, following which speaker Thammineni Sitaram adjourned the House sine die.

Japan, Germany, the US, China, and Singapore account for nearly 55% of the total medical devices imported by Vietnam. The domestic market comprising about 50 manufacturers contributes less than 10% to the market share. “Vietnam appears among the top markets in India’s exports of medical devices and also acts as a springboard to the ASEAN countries,” said Desai in his introductory remarks at India-Vietnam Business Meet in the medical devices sector. With demand for medical equipment growing, Vietnam’s medical device industry has emerged as one of the most promising sectors for foreign investors. The local government has offered tax incentives to promote the industry. “Many Indian manufacturers of medical devices and pharmaceuticals have already entered and invested in the Vietnam market which is a very positive sign,” said Desai. Madan Mohan Sethi, Consul General of India in Vietnam, said that the South-East Asian country’s medical device industry is one of the most promising sectors for foreign investment due to the country’s economic development and rising demand for adequate medical care and equipment. “There is a lot of untapped potential in this area (medical devices sector). The COVID-19 crisis has given an opportunity to both sides to join hands and set up alternative global supply chains in different products that have been disrupted by the pandemic,” said Sethi in his special address.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/vietnam-potential-export-mkt-for-medical-devices-eepc/articleshow/82813181.cms||---

FAITH has suggested initiating the process of undertaking a review and rationalisation of GST applicable across different aspects of the Indian tourism, travel & hospitality industry. It said that this rationalisation will enable some rationale support once the tourism industry attempts to begin its long crawl back from the pandemic. The tourism body has suggested that hotels be allowed to charge IGST which will enable seamless availability of credit across India to all travel agents and tour operators and will thereby lead to building up a sustainable domestic holidays,meetings and conventions business within the country. It has also urged that tour operators to be enabled a special presumptive GST rate of 1.8% with full GST setoffs. “The current rate of 5% without setoffs structurally implies that tour operators have an inbuilt margin of around 27.8% which is an inherently flawed assumption in the internet economy. Travel Agents be also allowed the option of exploring the reseller model for charging as they are distribution arms for airlines,” it added. FAITH also feels that tourist transporters be allowed the provision for availing GST setoffs on interstate Tourist transport taxes, taxes on parking fees and on taxes on fuel which is their biggest input cost· “Restaurants should be also allowed the option of charging GST at 12% with full input tax credits and the rate should be delinked from any room tariffs if they are part of hotels,” it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/apex-tourism-body-suggests-rationalisation-of-value-chain/articleshow/82813224.cms||---

---||Vijayawada||Committee recommends clinical trial of herbal cure for Covid-19 in Vijayawada||NELLORE: A committee comprising senior officials and ayurvedic professionals has recommended clinical trials on the controversial ‘Krishnapatnam herbal medicine’ for Covid-19. The committee confirmed that oxygen saturation level has been rising after the administration of the herbal eye drops. The committee, however, said it could not confirm if the saturation level was only due to the medicine. It also observed that the herbs used for the preparation of the medicine could be harmful for eyesight in the long run since it is being directly administered into eyes as part of Covid-19 treatment. It, however, said that no one was found to have adverse complications after taking the medicine. Legislator Kakani Goverdhan Reddy has announced resuming the distribution of the medicine under pressure from people notwithstanding the district collector’s directive to stop distribution. The official committee suggested the district administration to conduct clinical trial on Covid-19 patients in Covid care centres without giving them any other medicine. “Although the person who is preparing the drug, B Anandaiah, is not a qualified medical professional, and the formula not a standard recipe, public have not raised any complaints against the drug,” said district collector KVN Chakradhar Rao. He said the medicine samples and the joint enquiry report were sent to the Ayush department and lab at Vijayawada for further investigation. Following uproar about the use of unscientific medicine for Covid treatment, Lokayukta Justice A Lakshman Reddy had directed district collector KVN Chakradhar Rao to immediately stop the distribution of the medicine two days ago. The collector set up a six-member committee comprising district medical and health officer Dr S Rajya Lakshmi, district panchayat officer M Dhana Lakshmi, local revenue divisional officer and three ayurvedic professionals, Dr G Gangadharam (Rasa Sastra), Dr K Sekhar (Kaya Chikitsa) and Dr K Raja Narsimha (Dravya Guna) to take up a preliminary enquiry. The committee went to Krishnapatnam village and interacted with Borigi Anandaiah, chief maker of the medicine and local people. The committee also examined the herbs and other components being used for medicine preparation. Anandaiah, who served as sarpanch and MPTC in the past, told the officials that he was distributing five different formulations for different complications. He said the medicine was given as a prophylactic and treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/committee-recommends-clinical-trial-of-herbal-cure-for-covid-19/articleshow/82808902.cms||Samdani MN

The latest development is, of course, part of Iran’s own efforts to develop the gas field and our consortium is in touch with Iranian authorities,” he added. The Iranian oil ministry’s official news service Shana reported three days ago that the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) signed a contract worth nearly $1.8 billion with Petropars Group on May 17 for the development of the Farzad B gas field in the Persian Gulf. ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL), the overseas investment arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), had in 2008 discovered the gas field in the Farsi offshore exploration block.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/iran-wants-to-rope-in-india-later-for-gas-project-government/articleshow/82818246.cms||---

The government will set up 15 pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen plants in the region on war-footing. The government has allotted 50 per cent of the PAS plants to Rayalaseema as most major oxygen plants in the state are far away from the region. A fortnight ago, 11 people lost their lives at government general hospital at Tirupati due to shortage of oxygen. Zone-I comprising five districts Srikakulam, Vizianagaram, Visakhapatnam, East Godavari and West Godavari will get 5 PSA plants. Zone-II with four districts Krishna, Guntur, Prakasam and Nellore will get 10 plants. The government has issued guidelines for setting up the plants under new oxygen policy. “We have decided to set up manufacturing units for producing medical oxygen based on PSA (pressure swing adsorption) in both captive model and non-captive model. At least 30 units will come up under non-captive model,” said special chief secretary (industries) R Karikal Valaven. He said the government has planned two units, one each in zone-II and zone-III for producing medical oxygen based on Liquid Oxygen Technology (LOx) with an augmented capacity of at least 100MT. He said that one plant with a capacity of at least 50 MT in the state for manufacturing Helium mixed oxygen (Heliox) for medical uses has also been planned. The government has also decided to grant incentives to reopen and operate some of the closed PSA plants due to non-viability. “A few units which are installed based on the PSA technology and shut down due to financial non–viability will be brought into operation by granting incentives to the operators,” said Valaven.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/rayalaseemas-oxygen-infra-set-for-a-boost/articleshow/82808928.cms||Samdani MN
---||Delhi||Delhi: Number of Covid +ve children at LNJP 4 times more than in last wave||NEW DELHI: Lok Nayak Hospital has this time, compared to last year, recorded four times higher admissions of Covid-affected children between eight and 15 years. In the past two months, 29 children have been admitted and three of them required oxygen support while during last year's third wave, only around seven to eight kids had been admitted. In the absence of data to establish whether this is because of a proportional increase in the number of Covid cases during the fourth wave (second wave for the country) or because of the fourth wave being relatively dangerous for the kids, the authorities are trying not to leave things to chance. There is widespread concern that the next coronavirus wave could affect more children. Testing ramped up for kids showing symptomsTo strengthen the paediatric wing, the hospital has recently added six paediatric ventilators to the 15 it already had. The symptoms of Covid in kids include diarrhoea, fever, viral pneumonia and irritability. Some also experience a fall in oxygen saturation. Cases of kids testing positive for Covid are trickling in from various districts unlike past year. A senior government official said this year more and more kids are being tested for coronavirus and positive cases are emerging. “We are consistently doing contact tracing and all the children who are identified as contacts, including those below six years of age, are being tested. Last year children below six years of age were generally not tested because they usually did not develop symptoms. We have observed a trend that more kids who have been exposed to coronavirus-infected persons are developing symptoms,” said the officer. “We are still studying the data and in twothree days, we can give more details.” The medical director of Lok Nayak Hospital, Suresh Kumar, said the hospital has assembled a team of 15 paediatricians and is evaluating the situation. “None of the 29 kids turned critical and around 22 of them have been discharged after successful treatment. The number is far more as compared to last year when many of the kids were those born to Covid-positive mothers. We are evaluating the situation and will take appropriate action according to the demands of the situation,” he said. The Delhi government has decided to form a special task force and make arrangements in advance for beds, oxygen and other medical infrastructure amid fears of a third Covid wave which could affect children. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday held a meeting with senior officials to chalk out plans in this regard. The special task force will comprise paediatricians, other experts and senior IAS officers. Dr Arun Gupta, president of Delhi Medical Council, said it is believed that the third wave may affect more children because the second wave affected more youth. That is the source of this belief, he said. “In adults, many people are either infected or have been vaccinated. The natural immunity of children is lesser as compared to the adults and hence they are vulnerable,” said Gupta. He added that infection among the children will also depend on adult behaviour and hence they must strictly follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. The children are yet to be vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-number-of-covid-ve-children-at-lnjp-4-times-more-than-in-last-wave/articleshow/82818255.cms||AlokKNMishra

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Out-of-work house helps stare at uncertain future||VIJAYAWADA: The second wave of Covid-19 has had a massive impact on livelihoods of people working in the unorganised sector. Of these, one of the professions that have taken the hardest hit is domestic work. As households sack helps for fear of pandemic spread, domestic workers across the state are finding it difficult to eke out a living. Domestic work is a major source of employment for women in urban areas. It is estimated that around 20,000 women in Vijayawada depend on domestic work. Most work in multiple households. Only a couple of years ago, there was a huge demand for domestic workers in Vijayawada. Many homes would put up signboards or give ads in newspaper classifieds to find suitable househelps. Domestic workers would charge anything upward of Rs 3,000 a month for dusting and mopping a 2BHK flat. But the pandemic has changed the lives of these domestic workers. “I used to work in five houses and earn around Rs 14,000 a month. But four families removed me from work due to fear of Covid-19. My husband, a mason worker, is sitting idle at home because of the partial lockdown. We are finding it difficult to run our family,” said K Nancharamma, a domestic worker from NTR Colony. “As many people are working from home, they are managing to do house work. Many families are also showing interest towards appliances such as dishwashers and robotic mops which will permanently abolish the need for domestic workers,” said A Ranganaykulu, an AITUC functionary. Ranganaykulu demanded that the government announce a special assistance package for domestic workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/out-of-work-househelps-stare-at-uncertain-future/articleshow/82809248.cms||Venu Lanka

Some states including Rajasthan and Telangana have already made it a notifiable disease. A notifiable disease means the government has to be mandatorily informed about all cases. This will enable it to collect data, analyse the surge and initiate policy as well as clinical measures to tackle the issue. Apart from Covid-19, tuberculosis, cholera and diphtheria are among the other notifiable diseases in the country. The ministry has also asked all government and private health facilities, medical colleges to follow guidelines for screening, diagnosis, management of mucormycosis, issued by the ministry and ICMR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/notify-mucormycosis-under-epidemic-act-centre-to-states-as-cases-rise/articleshow/82818309.cms||---
---||Goa||Concretising Vainguinim beach wall is illegal, nod only for repair: Coastal body||Panaji: Despite findings of a two-member expert committee that an ongoing construction of a wall at Vainguinim beach, Dona Paula, is illegal and the concrete should be removed, the work has continued during the last few days, residents alleged. Vainguinim Valley Residents Association and Bhanu Shirodkar, a Nagalli resident, had lodged a complaint with Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA) on behalf of local fishermen against the hotel carrying out the concretisation work on the beach. “The work still continues brazenly and no stop work order has been issued so far,” a villager said. The coastal body had deputed two expert members, Sujeetkumar Dongre and Savio Correia to carry out a site inspection at Vainguinim beach on April 23. The committee’s report concluded that the party had violated the conditions, as cement concrete was used instead of eco-friendly material. Cement concrete structures are prohibited on the beach and that too, within inter-tidal zone Coastal Regulation Zone (IB)—a highly ecological area, the report stated. Further, the report stated that the construction of the linear wall along the beach is a new work and not repairs under no-objection certification obtained by the party. The expert members had recommended issuance of stop work order to prevent further damage to the ecologically fragile inter tidal zone. They suggested restoration of the beach to its original condition, stating that the excavated beach area also needs nourishment. The inspection was attended by a few villagers, sarpanch Agnelo D Cunha, panchayat secretary, panch members and representatives of the association. The panchayat had stated that it has not granted any permission for the work. GCZMA had granted permission for repairs to gadaga wall and a linear wall in the property bearing survey number 246/1, source said. A representative for the party while submitting copies of the approvals of the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority for repairs, denied the allegations and maintained that the work was being carried out as per the permission in phases. The design was prepared in consultation with the water resources department, he stated. GCZMA had issued a showcause notice recently to the party, stating that the entire zone is designated as a no-development zone, being within 100m and hence no construction is permissible. “The allegedly illegal construction is highly detrimental to the coastal and riverine ecosystem,” the notice stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/concretising-vainguinim-beach-wall-is-illegal-nod-only-for-repair-coastal-body/articleshow/82811929.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: ‘Repair undertaken with Water Resources Department permits’||PANAJI: Countering allegations that it is carrying out concretisation of the beach illegally at Vainguinim, a representative for Fomento said that the area under which the retaining wall is being repaired is owned by the hotel company and that this retaining wall has been in existence for over five decades. “The hotel does not gain in anyway by compromising the beach, and the retaining wall is only to protect the erosion as it has been doing all this time. In 2017, due to heavy rains over the previous years, portion of the retaining wall began collapsing/breaking. The hotel received permission from Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA). On receipt of such permission, work began in 2017 in consultation with the Water Resource Department (WRD),” senior general manager, HR, Fomento, Colonel Arun Sharma, said. Sharma said that as work continued further cracks appeared in the retaining wall and collapses occurred over the past two years and each part was accordingly dealt with as per the permission and in consultation with the WRD. “Despite the work being conducted, only recently, certain individuals had come to the site and threatened our workers and filed complaints before the authorities. The authorities immediately, on receipt of their complaint, conducted a site inspection on April 20, 2021, by the GCZMA, and the report (conducted by an expert member and officer of the GCZMA) confirmed that the work was conducted in line with the permission,” Sharma said. During the course of this time, the WRD also conducted a site inspection and have confirmed that construction is being conducted in line with the plans submitted to the department. “A showcause notice was issued by GCZMA (based on the complaint) in response to which we have submitted our initial response. GCZMA has not in any way directed that the work at site be stopped. During the course of attempts by certain persons to take law in their own hands, an injunction was directed by the district court, Panaji, ordering these persons from in any way stopping the construction work of this retaining wall and taking the law in their own hands,” Sharma said, adding that this injunction is in force at present. It is imperative that this work be completed before the onset of the monsoon, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/repair-undertaken-with-wrd-permits/articleshow/82812003.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa police seeks OK for promotions through board||PANAJI: Goa police has moved a proposal to the state government to allow police establishment board (PEB) to carry out promotions of police personnel till the rank of deputy superintendent of police (DySP).  A senior officer from the law department said the promotions should be done as per the direction of the apex court. “We are examining the proposal from Goa police. We have not given any opinion on the proposal,” he said.  In March, the state government had changed the rules to allow the Goa Public Service Commission (GPSC) to promote police sub-inspectors (PSI) to the post of police inspectors (PI). Earlier, the Police Establishment Board used to conduct promotions of PSIs. At present, the GPSC carries out promotions of PIs and DySPs.  The state government said that after the completion of the two-year probation and five years of regular service, PSIs should be promoted to the post of PI. The state government has not taken any decision on the proposal of Goa police to amend the existing PSI recruitment rules so that assistant sub-inspectors (ASIs), with minimum two years of regular service, could be promoted as PSIs.  Police officers have sought a direction from the high court to the state government to fill the DySP posts entirely through promotions.  Last month, the high court of Bombay at Goa admitted a petition filed by 14 police inspectors seeking filling up of posts of deputy superintendent of police (DySP) only by promotion. The court said that the filling up of DySP posts through direct appointment shall be subject to the final orders that may be made in the petitions.  The state government had decided to fill DySP posts -- 50% through direct recruitment and 50% by promotions. It has sanctioned 40 DySP posts to Goa police, out of which 21 are proposed to be filled by direct recruitment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-police-seeks-ok-for-promotions-through-board/articleshow/82812035.cms||---
