---||Mumbai||The Mumbai teacher who ferries the sick in his ambulance-rickshaw||‘Not all heroes wear capes’ — we've seen this saying come true when citizens turned saviours in the ongoing pandemic. One such person is Dattatray Sawant — the Ghatkopar-based English teacher has converted his autorickshaw into an ambulance to ferry COVID patients to the hospital, which he initiated on April 15. Since then, he has helped countless sick people get to emergency wards, ensured others make it on time for their weekly medical treatments and taken those who have recovered from the illness, back home. He opted to drive a rickshaw after facing pay cuts in his teaching job with a school, owing to the pandemic. ‘When I take a COVID patient to hospital only he/she is allowed to ride in the rickshaw’Dattatray was moved by the plight of people who could not manage to get help in the pandemic. He says, “I had been hearing many stories of ambulances charging high rates for their services. With job scarcity and hand-to-mouth existence at such times, how are people going to afford them? In some cases, the ambulances don’t arrive on time due the high demand that they have to field. I decided that I had to do something to help them.” He converted a rickshaw that he was driving into a makeshift ambulance and has taken on the task of helping people, including COVID patients, get to the hospital on time. He dons a PPE kit, sanitises the autorickshaw regularly and takes just one person at a time in his rickshaw. He informs, “When I take a COVID patient to hospital only he/she is allowed inside, while the relative or guardian follows in another rickshaw.” The 47-year-old operates in Ghatkopar East and West for now. “It’s a 24-hour ambulance; I get more calls after 10 pm, but I never refuse anyone,” informs Dattatray, adding that some of his patients include those who are on dialysis and have to be taken to hospital thrice a week. Fittings like the plastic curtains at the sides, the oximeter, temperature gun, etc are removed when the rickshaw is not ferrying the ailing. ‘Seva mein jo khushi hoti hai voh koi aur cheez mein nahi’Dattatray had to make a switch from being a teacher to a part-time rickshaw driver as the going got tough during the pandemic. “We ended up receiving just 20 per cent of our salary following the huge pay cuts by the school. It was not enough to sustain our family — my son is studying Science in Class 12 in our native place, plus the rent comes to about Rs 7,000. My wife used to teach special children, but that school got closed. So, I am the only earning member of the family,” he says. While the teacher-turned-rickshaw driver has paid a large chunk of the fittings through his own pocket, the oximeter and the temperature gun have been donated. He adds, “The Mumbai Cricket Association give me weekly money for the fuel, which is a big help. The greatest reward, however, is when a patient reaches the hospital in time. I have decided that even after the COVID-19 pandemic ends, I will continue providing the ambulance service from 10 pm to 5 am to Mumbaikars. Jab tak zindagi rahegi, tab tak. Seva mein jo khushi hoti hai voh koi aur cheez mein nahi. I am just a simple teacher doing something small, but if everyone lends a helping hand in their own way, Mumbai will be up and running again soon.” Netizens laud his effortsCricketer VVS Laxman featured among people who took to social media to praise Dattatray’s work. He tweeted: “Dattatray Sawant, a school teacher by profession and a part-time autorickshaw driver, gives free rickshaw rides to COVID patients. He picks up and drops patients from hospital without charging them. Hats off to his noble initiative. Pray that we overcome this soon (sic).”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/the-mumbai-teacher-who-ferries-the-sick-in-his-ambulance-rickshaw/articleshow/82683884.cms||Ismat Tahseen

The CoWin authorities said if an online appointment has already been made for a second dose of Covishield as per the previous schedule, it would remain valid and a shot can be received as planned. However, vaccination centres are turning away even those with valid appointments and this part of the directive may need to be made clear to state health departments. “Online appointments that have been already booked for second dose of Covishield will remain valid and are not being cancelled by CoWin. We have also asked states and UTs to honour the appointments booked prior to the change in dosing interval, mainly to avoid any inconvenience,” a senior official said. Now on, further online or on-site appointments for second dose can be booked only with a gap of at least 84 days from the first dose. “We also urge those who have already booked an appointment for second dose, and their scheduled period is less than 84 days, to reschedule their slot,” the official added. For instance, if you received your first dose of Covishield on April 4, CoWin will show a due date of June 27 and last date of July 25 for your second dose. Similarly, those who received the first dose of Covishield on April 8 will be now due for their second dose between July 1 and July 29. On May 13, the Centre had extended the gap between the first and second doses of Covishield vaccine to 12-16 weeks based on recommendations of the Covid Working Group chaired by N K Arora. “The government of India has communicated this change to states and UTs. The CoWin digital portal has also been reconfigured to reflect this extension of interval for two doses of Covishield, manufactured by Serum Institute of India to 12-16 weeks,” the health ministry said. States have also been advised to undertake awareness activities to inform recipients about the changed dosing schedule. The dosing schedule for Covaxin remains unchanged. The second dose of Covaxin can be taken four to six weeks after the first.

A Rajya Sabha MP who was also the AICC in-charge of party affairs in Gujarat, Satav was close to Rahul Gandhi and was earlier the president of Indian Youth Congress. He was nominated to RS in 2020 and was an MP in Lok Sabha from 2014-19. Satav, 46, tested positive for Covid-19 on April 22 and was hospitalised in Pune owing to complications. He was believed to have been improving before his health deteriorated suddenly a couple of days ago. Condoling his death, Rahul tweeted, “I’m very sad at the loss of my friend Rajeev Satav. He was a leader with huge potential who embodied the ideals of the Congress. It’s a big loss for us all. My condolences and love to his family.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mp-and-close-rahul-aide-satav-dies-of-covid-in-pune/articleshow/82692934.cms||---
---||India||PM poster row: Rahul says ‘arrest me’, cops point at AAP role||NEW DELHI: Even as Delhi Police said that the probe into posters running down Prime Minister Narendra Modi over vaccine supplies had shown the involvement of several AAP members in violation of lockdown rules, the issue took a political turn with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi tweeting “arrest me too”. Congress protests against the arrests in the case saw the party using the “Modi ji why did you send vaccines meant for our children abroad” line widely on social media. Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra made it their Twitter profile picture and party spokesman Pawan Khera said the PM was bound to be asked questions because he had centralised all decision-making since the onset of the pandemic, and had sought credit for “disproving” the forecast of a “tsunami” of infections. AAP functionary Durgesh Pathak told the media that the police were harassing party workers for putting up the posters. “Today, when the people of India are asking why Modi ji sent vaccines abroad... Modi ji’s Delhi Police is registering FIRs and sending our workers to jail,” he said. Delhi Police, meanwhile, said its probe showed the role of AAP functionaries who organised and financed a “defacement campaign” in violation of the lockdown guidelines. Many AAP volunteers were directly involved in putting up the posters and also paid people to violate the lockdown norms and fix the pictures, the police claimed. The probe indicated that large sums of money were spent to open printing presses, the police said. In Mangolpuri, the police claimed to have obtained video footage showing some men pasting posters at 4am. “The accused persons disclosed during interrogation that Arvind Gautam of Sultanpur Majra, New Delhi, who is an AAP worker, had sent an order on WhatsApp to one Rahul regarding the subject matter of printing and Rs 9,000 for printing and affixing these poster and hoardings. Rahul made a graphic image for printing and placed the order with one Rajesh via email,” police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal said. In south district, two suspects, identified as AAP workers Mayank and Santosh, were spotted on CCTV and held, the police said. They added that one Sanjay Chaudhary (a councillor candidate of AAP) had tasked them to affix these posters. The contents of the posters were sent to Mayank by Sanjay Chaudhary through WhatsApp. Mayank got 20 posters printed for Rs 4,000. In west district, four people were held and the role of Prashant Kumar, an AAP worker, along with Rakesh Joshi, also an active party member, was found, the police said. In Dwarka district, two people had placed banners on telephone poles. One of them, Suhail was an AAP worker and a close associate of AAP municipal councillor Praveen Kumar, the police said. In Timarpur, Tarkeshwar Jaiswal was apprehended while pasting posters. He said one Bharat had asked him to do so. Bharat said he worked for AAP and was leader of the local “Jatav samaj”, the police claimed. In east Delhi, a large number of posters were seized and four people arrested. The police suspect a large amount of money was paid to print around a thousand posters here. Congress’s online protest involved party functionaries from the headquarters to state units, as they sought to amplify outrage over the arrests. Congress rhetorically asked the PM if he would make a law that would make it compulsory to praise him, even while cremating the dead. Pawan Khera flashed a placard during his online press meet, “I dare you Mr PM, arrest me,” adding that he would ask questions such as “why do we not have vaccines, why do we not have oxygen, why do we not have medicines?” Congress said BJP had resorted to punitive measures even against doctors who spoke out on shortage of oxygen. “The PM’s fake image cannot be more important than real lives. To hell with your fake image,” Khera said. In response, BJP said it was ironic that Congress leaders were inciting people to break the law at a time when lockdown was in force in the national capital and there were restrictions on public movement. “The National Disaster Management Act has been imposed in Delhi but Congress supporters, incited by their mindless leaders, resorted to break the law against which Delhi Police took the action,” BJP chief spokesperson Anil Baluni said. He said leaders like Rahul Gandhi and Jairam Ramesh should understand that a decision on vaccinating children was yet to be taken as it would be subject to clearance from scientists and experts. “Congress leaders are consistently spreading lies about Covid management. Their behaviour is most unfortunate and irresponsible. Instead of acting as a responsible opposition, they are busy doing politics,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-poster-row-rahul-says-arrest-me-cops-point-at-aap-role/articleshow/82692687.cms||Raj Shekhar

However, fatalities continued to rise with the week's toll crossing 28,000 -- the highest number of deaths in seven days anywhere in the world for the second week running. India reported just over 24 lakh fresh cases during the week, a drop of 16% over the previous week's count of 27.4 lakh. In fact, the May 10-16 case count was the lowest in three weeks, pointing to a sharp fall in daily numbers after peaking in the previous week. The country officially recorded 28,334 deaths from the virus during the week at a daily average of 4,048 deaths per day. This was a 4% rise over the previous week’s toll of 27,243, which too was the highest recorded by any country for any week. The previous highest was 24,282 deaths recorded in the US in January 11-17 this year, as per worldometers.info. Coronavirus live updatesWhile these are the official figures of fatalities caused by the pandemic, the real toll is widely considered to be considerably higher, with local media in various states having been pointing to huge discrepancies between government numbers and crematoria records of Covid protocol deaths. On Sunday, daily cases reported in the country fell below the 3-lakh mark for the first time since April 20, as 2,82,086 new infections were detected in the last 24 hours. Just as the second wave saw a rapid surge in infections, the fall in cases over the past week has been just as sharp. Sunday's case count was nearly a 30% fall from the peak of 4.14 lakh recorded on May 6, just nine days ago. Deaths, however, haven't yet shown any signs of a fall. On Sunday, the country reported 4,100 fatalities. This was the fourth time in the week that the death toll had crossed 4,000. While Maharashtra recorded its second highest daily deaths at 974, four other states reported their biggest tolls so far. These were Tamil Nadu (311 deaths), Bengal (147), Himachal Pradesh (70) and Puducherry (32).

The administration did not give out the exact number of deaths in Libberheri village but said "several people have died". A senior government official said teams from different departments like revenue, health and police have been pressed into service to know the exact cause of deaths. Joint magistrate of Roorkee, Namami Bansal, told TOI, “We still have no data that could point to that these deaths happening due to Covid-19. It (the deaths) might be due to Covid-19 or some other fever or ailments. But we have intensified our efforts to test every Covid-19 suspect in the village.” Villagers believe it all started when a few of them returned from Maharashtra, where they used to work. And they brought the infection to the village which has a population of about 12,000. “My elder brother lost his life due to Covid-19 as many others did. Several people are still suffering from this deadly fever,” said 35-year-old Dharmender. On May 10, when an RT-PCR test facility was set up in the village, 10 out of 71 tested positive for Covid-19. Shubham Kumar, a member of the group that organised the testing camp, said, “Locals are also at fault. They are still not aware about Covid-19. Despite our efforts, they did not come out for the testing.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/30-dead-in-roorkee-village-in-may-say-locals/articleshow/82693468.cms||Tapan Susheel
---||India||Forget review, amend the 102nd Constitutional Amendment: Opposition/OBCs to govt||NEW DELHI: As the Modi government moved the Supreme Court for a stay on its judgment denuding the states of their powers to identify OBCs, several leaders and opposition members demanded that the Centre initiate the process to amend the contentious 102nd constitutional amendment, arguing that the history of review petitions in the apex court do not inspire optimism. The opposition and champions of OBC rights are upset with the BJP government for ignoring their objections in Parliament during the debate on the 102nd constitutional amendment which granted constitutional status to the National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC) and rewrote the process of decision-making on issues relating to the backward classes. They had repeatedly warned the Centre that specific clauses in the bill would deprive the states of their powers but the Centre had rubbished their objections. Now, these sections do not appear to be reassured by the government approaching the Supreme Court on Thursday. BJD MP Bhartruhari Mahtab, who was the most vocal in the Lok Sabha debate on the 102nd amendment, told TOI, “Given the history of review petitions in the SC, it is necessary that the confusion that has erupted relating to the amendment be settled soon. The Centre should prepare the alternative route of amending the law.” Congress leader B K Hariprasad, who led the charge against the 102nd amendment in Rajya Sabha, said, “The only way out is an amendment.” OBC rights activists and regional parties felt that leaving the controversy to a court judgment may not be prudent, as restoring the rights of states was “non negotiable”. While the May 5 apex court judgment pertained to Maratha reservation in Maharashtra, it adjudicated on key controversial subjects related to the OBCs by reiterating 50% cap on quotas and ruling that 102nd amendment bestows the power to identify the OBCs even for states on the President and the NCBC. Given that the NCBC is a central body packed with political appointees, there are strong fears that the ruling party in Delhi may end up dictating the OBC lists in states besides the central OBC list. Before the 102nd amendment/Supreme Court judgement, the state lists of OBCs have been the exclusive domain of the state governments and the state commissions for backward classes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/oppn-not-banking-on-review-plea-on-quotas-wants-statute-tweaked/articleshow/82693847.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

Home minister Amit Shah on Sunday reviewed preparedness with CMs of Maharashtra and Gujarat and the administrator of the UT of Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu, and specifically raised concerns over safety of health facilities that currently house Covid patients, including those in ICU requiring critical care. Shah also spoke to Goa CM Pramod Sawant regarding the situation in the state and promised him all central help to deal with the cyclone’s impact. During the video conference with states/UT, Shah asked them to evacuate patients from health facilities that fall on the cyclone path, to avert any loss of life or property. For makeshift/temporary hospitals functioning close to oxygen generating plants, his advised that patients may be shifted to vacant beds in proper hospitals and ‘pucca’ facilities nearby. Shah directed district administrations to make sure that there was power back-up at all times in hospitals, laboratories, vaccine cold chains and other medical facilities. He suggested hospitals stock all essential medicines and supplies just in case the cyclone ended up disrupting vehicular movements. The minister’s video conference, following the review by PM Narendra Modi on Saturday, assessed the likely impact on oxygen generation plants in Maharashtra and Gujarat. Shah assured help from the Centre, including deployment of central forces and NDRF teams. NDRF has deployed 79 teams so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/as-cyclone-roars-in-focus-on-safety-of-covid-units-power-and-o2-supply/articleshow/82694074.cms||---

Airline operations were suspended in Goa and many trains were cancelled. As many as 29 people have been reported missing, 10 each from Kerala and Tamil Nadu and nine from Karnataka. Tauktae, which is turning into a “very severe cyclonic storm” and is headed towards Gujarat, tore through the coast of Karnataka on Sunday, unleashing heavy rain in seven districts of the state. Among those who died is a three-year-old boy and two stranded on a stricken tugboat along the coast. At least nine people were stranded on another tugboat that drifted from anchorage off New Mangalore Port Trust. At least 300 houses were damaged in the worst-affected Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts of Karnataka. Met department says rainfall will be widespread in the state and its intensity in coastal districts will decline by Tuesday. In Goa, strong winds uprooted electricity poles and left large parts without power supply as the cyclone crossed the state approximately 150km off the coastline. Goa CM Pramod Sawant said on Sunday that it would take two days for power supply to be completely restored throughout the state. Goa Medical College too suffered a 15-minute power outage, Sawant said, adding that all Covid hospitals were provided backup generators. All air operations were suspended for a day at the Goa International Airport on Sunday. Along with gusts of wind at 80-100kmph and heavy rainfall, Tauktae also led to visibility at the airport dropping to less than 500m at one point of time. After heavy rain and high tidal waves wreaked havoc across Kerala and claimed two lives on Saturday, there was forecast of isolated rainfall for Monday in all districts of the state, except Thiruvananthapuram, Palakkad and Wayanad. On Sunday, an orange alert of very heavy rainfall was issued for eight districts. Meanwhile, the Coast Guard has launched a search to locate the crew of Tamil Nadu fishing boat that was reported missing off Lakshadweep coast on Saturday night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/29-missing-8-dead-in-karnataka-parts-of-goa-without-power-may-need-2-days-to-restore-it/articleshow/82694233.cms||---

Non-life insurance companies are seeing a sharp spike in claims, which could impact their balance sheets if the trend continues. As of March 31, non-life companies including health insurers received 9.8 lakh claims for Rs 14,560 crore for treatment of Covid-19. This went up to 14.8 lakh as of May 14, 2021, for a total value of Rs 22,955 crore. This means that in the first 44 days, Covid claims amounted to Rs 8,385 crore which is 57% of the pandemic-related claims for FY21. According to Atul Sahai, chairman, New India Assurance the claims paid by his company are in the vicinity of Rs 2,200 crore. “Last year though we had claims, we were not worried about the impact on the balance sheet. This year it could reach a point where it does,” he said. He added that although the rising cases were resulting in losses on the Corona Kavach policies, the public sector insurers are not looking at a price revision. Last year health insurers had the advantage of a revision in premium rates. They also saw lower claims in the first half on account of lockdown in the first half when health claims were low and most treatments were done in government facilities. “Last year although some elective procedures were postponed, the health insurance claims were still over the pre-covid trendline,” said MN Sarma, secretary-general, General Insurance Council. The claims are higher despite there being several factors that are keeping costs under check. “What is different this time is that the average length of stay has come down from over nine days in the earlier part of the pandemic to around six days. One reason for this is that the treatment protocols have standardized. Hospitals are discharging earlier due to paucity of beds and recommending home isolation for remaining part of treatment” said Bhaskar Nerurkar, Head - Health Claims, Bajaj Allianz General Insurance. Another trend observed by Bajaj Allianz is that an increasing number of claims are coming from tier II and tier III towns in the second wave which has seen a surge in numbers in April and May after a decline in April. Given the shortage in healthcare capacity and the need to avail private treatment, health insurance is turning out to be the only fallback for many. While the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India has asked companies to offer `Corona Kavach’ policies until September, prospective buyers say that they have not been able to buy covers from company websites. Also, an insurance policy does not automatically mean everything is covered as often insureds have to bear the costs in the first instance and seek reimbursement later. According to GI Council data, 8.5 lakh cases, which is 86% of the 9.8 lakh claims received, have been settled and 1.37 lakh claims are pending.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/covid-insurance-claims-in-first-6-weeks-of-fy21-are-57-of-last-year/articleshow/82694807.cms||Mayur Shetty

But illness in the villages isn’t, sarpanches say. The heads of several villages in the district said Covid-like symptoms had manifested in scores of residents, who have not got tested. They also claimed several deaths had taken place after people reported fever and breathing distress, reports Shubhra Pant. Nuh has so far officially reported 64 Covid deaths – 9 of those in April and 25 from May 1-16. Ashraf, the outgoing sarpanch of Ghasera village, said at least 10 persons with Covid-like symptoms had died in the past week. “There has not been a single day in the last week when a villager hasn’t died here,” he said, adding every other household had someone afflicted by fever or respiratory distress. If one goes by the data, Nuh has shown an encouraging trend. From 176 cases on May 6, the numbers came down to just 29 on Sunday. The district has a positivity rate of 3.5%. But the sarpanches – all outgoing because their tenure is over and panchayat polls are due in the state – allege there has hardly been any testing in many of the villages where the pandemic is stalking households. Many of the ill villagers have turned to local quacks, who give antibiotics and steroids to treat the symptoms, according to local residents. “Four people have died in my village in the past 10 days. Most of them had symptoms like fever and cough,” said Gopi, the outgoing sarpanch of Maroda. “We had two people with symptoms, and one of them died recently. Despite all this, no tests have been conducted here,” said Juhrudeen, the outgoing sarpanch of Alipur Tigra. The village heads also said locals were reluctant to come forward and get treated in hospitals and health centres. For instance, Irshad, a former sarpanch of Chharora in Tauru, hasn’t got himself tested despite cough and fever for the past few days. Asked why, Irshad said, “I didn’t know I could get myself tested for free at a government facility.” After testing, finding a hospital bed for those who need institutional care will be a major challenge, though. The medical college in Nalhar, which had been admitting patients from Gurgaon and other parts of NCR till about two weeks ago, is full. Aftab Ahmed, the Congress MLA from Nuh, said, “The situation is extremely worrying. We have written to the government several times, but there hasn’t been any concrete action yet.” Nuh deputy commissioner Dhirendra Khadgata refuted allegations that little or no testing was being done in the villages. “A survey is being done in all villages and we have been collating information on a daily basis,” he said. Khadgata claimed the government had been collecting samples of asymptomatic people as well to stop the spread of the infection as part of a screening exercise. On Saturday, he said, more than 700 households in the district had been surveyed by health teams. Some villagers have been trying to create awareness among people to go to a health centre and get tested. “The district administration has reached out to us and we are now trying to convince people to get tested if they show symptoms. We are hopeful we will be able to stop the spread of the infection in the villages,” said Khatuni, the outgoing sarpanch of Roz Ka Meo.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/nuh-sarpanches-claim-deaths-rife-covid-symptoms/articleshow/82694947.cms||---
---||India||As Covid spreads to villages, govt says beef up health infra||NEW DELHI: With Covid-19 now spreading to villages, the Centre on Sunday issued new guidelines for containment of the virus in peri-urban and rural areas by enabling communities, strengthening primary level healthcare infrastructure at all levels to intensify Covid-19 response, while continuing to provide other essential health services. The Centre also advised planning a minimum 30-bed Covid care centre in such areas for asymptomatic cases with co-morbidities or mild cases where home isolation is not feasible. Besides, provisions for RAT testing should be made at all public health facilities including sub-centres or health and wellness centres and primary health centres. The health ministry said with the larger spread of Covid-19 cases, it is important to ensure that these areas are equipped and oriented to manage positive cases. “In every village, active surveillance should be done for influenza-like illness/ severe acute respiratory infections(ILI/SARI) periodically by health workers,” the standard operating procedure issued by the ministry said. Noting that besides urban areas reporting a large number of cases, a gradual ingress is now being seen in villages and tribal areas as well, the ministry released the ‘SOP on Covid-19 Containment and Management in Peri-urban, Rural & Tribal areas’. Symptomatic cases can be triaged at village level by tele-consultation with the community health officer, and cases with co-morbidity or low oxygen saturation should be sent to higher centres. “Nearly 80-85% of Covid -19 cases are asymptomatic/ mildly symptomatic. These patients do not require hospitalisation and may be managed at home or in Covid care isolation facilities,” the SOP stated. As monitoring of oxygen saturation is important for monitoring of Covid patients, it is desirable for each village to have adequate number of pulse oximeters and thermometers. The SOP recommended developing a system of providing pulse oximeters and thermometers on loan to families with a confirmed case of Covid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/as-covid-spreads-to-villages-govt-says-beef-up-health-infra/articleshow/82695329.cms||---

Last year, the Centre had released Rs 29,000 crore towards state disaster funds. Some states like Odisha have been effectively putting this fund to use in disaster mitigation by building resilient infrastructure. The state’s cyclone centres built along its coastal districts served as Covid quarantine centres last year for lakhs of returning migrants. Karnataka on Sunday announced allocation of Rs 15 crore from this fund for purchase of ambulances and other equipment. Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik has been often praised for his disaster mitigation efforts. Recently, he received congratulatory messages on Twitter from Mami Mizutori, head of the UN office for disaster risk reduction, for his efforts towards pandemic management and coming to the rescue of other states when they were facing anwith acute oxygen crisis. As per the recommendation of the 15th finance commission, the government changed its policy, shifting its focus from spending just on rescue and relief to building resilient infrastructure. Annually for last 20 years, India on an average has suffered economic losses of $10 billion to disasters. For the first time the Centre has constituted the National Disaster Risk Management Fund and encouraged states to have their own which will address both response, mitigation and long term recovery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rs-23000-crore-given-to-state-disaster-fund-50-of-it-for-covid-fight/articleshow/82695356.cms||---

The advisory comes following representations that during the current lockdown in some states, timings of ration shops have been curtailed due to which beneficiaries might not be getting enough time to collect it. The Centre is distributing monthly highly subsidised foodgrain of 5kg per person at Rs 1-3 per kg to over 80 crore poor under the National Food Security Act. Additional 5kg of free foodgrain is being distributed to these beneficiaries under the PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana scheme in May and June. The food ministry has advised states to keep ration shops open for distribution of foodgrains in a staggered manner throughout the day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/relax-ration-shop-timings-states-told/articleshow/82695388.cms||---

The government condemned all acts of violence and destruction and called for resumption of dialogue. Participating in a virtual UNSC meeting on the situation, India’s permanent representative to the UN T S Tirumurti reiterated strong support for the “just Palestinian cause” and unwavering commitment to the two-state solution. “Immediate de-escalation is the need of the hour, so as to arrest any further slide towards the brink,” Tirumurti said. India also condemned the “indiscriminate rocket firings from Gaza” targeting the civilian population in Israel, and also the retaliatory strikes into Gaza, saying these had caused immense suffering and resulted in deaths, including of women and children. Despite its growing ties with Israel, India has been walking the diplomatic tightrope by expressing concern over possible Palestinian evictions in East Jerusalem. India was not among the 25 countries Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu thanked in a tweet for supporting Israel’s right to self-defence against “terrorist attacks”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-reiterates-support-to-just-palestinian-cause/articleshow/82695418.cms||---
---||India||Beat 1st wave, halted 2nd, ready to face 3rd: Yogi Adityanath||NEW DELHI: Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath asserted here on Sunday that the country’s largest state was able to arrest the second surge of Covid-19 and was prepared to face the challenge of the much-feared “third wave”. “We defeated the first wave, have got a grip on the second and are well prepared to face a third one as and when it comes,” the CM told reporters. His assertion comes amid the fear — troublingly highlighted by the bodies of Covid-19 victims dumped in the Ganga — of the current spate hitting villages hard. PM Narendra Modi last week had cautioned states about infections spreading through rural parts which lack public health infrastructure. The CM, who has been visiting districts and villages, struck a confident note, citing figures to justify his optimism. “On April 24, UP recorded 39,055 cases and many predicted that the daily load would cross 1 lakh by May second week. However, today the number of cases stands at 12,547. Positivity rate has dipped from 16.3% to 4.8%,” he said. While sounding confident that villages may dodge the worst, he appeared to lay great store in a campaign involving panchayat members and local bodies to look for those with symptoms. Asked about bodies floating in the Ganga, the CM said: “Lack of resources could also be a reason why some were not properly cremated. However, we have taken steps to tackle the problem. Apart from a provision of Rs 5,000 for families who are unable to bear the cost of cremation, we have launched a campaign,” he said. Yogi claimed that his government’s response to the second wave was better than the first one. “On March 2, 2020, when the state logged its first corona case, we had to send his sample to Pune for testing while the patient had to be referred to a Delhi hospital. We had no testing facility or isolation ward. Today, we have taken the number of oxygen-equipped beds from 17,325 to 80,000,” he said. The CM said while the second sero survey is to be undertaken shortly, vaccination of the 18-44 group, which was limited to nine districts, was now being expanded to 23 districts. Emphasising that UP was the first state to launch global tenders for vaccines, he said negotiations with manufacturers like Pfizer and Moderna were underway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/beat-1st-wave-halted-2nd-ready-to-face-3rd-yogi-adityanath/articleshow/82695454.cms||---

Vials of liposomal amphotericin is being sold at Rs 70,000 per injection, right under the nose of law-enforcing agencies, patients who bought the medicine secretly confessed. “We were offered a vial for Rs 1 lakh. After checking all medical shops, suppliers and dealers, I could find a vial for Rs 70,000 but am still looking for someone offering at lesser cost. It is not available anywhere at the MRP of Rs 5,000,” said Suresh N, a patient’s relative. This comes at a time when the hospital in Hyderabad announced on Sunday that they have come across 100 cases of black fungus in a month. The injection is the primary drug required to treat black fungus that damages nose, sinuses, eyes and sometimes the brain, and the shortage is leading patients and caregivers to panic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/5000-black-fungus-injection-being-sold-for-70000-a-vial/articleshow/82695490.cms||Amrita Didyala

Government sources said 43,800 ventilators were delivered to states and UTs after the pandemic hit India and the PM Cares fund was set up. Prior to the Covid-19 situation, according to non-government estimates, there were 47,500 ventilators in the country in public as well as private medical facilities. A study put the number in public hospitals at 17,850, which was higher than the Centre’s own estimate of 16,000. The health ministry has urged states to fully utilise the ventilators after it came to light that the machines were not being fully utilised in several states. Some states like Punjab and Rajasthan complained that the machines were faulty. In a statement, the health ministry said its teams visited the concerned hospitals in Punjab and were able to install the machines after replacing a few consumables after which they worked well. The government has said WhatsApp groups have been formed with representatives of state health departments and manufacturers like BEL to ensure glitches and maintenance issues are speedily sorted out. In the case of some states, ventilators supplied under PM Cares account for more than 50% of the machines. Officials said ventilators were mostly supplied last year and the health ministry as well as other government experts have been in touch with states all through. Efforts have been made to ensure that the machines are in working condition. Prior to the pandemic, the availability of ventilators even in bigger states was limited. Maharashtra, UP and Karnataka had around 5,800, 7,000 and 6,600 ventilators in all. Populous states like Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh had much fewer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-cares-helped-triple-number-of-ventilators/articleshow/82695564.cms||---
---||India||From her hospital bed, woman arranges Eid ration for needy||A few days before Ramzan Eid, Shaheen Jamadar's phone started buzzing non-stop. A bunch of people from Dharavi were calling up to inquire where she had disappeared. It was festival time and they were in need of rations and clothes that she had been organising for them through an NGO ever since the lockdown began. Jamadar had tested positive for Covid-19 and had been hospitalised 12 days ago. But the fact that people wouldn't be able to celebrate Eid kept gnawing at her and she got to work from her hospital bed. When the moon was sighted on Thursday night, ration kits had already reached all 170 families that had approached Jamadar for help. "Mai toh phir bhi zinda hu. Lekin yeh logo ke paas khaana pani kuch bhi nahi hai, bhuke mar jaayenge (I'm surviving at least. But these people have no food or water and will starve to death)," Jamadar explained over a phone conversation from her isolation ward. Her effort inspired other Dharavi residents to such an extent that they pooled whatever little sums of money they had and donated it to the NGO instead of making an annual contribution to the local mosque for Eid. Jamadar, 38, who lives in the same community at Dharavi, has been working for social causes for six years. In 2020, she joined a crowdfunded group, Enrich Lives Foundation, run by three women-- IIT engineer Shievani Upadhyay, lawyer Samrudhi Chothani and entrepreneur Rashmi Balwani. "Since inception, we have given out 8000 ration kits across Dharavi through various volunteers, besides clothes, snacks and 10000 sanitary pads," said Upadhyay. The group also started an initiative to coach around 300 school students in Dharavi in basic English and Maths as online education was a luxury these children couldn't afford. Jamadar was actively involved in all initiatives. "Being a lead volunteer from the NGO for Dharavi, it is my responsibility to identify needy families and fill up forms with their requirements," she said. From her hospital bed, she started collating a list of people who needed aid, in the run up to Eid. "We are required to visit each such family to verify their requests. As I couldn't step out of the Covid ward, I sent out my husband and son for door-to-door visits. I then asked each family to send me copies of their Aadhar cards, phone numbers and ration requirements," Jamadar said. The details were all keyed in into a Google form online and sent to the NGO. When the supplies arrived, Jamadar again coordinated with her husband and son to handle the distribution. Geo-tagged photos of the distribution were sent back to the NGO. "Records of every beneficiary are maintained and random checks are carried out to ensure that no needy individual is left out," Upadhyay said. Jamadar, meanwhile, can't wait to get discharged from hospital so she can resume field work and reach out to more people.

---||India||Check infection risk, states told over dumping of bodies in Ganga||NEW DELHI: Reacting to reports of bodies of suspected Covid-19 victims being dumped in the river Ganga, the Centre has sensitised its agencies towards missing actions on the ground and asked states to carry out risk assessment of infections among people living along the river. The states have also been asked to stop the practice of burying dead bodies in the sand along the river. Hundreds of bodies have recently been fished out from the river in several districts in UP and Bihar. While Bihar government has now decided to bear the cost of cremation or burial of Covid victims in all districts along the Ganga or its tributaries, UP will provide ₹5,000 each to families of victims in rural areas along the river. In UP, most of the floating bodies were found in Unnao, Kanpur rural, Ghazipur and Balia while in Bihar, the bodies were found in Buxar and Saran. Both states have informed the Centre of their decisions in a review meeting on Saturday where the water resources (Jal Shakti) ministry secretary, Pankaj Kumar, is learnt to have done some hard talks over negligence of local authorities. The meeting was held after two back-to-back letters written by the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) director general, Rajiv Ranjan Mishra, to states, flagging how dumping of bodies in rivers was “grave violation of Covid-safety protocol”. A Bihar government representative told the ministry that even if the deceased did not have a Covid positive report but had symptoms, the family would be offered support for cremation or burial. The state has, meanwhile, intensified patrolling to prevent further dumping of bodies in the river, especially in sensitive districts such as Buxar and Saran (Chhapra). The local administration is currently using a big net at Buxar to locate and fish out bodies from the river Ganga. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has been assigned the task of overall over-all monitoring, giving guidance to state pollution control boards and to take up advanced analysis in the matter. The Board will also increase the periodicity of testing water quality of the river at all monitoring stations along Ganga and its tributaries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/check-infection-risk-states-told-over-dumping-of-bodies-in-ganga/articleshow/82695609.cms||Vishwa Mohan

An in-silico (virtual simulation) study carried out by the scientists from Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre (GBRC) and Gujarat State Biotechnology Mission (GSBTM) revealed yashtimadhu and harde had a good bonding score with Covid-19 virus along with few antivirals currently in use. The study ‘Repurposing of the herbal formulations: Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies to validate the efficacy of phytocompounds against SARS-CoV-2 proteins’ has been accepted for publication in the Journal of Biomolecular Structure & Dynamics. “According to the present study, the formulations tested in this study had significantly higher binding efficacy against their SARS-CoV-2 targets. In-silico results reveal that these formulations may be effective inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 through their binding to the spike glycoprotein, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, protease, which can be further studied in vitro,” said the paper. “In simple parlance, we checked the binding affinity of base compounds of allopathic medicines and several popular herbs against Covid proteins in computer simulation. The average score of remdesivir was -7.3 and favipiravir -5.4. Yashtimadhu gave a score of -13.6 and harde -13. Here lower values show higher binding. Thus, in principle, it can prevent both viral attachment to human cells and replication in the human body,” said a researcher. The researchers insisted that through their research they do not promote use of these herbs alone for treatment of the Covid infection. “The purpose of the study was to assess the scientific basis of use of some herbs prominently in Covid treatment,” GBRC scientists said. The study may give impetus to hybrid approach when applicable and more studies among patients. Several city-based hospitals give optional ayurvedic treatment – primarily consisting of medicines like Ayush-64 and concoctions like Pathyadi Kwath – if the patient agrees for the same. For example, at Civil Hospital in Ahmedabad, over 4,000 patients were given ayurvedic treatment as assistive therapy, said officials. Vd Ram Shukla, a faculty at Akhandanand Ayurvedic College who is associated with Civil Hospital for ayurvedic treatment in Covid ward, said that ingredients like yashtimadhu and harde are used for throat infection and gastric trouble for years. “Jethimadh can reduce incessant coughing among Covid patients, for example. Of course, ayurveda is not applicable for patients with severe symptoms and should not be seen as an option, but we have seen good results of assistive therapy among mild to moderate patients in the past one year,” he said. Allopathy targets disease, whereas ayurveda targets the human body, said Vd Bhavdeep Ganatra, head of ayurvedic department at SGVP Hospital. “Virus may change tomorrow, but our understanding of the human body has helped us improve immunity. We have got good results in post-Covid recovery. But it must not be practised by self and must be done under expert supervision,” he said. Dr Devendra Patel, president of Indian Medical Association (IMA) Gujarat chapter, said that they are against ‘mixopathy.’ “We cannot say that the Ayurvedic concoctions should be taken with allopathic treatment ,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/herbs-can-complement-covid-antivirals/articleshow/82691994.cms||Parth Shastri

Just as the state battles with the second wave of deadly Covid-19, the cyclone threatens to compound the woes of critically ill patients and overwhelmed hospitals. To prevent a double-whammy for Covid-19 patients remained on top of state administration's mind. By Sunday evening, 34 critical Covid patients of Porbandar and Gir Somnath districts were shifted to Junagadh Civil Hospital as a precautionary measure. Some 46 patients of a Kutch hospital located close to the sea shore were shifted to Bhuj Samaras hospital. “On one hand, there are Covid-19 patients in hospitals. On the other hand, there is the cyclone and its effects. We are working to ensure there is zero casualty,” chief minister Vijay Rupani said on Sunday. “Seven hospitals in Saurashtra region have been designated as base hospitals where the patients from districts such as Bhavnagar, Amreli, Botad, Junagadh, Gir Somnath, Porbandar, Jamnagar, Devbhoomi Dwarka, Kutch, etc. would be shifted at the time of contingency. Those who can be shifted are already being shifted,” said a senior state health department official. “Ambulances from other parts of the state are brought in for contingency – the fleet of about 200 would have 120 ambulances equipped with ICU facilities.” Another issue of major concern is power and oxygen supply to hospitals getting disrupted due to the cyclone. Officials claimed that all the hospitals have been asked to stock up medicines and oxygen that can last for up to 48 hours. Meanwhile, diesel generators are being installed or shifted to major hospitals to ensure that life support systems and communication systems are not interrupted in case of power outage. Several hospitals close to the coastal region also went for ‘wind proofing’ by blocking the doors and windows with wooden logs. State energy minister Saurabh Patel held a meeting of the preparations of PGVCL and Gujarat Energy Transmission Corporation (Getco) in Rajkot on Sunday. Patel promised there won't be any power outage in 41 oxygen plants in the 12 districts which are providing medical oxygen to the Covid hospitals. In Surat, 40% of the 1200-odd ventilators are occupied. “Patients on ventilator support would be our concern. Most of the hospitals have their own generators and power supply back up and patients on ventilators are in the big hospitals including SMC-run SMIMER hospital,” Ashish Naik, deputy municipal commissioner (Health), SMC, told TOI. Dr Bharat Gadhvi, president of private hospitals in Ahmedabad, said that they have stocked adequate oxygen supply and have asked all member hospitals to ensure checking generators for critical equipment. “Dry run for any emergency was also carried out in some hospitals on Sunday,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/guj-faces-twin-crisis-of-battling-cyclone-amidst-covid-19-surge/articleshow/82696446.cms||---

Covid-19 patients in critical condition are seen waiting outside the hospital in ambulances, hoping to get a bed with a ventilator. The waiting time ranges from anywhere between four to eight hours. With the Covid-19 positivity rate drastically increasing in rural parts of Krishna and Guntur districts, most patients who are complaining of shortness of breath and a sudden fall in oxygen saturation are rushing to Vijayawada GGH for better treatment. This is adding to the rush of patients at the hospital. All oxygen and ventilator beds in the hospital are occupied and officials are allocating beds based on vacancies. Relatives waiting outside the hospital alleged that patients with recommendation letters are given top priority in bed allocation. They demanded the government arrange oxygen cylinders outside the hospital and provide emergency treatment till admission into hospital. “My father has been sick for the past three days and his oxygen saturation fell to 82. We brought him to Vijayawada GGH from Kankipadu in a private ambulance. But hospital authorities failed to provide a bed for six hours. Ambulance driver is charging Rs 1,500 per hour as waiting charges and oxygen charges. No doctors attended to him and provided basic treatment. We demand the government arrange teams to provide oxygen for patients waiting for beds,” said K Rama Kanth, a farmer from Komatiguntalaku of Kankipadu. Meanwhile, allegations by the Government Doctors Association (GDA) that some patients are being admitted on the basis of reference letters from politicians has sparked a controversy. GDA convener Dr Jayadheer said patients in need of critical care are not getting proper medical aid even as other patients are being admitted with reference letters of ministers and officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ambulances-line-up-outside-vij-ggh-as-wait-for-beds-goes-on/articleshow/82689612.cms||Venu Lanka

In the last seven days, Jhotwara has emerged as the biggest hotspot with 1,073 active cases, followed by Sodala (746) till May 16. Looking at the rising number of Covid cases, the district administration has created 69 micro-containment zones in the city. However, cases in many zones have nearly quadrupled in the last two weeks. According to an official, the first wave between September and November last year had a maximum test positivity rate of 8.2 per cent. According to data, it touched 8.2% in September and dipped to 7.2 per cent in October and slightly moved up to 8 per cent in November. An official said the second wave is unlike the first wave. In the first 15 days of May, postivity rate in Jaipur was 25% , compared to 17% in April “In May, 55,669 residents in Jaipur were found infected while 776 lost their lives. In April, there were 49,192 cases and 241 people lost their lives.” There are total 10 big colonies in the city where more than 500 positive cases were recorded in last 7 days. A district administration official said, “ In view of the spike in cases, in many colonies entry of outsiders has been made restricted and police have been deployed to keep a check. Also, movement is allowed between a specific time to purchase essentials.” After the pandemic started in March 2020, there are many places where a large number of cases were detected, including Ramganj, Idgah, Galata Gate, Subhash Chowk. However, the situation changed and in these areas not more than 10 -15 cases have been reported.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jaipur-remains-epicentre-of-second-wave/articleshow/82692358.cms||---

Sitamarhi SP Har Kishore Rai said Lallan’s owner Kundan Kumar had given him the keys of a rented accommodation in Sitamarhi town to bring the cash kept there. The showroom is at Kundan’s residence beside Majorganj police station. “The rented house was locked as no one was living there. Lallan left the showroom around 9am to bring the cash,” he said. The SP said Lallan told the police that the bike-borne criminals looted the cash around 12.45pm though it hardly takes 40 minites to cover the distance between the showroom and Khairwa. “He was unable to explain the reason of delay in returning with the cash,” he said. Rai said Lallan told the police that three criminals on one bike and two more on another intercepted him near Khairwa and looted the bag containing the cash. “We are quizzing Lallan. However, if nothing is found suspicious then he would be set free,” he said. Punaura police station SHO Shambhu Nath Singh said the showroom owner told the police that the money was the sale proceeds before the statewide lockdown got enforced and he had kept it at the rented accommodation. The SHO said it was yet not clear why Kundan didn’t deposit the cash in a bank or why he had asked Lallan to bring it back to the showroom from the rented house.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/sitamarhi-bizmans-staff-robbed-of-rs-rs-17l/articleshow/82688510.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Much of the state plunged into darkness, with chief minister Pramod Sawant saying it would take two days to restore power. Many parts of the state also lost mobile connectivity, and the cyclone also snapped telephone lines, disrupted flights and road and rail movement, as over 500 trees were uprooted blocking access to major parts of the state. “A 32-year-old woman died in the cyclone after a coconut tree fell on her in Bardez taluka. The second death was reported at Marcel, where an electric pole fell on a scooter on which two people were travelling,” Sawant said. Sawant said that in North Goa, Bardez bore the major brunt, with 32 trees uprooted and 17 houses damaged, while in the South, Mormugao taluka was badly hit with 36 houses reported damaged. Access to Chorao island was blocked as massive trees fell on the roads. Some who had gone to get their inoculation jab found themselves stranded on Chorao for the night, with no means to return home. The chief minister said it will take close to two days to clear the roads and restore access to places which have been cut-off because of the devastation. The Navy and the Army have been asked to help the state authorities clear the debris and assist in restoration of connectivity. A 22-member National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) has also been deployed in the state to assist in rescue and relief operations. With powerlines smashed to the ground, most parts of the state were thrown into darkness by early Sunday, with power yet to be restored at the time of going to print. The Goa electricity department has decided to requisition workers from Kolhapur and Belagavi to help restore power supply. The surge in water levels also caused some low-lying areas to be cut-off from the rest of the state. The sea level rise saw many beaches being taken over with water entering shacks and houses, particularly at Bogmalo. Fishermen at the Khariwada fishing jetty had a tough time protecting their vessels, with fishermen saying that a couple of trawlers were damaged due to the cyclonic storm. Fire and emergency officials, Goa police and disaster response agencies were kept on their toes, answering distress calls throughout the day and well into the night. In the state capital itself, the directorate of fire & emergency services received over 100 distress calls. Parts of Mala were cut off after the Rua de Ourem creek spilled over the banks due to the tidal surge and extremely high rainfall. Traffic had to be diverted through Bhatlem and Altinho.

With doctors suggesting one consume healthy food, patients are dialing helplines operated by voluntary organisations for meals. In many cases, patients are not in a position to prepare meals as the entire family is infected. “Six out of eight members in my family fell sick. We are very weak and not in a position to cook. Doctors suggest not to eat hotel food and we are depending on neighbours for meals. The government should help us,” said Valluru Ramu, a patient under home isolation at Patamata. Voluntary organisations and many eateries in the city have taken it upon themselves to help Covid-19 patients get quality food. Many in the city have also come forward to supply food to patients every day. Eight voluntary organisations have started distributing home-cooked meals to patients free of cost while many students have turned into delivery partners to help patients get their food on time. “This is the time to show our humanity. One should come forward to help each other and help Covid-19 patients in their recovery. We are serving around 130 home-cooced meals to Covid-19 patients.

He said the Centre has granted the state additional quota of oxygen following a request by chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy. Krishna Babu, along with Covid-19 special officer Arja Srikanth, health commissioner Katamaneni Bhaskar, joint collector A S Dinesh Kumar and senior divisional commercial manager Narendra Varma visited Container Cargo Corporation Limited (Concor) depot at New Guntur railway station on Sunday to receive the second Oxygen Express from Reliance Industries in Jamnagar. The train carrying 76.39 MT of oxygen reached Guntur station in the early hours of Sunday. Taking into account the shortage of oxygen in the state, the Centre had directed the Railways to operate a special oxygen express to carry liquid medical oxygen (LMO) to the state. In view of the rise in Covid-19 cases and a surge in demand for LMO, Indian Railways created a signal-free ‘green corridor’ to provide safe, secure, hassle-free and fast transportation of oxygen to different parts of the country. The four containers of the train were dispatched to different locations in Krishna, West Godavari, Prakasam and Guntur districts. Speaking to the media, Krishna Babu said about 30,000 out of 50,000 beds with oxygen facility were created in government and private hospitals. He said the state would require more oxygen in view of surge in cases. The chief minister has already brought the issue to the notice of the Prime Minister and sought an additional quota of LMO, he said. “The oxygen train started from Reliance Rail Terminal, Kanalus in Gujarat on Friday at 8.31 pm and reached its destination in 31.30 hours thanks to the green corridor created by the Railways,” said Krishna Babu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/oxygen-express-reaches-guntur-supplies-sent-to-krishna-prakasam-and-wg-dists/articleshow/82689548.cms||Samdani MN

The mayor met the collector at the latter’s camp office and submitted a representation. The mayor said setting up of only 10 vaccine centres for a city with a population of eight lakh would only result in gathering of crowds at vaccine centres. He wanted the collector to consider allocation of at least another 10 permanent vaccine centres to the city to facilitate speedy inoculation. He also urged the collector to allot an exclusive hospital for treatment of municipal staff including sanitation workers. He said that about 10,000 staffers of Guntur Municipal Corporation (GMC) were relentlessly working to contain Covid-19 in the city. He said that hundreds of workers were visiting Covid-19 positive patients’s residences to extend medical services. The mayor said sanitation workers were the most vulnerable to the virus as they visit households to collect garbage. The mayor requested the collector to allocate an exclusive Covid care centre for GMC and also spare at least 50 beds in all hospitals for GMC employees. He requested the collector to allocate doctors, paramedical staff for the GMC Covid care centre. The collector promised to clear permissions for a Covid care centre for GMC employees. He also agreed that there was a need to allocate exclusive beds for GMC’s employees in hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/mayor-calls-for-more-vax-centres-in-guntur-city/articleshow/82689879.cms||---

Based on a request from the state administration, the Eastern Naval Command (ENC) of the Indian Navy airlifted specialists from the naval dockyard by naval Dornier aircraft from Visakhapatnam. The teams repaired the oxygen plants on Sunday morning by overhauling compressors and replaced adapters and accessories that were manufactured within the naval dockyard. Krishna Teja oxygen plant in Nellore is a cryogenic plant capable of charging 400 jumbo type cylinders a day but has been non-functional for the past six years. The naval team undertook the repairs of the plant and managed to achieve the cryogenic temp of minus 186 degrees Celsius and achieved the requisite output oxygen pressure to charge bottles. The analysis of the output is 98% oxygen, zero per cent carbon monoxide and 0.01% carbon dioxide, meeting the requirements of medical grade oxygen. The oxygen plant at Srikalahasti near Tirupati is a big plant based on VPSA technology and is capable of generating 16,000 litres per minute at 5 bar (direct feed to lines rather than charging). The naval team undertook repairs of the plant and achieved the requisite output proved for medical-grade oxygen above 93% and zero per cent carbon monoxide and 0.02% carbon dioxide by carrying out necessary adjustment of column and moisture absorption of the plant. A team of specialists led by Commander Dipayan worked for seven days along with engineering teams of the state health department to complete the task with the cooperation of district collectors and the district administration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/experts-from-naval-dockyard-fix-o2-plants/articleshow/82689803.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Cyclone Tauktae surging towards Gujarat, over 1.5 lakh to be evacuated||AHMEDABAD: After being spared by cyclones for two consecutive years, the crashing of very severe cyclonic storm ‘Tauktae’ on Gujarat coast looked imminent with landfall expected to be anywhere between Union territory of Diu and Mahuva in Bhavnagar district on Tuesday early morning. Tauktae, which is moving north westwards, is likely to crash into the coast, packing winds up to 175km per hour. In 2019, Cyclone Vayu had skirted the Gujarat coast, sparing the massive damage it could have caused if it struck while cyclone Nisarga in 2020 that hit Mumbai only poured heavy rain in parts of south Gujarat. This could possibly be the strongest tropical cyclone to hit Gujarat after the 1998 cyclone that flattened Kandla. Chief minister Vijay Rupani said, “With the aim of zero human casualty, 44 NDRF teams, assisted by SDRF and fire brigade teams of civic bodies have been deployed along coastal areas for rescue and relief work.” He appealed to citizens not to venture out of homes except for emergencies for the next two days. By Monday evening, close to 1.5 lakh people living in coastal villages of Saurastra districts and Kutch are expected to be shifted to safer locations as extremely strong winds and high tidal waves are predicted to inundate coastal areas of in Junagadh, Amreli, Diu, Kutch, Bharuch, Gir-Somnath, Devbhoomi Dwarka, Jamnagar and Bhavnagar districts by early hours of May 18. Additional chief secretary Pankaj Kumar said 25,000 people were evacuated by Sunday evening. Tauktae was earlier heading towards Porbandar with India Meteorological Department (IMD) predicting that it would cross the Saurashtra coast between Porbandar and Naliya in Kutch. But the cyclone changed trajectory and is moving northwestwards towards Diu and Veraval. “It is very likely to move north-northwestwards and reach Gujarat coast in the evening hours of May 17 and cross Gujarat coast between Porbandar and Mahuva (Bhavnagar district) around 18th May early morning,” the IMD said. The IMD has also issued a yellow alert for the coasts of Gujarat and Diu and Daman, which indicates possibility of heavy rainfall at some places. The IMD said wind speed reaching 70-80 kmph gusting to 90 kmph is likely along and off south Maharashtra-Goa and adjoining Karnataka coasts, and 40-50 kmph gusting to 60 kmph along and off the north Maharashtra coast on May 16. It is likely to increase to 65-75 kmph, gusting to 85 kmph along and off the north Maharashtra coast from May 17 till the morning of May 18. Major damage to kutcha and pucca roads, flooding of escape routes, minor disruption of railways, overhead power lines and signalling systems is expected, the IMD said. Squally wind speed reaching 40-50 kmph gusting to 60 kmph is likely off south Gujarat and Daman and Diu coasts from morning May 16. Winds with speed reaching 70-80 kmph gusting to 90 kmph are likely to prevail along and off Dadra, Nagar Haveli, Daman, Valsad, Navsari, Surat, Bharuch, southern parts of Ahmedabad and Anand districts from the midnight of May 17 and till the morning of May 18. According to IMD, in Bhavnagar district, total destruction of thatched houses, extensive damage to kutcha houses and some damage to pucca houses is expected. There could be a potential threat from flying objects with bending or uprooting of power and communication poles. Gale-force winds, heavy rainfall and high tidal waves swept the coastal belt of Kerala, Karnataka and Goa as Cyclone Tauktae hurtled northwards towards Gujarat on Sunday, leaving four people dead, damaging hundreds of houses, uprooting electricity poles and trees and forcing evacuation. Four deaths have been reported from Karnataka in cyclone-related incidents, while two persons died in Goa in separate incidents. agencies||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/tauktae-surging-towards-guj-over-1-5-lakh-to-be-evacuated/articleshow/82692043.cms||---

---||Business||Ample liquidity, stable market fuel IPO rush||MUMBAI: With the stock market showing resilience despite surging Covid cases and weakening economic fundamentals, around 10 companies have filed IPO prospectus with Sebi in the first half of May to collectively raise nearly Rs 20,000 crore. From early backers of some of these companies eyeing to exit to maturing businesses looking for funds for their next phase of growth and availability of liquidity globally, the reasons are quite a few for this rush, top merchant bankers said. The companies include Nuvoco Vista — Nirma group’s cement business, low-cost carrier GoAir, Divyani International — the franchisee for Pizza Hut and KFC, and CarTrade — the online auto classifieds firm. In the last week of April, food delivery major Zomato had also filed with Sebi to go public and raise about Rs 8,200 crore. According to HDFC Bank group head (investment banking) Rakesh Singh, after a long time, markets are closer to fair valuations and are at levels at which entrepreneurs feel they can offload part of their stakes through public offers. “Investors are also getting a good window for reallocation of capital. In several businesses, we also see a cycle playing out, where private equity players and early investors are exiting or part-exiting, while a new set of investors are coming in through these fund-raising processes.” For instance, in Zomato, of the expected Rs 8,200 crore that could be raised through its IPO, its stakeholder InfoEdge is eyeing Rs 750 crore. In Nuvoco Vista, of the Rs 5,000-crore, the promoters are eyeing Rs 3,500 crore, while in Devyani International, private equity investors and its promoters, both are eyeing some funds by paring their stakes. According to Kotak Mahindra Capital MD & CEO S Ramesh, ample liquidity in the Indian market and also abroad is helping these fund raisings. “This (liquidity surge) has resulted into a favourable capital market environment for companies to go public.” The companies which are filing for IPO are of reasonable size and good quality, Ramesh said. Some companies have matured their businesses and now need growth capital for their next phase of journey. “That’s also another reason for the recent spate of fund raising activities, some of which are through the IPO route,” Singh said. Also, the bunching up of IPO prospectus during the last few weeks could be because the companies eyeing public offering, have a six-month window to file with the regulator after they have published their audited results for the October-December quarter. “This could also be one of the reasons for this rush this month,” he said. Usually the companies file with Sebi (based on their December quarter results) and after the January-March results are audited, those are given as addendum to the prospectus, Ramesh added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ample-liquidity-stable-market-fuel-ipo-rush/articleshow/82691220.cms||---

Even the suspected Covid-19 patients were undergoing treatment along with those suffering from other ailments. After receiving a complaint on its control room number 0612-2215142, the Economic Offences Unit (EOU) of the state police raided Prince Sanjivani Hospital located on the SDO Road at Hajipur on Saturday and found the allegations true. The hospital was charging up to Rs20,000 per day for a bed from Covid-19 patients. EOU ADG Nayyar Hasnain Khan, in a press note on Sunday, said an FIR was registered with the Town police station of Hajipur against the hospital management under relevant sections of IPC and the Disaster Management Act for charging exorbitantly and not giving the attendants proper bill against the payments made. The raiding team found that the hospital was running without a license and its management produced one of Prince Multispeciality Clinic and Hospital registered on the address of Old Gandak Bridge road at Jauhari Bazar in Hajipur. The hospital management was also procuring oxygen cylinders on the licence of that clinic. The EOU team also found a drugstore functional without licence. When asked, the management produced documents of one Prince Medical Hall registered on Konhara road at Hajipur. When contacted, Vaishali civil surgeon Dr I B Ranjan on Sunday said the district assistant drug controller has been asked to conduct an inquiry. “We would ban the hospital. Those licenses shown to the raiding team would also be cancelled,” he added. Earlier, the state drug controller team raided Samay hospital on Khagaul road under Danapur police station area in western Patna on Saturday for allegedly selling 66 vials of Remdesivir injection on black market. The injections were procured from government channel by making applications to the civil surgeon office for the patients who had already been discharged.

Despite the pandemic fatigue most complain of globally, most Indians perceive video communications more positively, and believe it is here to stay, findings of a study by videoconference (VC) tech firm Zoom said. 90% of Indians said video communications helps them combat feelings of loneliness. 89% in the UK, and 86% in the US believe video interactions help them fight feelings of loneliness. 92% Indians said that the video mode has helped them stay connected with others. During a stressful pandemic, 75% Indians said video communications technology helped to positively influence their general emotional well-being. Further, 92% said video chats have given everyone an opportunity to participate during group meetings. While the majority favor a hybrid business environment, 12% of Indians said they will “only use video conferencing” for business related meetings going forward —the second highest globally after Japan. Similarly, Indians also constituted the largest demography preferring to go only-virtual for healthcare. India led the survey when it comes to taking routine doctor appointments from the comfort of one’s homes in the future through video mode. When asked about their learning and education plans post the pandemic, while 46% Indians choose to embrace the hybrid mode mixing physical classes with virtual platforms, 13% Indians –the highest globally—are looking forward to going completely virtual for learning needs. India also led the world tally in their preference to go fully remote for personal celebrations and entertainment events in the future. Using video platforms to participate in online fitness group classes or one-on-one personal training was the top use case for those in India far more than any other country surveyed, Zoom said in its study. “The usage of video calls has increased exponentially by not just GenZ, but senior citizens too. The level of interactivity and connected world experience in a video call is unmatched by audio, which is critical not just for experience but also for mental health”, Sameer Raje, general manager and India head, Zoom, said. In India, the most common use of VC was seen in education (72%), celebration/social gatherings (62%), events (59%), entertainment (58%), business (50%), and telehealth (42%). Zoom in collaboration with Qualtrics Research surveyed 7,689 respondents from the US, UK, Mexico, Brazil, France, Germany, Japan, India, Singapore and Australia during March 15 to 26. Indians were 13% of the total surveyed. As of April 2020, the number of daily meeting participants on Zoom globally topped 300 million.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/desis-most-positive-about-video-calling-globally-study/articleshow/82690153.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

In a tweet, Gehlot informed that he briefed Modi on the status of the pandemic in the state. “Modi has assured of resolving the matter (oxygen supply) soon,” said Gehlot. Modi had called upon CMs of four states — Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Puducherry — to take stock of the situation in these states. Gehlot has been very critical on the shortage of oxygen from the Centre. Sources said, “Gehlot informed the PM on the state’s current oxygen requirement against what it was getting from the Centre.” In another tweet, Gehlot informed that after directions from Modi, they held discussions with defence minister Rajnath Singh and railway minister Piyush Goyal. “I am hopeful that oxygen allocation for the state will be increased by the Centre,” said Gehlot. “I have also requested Rajnath Singh that the Indian Air Force should continue to lift empty oxygen tankers (from Rajasthan) to Jamnagar Hazira etc,” Gehlot tweeted. He reiterated that considering the size of the state, the oxygen plants under DRDO should be increased so that there is one in every district.

---||Business||Lenders want power finance cos as NARC promoters||Mumbai: The mantle of the promoter of the public sector National Asset Reconstruction Company (NARC) is likely to be state-owned power financiers. Power Finance Corporation (PFC) and Rural Electrification Corporation (REC) will be approached by banks to become the promoters of NARC for regulatory purposes. According to bankers, the RBI is reluctant to allow banks to float another ARC to which they will sell their bad loans. Most of the large public sector banks in India have a stake in an existing ARC. For instance, SBI is the largest shareholder in Arcil with IDBI Bank, ICICI Bank and Punjab National Bank holding a significant stake. Another firm Asrec is owned by Indian Bank, Bank of India, Union Bank and LIC. While all major public sector banks will invest in the NARC, they will be holding a stake of below 10%. “REC and PFC are in the public sector. Also, a significant portion of NPAs are in the power sector, which makes sense for them to be promoters,” said a banker. The power finance companies are expected to hold over 10%. Last week, lenders decided upon Padmakumar Nair — SBI chief GM (stressed assets) — to head the proposed NARC, which is expected to take over bad loans larger than Rs 500 crore total exposure with banks. Banks are expected to transfer bad loans in the range of Rs 1.5 lakh to Rs 2 lakh crore to the NARC after a ‘Swiss auction’ that will allow other private asset reconstruction companies to bid for the loans. However, the NARC is expected to have an upper hand as it will receive a government guarantee.The management of Yes Bank has been pursuing a licence to set up an ARC soon after the new management took charge following the reconstruction of the bank in March 2020. The RBI has not yet granted the private bank the licence. The central bank recently published a study on asset reconstruction companies, where it pointed out that those in the public sector have performed better internationally. These include Securum of Sweden, which was set up in 1992 and wound up in 1997, and which succeeded in recovering close to 86% of the amount involved. Similarly, Danaharta of Malaysia, set up following the Asian financial crisis and operational between 1998 and 2005, managed to recover about 58% of the involved amount. Among the AMC experiments reviewed by the World Bank, the performance of the Non-Performing Assets Trust of Ghana, which existed from 1989 to 1997, was regarded as satisfactory.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/lenders-want-power-finance-cos-as-narc-promoters/articleshow/82691113.cms||Mayur Shetty

The suspended doctors are resident medical officer Dr Sridhar and Dr Sudhakar. As Covid-19 nodal officer, 58-year-old Subbarayadu was monitoring flying squads at private hospitals in the district. The APMIP director suddenly fell ill and was admitted to a private hospital in Anantapur. He later tested positive for Covid-19. As his condition deteriorated, doctors suggested he be moved to a super-speciality hospital on Saturday night. But Subbarayadu passed away on the way. District collector Gandham Chandrudu learnt that there had been an alleged delay in admission processes and lapses in emergency procedure and ordered an inquiry. — Sandeep Raghavan||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/two-doctors-suspended-for-negligence/articleshow/82689506.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

As the third Covid wave is likely to hit children, the government has instructed officials to increase ICU and ventilator beds for children in Gorakhpur BRD Medical College and other hospitals of the district. As many as 500 beds are being reserved for children in the district. BRD Medical College principal Dr Pawan Pradhan said that the preparations have begun as per the instructions on third Covid wave given by the government. Beds have been reserved and an ICU has been made for children in the encephalitis ward of BRD Medical College. There are 400 beds reserved for children in BRD Medical College. Out of these, 177 beds are placed in a fabricated ward which will be used as a Covid ward. The wall of the fabricated ward is made of plastic instead of concrete, and is easily accessible. The health department is planning to add two beds at CHCs with paediatric ICUs. There are three mini encephalitis centres with three ventilators beds in the district. The administration is planning to add two more beds at each of these centres. Apart from this, the district hospital has 17 beds for children. The administration is planning to increase five more beds. As per requirement, more ICUs and ventilators would be made available by the government, said CMO Dr Sudhakar Pandey. The CMO said that help from private hospitals would also be taken. The private hospitals will be asked to increase ICUs and ventilator beds for children. There are many hospitals in the city which are already equipped with NICU (neonatal intensive care unit) and ICU wards for children. Help from these hospitals would also be taken, he said. “Preparations are underway for training paediatricians for the third Covid wave. KGNU and SGPGI doctors will give online training to the paediatricians. Specialists and doctors across the country who have played a vital role in treating children suffering from Covid, will also be the part of training programme” said the CMO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/500-beds-being-set-up-for-third-wave-in-gorakhpur/articleshow/82692380.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat faces twin crisis of battling cyclone amidst Covid-19 surge||AHMEDABAD/RAJKOT/SURAT: The very severe cyclonic storm Tauktae could not have come at a worse time for Gujarat. Just as the state battles with the second wave of deadly Covid-19, the cyclone threatens to compound the woes of critically ill patients and overwhelmed hospitals. To prevent a double-whammy for Covid-19 patients remained on top of state administration's mind. By Sunday evening, 34 critical Covid patients of Porbandar and Gir Somnath districts were shifted to Junagadh Civil Hospital as a precautionary measure. Some 46 patients of a Kutch hospital located close to the sea shore were shifted to Bhuj Samaras hospital. “On one hand, there are Covid-19 patients in hospitals. On the other hand, there is the cyclone and its effects. We are working to ensure there is zero casualty,” chief minister Vijay Rupani said on Sunday. “Seven hospitals in Saurashtra region have been designated as base hospitals where the patients from districts such as Bhavnagar, Amreli, Botad, Junagadh, Gir Somnath, Porbandar, Jamnagar, Devbhoomi Dwarka, Kutch, etc. would be shifted at the time of contingency. Those who can be shifted are already being shifted,” said a senior state health department official. “Ambulances from other parts of the state are brought in for contingency – the fleet of about 200 would have 120 ambulances equipped with ICU facilities.” Another issue of major concern is power and oxygen supply to hospitals getting disrupted due to the cyclone. Officials claimed that all the hospitals have been asked to stock up medicines and oxygen that can last for up to 48 hours. Meanwhile, diesel generators are being installed or shifted to major hospitals to ensure that life support systems and communication systems are not interrupted in case of power outage. Several hospitals close to the coastal region also went for ‘wind proofing’ by blocking the doors and windows with wooden logs. State energy minister Saurabh Patel held a meeting of the preparations of PGVCL and Gujarat Energy Transmission Corporation (Getco) in Rajkot on Sunday. Patel promised there won't be any power outage in 41 oxygen plants in the 12 districts which are providing medical oxygen to the Covid hospitals. In Surat, 40% of the 1200-odd ventilators are occupied. “Patients on ventilator support would be our concern. Most of the hospitals have their own generators and power supply back up and patients on ventilators are in the big hospitals including SMC-run SMIMER hospital,” Ashish Naik, deputy municipal commissioner (Health), SMC, told TOI. Dr Bharat Gadhvi, president of private hospitals in Ahmedabad, said that they have stocked adequate oxygen supply and have asked all member hospitals to ensure checking generators for critical equipment. “Dry run for any emergency was also carried out in some hospitals on Sunday,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/guj-faces-twin-crisis-of-battling-cyclone-amidst-covid-19-surge/articleshow/82691940.cms||---

Speaking to the media on Sunday, Singhal said that the doctors called nearly 14,300 Covid-19 patients who had opted for home isolation services, 789 people identified in the fever survey, and other pending calls. “As many as 126 people were referred to Covid care centres and 337 people for hospital admissions. In all, 4,596 people have got various recommendations, right from medications, testing, and others,” said Singhal. Singhal said that the call centre received 13,796 calls from the public. “However, the requests for beds have decreased compared to the earlier days. Out of the allocated daily quota of 590 metric tonnes (MT) of liquid medical oxygen, Andhra Pradesh could draw nearly 600 MT on Sunday due to the one-time allocation of 230 MT over and above the existing daily quota. Due to the same, the hospitals can keep a few tonnes of oxygen in reserve,” said Singhal. The call centre executives have been tasked with providing information related to testing centres, status of tests and the availability of beds in hospitals and Covid care centres, and raising a request for Covid-19 testing and hospital/care centre admissions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/docs-give-virtual-aid-to-16k-patients-in-24-hours/articleshow/82689470.cms||---

As many as 6,22,562 doses of vaccines have been given to people in the age group of 18 to 44 years since the launch of third phase of the inoculation drive. It accounted to 12.91% of the total 48.21 lakh doses administered to this age group people in the country since May 1. According to the data compiled by the state health department, altogether 90,14,237 beneficiaries were administered the doses of Covaxin and Covishield in Bihar, including 71.3 lakh people who got their first dose. Over 32.4 lakh of them are above the age of 60 and the remaining 24.2 lakh between 45 and 59 years of age with comorbidities. Moreover, 18,81,367 people have taken the second dose, including 7.9 lakh senior citizens and 5.2 lakh in the 45-59 years age group. Altogether 53,476 people in the age group of 18 to 44 have been inoculated at 88 vaccine centres in Patna district in the last seven days, against the target of 61,921 doses, as per the figures provided by the district administration. The inoculation drive for all age groups was been suspended on Sunday as the Patna district administration had asked the selected sites for sanitisation of the campus. One of the officials, however, said there was a shortage of vaccines in the district and only a few selected sites were left with anti-Covid vaccine doses. “The fresh stock has not come yet and it may take another 3-4 days,” he said. Patna civil surgeon Dr Vibha Kumari Singh, however, had no clue about the availability of vaccines at the storage or the district headquarters. “There was no vaccination at any selected sites in the district on Sunday,” she told this newspaper. Dr R K Choudhary, medical officer in-charge of Phulwarisharif PHC said there were sufficient vaccines for people above 45 years of age. “However, there is a shortage of vaccines for beneficiaries in the age group of 18 to 44 years,” he added. The Centre had given 98.03 lakh vaccine doses to Bihar till May 15, of which 90.5 lakh had been administered to the beneficiaries. Only 7.48 lakh are left in the stock.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/state-ranks-third-after-rajasthan-maharashtra-in-vaccinating-18/articleshow/82688377.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Patna||Bihar govt supplies Ambisome to hosps for treating black fungus||PATNA: In a prompt action following reports of black fungus (mucormycosis) cases diagnosed in some post-Covid patients, the state government on Saturday ordered to supply Ambisome (Liposomal amphotericin B) injections to all the government medical colleges at the earliest. These injections would also be made available to private hospitals free of cost but only after approval of their demand with relevant papers by a committee of the health department. The officer on special duty in the health department, Kumar Ravi, said the state programme officer (SPO) of kala-azar was directed to supply the injections as per the allotment fixed by the government. The World Health Organisation (WHO) had provided 14,000 vials of Ambisome to the state as reserve under the kala-azar programme. As per the medical advice, this medicine is highly effective for treatment of severe fungal infections. Ravi said the government’s direction was forwarded to all the DMs and medical colleges in the state. The AIIMS-Patna has been allotted 2,000 vials while PMCH, NMCH, IGIMS and JLNMCH at Bhagalpur would get 300 vials each for treatment of black fungus patients. SKMCH (Muzaffarpur), DMCH (Darbhanga), KTMCH (Madhepura), ANMMCH (Gaya), VIMS (Pawapuri) and GMCH (Bettiah) would get 200 vials each. SPO Anjani Kumar, who is also the additional director of health, said AIIMS-P received its allotment on Sunday morning while IGIMS, PMCH and NMCH were likely to get it by the evening. He said the injections for supply to the private hospitals would be stored at the RMRI, Patna. All the hospitals getting the Ambisome injections would have to send their utilization certificates to the government. Anjani said a committee headed by the director-in-chief of the disease control would decide the allocation and supply of this injection to the private hospitals. Medical experts said black fungus may affect several parts of the body, including nostrils, oral cavity, teeth, eyes and even brain. If remained untreated, it could prove fatal. Health minister Mangal Pandey said on Sunday that about two dozen cases of the rare fungal infection have been reported in the state and patients suffering from it were being treated at AIIMS-P, IGIMS and other private hospitals. Pandey also said 37,430 doses of Remdesivir injection have been made available to various districts and hospitals and 50,321 doses are available at the state headquarters to provide to hospitals as per the requirements, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/state-govt-supplies-ambisome-to-hosps-for-treating-black-fungus/articleshow/82688435.cms||VK Tripathi

Police nabbed the accused hours after the crime on Sunday morning from Sultanpura area of Baran district.

---||Business||Over half of FY21 Covid health claims in just 6 weeks||MUMBAI: Health insurance claims due to Covid reported since April 1, 2021 are 57% of the claims filed in the year ended March 2021. Non-life insurance companies are seeing a sharp spike in claims, which could impact their balance sheets if the trend continues. As of March 31, non-life companies, including health insurers, received 9.9 lakh claims for Rs 14,561 crore for Covid treatment. This went up to 14.8 lakh as of May 14, 2021, for Rs 22,955 crore. This means that in the first 44 days, Covid claims amounted to Rs 8,385 crore, which is 57% of the pandemic-related claims for FY21. According to New India Assurance chairman Atul Sahai, claims paid by his company are around Rs 2,200 crore. “Last year though we had claims, we were not worried about the impact on the balance sheet. This year it could reach a point where it does,” he said. Sahai added that although the rising cases were resulting in losses on the Corona Kavach policies, public sector insurers are not looking at a price revision. Last year, health insurers had the advantage of a revision in premium rates. They also saw lower claims in the first half due to lockdown, when health claims were low and most treatments were done in government facilities. “Last year although some elective procedures were postponed, the health insurance claims were still over the pre-Covid trendline,” said General Insurance Council secretary-general M N Sarma. The claims are higher despite there being several factors that are keeping costs under check. “What is different this time is that the average length of stay has come down from over nine days in the earlier part of the pandemic to around six days. One reason for this is that the treatment protocols have standardised. Hospitals are discharging earlier due to paucity of beds and recommending home isolation for remaining part of treatment,” said Bajaj Allianz General Insurance head (health claims) Bhaskar Nerurkar. Another trend observed by Bajaj Allianz is that an increasing number of claims are coming from tier-2 and -3 cities in the second wave, which has seen a surge in numbers in April and May. Given the shortage in healthcare capacity and the need to avail private treatment, health insurance is turning out to be the only fallback for many. While regulator Irdai has asked companies to offer ‘Corona Kavach’ policies until September, prospective buyers say that they have not been able to purchase these covers from insurers’ websites. Also, an insurance policy does not mean all expenses are covered as often those insured have to bear the costs in the first instance and seek reimbursement later. According to General Insurance Council data, 8.5 lakh cases, which is 86% of the 9.8 lakh claims received, have been settled and 1.4 lakh are pending.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/over-half-of-fy21-covid-health-claims-in-just-6-weeks/articleshow/82691184.cms||Mayur Shetty

On Sunday, Goa recorded 43 casualties, 15 less than a day earlier. Toll rose to 2,100. The state’s case positivity rate dropped marginally to 34% on Sunday as it reported 1,314 fresh infections. Recoveries were more than double the new cases and the tally of active cases dropped below 30,000 in the last 24 hours. The recovery rate has increased to 78 % in the last 24 hours. Mortalities reported on Sunday have been the lowest since May 2. Since May 1,806 people have lost their lives to Covid-19 with half of the mortalities reported from the Goa Medical College (GMC) which faced a shortage of oxygen supply as well as outages in supply of oxygen from its central lines. On an average, the GMC reported 30-40 Covid mortalities daily in the last fortnight. The hospital admitted that there were dips in oxygen supply, especially during nights, but it refused to attribute the deaths during dark hours to disruptions in the oxygen supply. The state’s mortality count shot with the corresponding rise in new cases as well dips in oxygen supply. GMC dean and in-charge of Covid hospitals Dr S M Bandekar said that oxygen was an important component of treatment, but all mortalities can’t be related to the drop in oxygen supply. He said, on Saturday, that the criticality of patients admitted in GMC was high and 160 patients were on ventilator support as of that day. Analysis of mortality bulletins revealed that 15-20% of patients died within 24 hours of admission to a hospital, and at least, two to three people daily were brought dead. This component — patients brought dead — comprised mostly, elderly or unknown persons, picked from streets lying unconscious. A health officer said that as the cases increased, the monitoring of patients in home isolation suffered. “Late admissions were because hospitals were full and no beds were available,” he said. However, over the last three days, hospital admissions have also reduced.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/covid-deaths-at-gmc-drop-as-oxygen-supply-improves/articleshow/82694402.cms||---

As chances of power being restored remained slim throughout the day, some began their search immediately, by posting SOS messages on social media. Deepa George from Succoro, who tried to get help on the internet for a senior citizen with a lung problem who needs oxygen support most of the time, told TOI, “Though the patient’s family has an inverter, with long spell of outages, backup was needed. So, we all started messaging friends and acquaintances including SOS on social media.” Within a few hours, they received help. “Not just one, but we received two generators. I’m so glad that there are people out there who are willing to help in these difficult times,” she said. Some Covid patients, after their discharge from hospital, too needed to be given oxygen support. Ramakant Naik from Ponda said he succeeded in hiring a generator for his friend, who has just recovered from Covid and was discharged recently. “It was difficult to get a generator on hire, as suddenly the demand went up as it became clear by afternoon that electricity supply would not be restored today (Sunday). I got it from a shopkeeper as his shop was closed due to the curfew,” he said. In another instance, the family of a man dependent on an oxygen machine stated they were willing to do anything, hire or even buy a generator, from anyone who could help. Another volunteer received distress calls from youth who were away from their parents. “The son of a senior citizen asked if anyone could help his father at Dabolim, who had been Covid positive for a week but had run out of food and drinking water,” a volunteer told TOI. “We also got calls for patients stressed as their oxygen concentrator batteries were dying out,” the volunteer said. Till late night, a family in North Goa was looking for a generator for their family friend on a ventilator.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/as-power-snaps-sos-for-gensets-for-patients-at-home/articleshow/82694481.cms||Bindiya Chari

Earlier, Chidambaram had attacked Nitish in his tweet. “Has Nitish Kumar visited Darbhanga in the 15+ years he has been CM? Does he even know about the condition of the DMCH?” Chidambaram had tweeted. To this, Jha tweeted, “CM Nitish Kumar is a self-made mass leader, and has risen from the ground, unlike your leader, who has inherited a ‘kursi’ (chair) and whom you idolise so brazenly. Kumar has not only visited Darbhanga, but also brought it on a global aviation map. Heard of Darbhanga airport and AIIMS?” “The DMCH has a state-of-art building where Covid patients are being given the finest treatments. The CM personally monitors all Covid logistics and management, including at the DMCH. I truly wish you had done a bit of homework before trying to exhibit your ugly politics!” Jha tweeted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/minister-attacks-chidambaram-for-slamming-cm/articleshow/82688526.cms||---

Apart from imparting modern techniques on farming, BAU is also creating awareness among the farming community about the surge of Covid-19 and taking precautionary steps while carrying on with their day-to-day works. Sohane said the farmers were being guided on farming of strawberry, pointed gourd (parwal), pineapple, dragon fruit, milky mushroom, basil, high-yield mangoes and fox nut (makhana), besides high-yield food grains, oilseeds, pulses etc. “Farmers are informed about the modern techniques on livestock through live e-Kisan chaupal as well as the videos uploaded to the e-platform for which information is disseminated through community tab,” Sohane said. “Out of 15 lakh beneficiaries, 12.6% are women,” said Sohane and added that 90.9% of viewers are from India and especially from this region while 1.9% are from Nepal, 1.2% from Pakistan and 6% from rest of the world. The maximum 36.2% beneficiaries belong to the 25-34 years age group, followed by 24.9% in 18-24 years, 19.6% in 35-44 years, 9.2% in 45-54 years, 4.6% in 55-64 years and 3.4% in the 13-17 years age group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/15-lakh-farmers-benefited-from-e-kisan-chaupal/articleshow/82688531.cms||Kumar Rajesh

Soon after the incident, Sanyukt Kisan Morcha termed the action as a brutal act which would not silence farmers. Highways were blocked in at least five districts — Ambala, Kurukshetra, Yamunanagar, Karnal, and Panipat. The protests in Ambala, Kurukshetra and Yamunanagar were organised on a call given by Bharatiya Kisan Union (Charuni), while the ones in other two districts were held on a call given by SKM. In Ambala, farmers blocked NH 44 (GT Road) at Devi Nagar toll plaza on Shambhu border. In Kurukshetra, farmers blocked the road in front of Third Gate of Kurukshetra University for about two hours and then lifted the stir. Farmers also blocked the GT Road at Shahabad-Markanda for two hours. In Yamunanagar, farmers blocked NH 344 near Gurdwara Gobindpura Sahib at Sugriv Chowk, where three roads merge. About 7 pm, farmers lifted all blockades. SKM has, meanwhile, given a call for holding protests at all police stations in Haryana on Monday. Farmers have decided to hold parleys on Sunday night to prepare further strategy to deal with the situation. SKM leaders described Haryana government’s attitude as “confrontationist”, saying it was trying to provoke farmers to defame them. In Hisar, Rakesh Tikait said, “BJP must stop testing the patience of the farmers and that too in such a way. This type of action will not be tolerated and prove dear for the BJP government. The farmers will not sit back. Instead, they will come out in bigger numbers with renewed vigour to take on the BJP.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cops-action-sparks-highway-blockades/articleshow/82692411.cms||---

CBI has registered a case under prevention of corruption act against the two accused identified as Parag Bhushan and R Mohan, who are medical device officers. “The accused demanded undue advantage of Rs 3.50 lakh from the complainant, who is into manufacturing of orthopaedic implants, for extending him some favour. It was further alleged by the complainant that the inspection of the complainant’s unit was done for issuing a medical device manufacturing licence (MD-9) by the two accused persons,” said the statement. The CBI officers laid a trap and caught the accused while accepting the bribe amount.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Villagers passing off Covid deaths as heart ailments||JAIPUR: The spurt in deaths in rural areas has put the local administration on their toes. These deaths are being termed as ‘sudden’ or due to heart attack by the family members to escape Covid protocols. Bukarka village in Nohar tehsil Hanumangarh recorded 12 deaths in the last 15 days with three dying officially due to Covid complications while the rest of heart attacks. Bukarka village pradhan Sohan Lal said termed it callousness of his fellow villagers by preferring to die at home without treatment rather getting admitted to a hospital. “Of the 15 deaths, most were due to infection. Despite a massive campaign, villagers with Covid are hiding it from the health workers and not only endangering their lives, but the lives of their family members too,” said Lal. He expressed disappointment that even after family members are aware of the reason behind the death, they are not following the protocol of covering the body with a PPE kit. The health department conducted a survey of all 1,350 families to track 385 suspected Covid patients or who have shown strong influence like illness. This is not the situation of this village alone. The state has several such rural areas witnessing a high rate of deaths due to Covid or has similar symptoms. Magluna village in Sikar has recorded 17 deaths in 15 days due to all other reasons except Covid. “Most of the members are down with cold, cough and fever which makes them suspectable cases, but the fear is so high that they are not going for RT-PCR tests,” said Ashfaq Kaimkhani, a social activist based in Sikar. A door-to-door survey revealed that families have not cooperated with the health team due to fear of being taken to quarantine centres. Most of the deaths in these villages are in 50 years and above. Considering the gravity of the situation, Dungarpur administration is going all out to villages holding door-to-door survey. “The ILI survey is being done along with proper follow up of every person who show even one symptom. The health workers have been equipped with pulse oximeters and thermometers, along with providing medicine kit for treatment,” said Dr Rajesh Sharma, CMHO, Dungarpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/villagers-passing-off-covid-deaths-as-heart-ailments/articleshow/82692386.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: ‘Keep power backup ready in hospitals in case cyclone hits’||JAIPUR: While the India Meteorological Department (IMD) alerted that cyclone Tauktae has intensified into a ‘very severe cyclonic storm’ over East-central Arabian Sea, the health department has expressed need to remain prepared in case of power failure in hospitals where thousands of Covid patients are undergoing treatment. The health department has issued directions to all collectors to ensure alternate power supply in case of power failure during cyclone. The IMD has clarified that the cyclone is very likely to intensify further during the next 12 hours, and reach the coast of Gujarat on May 17. A senior health department official said it is mentioned in the order that disruption of power for some time in hospitals would affect Covid patients undergoing treatment. Thousands of Covid patients across the state are on ventilator support in ICUs and also on oxygen support. The health department is apprehensive that if the power gets disrupted even for some time, it may affect the health of patients badly as medical equipment functions on electricity. The health department has alerted district collectors and directed them to ensure alternate source of power such as diesel generators and inverters. “If DG generators are not in use, the hospitals have been directed to check its functioning,” the official said. Strong winds might damage electricity cables as trees may fall on them, eventually disrupting power supply. The power department is also alert on it. The health department has directed its officials to remain prepared for any such situation as some districts of the state might get affected due to cyclone. Now, the hospitals are checking their alternate means of power supply, such as diesel generator sets to ensure that patients in hospitals continue to get treatment without any disruption.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/keep-power-backup-ready-in-hospitals-in-case-cyclone-hits/articleshow/82692426.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||KU to challenge single-bench HC order||Thiruvananthapuram: Kerala University (KU) has decided to challenge the recent high court order that nullified the varsity’s 2017 notification, based on which the university had filled 58 teaching posts by pooling up vacancies in different departments as one common unit. The single bench verdict has also annulled the amendment carried out by the former UDF government in 2014 in the Universities Act to give a legislative backing to demand by a section that all teaching posts should be considered as a single unit to safeguard the reservation claims of different communities. However, several candidates had approached the court with the plea that when posts arising in different departments are clubbed together, it would lead to 100% reservation in some single posts. This, they argued, would go against the Constitutional provisions and the Supreme Court order that 100% reservation is against law. KU vice-chancellor V P Mahadevan Pillai said the university has decided to challenge the order in the high court. “The decision to club the vacancies and consider it as a single unit has helped the university to ensure social justice like never before. There is no question of the university exceeding the 50% ceiling for reservation per se. The remaining 50% posts are still filled up from open quota. If vacancies arising in each department is to be considered separately, those communities in the lower rungs of the reservation ladder would never get the benefits of reservation,” he said. However, the state government is yet to take a decision on whether to file an appeal against the single-bench order or not. Additional chief secretary V Venu, holding the additional charge of higher education secretary, said the government is supposed to take a decision on such matters after close perusal of the order. Meanwhile, it is also argued that the best option to ensure social justice and reservation norms in appointment of university teachers would be to entrust the recruitment with the state public service commission (PSC). KU former syndicate member R S Sasikumar, the whistleblower of the university assistant selection scam in 2005, said the faculty posts in different disciplines can’t be clubbed together for legal and constitutional reasons. If the government and universities want to get out of this mess, the appointment of teaching faculties should be entrusted with PSC. Or else, the possibility of a common recruitment board can be explored. “The problem of certain communities being left out occurs only when vacancies are calculated department wise at the university level. This could be addressed if vacancies in all universities are clubbed together and selection is made by considering each discipline as independent units,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/ku-to-challenge-single-bench-hc-order/articleshow/82688547.cms||B S Anilkumar

Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC)-run Sri Guru Ram Das Langar at Golden Temple served over one lakh devotees every day before the pandemic. The number rose significantly on holidays and even doubles during religious occasions. While the virus is taking a toll on people, it has also taken the sheen out of religiosity with a large number of faithful performing religious services at home.Before Covid, the daily consumption of flour in Golden Temple’s langar used to be between 65 and 70 quintals, whereas cereal consumption was between 15 and 60 quintals. Now, flour and cereals’ consumption has come down to around 45 quintals and 8 quintals, respectively, said Sri Guru Ram Das Langar in-charge Harpinder Singh, while talking to TOI on Sunday. He informed the daily consumption of desi ghee had come to 1.5-2 quintals, from the earlier 4 quintals. Sugar usage at the langar has dropped to 3 quintals from the earlier 7-8 quintal, he informed. Harpinder said before Covid outbreak, the daily consumption of vegetables used to be 19-20 quintals, but it was now 7-8 quintalsStating that ‘guru ka langar’ was open all day, he said the drop in devotees had lessened milk consumption as it is used for making tea. As against around 20 quintals earlier, SGPC’s langar is now consuming only 10 quintals of milk. Harpinder, who has been serving the langar for over 24 years, said this was the first time that a number of devotees had fallen in Golden Temple. “The pandemic has changed life, yet devotees are coming to guru ghra without fear,” he said. But, he maintained, ration donations had not come down. He estimated the number of devotees visiting Golden Temple every day to be around 25,000, as against the daily footfall of around 1 lakh before the pandemic. “A lot of devotees used to visit daily from other states and countries who are not coming due to travel restrictions,” he observed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/langar-consumption-at-golden-temple-drops-to-half-but-seva-continues/articleshow/82692439.cms||Yudhvir Rana

Taking a dig at the SAD president, Mann said, “People of Punjab and the entire Sikh community knows who was in the state government in Punjab in 2015 when desecration of Guru Granth Sahib took place.” He asked on whose orders firing took place on the Sikh sangat protesting peacefully against the Bargari sacrilege at Behbal Kalan and Kotkapura and demanding arrest of the culprits. “Will Sukhbir Badal say that he was not then deputy chief minister and home minister? Won't the home minister own any responsibility for the indiscriminate firing by unidentified police personnel?” questioned the AAP leader. Mann further asked, “Didn't then Akali MLA Mantar Brar talk to then chief minister and deputy chief minister and issue an unsolicited order to SDM Vijay Syal that the situation would get out of hand if action was not taken? Can Sukhbir, as then home minister, tell on whose orders 182 police officers and personnel were sent to Kotkapura overnight to suppress the protests of the Sikh Sangat after the Bargari sacrilege?” Equating the police which fired at protesters with General O’Dwyer, he asked how CCTV footage of the Kotkapura firing disappeared. “Will Sukhbir explain why and how then DGP Sumedh Saini and DIG Paramraj Singh Umranangal became the apple of his eye?” he asked. The AAP Punjab president said the one asking for evidence was busy hiding evidence of Bargari and Behbal Kalan-Kotkapura incidents for two years but there was no shortage of evidence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/no-lack-of-evidence-bhagwant-to-sukhbir/articleshow/82692447.cms||---

If the person is found to be positive, treatment will start immediately and he/she will be advised home isolation and medicines will be provided to him or her. Around 22 mobile OPD vans will be used for the purpose,” said district collector Antar Singh Nehra. The health minister on Saturday said in order to reduce the spread of infection in villages, antigen and RT-PCR tests will be conducted through the mobile OPD vans. “These vans will cover at least 10 villages daily in each assembly constituency. If a person tests negative after antigen test, his/her samples will be taken for RT-PCR test,” the minister had said. The district administration is also going to adopt stern measures in identification of containment zones and door-to-door survey of ILI patients in rural areas of the district. Currently, there are around 900 micro-containment zones in the district. Also, 20 CHCs of Jaipur will be converted into Covid care centres. “We have also decided to appoint a supervisor in every PHC (primary health centre) in the district. There are over 90 PHCs in the district. There is a shortage of medicine kits now. There are around 50,000-60,000 kits at this moment. But the state is trying to procure more kits,” said Nehra. The state government has decided to appoint biomedical engineers and oxygen monitors in all the dedicated Covid hospitals for effective management of oxygen supply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/mobile-opd-vans-to-conduct-antigen-tests-in-jaipur-rural/articleshow/82692464.cms||---

Ex-collector of Baran Indrajit Singh Rao was also removed over charges of corruption and was arrested by the ACB.Meanwhile, Baran collector Rajendra Viijay has denied the allegations of slapping the village development officer (Sankesh De). “I did express displeasure over poor maintenance of the quarantine centre and scolded the VDO, but did not physically assault him. Many people had died due to Covid in the village and 60-70 were already infected. People would complain that the condition of the quarantine centre is poor. That’s why, I expressed anger over the poor condition of the quarantine centre,” said Vijay.They also launched a social media campaign - #suspendDMBaran -against the collector on Sunday and mailed memoranda to chief minister Ashok Gehlot, chief secretary Niranjan Arya and panchayati raj department secretary Manju Rajpal demanding his suspension.“District magistrate Baran Rajendra Viijay slapped the village development officer during his visit to a quarantine centre in Bhanwargarh gram panchayat. Seeing a pile of mud on the verandah, the collector lambasted him and even physically assaulted him. However, there was nobody in that quarantine centre at that point of time. So, we have decided to boycott all kinds of Covid-related works including door-to-door survey, distribution of medical kits, masks and food packets, sanitization etc,” said Mahaveer Sharma, state president, Gram Vikas Adhikari Sangh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cong-mla-demands-removal-of-baran-collector/articleshow/82692424.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Only 3 days’ vaccine stock left and just 50,000 doses coming||MUMBAI: The state’s vaccine shortage could get more acute this week as Maharashtra is slated to receive merely 50,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccine from the Centre in three days. The state is left with fewer than six lakh doses of the vaccine, which can sustain the drive for barely three days. According to details released by the Union health ministry on Sunday, states and union territories are supposed to receive nearly 51 lakh doses in the next three days. The Centre said that states had more than 1.84 crore doses available with them as on Sunday morning. A break-up of the 51 lakh doses shows that UP, which already has a balance of 18.59 lakh doses, is scheduled to receive six lakh doses. MP, too, which has 9.86 lakh doses, is slated to receive 5.26 lakh doses. Maharashtra, which has only 6.85 lakh doses, is to get 50,000 doses. Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Delhi and Haryana are listed to received 3.92 lakh, 4.22 lakh, 1.73 lakh and a lakh doses, respectively. The chart uploaded by Centre shows that even Andhra Pradesh is to receive 50,000 doses when it has 11.55 lakh balance doses. Punjab, West Bengal, Assam and Chandigarh are all receiving in the range of 50,000 to 75,000 doses. A state official said that the drive has significantly slowed down in the state for want of vaccines. An official said the allocation of 50,000 doses was “too little”. Having touched a high of 5.34 lakh vaccinations on a single day on April 26, the daily vaccinations are now languishing at fewer than 1.5 lakh. The state had vaccinated 1.92 lakh on Saturday and 1.5 lakh on Friday. It had dropped to as low as 95,535 on May 1. The state had last received 1.15 lakh doses of Covaxin and 3.5 lakh doses of Covishield a few days ago, which has all been distributed to districts. The doses that come from Centre are used to vaccinate people above 45 years. Mumbai barely has 70,000 vaccine doses left.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-only-3-days-vaccine-stock-left-and-just-50000-doses-coming/articleshow/82694039.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Assistant professor Vandana Sharma had tested positive on the campus and was rushed to AIIMS after her condition began to deteriorate early this week, said deputy registrar Amardeep Sharma. “Doctors tried hard to save her, but she succumbed on Sunday afternoon,” said Sharma. Hailing from Noida, Sharma had joined IIT-Jodhpur in August 2019 and had become one of the favorite teachers of students for her command over the subject. “She had a knack for making mathematics very simple for her students through her methodology and acumen,” Sharma said, adding that this quality made her very popular amomg students. She had done her Masters from IIT-Madras and had gone on to do her doctorate from Houston University in the USA in 2013. She joined Arizona University as a faculty before she came to Jodhpur after serving there from 2014 to 2019. She has many papers published in a number of national and international journals. This is the first Covid casualty in IIT-Jodhpur where 269 students, faculty and staff members have tested positive since February.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/iit-jodhpur-maths-teacher-dies-of-covid/articleshow/82692475.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Oxygen demand grows, but supply hits roadblocks||JAIPUR: Demand for oxygen continued to rise reaching 795MT even as supply remained at 366MT between May 10-15. The additional allocated supply from Burnpur and Kalinganagar (1,347km & 1,746km respectively from Jaipur) is not helping the cause as there are not enough tankers to carry the capacity from the far off locations. Terming the situation extremely fragile, the chief minister on Friday had urged the Centre for allotment of more imported oxygen at the earliest and also brought to notice the constraints in lifting 100MT from Burnpur and Kalinganagar. While, the government is tapping all the avenues to increase production to 500 MT from its own end by July 15, there is an urgency to tide over the current crisis. “We have been allotted 40MT from Hazira. In the meantime, we are strictly monitoring the hospitals to ensure judicious use of oxygen. Only needy patients are allotted oxygen beds,” said Siddharth Mahajan, secretary, medical and health. Mahajan said there are not enough tankers to lift oxygen from plants and supply to the hospitals. “Currently, we have 35 takers which can carry 430MT. We need at least 26 more tankers to carry 360MT. The services of Air Force are being used for regular transportation of oxygen from Jamnagar to places like Jodhpur, Udaipur and Jaipur. Railways is another mode, but we want this to be operational round the clock,” added Mahajan. After the state said that it is unable to lift the full allotted capacity of 100MT from Burnpur and Kalinganagar, the Centre allotted 40MT from Hazira in Gujarat, but senior officials in the medical health department said it was not enough. Recently, the local bodies issued work orders for production of over 11,000 cylinders per day. The medical department has also issued global tenders for oxygen concentrators. There is a plan to buy 50,000 concentrators for the deployment of hospitals in rural areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/oxygen-demand-grows-but-supply-hits-roadblocks/articleshow/82692491.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

Traders of Connaught Place, Khan Market, Lajpat Nagar, Janpath, Green Park, Sarojini Nagar, Aurobindo Market, South Extension, Karol Bagh, Palika Bazar, Chandni Chowk, etc, asked for waiver in trade licence fees for the lockdown period, postponement of the payment date for GST returns, advance income tax and house tax, and a moratorium on loan instalments. “Unlike other industries and sectors, nothing has been done for shopkeepers. Even for individuals, a moratorium on home loan EMIs was given, but nothing changed for us. We are on the verge of a collapse. In Lajpat Nagar’s Central Market, about 35% of showrooms are now closed. The government didn’t even intervene in the rental issues. So, shopkeepers on rent were forced to settle their issues with the owners on their own. Many got relief, but those who couldn’t had to leave,” said Ashwini Marwah, general secretary, Traders’ Association Lajpat Nagar. Traders argue that their shops remained closed in phases, but power discoms still raised the fixed charges for commercial electricity connections. Similarly, no relief was given on submission of licensing fees and trade licence. “We have spent all our savings to pay employees and ensure our survival last year and this year,” said Vijay Kumar of South Extension I Market Association. The traders took the decision of demanding support to survive in this crisis after a discussion at a virtual meeting on Thursday. “We support the government’s decision to extend the lockdown. But to pump life back into the dying business activities and get traders’ faith back, they need to take strong steps so that we can at least pay salaries and also manage our expenses,” said Atul Bhargava, president of New Delhi Traders’ Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/traders-write-to-cm-and-lg-seek-relief-package-to-revive-biz/articleshow/82692670.cms||Vibha Sharma

How? They do not step out of their homes without masks. They follow social distancing norms. Ceremonies and weddings have not been taking place here since a month. Majority of the population in these villages is labourers and peasants and all of them have been abiding the pandemic protocol diligently. Around eight kilometers away from Galiyakot panchayat samiti, Limbadiya gram panchayat is constituted of four revenue villages Limbadiya, Dhebariya, Gadiya and Ratanpura. “It is the great sense of understanding of the villagers as well as integrated efforts of the goverment officials, medical department and public representatives that not a single positive case or any Covid death has been reported from here so far,” CEO, Dungarpur zila parishad, Anjali Rajoria said. “The total population in the gram panchayat is 4,288 and majority of them are marginal farmers or labourers who earn their living by cultivation they are do. Yet, these people have been strictly adhering to the pandemic protocols,” Galiyakot BDO Raghuveer Singh Meena said. Sarpanch Narbada Devi Tabiyad has been meeting women in households to sensitise them on the importance of sanitisation. A core committee of panchayat members, medical staff and influential persons in the area have been monitoring the health conditions of residents in their respective areas. Seven persons found with symptoms of influenza like illness were gviven medical kits. Some 28 migrant workers who returned to the villages after lockdown were quarantined. After counselling and awareness campaigns, most of the marriages have been postponed. “The villagers have given up the mourning feast and in funerals too, people within the permissible limits are seen.

Deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan said, “We will enforce the stringent curbs and special focus will remain on rural areas.” On the other hand, traders are a bit satisfied with the odd-even concept, saying it has allowed them to run their businesses at least thrice a week. Some of the shop owners with two or more shops can open their businesses daily. A person having two shops in a market said, “We enjoy a special privilege as we have two shops with both odd and even numbers. This means we can open one shop daily.” Jatinder Dhamija, a shop owner, said, “Opening of shops in staggered manner is much better than closing all of them. This way we are able to do some business to run our households.” The DC said the weekend curfew will continue and all shops will close at 6pm on Friday till 5am on Monday apart from the daily restrictions. Shops will daily close at 6pm. Vehicle movement will also be restricted. ‘Donate oximeters’ Mohali civil surgeon has asked people who have recovered from Covid-19 to donate oxymeters. Such oximeters were part of the Covid kit given to the patients during the isolation period. The appeal comes due to the shortage of the medical equipment and its prices skyrocketing Double mutant in 5 of 23 samples Double-mutant B.1.617 variant of coronavirus was confirmed in 22% (five) of 23 nasopharyngeal swab samples of Covid-19 patients sent from PGI, Chandigarh, on May 13 to NCDC, New Delhi, for genome sequencing, said PGI director Dr Jagat Ram on Sunday Of the other samples, the UK variant, B.1.1.7, was found in 39% (9/23) samples, Ram said The surge of cases during the second wave of the pandemic has somewhat been attributed to the B.1.617 strain, said Ram||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/curbs-till-may-31-mohali-to-stick-with-odd-even-for-shops/articleshow/82686180.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Several hospitals were refusing to admit pregnant women for deliveries. It was inhuman on the part of hospitals that Pavani, a resident of Sultan Bazar, was denied admission by five hospitals, which consequently led to her death in an ambulance on May 14, he said. He demanded that the state government look into the possibility of registering a double murder case against the managements of hospitals, which denied her admission.

The department has written to the government to allow them for this special service with 50% capacity but are yet to receive a reply. “This provision was revived recently but soon after, lockdown was implemented in Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh due to which movement was completed stopped. We have written to the state government to let us allow movement for this service at 50% occupancy and senior officials have also spoken to their counterparts in other states but no decision has been taken regarding it,” said an official of Rajasthan roadways. According to this provision, two persons can carry the ashes of a deceased to Haridwar and back for free in a Rajasthan Roadways bus. All they have to do is produce necessary documents including the details of the deceased as well as their own. The buses will ply from all district depots and in case on a particular city there are 23 urns and 46 persons, a special bus will be arranged for the same. However, government officials will not be allowed to take this benefit. The application for the same can be given on www.rsrtc.rajasthan.gov.in and www.rsrtconline.rajasthan.gov.in This provision was announced last year after the pandemic hit the country and lockdown was imposed due to which family members of a deceased person were finding it difficult to travel to Haridwar. This free service will also prove to be a financial burden for the department. An official said, “If the state allows movement of buses to Haridwar at 50% occupancy, we have asked the government to give us the payment for full occupancy otherwise it will be difficult to sustain.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/roadways-write-to-govt-about-free-bus-service-to-haridwar/articleshow/82692511.cms||Yeshika Budhwar

Cardinal George Alencherry has expressed his condolences and thanked the priest for his contributions to the Indian Church. “It is with a heavy heart that I came to know early this morning of the demise of Fr Dominic Fernandez OCD in Spain at the age of 96. For about 25 years, Fr Dominic guided and presided over the formation of seminarians with the zeal of a great missionary creating a community of priests deeply devoted to Jesus and committed to their faith,” the Cardinal wrote in his condolence message. Fr Dominic came to India in 1954 as a professor at St Joseph’s Pontifical seminary, Aluva. He was appointed the rector of the Seminary in 1967 and continued in that position until 1976. He was one of the main proponents behind the establishment of the Pontifical Institute of Theology and Philosophy in 1972. He was appointed its first president and continued in that position until his retirement in 1978, when he went back to Spain to continue his activities there. “The Pontifical Institute in Aluva is still functioning as one of the top theological schools in India, supporting and enlivening the intellectual and moral formation of priests in India. I was fortunate to undergo priestly formation at Aluva seminary while Fr Dominic was the rector. I was also one of the students in the first batch of the Master of Theology Course (Licentiate) of the newly-established institute. As Fr Dominic was serving as a professor and later as the rector at a time when the Church was undergoing great spiritual renewal initiated by the Second Vatican Council, he was committed to implement various measures to renew the priestly formation in the light of the Council,” the cardinal said. “The Carmelites of the Order of the Discalced (OCD) contributed immensely to the formation of priests in Kerala. Erudite, gentle and affectionate, he endeared himself to all his students and the faculty. He was humble, unflappable, extremely courteous to all and sundry who came into contact with him. The Church in India is deeply grateful to his contributions,” the cardinal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/last-european-rector-of-aluva-seminary-dies-at-96/articleshow/82688607.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ahmedabad||2008 blasts accused denied personal shaving kit||AHMEDABAD: A special court hearing the 2008 serial blasts case has turned down a request made by one of the accused to allow him to have his personal shaving kit because regular shaving does not take place in Sabarmati central jail due to Covid-19 pandemic. In his application forwarded to the court through the jail authority, a serial blasts suspect, Afaq Saiyed, submitted that common shaving kit is used in jail for many prisoners and use of such common shaving kit could prove dangerous because of the surge in Covid-19 cases. This is dangerous to prisoners’ health. The prisoner has also claimed that due to the pandemic, shaving has not taken place for a month. Therefore, he should be permitted to have his personal shaving kit, a small-size mirror, a use-and-throw plastic razor, a nail cutter and scissors. If allowed, the prisoner can take care of himself and does not have to rely on the shaving facility being made available by the prison authorities. He requested the court to direct the jail authorities to permit him to have his personal shaving kit. In response, the jail authorities opposed the prisoner’s request by citing the jail manual. The report placed before the court said that according to the jail manual, shaving service is provided to the prisoners every week and it is taking place regularly despite the pandemic situation. Moreover, the jail authority asserted that there is no provision in the jail manual to provide shaving kit to a prisoner. This prohibition is mainly aimed at maintaining jail discipline and security inside the prison. After hearing the case, designated judge A R Patel rejected Saiyed’s application and noted that the shaving facility for prisoners is regular and taking place every week according to the jail manual. Considering the jail discipline and security concerns, the request cannot be acceded to. Saiyed is one of 78 inmates who are facing the trial in the serial blasts. On July 26, 2008, a series of blasts rocked the city of Ahmedabad killing 56 persons and injuring 200 others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/08-blasts-accused-denied-personal-shaving-kit/articleshow/82690649.cms||---

Inspector Kotwali, Satyendra Singh, said the girl was rescued after locals informed police that a lone minor girl was wandering in Pani Mohalla of Murain Tola locality on Saturday. “She apparently committed suicide on Sunday at Hariharganj Childline 1098, where she was lodged after she failed to provide her home address to the team of local cops who had rescued her,” he added. During further investigation, police officials came to know that the girl hailed from a village under Pahari police station of Chitrakoot district and had left her home for a nearby market on May 7. Her parents said she didn’t return home and remained untraceable. Subsequently, they lodged a missing complaint at Pahari police station the next day. After rescuing her, police asked her about her address and family but she didn’t reveal anything, so she was taken to Childline 1098 home in Hariharganj on Saturday, where the staff found her hanging from a ‘dupatta’ in the bathroom in the early hours of Sunday, the inspector said. “A team of Sadar Kotwali and forensic experts rushed to the spot and shifted the body to the morgue after conducting preliminary investigations,” said Singh. “The girl had shared a mobile phone number with the Childline staff members during counselling. We called the number and found it was of her brother-in-law, who arrived here today to claim her body,” the inspector said. “The girl’s family members claim she had some mental imbalance. Going by initial findings, it appears the girl committed suicide, but we are awaiting the postmortem report to ascertain exact cause of death. Further investigations are underway,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/teen-girl-found-hanging-at-childline-home/articleshow/82692549.cms||---

According to city scientists, a study of water samples from lakes and rivers in cities and towns would help in not only identifying the pollution load, but also give a foresight into the spread of Covid-19 in the given localities. That the lakes in Hyderabad are highly polluted has once again been established by city scientists when they scouted water from select lakes as part of wastewater epidemiological studies to estimate the viral load of novel coronavirus. “Considering the significant human activities near water systems, it is important to conduct the long-term surveillance for possible viral contamination in water systems,” said Dr S Venkata Mohan of IICT, one of the authors of a research study on wastewater epidemiology of novel coronavirus. “Viral genetic material/fragments in sewage or in water bodies are non-viable and do not infect the community. However, the viral material can be used as a surveillance tool to understand the infection onset and spread,” he added in a study published in preprint server MedRxiv. The surge in February 2021 sample showed the on shoot of the second wave of infection which correlated well with the prevailing pandemic situation. “The presence of viral fragments and its load can be used as a surveillance tool to understand the infection spread,” he said. Pedda CheruvuPedda Cheruvu or Nacharam lake, which is currently under long term viral RNA surveillance, is spread over 90 acres. It is surrounded by a 10 lakh population. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) of the lake is 152 mg/L with total dissolved solids (TDS) of 800 mg/L and total suspended solids (TSS) of 110 mg/L respectively. The unfiltered sample of the lake showed a yellowish tinge while the lake appears dark grey in colour with eutrophication behaviour. Pedda CheruvuPedda Cheruvu According to the MedRxiv study, 75% of lake outlet samples showed positive signals for the viral genetic material presence. Monthly monitoring samples showed higher RNA copies of 9,75,668/L for December 2020. A lower copy number was observed in January 2021 (3,128 RNA copies/L), February 2021 (2,881 RNA copies/L) followed by a slight increase in March 2021 (4,665 RNA copies/L). Further April 2021 samples showed an increase in the trend of RNA copies from 17,804 RNA copies/L (April 1) to 46,217 RNA copies/L (mid-April) depicting the emergence of the second wave. Nizam lakeNizam Talab or lake at Pragathinagar area near Kukatpally is spread over 35 acres with a population of about 1.5 lakh in the catchment area. The lake showed COD of 134 mg/L and TDS of 524 mg/L. Visually the lake was transparent in colour without any sign of eutrophication. Nizam lake The samples were collected for three months, from the end of Covid-19 wave-1 till the onset and persistent phase of Covid-19 wave-2. Only a few genetic materials of the coronavirus were found in the lake. Researchers attribute it to the lake being relatively young. It does not show signs of eutrophication and it has self- regeneration capacity. HussainsagarHussainsagar lake is spread over 1409 acres. It has majorly point sources (treated sewage) of 50 MLD from two STPs. The COD of the lake showed 225 mg/L with TDS and TSS of 720 mg/L and 125 mg/L respectively. The presence of aquatic microflora was evident with signs of eutrophication. Water samples from the lake showed the presence of E-gene and N-gene of the Covid-19 virus. RNA copies of 4,160 per litre and 664 RNA copies per litre were observed in July 2020 and April 2021 respectively. This might be possible as the lake receives majority of treated water as discharge and due to dilution effect apart from the ecosystem nature.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/contaminated-lakes-an-indicator-of-viral-spread-in-city-localities/articleshow/82692580.cms||Syed Akbar

The 46-year-old leader had witnessed an impressive political journey starting from a panchayat samiti member (2002) to becoming the national president of Indian Youth Congress (2010) and serving as an MLA (2009-2014) as well as member of both Lok Sabha (2014-2019) and Rajya Sabha (2020) in a short span of time. A close confidant of former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, Satav was shouldered with several key responsibilities by the party top-brass, including Congress in-charge of Gujarat. Hailing from a political background with his mother Rajnitai Satav, Satav defied ‘Modi wave’ in 2014 general elections to secure victory from his hometown in Hingoli. A science graduate, who later completed law studies from Pune, Satav was known as a cultured and soft-spoken leader who had connected with masses as well as classes. Satav is survived by his wife and two children. In his condolence message, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has described Satav as “an upcoming leader with much potential.” “Anguished by the passing away of my friend from Parliament, Shri Rajeev Satav Ji. He was an upcoming leader with much potential. Condolences to his family, friends and supporters. Om Shanti,” Modi has tweeted. In his tweet, Rahul Gandhi, said, “I’m very sad at the loss of my friend Rajeev Satav. He was a leader with huge potential who embodied the ideals of the Congress. It’s a big loss for us all. My condolences and love to his family.” Meanwhile, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, in his condolence message, said it was painful to see untimely demise of stoic and promising political leadership in the form of Satav. “Due to his humble nature, Rajeev Satav has developed many friends beyond party and politics. He was known as a scholar who had deep faith in Parliamentary system,” Thackeray said. The last rites on Satav are scheduled to be performed at Hingoli on Monday, local Congress leaders said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/congress-leader-rajeev-satav-dies-of-post-covid-complications/articleshow/82686224.cms||---

The CPM secretariat, in a statement here on Friday, termed condemnable the approach and attitude the BJP government has developed towards Palestine in recent years. The central government should revert to the position India had been maintaining for long towards Palestinians, it said. “The CPM attitude to the Palestine issue is clear and was announced long ago. All those who believe in democracy should come up and support the Palestinian people engaged in the fight for survival,” the statement said. CPM shared the view that Israel, with support from the US, was trying to flush out Palestinians from their soil, with scant regard for human rights and international peace accords. Meanwhile, CPM politburo member M A Baby likened Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his outlook and attitude. “The cause for the violence is the occupation of Palestine by the Zionists. Like RSS men in our country, Zionists are a set of terrorists who apply religious fanaticism in politics,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/declare-solidarity-with-palestine-cpm-tells-centre/articleshow/82688659.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The minimum temperature recorded was 25.8 degree Celsius. “The outer cloud bands of the cyclone triggered rainfall in the city. The thunderstorm activity has led to a massive drop in mercury levels,” said Naga Ratna, in-charge director, India Meteorological Department (IMD), Hyderabad. According to the Telangana State Development Planning Society figures, up to 7 pm, Hyder Nagar received the highest rainfall of 59.3 mm followed by 56.8 mm at Shaikpet, 56 mm at Balaji Nagar and 50.3 mm at Madhapur. Many other areas such as Langerhouse, Manikonda, Tolichowki, Kukatpally, Jubilee Hills and Gachibowli received 10 to 30 mm rainfall. The cylone induced rain led to water logging in areas such as Karwan, Shaikpet, Attapur, Kattedan among others. Several districts such as Suryapet, Khammam, Kamareddy, Jagtial, Ranga Reddy and Yadadri Bhuvanagari also recorded light to moderate rains. Meteorologists said that pre-monsoon activity is set to intensify across the state as it has extended thunderstorms accompanied with lightning warning till May 19. “A trough from the northeast is likely to intensify in the next few days. Under it’s influence, thunderstorm is likely to occur at all districts of Telangana,” said Naga Ratna. According to the IMD, Telangana too could witness an early onset of southwest monsoon this year. “The state will no longer witness any heatwave like conditions. The temperature is likely to be below 40 degree Celsius in all districts. This monsoon, central and southern regions of the state may receive 40-50 per cent above average rains and the northern and eastern regions could receive normal rains,” he added. The meteorologists claim that unlike last year, the state will not receive heavy to very heavy rainfall, but there could be few isolated days when its heavy, resulting in floods.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/tauktae-effect-rains-in-t-early-monsoon-a-possibility/articleshow/82690777.cms||---

A majority of those who caught mucormycosis, also known as the black fungus infection, are diabetic, the data shows. The number of casualties and infections could rise further as the process of compiling data is still on. Dr Neeta Padalkar, health officer with Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), on Sunday said a core committee of experts has been formed to deal with the challenge of mucormycosis among Covid patients. “The panel involves ENT specialists, dentists and ophthalmologists from both state-run and private hospitals. These experts will provide guidance about treatment of mucormycosis in critical cases,” she said. Padalkar said the use of steroids in Covid patients with diabetes is found to be a leading cause for developing mucormycosis. “We are also expecting special guidelines from the state government on the treatment protocol of Covid patients with diabetes. A separate treatment protocol for mucormycosis patients is also expected soon,” she said. As per the data, MGM hospital has reported the highest number of Mucormycosis cases (76 from April 1 to May 15), followed by Government Medical College and Hospital, Aurangabad (50, April 2-May 1), Apex Hospital (43, April 2-May 1), Asian Hospital (24, March 10- May 10), Bajaj Hospital (5, March 10- May 10) and Dhoot Hospital (3, March 10- May 10). Both MGM Hospital and Apex Hospital have registered eight casualties each. As for surgical treatment, 52 mucormycosis patients needed maxillectomy (removal of all or part of the upper jaw) while 62 needed debridement (removal of dead, damaged or infected tissue). Another 31 patients needed functional endoscopic sinus surgery, a minimally invasive technique used to restore sinus ventilation and normal function, health authorities said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/16-die-of-mucormycosis-in-aurangabad-city-in-2nd-covid-wave/articleshow/82686311.cms||Prasad Joshi

The finance department has reportedly been asked to only release funds for salaries and other overheads needed on an urgent basis by the health department. Though there is a pension payment for retried employees, there is no clarity on the gratuity payment. Sources say bills worth over Rs 19,000 crore are pending. While there is no decision on PRC payment for employees, the financial situation is going to have a bearing on all other payments.  Even payments to panchayats to the tune of Rs 1300 crore are still due. Except for excise there is currently no income for the government as lockdown has been implemented for 10 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/state-coffers-dry-as-2nd-wave-hits-revenues/articleshow/82690834.cms||---

The new directive from the Centre has mandated gap of at least four months between two shots of Covishield. As 90% of the population is vaccinated with Covishield in Gujarat, it would have implications on the future vaccination drive,” said a senior health department official. The department officials said that the cyclone aftermath might need more hands at hospitals, and thus the vaccination would not be initiated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/no-vaccination-for-next-two-days/articleshow/82690839.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Vaccination nearly halved since beginning of April in Uttarakhand||NAINITAL: The number of vaccines administered daily in Uttarakhand has gone down by nearly half since early April. From an average of 55,000 vaccine doses given daily in the first 10 days of April, the number slipped to an average of around 40,000 towards the end of last month and hovers around 30,000 daily doses currently. On May 15, 33,090 beneficiaries were vaccinated in the state. On May 16, the number was 18,421. Till now, 6,80,066 persons have been fully vaccinated in Uttarakhand, as per the state health department data. This is despite the fact that Uttrakhand is currently one of the 15 states where active cases are still increasing, even as the countrywide case count is on a decline. It is also among the states which has one of the highest daily death counts. The state has a total of 78,802 active Covid-19 cases at this point. On April 16, the number was 13,546, meaning the number has multiplied nearly six times in a month. According to data from the state’s health department, the vaccination numbers peaked on April 8, when over a lakh people received the shot. The numbers have been on a steady decline since. In fact, even during PM Modi’s call of ‘Tika Utsav’— the four-day period between April 11 and 14 when vaccination numbers were supposed to go up — the inoculation numbers stayed around 36,000 daily doses. The third phase of the vaccination drive which was launched on May 1 across the country, for inoculation of the 18-44 age group, didn’t start until May 10 in Uttarakhand. Anoop Nautiyal, founder of Doon-based Social Development for Communities Foundation, an organisation closely tracking the Covid-19 pandemic in the Himalayan state, blamed the “confusion, complaints and chaos around the vaccination process” as the major reason for falling numbers. “What has exacerbated the entire mess is the fact that the vaccination in the private hospitals has stopped. Phase III of the vaccination process has been in chaos as people are not even able to book a slot. There needs to be a concentrated effort by both the Centre and the state to procure vaccines since a cash-strapped and small state like Uttarakhand cannot compete with bigger states in floating global tenders,” Nautiyal said. After the Centre declared that private facilities will no longer be getting vaccine stocks from the government and that they would have to procure the shots from the manufacturers on their own, owners of private hospitals also expressed helplessness. Heads of major private hospitals in Dehradun had told TOI that they had no idea about how to go about procuring vaccines on their own as no guidelines had been released by the government. Meanwhile, government officials said that while they have the capacity and the infrastructure to vaccinate close to 60,000 people daily, doses had been in short supply and they had to use them judiciously. “The doses are limited and we want to maintain continuity, so that the entire cache of vaccines are not exhausted in a few days. Also, we don’t want to create a situation where thousands of people turn up at the same site for getting the shot. Therefore, we are rationalising the use,” said Saroj Naithani, director, National Health Mission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/vaccination-nearly-halved-since-beginning-of-april-in-uttarakhand/articleshow/82688729.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Dehradun||1,000 children in Uttarakhand infected||DEHRADUN: In the last 10 days, over a thousand children below nine years of age have tested positive for the coronavirus in Uttarakhand. Some of the children also had to be admitted to hospital for treatment. The Covid-19 cases among children started rising around mid-April in the hill state. Last year, during the first wave, 2,131 children contacted the infection in Uttarakhand. Between April 1 and 15, 264 children tested positive for the virus. Between April 16 and 30, the figure grew almost four times to 1,053 and in the first 14 days of May, 1,618 children tested positive. Uttarakhand director general of health Dr Tripti Bahuguna attributed these cases to lack of space for children to isolate in most households after parents or other members of the family test positive. “Growing cases of Covid-19 are being seen countrywide, not only in Uttarakhand. Unlike before, more people in a family are testing positive for the virus, making the children sharing space with these adults more likely to contract it. In a few days, the government will release guidelines on how to keep children safe. Also, in the next month, two 500-bed facilities will be set up by the DRDO in Haldwani and Rishikesh and these will have separate wards for children,” Bahuguna said. She added that since children have a better ability to deal with the virus, they were also recuperating quickly. Anoop Nautiyal, head of Doon-based Social Development for Communities Foundation (SDCF) which is tracking the pandemic in the state, said that Uttarakhand’s situation was still very delicate. “The Covid curfew, in place for the last three weeks, has showed little improvement in numbers. In the past fortnight, out of all the 36 states and UTs of India, Uttarakhand has been ranked 7th in terms of ‘active cases’. It has more cases per lakh of population than Uttar Pradesh. The recovery rate in the state is also quite low. The cases and subsequent deaths are even more of a concern in remote hills,” Nautiyal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/1000-children-less-than-9-years-old-contracted-covid-19-in-ukhand-in-last-10-days/articleshow/82688756.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Bareilly||Do sit-ups, carry bicycle home if you roam without valid reason, say police||Bareilly: A young man was seen wandering on a bicycle amid Covid curfew on a deserted Sambhal road on Sunday. Moments later, he had to return home carrying the bicycle on his shoulder. On the next street, people - young and old - could be seen doing sit-ups. To strictly enforce the curfew, police in Sambhal have introduced such unique "punishment tactics". Those flouting Covid protocols - driving a car or riding a two-wheeler - were made to squat, crawl and hold ears through legs on the road in full public view. The innovative measures are working on the ground as people are more aware and scared to come out unnecessarily now. No one would want to do sit-ups and hold their ears and nose publicly on the road in his own locality, the police said. Sambhal SP City, Chakresh Mishra, said, “We are on our toes to ensure that the rules are followed. Some people always try to disobey. Those who fail to provide any valid reason will be punished. We are also taking the legal route.” So far, legal action has been initiated against 120 people under IPC section 188 [disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant] and 6,000 have been fined. The SP City added, “Police teams have been patrolling on foot not only the arterial roads, but also by-lanes which are usually ignored.” Patrolling one such narrow lane, cops found some youngsters loitering aimlessly. They were stopped and made to do sit-ups. Others were asked to hold their ears through legs for several minutes as "punishment", police said. The police will continue to prevent people from breaking the rules and inspections will intensify across the district, including the rural areas, the SP City said. Around 9,000 Covid cases have been reported from across the district so far, the health department in Sambhal said. There are over 1,200 active cases and 75 have succumbed to the infection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/do-sit-ups-carry-bicycle-home-if-you-roam-without-valid-reason-say-police/articleshow/82684055.cms||Maria Khan

The TRS has intensified its campaign in entire Karimnagar district to ensure that neither elected representatives nor party leaders and workers rally behind Eatala. TRS leaders had organised a media conference in Huzurabad constituency on Sunday when the supporters of Eatala reached the spot and an argument broke out between the two groups resulting in a clash. However, the timely intervention of the police kept the situation under control and several were taken into custody. Meanwhile, Eatala and Konda Surekha discussed the present political situation in the state and how the government has failed to effectively check the spread of coronavirus. Eatala has previously met CLP leader Bhatti Vikramarka, BJP MP D Aravind and ex-MP Konda Vishweshwar Reddy. He has been meeting leaders of opposition parties to gather support before taking a decision on resigning. On the other hand, BC welfare minister Ganugula Kamlakar of the TRS, has intensified his meetings with elected representatives to wean them away from Eatala’s camp. Eatala has alleged that TRS is using carrot and stick policy by luring his supporters and threatening that they will have cases booked against them if they did not leave his camp. The ruling party has termed these as baseless.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/eatala-meets-former-mla-konda-surekha/articleshow/82690864.cms||Roushan Ali

Families of the deceased said the state government must appoint a special committee to resolve technical problems related to the redevelopment of buildings to stop such tragedies. The city has over 400 buildings constructed between 1990 and 2000 when mostly inferior quality material was used.  In the last decade itself, over 2,000 people have become homeless and have been forced to live on rental basis after at least 50 buildings either collapsed or got sealed by Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation (UMC) due to their dilapidated condition. Shockingly, local sources said only one of these 50 ill-fated buildings has been redeveloped. Prem Dotwal, whose cousin Harish Dotwal died in the Mohini Palace crash, said, “The government needs to do something for Ulhasnagar. On Saturday, I lost my cousin brother and his two family members. Three years ago, my house crashed in a similar building collapse.”  On Sunday, UMC commissioner DR Raja Dayanidhi held a meeting with senior civic officials and later announced a list of 148 dangerous buildings on the corporation’s website. Of these, 23 buildings have been declared “very dangerous”. UMC spokesperson Yuvraj Bhadane said 19 of these had already been vacated. Residents of another four buildings are being urged to vacate their premises. “We have also appealed to citizens to get structural audits done,” Bhadane said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-redevpt-of-illegal-ulhas-bldgs-must/articleshow/82694197.cms||Pradeep Gupta

According to an estimate, at the current rate of 1.07 lakh doses each month, it will take 28 months to cover this age group. The numbers of estimated persons in Himachal Pradesh who are eligible for vaccination under this category are around 31 lakh and to cover this age group 73 lakh doses are required while state so far has received 1,07,620 doses of Covishield from Serum Institute of India, Pune to cover the age group of 18-44 years. The vaccine drive would start from Monday for which only 21,090 persons have been able to book their schedule so far. The vaccination for this age group will be given only on Mondays and Thursdays and sessions will be updated in the Cowin portal two days prior to each scheduled session. Vaccination will be held on May 17, May 20, May 24, May 27 and May 31 for 18 to 44 years age group and after that when vaccination will be carried for remaining lot would depend on the availability of vaccines. Several persons in the age group of 18-44 years in Himachal are struggling to get themselves registered on the Cowin portal. According to sources, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur on Sunday spoke to Union minister for health Harsh Vardhan and requested him to provide vaccination doses to cover the 18-44 years age group in the state. Government officials requesting anonymity said state has all the required infrastructure to cover 18-44 years age group in few week, but only problem faced is that vaccine is not available.

A home guard jawan accompanying the police team was injured in stone pelting by the villagers. The injured home guard jawan was identified as Balmiki Prasad Yadav (57). His service rifle was also snatched. Yadav, who received injuries in head and legs, was immediately rushed to a local hospital. The state government has allowed gathering of maximum 20 people at marriage functions. No orchestra, DJ or procession is permitted and the concerned police station would have to be informed about such events at least three days in advance. SHO of Khusrupur police station Chandra Bhanu said around 500 people had gathered in the village to attend the wedding amid lockdown. “Orchestra and dancing were also on. The baraat with huge number of guests had come from neighbouring Chainpur village. The administration and police were not informed about the wedding ceremony in advance,” Bhanu added. The SHO said he reached the village around 12.15am along with a police team to disperse the gathering. “Before raiding the house, we had called up the bride’s father, Suresh Singh, an affluent farmer, and asked him to obey rules. He, however, did not listen to us. As the police team reached the spot, the villagers started pelting stones in which the home guard jawan was injured,” the SHO added. He said Fatuha SDPO Rajesh Kumar Manjhi also reached the spot with additional police forces and the situation was brought under control around 2.30am. “Raids are on to arrest those involved in attacking the police team and holding marriage function in violation of lockdown norms. They have fled the village,” the SHO said, adding it is still not clear whether the marriage took place or not. He said the fathers of the bride and groom and around 40 other people have been named as accused in the FIR. The other unknown people who attended the marriage function have also been booked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/500-attend-wedding-attack-cops-for-challenging-them/articleshow/82688832.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Financial aid brings solace to Covid orphans||AHMEDABAD: The heart-wrenching visuals of a 10-year-old boy performing last rites of his mother who succumbed to Covid would have sent shivers down the spine of those who watched it. For a week ago, he had performed a similar ceremony for his father who passed away after being infected with Covid-19. The two deaths that left the child orphan took place in Bharuch district in the first half of May, said a person aware of the matter. In another instance, a four-year-old girl was reportedly undergoing treatment for coronavirus at a hospital in Bhavnagar, oblivious to the fact that her parents have succumbed to the deadly virus at a nearby hospital. Such messages have been doing rounds in social media during the second Covid wave. In a message, being circulated on social media, two young siblings, less than five years old, lost their parents in Covid-19. Taking a leaf from Madhya Pradesh, the Gujarat government recently announced a monthly assistance of Rs 4,000 for children who have been orphaned in Covid-19 pandemic. The financial assistance will continue till the child is 18 years old. “It is possible that a child who has lost both his parents may be from a nuclear family hence the government should plan for their proper rehabilitation and their free education,” said an official. The state core committee at its meeting on Friday, chaired by chief minister Vijay Rupani, announced to pay Rs 4,000 per month assistance to children rendered orphan following death of mother and father due to coronavirus. Those present at the meeting included education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasma, energy minister Saurabh Patel, minister of state for home Pradeepsinh Jadeja, chief secretary Anil Mukim, chief minister’s chief principal secretary K Kailashnathan, ACS Pankaj Kumar and M K Das and principal secretary (health) Jayanti Ravi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/financial-aid-brings-solace-to-covid-orphans/articleshow/82690893.cms||---

The campaign, under the banner of Chellanam Janakiyavedi, features the hashtag SaveChellanamKochi and it includes the pictures and videos of flood-hit houses in the region. The campaign gathered momentum with many people from various places in the state extending solidarity to the residents. They have used Facebook Live to mark their protests and the posts were shared across social media platforms. “Almost all places along Kerala coast witnessed sea erosion and coastal flooding due to the cyclone and resultant rains. But in Chellanam, the severity was so high because of the neglect of the government in ensuring coastal security measures at the right time despite huge protests and continuous requests of the residents. We cannot protest outside now due to the flooding and the pandemic and so decided to launch an online protest,” said Mariyamma George chairperson, Janakiyavedi. Meanwhile, the sea erosion and flooding continued severely in the coastal region of Ernakulam for a fourth consecutive day. While Chellanam remained the worst-affected place, many other places in Kochi taluk like Kannamali, Saudi, Fort Kochi, etc also witnessed sea flooding and coastal erosion on Sunday. Many of the houses along the coast of West Kochi were inundated throughout the day. Though the strength of the waves reduced, high tides seeped over the seawalls in most places to flood houses lying close to the sea. In Chellanam, the flooding was severe as there is no seawall in most places. The district administration opened 35 relief camps in the district and 27 among them are in Kochi taluk. Around 1,317 people are residing in the camps in Kochi taluk.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/chellanam-residents-begin-online-protest/articleshow/82688817.cms||---

It has released data to flag mental health concerns with over 82% of the eldery complaining of anxiety due to rising Covid-19 cases and casualties around them. Around 70.2% of respondents were found suffering from sleeplessness or insomnia or nightmares due to poor quality of sleep. During the past month, it was also found that 63% of the elderly developed symptoms of depression due to loneliness and social isolation and unceasing stress The analysis is based on feedback collected between April 10 and May 10. More than half (55%) of the elderly claimed that they are also feeling weak and fatigued due to change in lifestyle, restrictions and other factors. At the same time, over 52% complained of loss of appetite. Agewell Foundation Founder Himanshu Rath said, “During the past month, there was overall rise of 50% in the number of older people seeking counselling or help for psychological issues.” These concerns are also reflected in the nature of calls being received by organisations like HelpAge India. Dr Imtiaz Ahmed, mission head, Agecare, said not only have the number of calls increased across 24 states on HelpAge India’s toll-free helpline number (1800-180-1253), the overall experience reflects a growing sense of vulnerability with loneliness and uncertainty emerging as the common thread. The helpline has had calls from the elderly seeking a varied range of assistance—from hospital beds, oxygen to seeking assistance for transportation. Recognising that vaccination holds the key to fighting the virus, HelpAge is now totally focussed on making the elderly aware and overcome vaccine hesitancy besides facilitating them to get vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/study-covid-deaths-have-affected-82-of-elderly-with-anxiety/articleshow/82695745.cms||Ambika Pandit
---||Hyderabad||Unseasonal rains damage paddy, farmers want MSP from govt||Hyderabad: The unseasonal rains lashing many parts of the state under the influence of cyclone Tauktae has damaged paddy in Telangana. Farmers are demanding that the state government purchase the soaked paddy at Rs 1,888 and Rs 1,868 per quintal as per the minimum support price (MSP). Farmers have been taking their paddy to the procurement centres set up by the government for over a month. The state government had set a target of procuring 80 lakh metric tonnes of paddy from farmers this season and had also given a counter guarantee to the Civil Supplies Corporation to obtain Rs 20,000 crore loan from banks. The corporation procures paddy directly from the farmers and deposits the money into their bank account. The produce is then sent to rice millers who later give it back to the state government, which in turn gives it to the Food Corporation of India (FCI). On payments from FCI, the corporation repays its loans. However, this season, the procurement has been badly hit by Covid-19 and unseasonal rains. Several staff at procurement centres were infected with Covid-19 and a large number of workers involved in loading and unloading paddy at these procurement centres and rice mills went back to their native states like Bihar, Odisha, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh. Members of various farmer associations said that the paddy was soaked in rain water both in the agricultural fields and at government procurement centres. All India Kisan Congress state president Anvesh Reddy alleged that rice millers in connivance with officials were troubling farmers by saying that paddy that was brought to them was of inferior quality and was already moist and chaffy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/unseasonal-rains-damage-paddy-farmers-want-msp-from-govt/articleshow/82690899.cms||Roushan Ali

---||Delhi||Scores duped in name of Covid care at home||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police has made multiple arrests for alleged cheating of kin of Covid-19 patients on the pretext of setting up home ICU or providing oxygen cylinders at home. Two foreigners have been arrested by Crime Branch for allegedly duping around 1,000 people from across the country of over Rs 2 crore in the name of providing oxygen cylinders and Covid medicines. “The gang was operating 17 bank accounts to receive money. We have seized 165 SIM cards, 22 mobile phones, five laptops, two WiFi dongles and four debit cards,” said joint commissioner Shibesh Singh. The accused have been identified as Chika Benneth from Nigeria and Jonathan Kojo from Ghana. A victim had complained that he had paid a man Rs 16,000 for an oxygen cylinder and Rs 4,000 as transport charges for its home delivery. After the payment was made, the accused went off the radar. The cops found that a mobile number, 858691****, was used in several such crimes registered in several police stations of Delhi and tracked the suspects in Green Park. In another operation in north Delhi, a BTech student has been arrested for allegedly duping people by offering to set up an ICU at home for critical Covid patients, DCP (north) Anto Alphonse said. Aryan Singh has duped 47 people during the pandemic, the DCP said. “He used to put up Instagram stories and ask users to amplify them so that the needy could be helped,” he added. The accused got the idea when he had uploaded a request for help for a friend and got an enormous response. He accepted payments below Rs 5,000 as an advance, thinking people won’t go to police, said a source. A team of inspector Sunil Kumar and others arrested him from Pathankot after a chase of 48 hours. “The accused posed as a representative of a reputed foundation and even provided its URL to gain trust of his targets,” Alphonse said. The accused, a resident of Sector 77 in Noida, had been staying at luxury hotels in Noida, Gurgaon and Jammu while committing these crimes. In Shahdara, the cops started tracking a fraudster after receiving a complaint from a man whose entire family had tested positive. On April 27, the condition of his father-in-law started deteriorating and oxygen cylinders were required. “The victim received a message on WhatsApp claiming to sell and make home delivery of oxygen cylinders. When he called the number, a person asked him to transfer an advance of Rs 50,000 for two oxygen cylinders, which the victim did immediately,” the DCP said. Thereafter, the accused went underground. A team of inspector Hira Lal and others tracked the account holder, Jai Kishan, a first-year undergraduate student, who had allegedly duped more than 10 people of Rs 3 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/scores-duped-in-name-of-covid-care-at-home/articleshow/82692691.cms||---
---||Kochi||Ernakulam: ‘LINI Pod’ to keep frontline health workers safe from Covid infection||KOCHI: At a time when the increased use of personal protective equipment (PPE) kits due to the pandemic is contributing significantly to the existing plastic menace, two newly-graduated engineers in Ernakulam are proposing an alternative method to keep frontline health workers safe from Covid-19 in the line of duty. Anurag P A and Sanoob M, who graduated as mechanical engineers from the Cochin University of Science and Technology (Cusat) in 2021, have designed a manoeuvrable transport pod called ‘LINI Pod’ for doctors and nurses giving them the option to get rid of PPE kits while on duty. It has been named in memory of Lini Puthussery, the nurse who died battling Nipah virus. She had contracted the virus while treating a patient in 2018. From within the safety and comfort of the enclosed pod, which has wheels under it and is powered by an electrical motor, health workers can easily manoeuvre in the hospital and interact with Covid patients or suspects without making direct contact with them. LINI Pod has already been selected as one among the Top 20 Innovations in the Innovations Unlocked: Student Innovators Meet 2020 organized by Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM) and it is now eligible for Covid response grant worth Rs 1.4 lakh under the Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA) scheme operated by Cusat Technology Business Incubator (TBI) of Cusatech Foundation. The young engineers are now working on developing the prototype of the pod at the earliest. “The idea came up last year when the pandemic became severe and KSUM decided to invite innovative suggestions from students to fight the pandemic. Due to the surge in pandemic, doctors and nurses need to work hard and they get exhausted by working in PPE kits for long hours. Even with PPE kits, many doctors and nurses are affected by Covid. Our intention is to boost the confidence of health workers by providing a much better utility and safe equipment to fight Covid,” said Anurag, a native of Edakochi. The movement of the pod can be controlled by the person from inside using joysticks or pedal. Doctors can tend to the patients lying on beds as the pod has the option of bending or leaning forward without compromising the safety. Air circulation is ensured within the pod with dedicated air filter and it also has the option to install air conditioner or oxygen cylinder. A stethoscope can be installed on the pod. “Doctors can move around anywhere in the Covid wards at maximum safety and take breaks without the fuss of removing and re-donning PPE kits. Unlike PPE kits, the pod can be reused after sanitization. We have registered as a startup named Black Owl Technologies and are looking for sponsors to fund the project so that we can complete the prototype with some advanced modifications,” Anurag said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/lini-pod-to-keep-frontline-health-workers-safe-from-covid-infection/articleshow/82688854.cms||Anantha Narayanan K

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: MCQ inadequate, colleges mull newer methods of assessment||MUMBAI: The pandemic has forced universities to rely largely on an online MCQ-based (multiple choice questions) test to assess students. A year later, a few autonomous colleges in the city are now making an attempt to improvise testing methods. While Sophia College for Women has already brought down the weightage given to MCQ-based semester-end examination, St Xavier’s College is planning it too. A few others are including subjective questions and a more flexible approach to assessing postgraduate students. Most autonomous colleges currently follow the 60-40 pattern of assessment, where 40 marks are for the internal assessment and 60 for the semester-end exams. Sophia College decided to reduce the weightage given to semester-end exams by shifting from 75-25 pattern to 50-50 in December. The dependence on a single MCQ test was not enough to assess students for the whole semester, said principal of the college, Ananda Amritmahal. “At a workshop organised by the UGC, it was suggested that colleges eventually move to the 50-50 pattern. In the pandemic, we thought it would be better to assess students over a period of time rather than just rely on one single test. There are several good instruments to assess students in internal exams, be it presentations, viva-voce, assignments or tests on smaller modules. It will enable students to perform well in whatever they are good at,” said Amritmahal. St Xavier’s College is planning to reduce the weightage given to end-semester exams in the coming academic session. Principal of the college, Rajendra Shinde, said the final decision will be taken only after clearance from the college’s governing body. “The change, if approved, would be applicable only for the pandemic period and then we would revert to the old pattern,” he said. “The end-semester exams are becoming only about MCQs, where students’ creativity and thinking ability is not challenged. This dependency can be reduced by changing the internal assessment pattern,” added Shinde. A few colleges are taking a flexible approach for postgraduate courses. Anushree Lokur, principal of Ramnarain Ruia College, said they would allow flexibility in the way PG students are assessed in the 40-mark internal assessment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mcq-inadequate-colleges-mull-newer-methods-of-assessment/articleshow/82694269.cms||Yogita Rao
---||Delhi||DU teachers seek breather on internal assessments||NEW DELHI: With many students and their families infected with Covid-19, some even losing their loved ones, Delhi University teachers have highlighted that students are finding it difficult to submit their internal assessment assignments. DU Teachers’ Association (DUTA) has written to the vice-chancellor seeking a relaxation in the deadline for the semester-IV students. DUTA has also sought that the academic sessions for the first-year students be suspended further. It has already been postponed by a week following students’ requests. Hit by Covid, many teachers are also finding it “difficult to meet these deadlines. As there will be no semester-end examinations for the continuing students, this relief can be given to students and teachers”, urged DUTA. Even for the final-year students, teachers hope that an alternate mode of assessment would be adopted so that their results can be declared on time. Students have been demanding that the scheduled online open book examination be cancelled. “The university should use its energy in declaring pending fifth semester results so that students can get degrees on time. The university should pursue the matter with UGC and the ministry of education, if so required,” demanded DUTA. With the university following different academic calendars for the first-years, DUTA also wants changes in deadlines of internal assessment submissions and examination schedules. Reiterating its demand for ad hoc teachers, DUTA said their work must be counted during the summer vacation as many had faced losses due to Covid-19. At Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), the teachers’ association has written to the registrar for setting up a Covid care centre as per directions of Delhi High Court. It has also asked for details on the Covid cases in the campus. “Data would help in drawing up protocols for collection and dispersal of garbage from Covid-affected households,” said JNU Teachers’ Association. The absence of a protocol and safety gear has led to infection of four workers engaged in garbage collection, it stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/du-teachers-seek-breather-on-internal-assessments/articleshow/82692844.cms||---

---||Surat||Less painful: Saliva swabs match 87% with nasal tests||SURAT: Many people avoided Covid tests merely for the alarming prospect of being poked inside the nose. While it caused massive discomfort for the patient, it was equally if not more hazardous for the health worker who remained exposed to the threat of being sneezed upon. However, that will all be in the past if a non-invasive method under study, in which a patient collects his own oral saliva in a container and deposits it for testing at a nearby laboratory, proves as effective a method. In a path breaking study conducted by four doctors from Government Medical College (GMC) in Surat, the team comprising Dr Gunvant Parmar, Dr Neeta Khandelwal, Dr Stuti Jhala and Dr Apexa Rana, all doctors at New Civil Hospital (NCH), has developed a more convenient method. Their findings were also published in International Journal of Research and Review, a journal listed by global indexing agency Index Copernicus, in March 2021. Researchers collected nasal (nasopharyngeal) and oral swab samples of around 200 positive patients to compare virus content in both through RT-PCR tests. Samples were collected from Covid Hospital in NCH between October and December 2020. Results of 82 percent (164 samples) matched wherein they tested negative in both types of samples. Results of five percent (10 patients) matched in positive cases. Of the entire samples, 11 percent (22 patients) tested positive in nasopharyngeal/oral swab but tested negative in saliva specimens. Similarly, three percent (6 patients) were found negative in nasopharyngeal/oral swab but positive in saliva specimens. “While similar studies have been done abroad, it is the first of its kind study here as I could not find any study reference in India. The results are satisfactory and saliva testing can be used,” said Dr Parmar, professor and HoD, dentistry at GMC. Dr Jhala and Dr Rana are junior doctors in the dentistry department. Dr Parmar further said that testing saliva is cost effective as it doesn’t require trained staff for sample collection as sample can be deposited by the patient in collection centre. Unlike the swab collection, the hazards of sneezing or coughing that can spread infection is also reduced. “People don’t like the collection of nasal or oral swabs since it is painful but the collection of saliva is easy. RT-PCR testing is 70 percent accurate and its results remain largely the same in both types of samples,” Dr Khandelwal, professor and nodal officer for Covid-19 testing told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/less-painful-saliva-swabs-match-87-with-nasal-tests/articleshow/82688946.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

The girl, hailing from Narwal town of Maharajpur, was set to get married to a man of the neighbouring Palhepur village on Friday, but things took a different turn. As per reports, after ‘baarat’ had arrived, when pre-wedding rituals were scheduled to take place, the groom disappeared under mysterious circumstances from the venue leaving the bride and her family members in a shock. After searching for a while, the bride’s family members later got to know that the groom was not missing, rather he had deliberately fled from the spot for reasons best known to him. “On coming to know about the development, the bride’s family members were in a shock and the bride -to-be started crying inconsolably at the `shaadi-mandap’. Seeing this, a guest from the groom side, who had mediated the things earlier, immediately put forth a proposal before the girl and her parents of getting her married to a suitable `baraati’ (guest from the groom side) right at the moment,” said a group of guests from the bride side. Both the families agreed on this alliance, and without any delay, they got the two married at the venue. After this, the bride side approached the police and lodged a complaint against the groom and his family members. “We have received a complaint in this regard from both the bride and groom sides. While the bride side stated in their complaint for suitable action against the groom and his family members, the groom’s father Dharampal in his complaint requested the police to trace his missing son. Investigations are continuing in this regard,” said inspector Narwal Shesh Narain Pandey.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/bride-weds-baraati-after-groom-goes-missing-from-venue/articleshow/82692708.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
---||Dehradun||Corpses in Ganga may infect dolphins, gharials, warn scientists||DEHRADUN: Scientists at Doon-based Wildlife Institute of India have expressed fears regarding the Gangetic river dolphins (Platanista gangetica) and gharials (Gavaialis gangeticus) in the Ganga being infected by Covid-19 mainly by the corpses of those who died due to the disease. The scientists’ fears are compounded by the fact that Bihar and Uttar Pradesh – where infected corpses were found floating in the river recently – is a major stretch of the Ganga where Gangetic Dolphins and gharials and various other aquatic mammals are found. The 2,525-km-long Ganga which starts from Gaumukh in Uttarakhand and passes through at least 11 states of India is the only habitat of these two mammals. There are over 1,000 gharials and around 2,500-3,000 Gangetic Dolphins in the river. According to scientists, gharial and Gangetic Dolphin are both quite vulnerable as they breathe through lungs unlike other smaller fishes which breathe through gills. Also, they are categorised as ‘Critically Endangered’ and ‘Endangered’ respectively by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Both the species are also tagged under Schedule I of the Indian Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The scientists’ concerns come in the wake of a few other wild animals like lions and tigers having been infected by Covid-19 recently. Speaking to TOI, K Sivakumar, senior scientist, WII, said, “Since lions are mammals and they were found infected, aquatic mammals like Gangetic Dolphins and ghariyals are also susceptible. We are really worried about the threat as the government has spent a lot of money in the conservation of these species.” On whether the virus transmission can happen through water, he said, “We really don’t know enough about how the virus spreads but since it is believed that it spreads through air droplets, it can spread through water too.” Another senior scientist, Qamar Qureshi added that there is an urgent need to formulate a robust strategy for proper disposal of corpses so that effect on the environment is minimised. “Robust monitoring should be done so that corpses are not disposed in the river. Besides impacting aquatic life, it also impacts the health of people living near the rivers. Proper disposal is also essential as a mark of respect towards the dead.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/floating-corpses-in-ganga-may-infect-gangetic-dolphins-gharials-say-scientists-at-wildlife-institute-of-india-raise-alarm/articleshow/82688931.cms||Shivani Azad

Shifa Khan, the accused, told the police she had no money to take care of the child and was forced to abandon her. On May 7, a social worker informed the Sion police after a resident of a housing society found a five-day-old infant lying outside the gate around 2pm. The police immediately sent a team and took the child to a hospital. She was admitted to the ICCU as a precaution but found to be unharmed. On checking CCTV footage, police noticed a woman leaving the baby at the gate and walking away. The woman appeared poor from her appearance. The crime branch as well as local police made inquiries at public hospitals and nursing homes. The baby’s photo was circulated to all police stations. Sleuths carried out door-to-door visits of slum colonies till a team led by inspector Jagdish Bhambal and assistant inspector Rajesh Patil tracked down Khan to a colony in Dharavi a few days later. Khan already had two older children, aged four and three. She told the police that her husband was an alcoholic and did not provide for the family. Five days after the child's birth, Khan abandoned her at the society gate, hoping someone would find her and look after her. A case has been registered under Section 317 of the Indian Penal Code.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mother-of-baby-girl-abandoned-outside-hsg-soc-traced-arrested/articleshow/82694364.cms||---

Himanshu Kumar, a native of Shankarpur in Saurikh police area, and an assistant teacher posted at Gapchariyapur Basic school, had gone to his nearby fields. “On the way, he was waylaid by nine assailants, riding separate bikes, who opened indiscriminate firing on him leaving him critically injured,” said police. Hearing the gun-shot sound, villagers rushed to Himanshu’s rescue. After a brief chase, the villagers managed to nab one of the assailants. The firing led to tension in the area. Senior police officials rushed to the spot with a large police force. The injured teacher was admitted to a hospital in Chhibramau. Preliminary findings revealed that enmity with his rivals in the recently concluded panchayat elections could be the cause behind the attack, informed the police. “We will lodged an attempt to murder case and have detained few suspects in this connection. The main accused are still on the run,” said inspector Saurikh Poonam Awasthi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/teacher-shot-at-over-poll-rivalry/articleshow/82692721.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Mussoorie docs revamping town’s Covid defence line||DEHRADUN: After realising that poor-quality face masks are leading to a greater transmission of Covid-19, Dr Sunil Sanon, Mussoorie-based physician took it upon himself to distribute free N-95 and multi-layered masks to frontline workers and financially weaker communities in the hill town. He has, so far, along with his wife Dr Venu Sanon, purchased nearly 4,000 masks and has been distributing them to people in need in the hill town. Elaborating about the rationale behind the venture, Dr Sanon said, “Asha workers, sanitation staff and those involved in the delivery of essential services are doing a great service by carrying on their duty amidst the raging pandemic. Therefore, it is imperative to provide them with good-quality safety gear to protect them from contracting the virus.” An active campaign to provide good-quality face masks in slums is also being carried by the doctor couple with the help of some volunteers. “The infection can spread rapidly if people living in the slums catch the virus. Thus, we are putting a special focus on mask distribution in these areas. Also, masks are being provided to security guards, vendors, daily wagers, waterline workers, and sanitation staff,” Dr Sanon told TOI. Rhitik, a Karate coach associated with the drive, said, “The students at my Karate Academy and I are sensitising people on the need to wear a mask and also ensuring their effective distribution.” Meanwhile, the Sanons have also been volunteering their services in villages around Mussoorie. “We are ensuring delivery of medicines at the doorstep of Covid-19 patients in remote areas. We have also been treating people suffering from chronic illnesses in villages. Many of these patients, suffering from severe diseases like epilepsy and others, are recovering well but they need regular medication. Our volunteers are trying to ensure free delivery of essential medicines to such patients.” Recently, the couple also donated a BiPap machine, a type of ventilator used to treat chronic conditions, to the Mussoorie Civil Hospital. Emphasising the need for the community to step up and help others in need, Dr Sanon said, “In a war, everyone has to chip in. Those who can, should help those in need. Only then can the war be won.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/from-distributing-masks-to-treating-villagers-for-free-mussoorie-doctor-couple-strengthening-hill-towns-covid-defence-line/articleshow/82688975.cms||---
---||Kolkata||State plans to float global tender to import vaccine||Kolkata: Bengal government is consulting with experts before it floats a global tender to purchase vaccines. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has already declared that she wants all in Bengal to be vaccinated for free. Experts feel that even if a global tender is floated now, the vaccine supply might be by the end-July or in August. A senior official said that the Bengal government is interested in importing Sputnik V and is looking for its availability and is also keen on Novovax and Johnson & Johnson’s single dose other than Pfizer’s vaccine. But the Centre must clear the passage as Indian drug regulatory authority has to give the nod, the official said. He added that some of the manufacturers are producing vaccines in such a manner that they can be preserved in normal freezes. Earlier, some vaccines had to be kept at 80°C. On May 12, Banerjee had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging him to “speedily import vaccines” to overcome the shortage. Banerjee also said that Bengal is “ready to provide land and support for any manufacturing/franchisee operation for authentic vaccine manufacturing.” The CM’s letter also coincided with a letter to the PM by senior opposition leaders and chief ministers, including Banerjee, who demanded that all vaccines be procured “centrally from all available sources — global and domestic.” “The vaccination process in Bengal had been hit badly due to the inadequate supply and illogical orders by the Centre,” said Sukumar Mukherjee who is part of Bengal government’s health expert team. He said that those, whose second vaccine dose, mostly Covishield, was due from mid May, were unable to get their dose as the Centre changed norms suddenly and made a mandatory gap of 12 weeks, instead of six weeks from the first dose. “The Bengal government might opt for contacting the global vaccine producers through a tender so that the supply of vaccine remains constant and there is no lapse,” said Mukherjee. Mukherjee said that while the UK announced to reduce the gap between the first and the second dose to eight weeks from 12 weeks, the vaccination process was delayed in India at that time without citing any reason “This contradiction is worrisome,” said Mukherjee, adding, “The Centre did not say whether the delay in vaccination will increase the efficacy.” With the price range varying, the state government will decide on this only after consulting the vaccine producers. Mukherjee said that each dose of Covishield will cost Rs 1,500, Covaxim will cost Rs 750 and Sputnik V will be Rs 1,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-plans-to-float-global-tender-to-import-vaccine/articleshow/82691038.cms||---

He said the plant would strengthen the infrastructure of the hospital and boost the fight against Covid-19 pandemic. “The city is also in the grip of Covid and was facing shortage of oxygen, but now liquid oxygen is being supplied even to neighbouring districts because of the steps taken by state government as oxygen plants are being installed at several hospitals,” he said. In UHM hospital, the plant was installed in just 21 days. This hospital would soon get one more oxygen plant, he added. He had released Rs 47 lakh for the oxygen plant at Kanshiram hospital which would be installed next month. BiPAP machines had also been sanctioned for the medical college, the minister said.  MLC Salil B Bishnoi had also released Rs 25 lakh while other MLAs and MLCs have also announced handsome amounts to improve health infrastructure in the city. He said Kanpur city would soon be equipped with permanent health infrastructure to face the third corona wave.

---||Kolkata||Watchdog lens on medicine supply chain in Kolkata||KOLKATA: With the city facing a shortage of medicines including Doxycycline — that are often prescribed for Covid-19 management — the Directorate of Drugs Control has asked pharmacy owners and those with the supply chain of medicines to ensure a better availability of the drug. On Saturday the directorate took stock of the situation at a meeting with the pharmacies and clearing and forwarding agents — those who manage the supply chain of companies. “The directorate has asked pharmacies to ensure smooth supply of medicines including Doxycycline, Methyl Prednisolone and paracetamol. We have already got in touch with lesser-known companies who produce medicines like Doxycycline. That has improved the supply crunch a bit,” said Sajal Ganguly, general secretary of Bengal Chemists and Druggists Association. Pharmacies on Sunday complained that some of the big manufacturers are sending 10-15% of the orders placed with them. Abesh Mazumder, who represented clearing and forwarding agents at the Saturday meeting said that the shortage has become more perceptible as patients are stressing on the few big brands of Doxycycline. “Doctors are prescribing a few branded ones for Doxycycline and patients are insisting on that. There is supply from the less popular and small companies. We are constantly in touch with the manufacturers for faster shipment of medicines,” Mazumder said. Saurabh Kumar Ghosh of Nabajiban Hospital said that in case of shortage of Methyl Prednysolone, other steroids like Dexamethasone can be used. “It is true for using Azithromycin in treating Covid-19 patients. Doctors can prescribe alternative medicines keeping the supply shortage of a few brands in mind,” he said. With both anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties, Doxycycline was being prescribed to prevent secondary bacterial infection. “It also helps to transport zinc intracellularly, increasing the cellular concentrations of zinc that inhibit coronavirus replication,” said Sivaresmi Unnithan, consultant pulmonologist with a city nursing home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/watchdog-lens-on-med-supply-chain/articleshow/82691041.cms||Rohit Khanna

---||Chandigarh||Estate office set to offer online payment option||Chandigarh: The estate office of the UT administration is ready to offer online payment for multiple services following a tie-up with the State Bank of India (SBI). The finance department will decide on allowing a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the bank to launch the new service. The estate office receives charges of different nature like ground rent or lease money from industries and commercial properties (showrooms, shop-cum-offices, shop-cum-flats, booths and shops) and others. Besides, the estate office also charges money for increasing FAR (floor area ratio), and takes amount of building branch and penalties and other charges. Sources said the estate office gets around Rs 90 to 100 crore annually from 15,000 to 20,000 properties situated in different locations across the city. “The gateway will be of SBI and around 50 banks will connected with it to make the payment. There will be a link on the official website of the estate office through which people will be able to make the payment without any hitch. Since the matter is related to a major financial transaction, we have sent the MoU to the finance department for approval. Once we get the green signal, this new initiative will be launched,” sources said. Currently, people make the payment through demand draft, which is quite time consuming. Although the estate office a few months back came up with a system to process the drafts as soon as possible, it is quite a lengthy exercise as compared to online payment. There is an option of net banking too, but sources said a majority of the people prefer to make payment through drafts only. DIGITISATION Online payment initiative is a part of the digitisation of the estate office. The department has been working hard to reduce the man-to-man contact. Sources said the move is ideal during the coronavirus pandemic, when people need to restrict their movement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/estate-office-set-to-offer-online-payment-option/articleshow/82689084.cms||Deepak Yadav
---||Kolkata||Rush to replenish stock as sanitisers fly off shelves||Kolkata: With branded sanitisers flying off the the shelves in most drug stores and standalone shops on Sunday, retailers fear unless stocks are replenished fast they may run out of supply. While customers have become more aware of using branded hand sanitisers now, pharmacists are finding it difficult to get enough supply. Most of the branded hand sanitisers, manufactured mainly by FMCG companies are sold through grocery stores or cosmetics shops. While pharmacy stores have started to stock branded products after repeated customer demand, supply of these hand sanitisers to neighbourhood drug stores is yet to match the demand. “If you compare the situation with what we had in last March, it has definitely improved. But the demand has grown further and people have become conscious of the brands,” said Somnath Ghosh of Metro Pharma. The pharmacy chain sells nearly 300 bottles of varying sizes each day through eight stores it has in the city. “We are trying to ration the sale through selling limited number of bottles to each customer,”Ghosh said. Earlier this month, World Health Organisation (WHO) came out with the recommendation of using a palmful of hand sanitiser to cover all surface of the hands. In an Instagram post, WHO said that alcohol in sanitisers have not shown to create any relevant health issue. It also said that alcohol based sanitiser does not create antibiotic resistance. “Unlike other antiseptics and antibiotics, pathogens (harmful germs) do not seem to develop resistance to alcohol-based sanitisers,” it said. Pharmacists on Sunday indicated that sale of alcohol-based hand sanitiser has gone up following that. “There has already been a steadily increasing demand for hand sanitisers of reputable brands. People, who could last year be seen buying hand sanitiser from a road-side shop, have started procuring it from medicine shops now. There are brands that might not be popular, but they manufacture products under strict guidelines,” said Manik Lal Das, secretary (south Kolkata) of the Bengal Chemists and Druggists Association. According to Sanjay Mukim, a wholesaler of medicines at Mehta Building, several chemical manufacturing companies have now ventured into making hand sanitisers. “Hand sanitiser is not our main business but we keep stock as there is a demand. We carry out due diligence before procuring from an unknown company and check for the WHO standards in the composition,” Mukim said. “The shortage could be for a few big brands, but there is enough supply from less popular companies,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rush-to-replenish-stock-as-sanitisers-fly-off-shelves/articleshow/82691045.cms||Rohit Khanna
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Coastal road reclamation must create public spaces||By: Harshad Bhatia News in a leading daily on March 26 revealed that the coastal road proposal estimates land reclamation of 111 hectares, or the area of 12 Oval Maidans, of which 72% is complete. History has it that reclamations in the area from Colaba to Mahim provided a contiguous land mass to seven separate islands. This part is called the island city, and the area further north forms the suburbs under the Greater Mumbai Municipal Corporation limits. The coastal road proposes to be a mobility network primarily and the ongoing construction is part of the designed alignment. Currently, its implementation gained an advantage during the lockdown in 2020 that slowed this otherwise jostling city. That this reclamation is a tangible reality now can be seen on Google Earth online. There is no looking back here — only a recollection of the sanity in questioning the proposed coastal road’s disturbing impact on a sensitive marine ecology, the economics of financial cost versus recovery and such concerns raised from the beginning of this megaproject. This shall not go unnoticed in the transportation history of the city with collateral damage in ecological terms and intentional gains from reclamation to create more land for the city. It is this latter aspect that raises the question: “Whose land is it?” It is imminent for the citizens, vote banks, voices, activists and NGOs to set the answer. Else, the reclaimed land may get lost to ad hoc planning and private profiteering. While accepting the coastal road as a soon-to-be situation, the new land bank created alongside needs closer scrutiny. These lands are awaiting a future. Let that future be for and of the people and adjoining neighbourhoods in the making too. What seems planned as urban space can decidedly be public place, for the city is running short of these, and dwindling further through privatisation and territorial control. An objective approach to this is thereby necessary. Most of the reclamation at present is observed along the western coast in the island city. The first aspect is about accessibility. The new lands shall need safe, walkable proximity to public transport modes of bus, suburban railway and metro. The second highlight is for scenic vistas. Existing public access points which framed sites like Haji Ali skyline and the Arabian Sea horizon must be addressed. With reclamation shifting the coastal edge further into the sea, these present positions of viewing seem lost forever. Thus it is imperative to identify new sites at the edge of the new coastline through consciously designed ‘view cones’. In tune with the city’s heritage regulation, protected view cones can bring in a scenic rights policy that enhances the image of the city in the physical setting. The third, but local, fallout is of air and visual openness to existing development along the waterfront that may be adversely affected. Existing enclaves along the reclaimed areas must be identified with inclusive roles. The reckoner rates must be reasonably corrected for the value change when these properties are denied their open frontage. Finally, and the most vital point to be raised by the citizens as a collective democracy, is for control rights in the new reclamation. The reclaimed land created must not be lost from public scrutiny in the perpetual future. This is in addition to the formality of calling suggestions and objections under the MR&TP Act. Essentially, the future of reclaimed lands must get pledged through community land trusts, the constitution of which shall include members from the citizens, neighbourhood representation and people groups to prevent misappropriation and usurping or encroachment for private gain.

They alleged that a temple was demolished and an idol was removed during the Saturday drive and demanded action against the officials. The drive was carried out by the administration after the officials of the Bairagi akhadas were found constructing buildings in the camp area which was allotted to them temporarily for the Kumbh Mela. Sri Mahant Rajendra Das of Nirmohi Akhada said that the district administration has 'no right to demolish temples' and that 'it is an act against Hinduism'. “Some locals, in cahoots with politicians and bureaucrats, have erected illegal structures on government land in Haridwar but no action is taken against such people. The state government should remove all illegal structures constructed in the Bairagi Camp after 1986 Haridwar Kumbh Mela and allot the land to the three akhadas.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/seers-of-bairagi-akhadas-stage-protest-against-anti-encroachment-drive-by-district-administration/articleshow/82689103.cms||MS Nawaz

The suspect, Manisha Rote, is the fifth person to be arrested in this case. Police also suspect involvement of private medical practitioners in the racket. According to police, the relatives of Covid patients were asked to get the vials from government supply department or open market. The injections were kept unused and sold outside the hospital. Sitaram Dubal, police inspector of Rajarampuri police station, said, “We have information regarding medical practitioners being involved in the whole network of black marketing. We have information about one such doctor, who is currently undergoing Covid treatment. Once he recovers, we will arrest him.”  It has been found that the injections were sold for over Rs 28,000 per vial to the relatives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/nurse-held-for-illegal-sale-of-remdesivir/articleshow/82687025.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Government instructs hospitals to review fire safety measures during pandemic||KOLKATA: The West Bengal health and family welfare department has instructed all the hospitals and nursing homes in the state to review their fire safety measures, which has become “highly essential” in view of the increasing number of patients admitted in all healthcare facilities across the state. MSVPs, CMOHs and heads of private hospitals have been instructed to review the existing facilities and take more measures, if required. The department has also authorised district magistrates and heads of government hospitals to spend upto Rs 25 lakh to overhaul electrical fittings without any prior permission, said a health department official. “Currently, not a single hospital in the state is empty. Most of the hospitals and nursing homes have 100% occupancy due to the pandemic. We have instructed all the hospitals and nursing homes to take precautions to keep fire incidents at bay. We have recommended an urgent review of the fire safety preparedness at all hospitals and nursing homes,” said an official of the health department. In the past few years, there have been several fire incidents in hospitals and nursing homes across the city while some of these incidents saw the loss of lives. Though the electrical fittings at hospitals have received an overhaul after these fire incidents in the past, the government does not want to take any chance during the pandemic. In case of fire the power connection has to be severed which means cutting off oxygen supply and ventilator support along with other monitoring devices. “By now we know the importance of oxygen to save lives. Cutting off the oxygen supply even for an hour might cause fatalities,” said a senior medical official. The head of a government hospital in the city said that a fire incident in a hospital during the pandemic situation can lead to a disaster. “Almost 100% patients are undergoing treatment for Covid and most of them cannot move on their own. In case of a mishap the hospital staff would have to evacuate everybody but that is a very difficult task. So, taking precautions is better,” said the head of the hospital. Most hospitals and nursing homes do not have alternate spaces to shift the patients in case of an inferno. Most of the hospitals are operating with full capacity, there is no option to transfer the patients. “Covid patients cannot be kept with other patients. Hospitals do not have adequate space to shift so many patients in isolation when any emergency situation like a fire incident occurs,” said the official of a hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/govt-instructs-hosps-to-review-fire-safety-measures-during-pandemic/articleshow/82691063.cms||Zeeshan Javed

Pointing out that Covaxin was successful in retaining neutralising activity against emerging variants, a top official of the company said that no difference in neutralisation was observed between B.1.1.7 (first isolated in the UK) and the vaccine strain (D614G) that was used to develop Covaxin. Citing a study published in peer-reviewed medical journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, Bharat Biotech joint managing director, Suchitra Ella, tweeted: “A modest reduction in neutralisation by a factor of 1.95 was observed against B.1.617 variant compared to the vaccine variant (D614G). Despite this reduction, neutralising titre (concentration of neutralising antibodies) levels with B.1.617 remain above levels expected to be protective.” P2 Neutralising antibodies are part of the body’s immune system and helps defend from viruses and bacteria by neutralising their effects on the body. These antibodies are produced when one gets infected or vaccinated. The study, `Neutralisation of variant under investigation B.1.617 with sera of BBV152 vaccines’, was covered in the May 7 issue of the journal that is published by the Oxford University Press. The study found that the sera drawn from those vaccinated with Covaxin performed better against the B.1.617 variant as compared to the sera taken from patients who had recovered from Covid. “B.1.617 variant performance with vaccine sera was better than recovered cases. The result of B.1.1.7 variant neutralization with BBV152 vaccine sera and findings of B.1.617 emphasize that this vaccine is robust against emerging mutation and maintains the efficacy of the vaccine,” the research paper said. As part of the study, researchers from Bharat Biotech and Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Virology (ICMR-NIV) took the sera of 28 volunteers vaccinated with Covaxin in the Phase II clinical trials and compared its ability to effectively neutralise the B.1.617 variant as compared to the D614G strain and B.1.1.7 variant. This was done by collecting sera samples from 17 patients that had recovered after being infected with lineage B.1.1.1, B.1.351, B.1.1.28.2 and D614G of SARS-CoV-2. These samples were then used to perform PRNT50 (Plaque reduction neutralisation test) against the B.1.617 variants and results were compared with the sera samples of the Covaxin recipients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covaxin-blunts-key-covid-variants-says-bb-icmr-study/articleshow/82694477.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

While each ailment makes the patient more vulnerable, even the required treatments have side effects, pushing them further into the vicious cycle, said doctors. Starting from diabetes and obesity to Covid-19, mucormycosis (black fungus infection), kidney failure and some progress to multi-organ failure too. The best thing to do for patients currently is to keep their diabetes well under check and manage obesity. “While patients having diabetes and other comorbidities are more prone to contracting the virus, if any diabetic patient has uncontrolled blood sugar levels before getting infected, they will see a further rise in blood sugar levels due to the steroids used as part of the treatment. This then makes them prone to mucormycosis and further complications one after the other,” said Dr Ehsan Ahmed Khan, superintendent, Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences and Research (TIMS), adding that controlling the blood sugar levels should be the top priority for any patient at this point of time. Currently, there is a rise seen in fungal infections, mainly mucormycosis and aspergillosis. “While steroids are essential for treatment of patients, these fungal infections are a result of excess usage of cortico-steroids, especially in diabetics and immuno-compromised patients,” added Dr Hari Kishan Gonuguntla, lead interventional pulmonologist, Yashoda Hospitals. After recovering from Covid-19, the next round of antifungal treatments required in the patients contracting fungal infections, meanwhile, trigger problems in the kidney. The treatment takes anywhere between three weeks to five weeks of antifungal injections. “These injections however result in increased burden on the kidneys. Since patients with uncontrolled diabetes have other comorbidities too, many are unable to tolerate the treatment and succumb in the process. Many land up with organ failures,” said Dr Koka Rambabu, senior consultant ENT surgeon, Apollo Hospitals, adding that along with the use of steroids, checking liver function and kidney function is essential every three days in such patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/more-covid-19-patients-with-comorbidities-slipping-into-vicious-cycle-of-diseases-experts/articleshow/82692821.cms||Amrita Didyala

Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (AHNA) also issued an advisory for member hospitals. The advisory stressed on keeping electricians and other technical staff ready for any emergency, keeping fuel tanks of ambulances full and keeping the vehicles in working condition, identifying and covering all the places from where water can seep in, checking stock of medicines and disposables and stocking it for at least three days, checking oxygen supply lines, and fire safety equipment. Dr Jigar Shah, secretary of AHNA, said that the members are also asked to check generators and keeping it in working condition for possible power outage, keeping oxygen stock at maximum level possible, and be ready for any emergency. “Oxygen bank is well-stocked and we have been in touch with all members for any contingency,” he said. Ahmedabad Fire and Emergency Services (AFES) officials said that primary survey of Covid care centres is over, and they have taken down a makeshift structure outside Dhanvantari Covid Hospital. “Audit at majority of the hospitals is done, and the authorities have already been instructed to take down big banners, makeshift shamiana-like structures and check electrical equipment,” said a senior official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/city-hospitals-stock-oxygen-medicines-for-three-days/articleshow/82691082.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand records its first black fungus death, 21 cases in state so far||DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand on Sunday recorded its first death by black fungus, or Mucormycosis, an infection seen in Covid-19 patients who have serious conditions and compromised immunity. The patient was admitted at AIIMS Rishikesh, which has seen 17 cases of black fungus so far. In all, Uttarakhand has recorded 21 black fungus cases, with three at Dehradun’s Max Hospital and one at Almora Medical College. The death occurred on Friday night. “The man, a 36-year-old from Dehradun, was brought in in a serious condition to AIIMS Rishikesh,” said Dr Ravikant, the hospital’s director. The head of ENT department at AIIMS Dr Amit Tyagi said that the hospital now has a separate ward for black fungus patients. Some black fungus patients in Uttarakhand are also from Uttar Pradesh, said Dr Ravikant. Meanwhile, Uttarakhand, which was recording 7,000 daily cases of Covid-19 not long ago, has managed to record a slight decline, with 4,496 new cases registered on Sunday. This is the lowest daily rise in coronavirus cases in the state in the past 21 days. Also, after 46 days, the number of recoveries on Sunday (5,034) exceeded the daily cases. The last time this happened was on March 30, when the state had reported 147 recoveries and 128 cases. Dehradun as has been the trend for some time, saw the highest number of positive cases at 1,248, followed by 572 in Haridwar, 498 in Tehri, 393 in US Nagar and 356 in Rudraprayag. Worryingly though, the daily deaths continue to be high in the Himalayan state. With 188 deaths recorded on Sunday, the fatality toll has touched 4,811 in Uttarakhand. In May alone, 2,122 deaths were recorded. The number of containment zones meanwhile has increased to 479 now in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarakhand-records-its-first-black-fungus-death-21-cases-in-state-so-far/articleshow/82689167.cms||Shivani Azad

Though the price is capped at Rs 900, these are the new ways to charge even from those who are elderly or cancer patients in the city. Besides the Covid test, the other investigations associated with the infection also cost around Rs 8,000, excluding the CT scan. “I am a cancer patient and restricted within the house. I had symptoms and my son wished to get my home collection for Covid test. It was Rs 1,500 when the adjoining states of Haryana and Punjab have lower rates fixed for the tests,” said Anupam Vashist, a resident of the city. Even the cost for the CT scan varies between Rs 3,000 to Rs 4,000. “There are some charitable trusts which are offering this test for Rs 1,500. But there is lot of rush there. If the rates are capped, it will help Covid patients to at least not be burdened financially as well,” said Vipin Aggarwal, another local resident. The UT administration has fixed rates for ICU and non ICU beds in private hospitals. However, there have been cases where the hospitals have been overcharging. “We have a team of doctors who randomly check these facilities. Also, on the basis of any complaint, we take action as we have fixed rates of RTPCR and hospital admission,” said Dr Amandeep Kang, director health services, UT. All the blood tests, including D dimer, interleukin 6 and CBC also cost Rs 8000 to a patient. “There is both a mental, physical and financial suffering due to the pandemic. The financial part can be regulated by the authorities,” said Anupam. FLEECING METHOD For home collection, vendors do charge for the cost of transport as the amount fixed for laboratory test for RTPCR is Rs 900. “But charging Rs 600 for the travel within the city is almost fleecing people. Moreover, we are given a bill of Rs 900 but the amount taken is more,” said Anupam Vashist, a resident of the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/test-rates-climb-as-regulation-drops/articleshow/82689157.cms||Shimona Kanwar

He had been to a private hospital for the first dose. Having never ever been there, he had assumed the KMC clinic to be run-down, dark, dank and dirty. And he had assumed the staff would be wayward and rude. “I was impressed to see the discipline and dedication of KMC health officials and workers posted at the clinic. I got my jab and was back home in an hour. There were no air conditioned waiting rooms, which is good. The vaccination room was neat and clean and everything — from standing in the queue to getting the jab — was hassle-free,” the retired bank officer said. Like Lahiri, many Kolkatans have been forced to step into KMC clinics for the first time in their life to take the second vaccine shot. Gobindo Dasgupta, a senior citizen and a chemist, had joined the queue at the KMC clinic in Netaji Nagar with myriad apprehensions. “They took care of the senior citizens and we were not made to wait for long. I have since recommended KMC clinics to others,” Dasgupta said. <p>KMC officials are making a constant effort to ensure hassle-free vaccination for all, especially senior citizens<br></p>Anuja Mukherjee’s inhibitions about KMC centres, too, have gone since she got inoculated at the clinic on Ballygunge Circular Road last weekend. “The ambience and the efficacy of the system as offered by the KMC health officials was beyond expectation. I was initially very skeptical, fearing a long queue. In reality, we found it otherwise. Older folks including my mother were given chairs to sit under the shade of a mango tree out in the open. Social distancing protocols were maintained. The whole process took less than 40 minutes,” said Mukherjee, a resident of Dover Terrace.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/citizens-impressed-after-first-visit-to-kmc-clinics-for-second-vax-shot/articleshow/82691058.cms||Saikat Ray

---||Kolkata||Cine body to request CM for shooting breather to keep industry running||Kolkata: Since 50 people are allowed to attend weddings during the ongoing period of enhanced restrictions in Bengal, the Eastern India Motion Pictures Association (EIMPA) wants the chief minister to make similar concessions for shooting too. According to EIMPA president Piya Sengupta, a letter will soon be sent to the Chief Minister requesting her to kindly consider the financial distress of people in the film and television industry and offer some relief. Most production houses have episode bank that will last at least a little more than a week. There are talks of suspending weekend telecast of serials and/or shortening to duration of episodes so that the content that has been shot can last till May 31. But problem will arise for serials like ‘Mohor’, ‘Desher Mati’, ‘Khorkuto’, ‘Sreemoyee’, ‘Sanjher Bati’, ‘Ogo Nirupoma’, ‘Dhrubotara’ and ‘Rimli’, ‘Krishnakoli’, ‘Titli’, ‘Binapani’ and ‘Aparajita Apu’ if the enhanced restrictions are extended further. “Weddings are being allowed with 50 people. We can shoot a film or a serial with just 35 people on the floor. We want to humbly request the chief minister to allow us to do that,” Sengupta said. Incidentally, Covid tests of technicians have already started in studio floors. Till date, 756 technicians have undergone testing. Among them, only 34 have tested positive. “That’s just 4.4%. Most of the infected are dressers, hair dressers, makeup man and assistant makeup man who are largely asymptomatic,” said president of Federation of Cine Technicians & Workers of Eastern India (FCTWEI), Swarup Biswas. If the Covid situation improves, he intends to request the chief minister to allow serial shooting after a week. “We will follow all the guidelines and health protocols that are given to us,” Biswas added. Doctor-turned-actor Kinjal Nanda, who played the lead in critically-acclaimed ‘Hiralal’, insists that the next two weeks are extremely crucial. “Being a doctor in the onco critical care unit, I have first-hand experience of how grave the situation is. I want people to just stay at home now. The actor in me wants to go to the floor as soon as possible. That’s possible if we introduce mandatory rapid tests for everyone on the sets before work starts and maintain a few protocols,” Nanda said. Cinematographer-turned-director Premendu Bikas Chaki cancelled the shooting of his new film since he understood the gravity of the situation. “My shooting was supposed to begin on May 10 but I cancelled it on April 15. Maintaining social distancing is a myth on the sets. Even if it is maintained, reality shows and serials are shot on AC floors where people are confined in closed environment for long duration. That is a health hazard too. If other daily wage-earners can survive the next 15 days, our industry too should be equally supportive and not urge for any reviews till the situation improves,” Chaki said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cine-body-to-request-cm-for-shooting-breather-to-keep-industry-running/articleshow/82691077.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: With funds, food, Oxygen & manpower, education institution alumni bodies help Covid-hit||KOLKATA: Several alumni bodies of city schools and colleges have come forward to help out Covid-affected people in different ways like raising funds, sending food and oxygen cylinders, finding beds for patients and arranging RT-PCR tests for many people. St Xavier’s school and college alumni, NUJS alumni, Hindu School alumni, St James School alumni and South Point School alumni are working continuously to help people with such relief in the present trying times. The fund raising by the alumni of NUJS went online on May 1 and within a week, Rs 50 lakh poured in from former students of the university. Apart from helping to set up additional Covid beds across many charitable hospitals, the money was also utilised in the Sunderbans to buy medicines for Covid patients. “This is just a start, our alumni spread across the country are joining in and we hope to make this a continuous effort,” said Nishant Beniwal, president of the association. Another Rs 35 lakh was raised through crowdfunding by Kolkata Katalysts, a group of former St Xavier’s College boys. This money has helped to add beds at the Bharat Sevashram Sangha hospital in Joka and the Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratisthan. St Xavier’s Collegiate School’s alumni partnered with a popular diagnostic centre on Theatre Road and set up an RT-PCR test centre on the St Xavier’s Primary School premises. Another such helpline has been started by the Hindu School alumni, mostly doctors in hospitals. The alumni has put together all the authentic phone numbers where people can reach out for help since the social media is full of numbers and forwarded messages that are false. The St James School alumni members, led by restaurateur Pratap Daryanani, is sending free food to needy Covid patients. They have also got all their old teachers and many inmates of old age homes like Mulvany Homes, vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/with-funds-food-o2-manpower-edu-inst-alumni-bodies-help-cov-hit/articleshow/82691083.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

---||Mumbai||Will agitate for 33% promotion quota: Mantri||MUMBAI: After receiving criticism from Maratha groups for not being able to retain reservation for the community, the Maha Vikas Adhadi (MVA) government may face attacks from the backward classes on the issue of reservation in promotion. The Scheduled Caste wing of the Congress, led by a minister in the Uddhav Thackeray government, has threatened to initiate statewide protests against its own government to demand that 33% of the seats be kept vacant for those eligible for promotion from the backward classes in government jobs. Nitin Raut, minister for energy, termed the state government's decision as ‘violation of constitution’ and threatened to protest against its own government. The general administration department led by Thackeray issued an order in April last year to keep 33% posts vacant for promotions from the Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribes, Vimukta Jati and Nomadic Tribe (VJNT) and Special Backward Classes (SBC), subject to the Supreme Court final verdict. The order said 67% of the posts would be filled on the basis of seniority. On May 7 this year, the state scrapped the 33% reservation posts, saying that 100% of the posts would be filled on the basis of seniority, without following any reservation criteria. The issue of reservation in promotion is pending in the Supreme Court. The decision to scrap the 33% promotion quota came two days after the Supreme Court struck down the Maratha quota. It is said that it was an attempt made by the state to assuage Maratha anger.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mantri-will-agitate-for-33-promotion-quota/articleshow/82694581.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Focus on patients, power, and oxygen||AHMEDABAD: The AMC has begun a survey of designated Covid hospitals and has identified seven private hospitals where power supply disruptions can occur when Tauktae hits the state. The AMC has assigned deputy municipal commissioners to visit these hospitals and check their power supply alternatives. The civic body has instructed the DyMCs arrange for generator sets. These sets should have the capacity to provide uninterrupted backup power for at least four to five hours so that patients are not affected. The AMC has asked the hospitals to explore the possibility of discharging patients who are stable and can recuperate at home. Such patients are likely to be discharged by Monday evening. Officials said that the city had over 32,000 active cases as on Sunday morning. The AMC has also opened a control room at the Sabarmati riverfront office to deal with emergencies swiftly. Also, each zone will have additional generators for emergencies. The city requires 150-200 metric tonnes of medical oxygen and has made provisions to meet the demand for the next couple of days. The AMC has ensured that the control room has a secure power supply and all officials have been told to remain alert from Monday till the cyclone threat subsides. The officials said the AMC has ensured that there is enough food for the next three days to meet the requirements of patients in hospitals. The AMC has estimated that the city has 25,000-30,000 patients, including those in home quarantine. The officials said that all firefighters have been put on alert and have been told to rush to hospitals if any fire calls are received.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/focus-on-patients-power-and-o2/articleshow/82691080.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Rising awareness on vaccine after case surge brings rush to inoculation centres||Prayagraj: Covid-19 vaccination is steadily increasing in Sangam city as the daily number of inoculations crossed the 9,000 mark for the first time on Saturday. Officials of the health department have attributed the increase in the number of vaccine recipients to the rising level of awareness among recipients of all age groups. However, considering the rising number of recipients, the department has decided to undertake a vaccination exercise to cover all age groups at 35 sites from Monday. As many as 4,42,707 Covid vaccine shots were administered to recipients of all age groups, including above 45 years and between 18 and 44 years, in the district till May 16. While 3,39,480 beneficiaries had taken the first dose of vaccine, a total of 1,02,936 recipients had also received the second dose of vaccine.  Officials have now decided to ramp up the vaccination exercise of recipients between 18 and 44, which was earlier underway at 20 sites, to 35 sites now. Over 60 sessions, including 14 in urban and 21 in rural areas, will be held from May 17 to May 24 to cover the maximum number of beneficiaries aged between 18 and 44 years. Besides, beneficiaries above 45 years are also vaccinated at other centres in both rural and urban pockets. Additional chief medical officer and district immunization officer (DIO) Dr Teerath Lal told TOI, “On average, we are covering over 9,000 beneficiaries daily of all age groups including 45 plus and recipients between the age group of 18-44 years. For instance, a total of 9,224 vaccine shots were administered to recipients of all age groups in the past 24 hours which included 5,767 recipients of the first dose and 3,457 of the second dose, he said adding that more and more people are getting themselves registered on the CoWin portal (http://selfregistration.cowin.gov.in) for getting vaccinated. Interestingly, there has been a steep rise in the number of recipients above 45 years of age, registered with the CoWin portal. Be it rural or urban sites, all vaccination sites are witnessing a heavy rush of recipients. As about 60 per cent of the district population falls in the age category between 18 and 44 years and the majority of them living in rural areas, the health department has taken up vaccination exercise at all its 21 community health centres. In trans-Ganga and Yamuna pockets, 21 sites of vaccination have been opened to cover the maximum number of recipients in the 18-44 year age group. A database of people getting the shot in the target age groups is also being maintained. However, getting registered on the CoWIN web portal and taking an appointment to get a Covid-19 vaccine jab has been mandatory for those aged between 18-44 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/rising-awareness-on-vaccine-after-case-surge-brings-rush-to-inoculation-centres/articleshow/82692893.cms||---
---||Delhi||Noida hosps can’t deny treatment to outsiders, says Yogi||Noida/Ghaziabad: Since Noida is an NCR city, no hospital can deny treatment to patients from other districts, chief minister Yogi Adityanath told officials on Sunday. He also clarified that healthcare facilities should not ask for any residential proof like Aadhaar card while admitting patients. When cases had been rising by leaps and bounds in April, hospitals in Noida admitted only those patients who had local addresses on their Aadhaar cards. This is something other NCR cities like Gurgaon also followed. Not just admissions, even the Covid control room addressed complaints of patients only if they had a local Aadhaar card. The UP government has, however, done away with a rule that made a state Aadhaar card mandatory for vaccinations in the 18-44 category. The chief minister, who visited Noida, Ghaziabad and Meerut to assess the Covid situation in the three districts, also announced that three and nine oxygen plants would be set up in Noida and Ghaziabad, respectively. Across the state, his government would set up 300 such plants, the CM said. Adityanath also announced that each district in the state would have a Covid care centre or hospital for women and children. The hospitals, he said, would be equipped with ICU facilities. The chief minister said the state government had been conducting 2.5-3 lakh tests every day. “On March 2 last year, we did not have much capacity for Covid tests. Neither did we have many isolation beds for treatment of Covid patients. With support from the Centre and help from various organisations, we are conducting 2.5 lakh to 3 lakh tests every day,” Adityanath said in Noida.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/noida-hosps-cant-deny-treatment-to-outsiders-says-yogi/articleshow/82692942.cms||Snehil Sinha
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Race against time to procure more black fungus drug||AHMEDABAD: With more than 650 cases of a serious fungal infection, known as mucormycosis or colloquially called ‘black fungus’ cases recorded among Covid patients in Gujarat, families are scrambling for an essential injection Liposomal Amphotericin. The state health department says that it just has 10% of the stock against the demand. Each patient requires anywhere between 50, 70 to 120 injections to treat this fungus. Gujarat has been allocated a quota of 16K injections till month end by the Union government, but health department officials says that with the rapid increase in cases the demand will be much more and there is an effort to procure more. “Only 5K Liposomal Amphotericin injections were available in the state, which were procured early in the year,” admits a senior state health official. Sources claim that it will take four weeks before a handful of companies which import or produce the drug are able to meet surge in demand. This is because a series of tests are to be performed on each batch of medicines manufactured, claimed the government official. Sources said that Gujarat FDCA’s Vadodara lab has extended its rapid sterility testing facility to cut the time to two weeks from four, which will be a major respite for three companies. Gomtipur corporator Iqbal Sheikh, who has been trying to procure the crucial injection for one of the Gomtipur residents, said, “I was told that the state is left with only 10% of injections against the demand. Each patient requires 110 to 120 injections.” Liposomal Amphotericin had got approval in 2010 but in 2016 there were issues related to toxicity and not many companies were ready to manufacture it in India, said Gujarat health authorities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/race-against-time-to-procure-more-black-fungus-drug/articleshow/82691084.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Life-saving drug going at Rs 70k a vial in Hyderabad||HYDERABAD: Covid-19 patients diagnosed with black fungus (mucormycosis) are struggling to find a life-saving drug that has vanished from the market and is being illegally sold at a very high price. Vials of liposomal amphotericin is being sold at Rs 70,000 per injection, right under the nose of law-enforcing agencies, patients who bought the medicine secretly confessed. TimesViewIn view of rising cases of life-saving drugs sold at prices several times higher than MRP, officials should proactively crack down on black marketeers. This is a national emergency and all enforcement agencies should unite to help the common man.It comes at a time when the government-designated ENT hospital announced on Sunday that they have come across 100 cases of black fungus in a month. Top five corporate hospitals in Hyderabad are each reporting 70-80 black fungus cases a month. The injection is the primary drug required to treat black fungus that damages nose, sinuses, eyes and sometimes brain, and the shortage is leading panic among patients and caregivers. A patient needs at least 15-20 of these injections for the treatment spanning 2-3 weeks and although hospitals are prescribing this by hundreds, patients are left to themselves to scout for the injection. “Within five days of discharge from a hospital, my brother developed symptoms and we went to another corporate hospital. We were prescribed six vials of the injection (300mg) and asked to come back for treatment with the injection,” said Suresh N, a relative of the patient. Suresh began looking for it, but soon realised there was no one who had stocks. “Later, we were offered 1 vial for Rs 1 lakh. After checking all medical shops, suppliers and dealers, I could find a vial for Rs 70,000 but am still looking for someone offering at lesser cost. It is not available anywhere at the MRP of Rs 4,000,” he said. The nature of the fungus is such that it spreads very fast and any delay in treatment can have serious impact on the patient’s health, said Dr Manish Gupta, resident medical officer, Government ENT hospital Koti. “This is an invasive fungal infection and a prolonged 3-5 weeks treatment is required, which means every patient will require at least 10-5 vials,” he said. Arun Daniel Yellamaty, founder Youngistan Foundation, said they are getting many calls from patients’ families and friends asking for remdesivir and liposomal amphotericin injection. “After getting one or two at the hospital, they are asked to buy from outside. So most of them are in panic and have no guidance on where to buy these. They end up calling everyone for help,” he said. Rachakonda police commissioner Mahesh Bhagwat said so far no complaints have been received regarding the antifungal injection, but they will act the moment they get one.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/life-saving-drug-going-at-rs-70k-a-vial/articleshow/82694582.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||India||Tauktae now ‘very severe’ cyclone, set to rip into Gujarat at 185kmph||AHMEDABAD/NEW DELHI: Covid-bruised Gujarat braced for a battering by the strongest cyclone to hit its coast since 1998 as Tauktae, which cut a swathe through the western coastal belt on Sunday and intensified into a “very severe” cyclonic storm, raced towards its predicted landfall between the Union Territory of Diu and Mahuva in Bhavnagar early Tuesday. Tauktae — Myanmarese for “gecko” — is estimated to arrive with wind speeds of 155-165 kmph, gusting up to 185kmph, the IMD said. It is tipped to reach the Gujarat coast on Monday evening and cross the areas between Porbandar and Mahuva by dawn the next day. The major impact of the projected landfall will be felt in Porbandar, Amreli, Junagarh, Gir Somnath, Botad and Bhavnagar districts. “Damage is also expected in Devbhoomi Dwarka, Kutch, Jamnagar, Rajkot and Morbi, Valsad, Surat, Vadodara, Bharuch, Navsari, Anand and Ahmedabad districts,” IMD director general M Mohapatra said. “The cyclonic system is being monitored by Doppler weather radar at Goa. The IMD will keep updating the movement of the cyclone.” The state administration, in coordination with central agencies, aims to evacuate close to 1.5 lakh people living in the coastal villages of Saurashtra and Kutch by Monday evening. CM Vijay Rupani said, “With the aim of zero human casualty, 44 NDRF teams, assisted by SDRF and fire brigade personnel, have been deployed along coastal areas for rescue and relief work.” Additional chief secretary Pankaj Kumar said on Sunday that 25,000 people had already been moved to safer places. The IMD warned of a storm surge of about 3m above astronomical tide over Amreli, Gir Somnath, Diu, Bhavnagar, 2-3m over Bharuch, Anand and the southern parts of Ahmedabad, and 1-2 m over Surat, Navsari and Valsad, and .5-1m in the remaining coastal districts. The storm surge during landfall is likely to inundate most of the low-lying areas in these districts along the coast. “The state has been advised to completely suspend fishing operations. People have been asked to remain indoors (during the landfall),” IMD chief Mohapatra said. Gujarat's strongest tropical cyclone so far was in 1998, killing thousands and flattening Kandla in Kutch. Since then, the state has twice had a narrow escape — in 2019, when Cyclone Vayu skirted off the state’s coast and again last year, when Cyclone Nisarga hit Mumbai but didn't affect the state much beyond bringing heavy rain in the southern parts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/tauktae-now-very-severe-cyclone-set-to-rip-into-gujarat-at-185kmph/articleshow/82696076.cms||---

A ward councillor who doesn’t wish to be named said, “We have a fixed staff to carry out all the work. Since sanitisation is also important we send two to three staff members for door-to-door garbage collection while others are deployed for sanitisation. The situation will become normal once there is a drop in the number of cases." Satyendra Gunjyal, a resident of Mohkampur, said, “While sanitisation is important, collection of garbage should also be the focus as people in households are falling ill. It is necessary to remove any medical waste on a daily basis.” However, the officials from DMC said, “The door-to-door garbage collection is taking place as usual. We are trying our best to carry out all the functions.” The teams from DMC will be carrying out a sanitisation drive in 35 wards of the city on Monday while another 34 wards will be sanitised on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/residents-unhappy-with-garbage-collection-dmc-says-trying-our-best/articleshow/82689296.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Diet an important tool in fight against Covid-19, say dieticians||Prayagraj: At a time when doctors and experts are counting on vaccination and wearing a mask as the only way out to minimise the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, it is also important to achieve and sustain good nutritional status to fight the virus and keep oneself safe as the devastating second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic continues to ravage lives in the country. TOI spoke to several eminent dietitians of the Sangam city and sought their opinion as to what they suggest is the best diet during the Covid-19 second wave-induced lockdown, as people are struggling to get ample exercise and have to avoid going outdoors. “Several factors such as age, sex, health status, lifestyle, and medications affect the nutritional status of an individual. The nutritional status of persons has been used as pliability towards deterioration during this Covid-19 pandemic. Optimal nourishment and dietary nutrient intake impact the immune system, therefore the only sustainable way to survive in the current context is to strengthen the immune system”, said eminent dietitian, Priya Srivastava of Diet and Health Zone. If your diet is good and nutritious, it is sure to make your immunity strong and can ensure that your body is in a proper state to beat the virus, she added. Agreeing to her suggestions, another dietitian engaged with a private hospital of Allahapur, Shushma Tiwari said, “Eat whole grains (oats, wheat, millet, ragi, brown rice) and avoid refined flour and its preparations. Eat fresh fruits and vegetables available in the markets. Also consume nuts like almonds, coconut, and pistachio along with foods from animal sources (eg fish, eggs, and milk with turmeric and black pepper).” However, one has to avoid irregular snacking. “Include fresh fruits and raw vegetables for mid meals. Avoid high fat and fried foods, do not overcook any foods as it leads to the loss of important nutrients such as vitamins and minerals and limit the salt intake to 4-5 gm a day,” said Tiwari. Another dietitian Richa Srivastava, Guest Faculty, Centre of Food Technology, Allahabad University said, “We must control our stress level at this critical time, as we know that stress stimulates cortisol secretion that leads to insulin resistance which is a prominent feature of diabetes and can further lead our body to an emergency as our body perceives stress as a stimulus of danger and start preparing itself to save from its ill effects and creates a hormonal imbalance in the whole body.” In addition to this, drink at least three litres of water every day. It helps to transport nutrients in the blood, and excrete waste, and regulates body temperature. “It can be in form of dal water, panna, sattu water, barley water, homemade soups, lemon water etc. Avoid all carbonated, concentrated juices, and all drinks which contain sugar,” she said. Maintain a healthy lifestyle of exercise, meditation, and regular sleep. Sufficient sleep will help to maintain immune performance, she added. “Alongside with the dietary management guidelines the food safety management and good food practices are compulsory. Good food practices are always recommended to minimize the risk of contamination,” suggests Srivastava. She adds that washing, rinsing, and disinfecting objects and surfaces every time before and after use helps to keep the virus away. “Keep cooked and raw foods separate, as it would prevent the harmful microbes from raw foods from spreading to cooked foods and use different chopping boards and utensils for cooked and raw foods to prevent cross-contamination. Likewise, food service workers should use gloves while preparing a meal and try not to display or sell unwrapped food from the self-service counter,” suggested the expert dietitian.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/diet-an-important-tool-in-fight-against-covid-19-say-dieticians/articleshow/82692954.cms||---

Forest minister K Ramachandran inspected the camps in Gudalur.While Pandalur received the highest rainfall of 180mm, Upper Bhavani and Cherangode registered 106mm each in 24 hours ending 7am. Gudalur and Naduvattam recorded 68mm and 91mm rain respectively. Ooty registered 20.8mm rain and Coonoor, 17.5mm.While 143 people were shifted to three relief camps at Aththipalli, Puththurvayal and Thorapalli in Gudalur taluk, two camps in Pandalur taluk accommodated 47 people.“The district administration is monitoring the rain situation. All precautionary measures have been put in place,” the minister said. “Food and warm clothes have been provided to the people in the relief camps.”Vaccination and medical camps were arranged at the five relief camps on Sunday. “Initiatives will be taken with the help of the state health ministry to obtain vaccine for the Nilgiris,” said the minister. He appealed to local residents in the two taluks to shift to the nearby relief camps if the areas become vulnerable due to the rain.Earlier, the minister held a review meeting on containment of Covid-19 with officials of Gudalur block.

---||Coimbatore||Covid test positivity rate rises, recovery rate drops in district||Coimbatore: The district has been presenting a worrying trend in Covid battle as test positivity rate keeps rising while recovery rate is dropping, leading to a surge in number of active cases.Coimbatore continues to report more than 3,000 daily fresh cases. The number of active cases has jumped past the 22,000-mark.On Sunday, there was yet another urge in caseload as 3,166 more people were declared Covid positive. A look at the statewide Covid data shows that the spike was steepest in Coimbatore over the past few weeks, while other cities like Chennai were showing signs of stabilising. Chennai has been reporting a little more than 6,000 cases for the last few days.But Coimbatore, which was reporting one-fourth of Chennai’s daily fresh case count in April last week, witnessed a spike in the first week of May when it started reporting one-third of Chennai’s cases. On April 26, Chennai reported 4,250 cases and Coimbatore had 1,056. On May 6, cases in Chennai grew to 6,600 odd cases while Coimbatore doubled its cases to 2,068. Ten days later, Chennai reported lesser number of cases – 6,247. But cases in Coimbatore continued to rise and reported half the number of Chennai’s cases despite the fact that Chennai has a higher and denser population.On an average, 10,000 people are being tested in Coimbatore and the test positivity rate has been hovering between 25% and 27%, which is considered high. The recovery rate, meanwhile, is falling. On Sunday, 1.151 people were discharged from hospitals and the total active cases stood at 22,181. The number of casualties was 15, according to the state government bulletin.Adding to the rising numbers are the severe shortage of medical oxygen supplies, which has scaled up the woes of Covid patients. Though government authorities say there are O2 and ventilator beds available in government and private sector, families of Covid patients have to run from pillar to post for a bed.Out of the 1,124 O2 beds available in government hospitals in the district, only 95 are available. In private hospitals, only 148 out of the 2,695 O2 beds are available.Neighbouring Tirupur is not far behind as 919 more people were detected with the virus on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/covid-test-positivity-rate-rises-recovery-rate-drops-in-district/articleshow/82692964.cms||---

The consignment comprises 60,000 doses of the second component — adenoviral vector Ad5 — of the two-dose Russian vaccine. Samples from the consignment will be sent for testing and release to the Central Drugs Laboratory (CDL) at Kasauli before being deployed in the immunisation programme, the company said in a tweet. The first consignment of the vaccine that landed on May 1, the day India opened up vaccination for all above 18 years of age, comprised 1.5 lakh doses of the first component of the vaccine – adenoviral vector Ad26. These two vectors have to be administered through intramuscular injections at a gap of 21 days. Sputnik V has shown an overall efficacy of 91.6% in a global phase III study. Sputnik V has already been soft launched in India on May 14 as part of a pilot rollout with a top official of Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, Deepak Sapra, receiving the first jab in India. Sapra is the CEO of the API & services business of Dr Reddy’s Labs, which tied up with Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) in September 2020 for conducting clinical trials and distributing 125 million people equivalent doses of the vaccine in India. Dr Reddy’s Labs, which has set a target of vaccinating 125 million people in India over the next 8-12 months, expects to vaccinate about 18 million people through 36 million doses imported from Russia and the rest through doses made in India. Six Indian manufacturers have been roped in for manufacturing Sputnik V in India. These include Gland Pharma (252 million doses), Hetero Biopharma (100 million), Virchow Biotech (200 million), Panacea Biotech (100 million), Stelis Biopharma (200 million) and Shilpa Medicare (over 100 million) -- to manufacture over 952 million doses or more than 476 million people equivalent doses of Sputnik V. The first shipments of the vaccines are being used by Dr Reddy’s to test out the cold chain, both in rural as well as urban settings. The company is targeting an initial pilot rollout in a few states, including Telangana, and plans to roll out the vaccine in 35 cities across the country first.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/second-consignment-of-60k-sputnik-v-doses-lands-in-hyd/articleshow/82692975.cms||Swati Bharadwaj
---||Coimbatore||Tamil Nadu: Virtual volunteers reach out to Covid patients||COIMBATORE: A group of good Samaritans have come together to help pandemic-hit people find beds in hospitals, oxygen cylinders, and offer medical consultation. In the last 10 days, they received 1,500 requests for assistance and helped half of them. As many as 500 volunteers in the team, most of them working professionals and some in foreign countries, have formed two groups Chennai Volunteers Forum (CVF) and Chennai Rescue Relief (CRR). While the first group takes care of low to medium Covid cases and requests for ICU beds, the latter handles emergency cases. They receive more requests from Chennai, followed by Coimbatore and other districts, and even from Karnataka. They decided to form the team two weeks ago when the number of cases started to climb. Initially, Prasanth Gopalakrishnan, Thendral Manoharan, Deepa Rajagopala, Priya Kannaiah and Sandeep Vijayakumar pitched in to form the team, which grew from strength to strength. Most of the volunteers are IT professionals, doctors, teachers and businessmen. “Initially, we created a Google Docs document with 15 questions like oxygen level, CT scan score, symptoms, whether the patient is on oxygen support, type of bed required and hospital preference. Once the form is submitted, a unique ID for the patient will be generated. The data will be updated in the back-end and would be converted to WhatsApp format automatically. Then it will be posted manually in the volunteer group and volunteers will ring up the person to verify details,” Prasanth told TOI. “We have set up separate WhatsApp groups for various types of requirements like beds, oxygen support and medical consultation to avoid confusion.” The team offers counselling service and emotional support to people, who go into panic mode when they detect Covid symptoms or test positive, said Thendral. “Our volunteers help such people interact with doctors via video conference. We have been receiving several requests for counselling and for finding hospital beds.” On an average, the team receives 200 requests a day, said Prasanth. “While we manage to resolve half of the cases, we forwarding the rest to the government war room in Chennai. Of late, it has become difficult to find beds in hospitals,” he said. “While team members in India work during the day, those in foreign countries extend their support during the night. About 80% of the volunteers are working professional and most of them work for 16 hours a day.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/virtual-volunteers-reach-out-to-covid-patients/articleshow/82692981.cms||Nivedha Selvam

The chief minister was addressing the virtual Covid review meeting. He said that one lakh vaccine doses received initially for the 18-44 group had almost been completely utilised. In the 18-44 age group, the Punjab government was inoculating families of healthcare workers, co-morbid persons and construction labourers. In the next stage, other categories, especially teachers, should be vaccinated to enable reopening of the schools at the earliest, said Capt Amarinder. tnn Taking note of the continued shortage of Tocilizumab, the chief minister said he had spoken to the Union health minister and hoped for supply of some quantity by Monday. He also asked state health secretary Hussan Lal to follow up on the issue with the central government. He stressed on the need to ensure that all other medicines, as well as Covid Fateh kits, were easily available for Covid patients in the state. The health secretary said that there was no shortage of Fateh Kits as the department currently has a stock of 24,000, with another 15,000 to be ready by Monday. He said some of the districts were “probably delaying picking up these kits”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjabs-top-bureaucrat-asked-to-check-sputnik-procurement/articleshow/82692988.cms||---

Dr Sunkavalli Chinna Babu, CEO and director of GRACE Cancer Foundation, who took the initiative, said the doctors are offering round-the-clock service to the patients. A team of trained nurses and junior doctors are also working at the facility. “Currently, there are enough rooms to treat patients. There is scope to expand it to 200 beds,” Dr Chinna Babu said. Having seen patients running around hospitals for oxygen and immediate care, the doctors decided to do their bit to alleviate the problems of those infected with the novel coronavirus. “We converted a paying guest facility in Madhapur into a makeshift hospital within a month. Setting up a big hospital with all the paraphernalia is not possible at this juncture,” said Dr Chinna Babu, who is a robotic surgical oncologist in Apollo Hospitals. The facility is also equipped with an ambulance and a mobile ICU to handle any emergencies. It also has a hotline. “The hotline is manned by over 80 doctors who provide free tele-consultation to patients. Over 6,000 calls have been received in the past 10 days,” one of the organisers said. They said this kind of a treatment centre is currently run only by the Army. GRACE foundation, which hosted the world’s largest cancer awareness initiative ‘Grace Cancer Run’ in October last year, was acknowledged by Guinness World Records. Dr Chinna Babu said they conceived the dream of creating cancer awareness seven years ago and achieved big success. “The icing on the cake was the Guinness World Record,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/15-city-docs-bridge-treatment-gap-turn-pg-facility-into-free-covid-19-care-centre/articleshow/82694632.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Shubham Shirhatti and his team of youths are providing free food tiffins to the Covid patients admitted in the Covid care centres and their relatives. Every day, they provide over 100 tiffins and Sunday was the 12th day since the beginning of the initiative. Now, the youths have teamed up to provide free accommodation facility to the relatives of the Covid patients. “We have opened the doors of our offices and flats to the relatives. Currently, we have rooms ready for patients’ relatives, who come from far to get the patients admitted. Few of them have started staying in the rooms where we provide food, drinking water and sanitation facility,” says Shubham. During the ongoing lockdown, nobody is allowed to step outside their house except for emergency purposes. However, the police administration has allowed the team to continue their task to provide a free meal. Meanwhile, to address the issue of many ambulances overcharging, Aam Aadmi Party has started an ‘Autorickshaw Ambulance’. At present, one such autorickshaw is operational. An oxygen refill tank is fitted in the auto along with a sanitiser spraying pump. Vijay Bhosale, who owns and drives the autorickshaw, is in a PPE kit while providing the service. “Poor people cannot afford the cost of an ambulance. We are providing the service on a ‘no-profit, no-loss basis. The service was started on Saturday and on the first day, I got calls from four patients to pick and drop them at nearby CCC or hospitals. Our initiative will inspire other autorickshaw owners to start similar service,” said Bhosale.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/youths-step-up-to-help-in-these-trying-times/articleshow/82687450.cms||---

In a first, petrol price touched Rs 99 a litre at the pumps in Thane and Navi Mumbai — just a rupee short of Rs 100-mark, while the rate in Mumbai was hiked to Rs 98.88 a litre. Diesel price was also at an all-time new high of Rs 90.40 a litre in Mumbai while in Thane and Navi Mumbai, the rate escalated to Rs 90.52. The rise in fuel prices lead to increase in costs of essential goods in the market.

The highest price in the state was at Parbhani where petrol was retailing for 101.25 per litre. This was followed by Nanded at Rs 101.05, Buldhana at Rs 100.45, Amravati at Rs 100.31, Ratnagiri at Rs 100.24, Gondia at Rs 100.11, Aurangabad at Rs 100.11 and Jalgaon at Rs 100.04 a litre.

Mumbai had seen a series of hikes in the past one year for both petrol and diesel. “During the assembly elections in other states in March and April, the fuel prices remained unchanged and they dropped on a few occasions. This was expected,” said a transporter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/petrol-touches-rs-rs-99-in-navi-mumbai-thane/articleshow/82693051.cms||Somit Sen

Today, people are sitting in front of the computer throughout the night to find vaccine slots,” he said on Sunday, alleging that people are not getting vaccines because crores of doses have been exported. “Today, when the people of India are asking as to why did Modiji send our children’s vaccines abroad, Modiji’s Delhi Police is registering FIRs and sending our workers to jail,” he claimed. Pathak said that two AAP workers from Karawal Nagar were jailed on Sunday and around 500 party workers from Ghonda, Mangolpuri, Rithala, Ambedkar Nagar, Mangodi and Kalkaji called in the morning and interrogated by the police till night. “We asked this question and due to this question, today we are being arrested.” “I’d like to tell Delhi Police, I’d like to tell Bharatiya Janata Party that you cannot arrest somebody for asking such questions because we live in a democracy. But despite this, if you want to arrest, if you think that people will be silenced by imprisonment, we’d like to tell you that these posters were put up by Aam Aadmi Party, these posters were put up by me,” Pathak said. “If you want to arrest, then arrest us, arrest our MLAs. Those poor, miserable people who paste these posters for Rs 100-200, those who drive autos, those who drive rickshaws, you are beating them up, you are calling them to the police station and arresting them,” he added. “We have put up these posters and put them up at every corner of Delhi. We will not stop; we will put up more posters and put them up in the entire country,” Pathak said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-you-cannot-arrest-somebody-in-democracy-for-asking-a-question/articleshow/82693072.cms||---

As a result, only 20% to 30% of the industries are functioning in the district. At present, when the infection rate is so high, we don’t want to risk our and our employees’ lives by running the industries. So, we have requested all our member industries to voluntarily down their shutters till May 23.”Explaining that they would face a significant loss due to the closure, he said that they have no other option but to bear the loss for a bigger cause. “We can compensate one week’s loss by working hard in the next few months. But our workers are our assets and it would be very difficult to fill the gap if anything happens to them. Even though the spread from the industries is meagre at present, we have taken the decision as a precautionary measure,” he added. Explaining that they have been receiving a positive response from their members, he said that the percentage of industries that would function during the next week is expected to go down to 15% to 20%. Meanwhile, many other industries in the district have decided to continue their business following the government guidelines due to multiple reasons. J James, coordinator of Federation of Coimbatore Industrial Association (FOCIA) – a federation of 19 associations - said, “At present, only 20% of the industries are functioning in the district and most of them are manufacturing essential items. Due to the huge shortage of raw materials, we are not sure how long they can continue their business. In this situation, we have decided to run the industries following government guidelines.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/members-of-six-industrial-assns-to-down-shutters/articleshow/82693000.cms||---

The suppliers had subsequently remitted the amount in the form of cash, bank guarantee or fixed deposit receipts to get the orders.As the verification, acceptance and release of the receipts was time consuming, the board had waived off security deposits for all the approved vendors and orders below Rs 25 lakh. For orders above Rs 25 lakh, the security deposit was reduced to 5% of the total value of the order, said the statement.“As most of the orders were scheduled to be delivered in April 2020, the same were postponed because of the lockdown. Now, after completing the orders, many of the bank guarantees and fixed deposit receipts are not returned to the suppliers. Because of the lockdown restrictions, we could not follow up on the release of the security deposit. As a result, our working capital is locked. Since the price of raw materials has surged, it has increased our burden,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/rly-suppliers-seek-immediate-release-of-bank-guarantees/articleshow/82693007.cms||---

By make, the vaccine is similar to Covishield made by Serum Institute of India, he added. “Going by data from the trials, the vaccine is good,” Rakesh Mishra said. So far, 66 countries had approved Sputnik V and 19 trials were on in six countries. The Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) has tied up with Dr Reddy’s Labs of Hyderabad for sending 36 million doses of Sputnik V in the next few months. RDIF has claimed that Sputntik V is the “safest and most effective vaccine against coronavirus and it ranks second among global approvals in all vaccines”. RDIF revealed that the efficacy of Sputnik V was 97.6% as analysed from the data between December 2020 and March 2021. It is based on a platform of human adenoviral vectors. It uses two different vectors for the two shots during vaccination. Due to this, it provides longer duration of immunity. The efficacy and safety of adenoviral vaccines have been proven in more than 250 clinical studies. There are no strong allergies caused by Sputnik V, RDIF said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sputnik-safe-and-effective-ex-ccmb-chief-mishra/articleshow/82693028.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

GMC is now running short on medicines and patients are being told to purchase them from in-house pharmacy at their own cost. The same pharmacy - which is part of a chain - supplies medicines to GMC itself. The state’s premier hospital is also short on oximeters and menometers (used to measure pressure). A doctor attached to GMC said that half of the oximeters are not functioning. Advocate Amit Palekar who is an intervener in a public interest litigation (PIL) filed before the high court of Bombay at Goa said patients are routinely being asked to buy medicines from the open market. “Patients are made to buy medicines from Wellness Forever which is GMC’s supplier. So why can’t it (GMC) procure it for its patients?” said Palekar. The PIL along with linked petitions pertaining to Covid management of patients is slated for a hearing today. GMC provides free medicines to all its in-patients but for the last several days things have been different as its patient load went up, a GMC doctor said. “Patients are asked to buy Teicoplanin injection - administered to a patient twice a day- with each vial costing Rs2,300 but many can’t afford it,” said Palekar. A patient’s relative told TOI that the patient was prescribed several medicines which a doctor treating him told the relative that the hospital was running short of and that he will have to buy them at his own expense. “I bought Targocid 400 injection vials from Wellness Forever which cost me Rs4,600,” he said. The GMC is also short on oximeters and many are broken, a doctor confirmed. This week itself the hospital received over 100 oximeters through donation. Palekar said that he himself, with help from his friends, had provided 30 oximeters to GMC on Saturday. “The hospital administration will not accept that it does not have adequate medicines and oximeters,” he said. A nurse at the hospital said that due to shortages they have been rationing medicines among patients, and yet at times they have had to ask patients to buy medication that the hospital has run out of.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gmc-short-on-oximeters-medicines-as-patients-told-to-buy-their-own-supply/articleshow/82694685.cms||Bindiya Chari

The council has said that it has resolved to support all those 60,000 practising advocates who have suffered from the disease and they were either hospitalized or they were treated during home isolation. The BCG has already processed 1,510 applications which were received from the advocates infected with Covid-19. The council has decided to pay Rs 30,000 aid upfront upon receiving an application in case of hospitalization of a practising advocate. It has also decided to pay Rs 10,000 to each of the lawyers who fell ill and were either treated at home or who do not have receipts to establish the medical expenditure during home isolation. The BCG has also proposed to increase the amount in the cases of 221 advocates, who were hospitalized and had to spend a large amount towards medical expenditure. Last year, after the courts were closed following the lockdown, the BCG had paid Rs 6 crore to some 12,000 young advocates towards financial aid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bcg-pays-rs-2-cr-for-covid-treatment/articleshow/82691199.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Conquerors’ unused medicines give others a shot||AHMEDABAD: Successfully battled Covid and are safe at home again? If you have unused Covid medicines, they could prove a lifesaver for someone else, especially given the shortages. A number of institutions including the women entrepreneurs’ body, YFLO (Young FICCI Ladies’ Organisation), Ahmedabad chapter, and Gujarat Technological University (GTU) have launched independent initiatives to collect unused Covid medicines from recovered patients’ homes. The medicines are distributed to the needy in urban as well as rural areas. When the pandemic is raging and the load of Covid cases has shifted from metro and urban areas to semi-urban and rural belts, a shortage of resources — particularly medicines — has hit the state. To help alleviate the problem, GTU has roped in students from its NSS (National Service Scheme) units to help collect spare Covid medicines and distribute them to the needy. “About 142 units have been formed, attached to different engineering and diploma colleges affiliated to GTU across the state,” said Navin Sheth, the vice-chancellor of GTU. “Across these units, 10,500 students will work as volunteers to collect Covid medicines from door to door in their neighbourhoods and surrounding areas.” These medicines will be deposited at the units and sorted based on expiry dates and the type of formulations, Sheth said. “Based on requirements, these medicines will be sent to various villages and slums,” he said. Students and faculty members from GTU’s pharmacy colleges will supervise the sorting process at each unit so that no expired medicine or spoilt one is delivered. The boxes will be sanitized so that those transporting the medicines do not get infected. Doctors in different villages will volunteer to scan the medicines, according to GTU officials. YFLO, Ahmedabad, has initiated a similar project. Supriya Jindal, the chairperson of the body, said: “Initially we launched a drive to collect medicines from our members and the response was very good.” She went on to say: “We managed to collect five bags of medicines. We sorted and distributed them through an NGO to slums in different parts of Ahmedabad.” After the encouraging response, the initiative was expanded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/conquerors-unused-meds-give-others-a-shot/articleshow/82691225.cms||---

In a first, petrol price touched Rs 99 a litre at the pumps in Thane and Navi Mumbai — just a rupee short of Rs 100-mark, while the rate in Mumbai was hiked to Rs 98.88 a litre. Diesel price was also at an all-time new high of Rs 90.40 a litre in Mumbai while in Thane and Navi Mumbai, the rate escalated to Rs 90.52. The rise in fuel prices lead to increase in costs of essential goods in the market. For the first time ever, eight districts in Maharashtra have petrol prices breaching Rs 100, said an official from an oil marketing company. The highest price in the state was at Parbhani where petrol was retailing for 101.25 per litre. This was followed by Nanded at Rs 101.05, Buldhana at Rs 100.45, Amravati at Rs 100.31, Ratnagiri at Rs 100.24, Gondia at Rs 100.11, Aurangabad at Rs 100.11 and Jalgaon at Rs 100.04 a litre. As for diesel, 11 districts now have crossed the Rs 90 alarming level. This includes the highest rate at Amravati at Rs 91.86 on Sunday followed by Parbhani at Rs 91.30, Aurangabad Rs 91.64, Nanded Rs 91.13, Buldhana Rs 90.53, Thane Rs 90.52, Mumbai Rs 90.40, Ratnagiri Rs 90.35, Gondia Rs 90.23, Jalgaon Rs 90.14 and Jalna Rs 90.09 per litre. Mumbai had seen a series of hikes in the past one year for both petrol and diesel. “During the assembly elections in other states in March and April, the fuel prices remained unchanged and they dropped on a few occasions. This was expected,” said a transporter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/petrol-touches-rs-rs-99-in-navi-mumbai-thane/articleshow/82693064.cms||Somit Sen
---||Pune||Doctors across Pune region now report severe shortages of key anti-mucormycosis tablet||PUNE: Doctors across PMR who’re treating mucormycosis — a potentially deadly fungal infection that has affected scores of Covid-recovered patients — have said that they are now seeing widespread shortages of oral anti-fungal tablets and conventional amphotericin, in addition to the ongoing scarcity of liposomal amphotericin B injection, which has become a key drug of choice. The shortages have been triggered by an unprecedented rise in the number of mucormycosis cases. Pune district currently has 291 patients affected by the fungal infection which has a mortality rate of nearly 50%. “We are feeling helpless; we do not have enough essential drugs. We are surgically clearing damaged tissue in patients, but we need these drugs to arrest the spread,” said ENT surgeon Virendra Ghaisas, president of the Association of Otolaryngologists of India (AOI), Pune chapter. Doctors, until recently, were relying on lipid emulsion or conventional amphotericin B and oral anti-fungal tablets to overcome shortages of liposomal amphotericin B.  “But these basic drugs, including oral tablets such as posaconazole, are also now scarce,” said maxillofacial surgeon JB Garde. Oral tablets like posaconazole reduce the need for amphotericin. “But the posaconazole tablet has been in short supply in Pune for more than 10 days now,” said ENT surgeon Abhijit Mantri. Other anti-fungal drugs do not kill the fungus in mucormycosis. “In addition to posaconazole, there is an isavuconazole capsule which is effective. But it is extremely expensive and again, difficult to get,” Mantri said. Posaconazole works by preventing fungi from producing a substance called ergosterol, which is a component of fungal cell membranes. “Without ergosterol, the membrane is weakened and damaged and essential constituents of the fungal cells can leak out. This kills the fungi and clears up the infection,” said pharmacologist Sanjay Dabhade. A patient with mucormycosis is recommended a 300 mg dose of posaconazole every day, for a minimum of one month to 45 days. “That means a patient needs three tablets (one tablet is 100mg) daily,” said Garde. Shyam Pratapwar, assistant commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (Pune) said, “The sharp spike in cases has triggered the drug shortages. We are trying to sort it out. There are quite a few Indian companies that produce the oral posaconazole tablets.” Many experts have now called for remdesivir-like price controls on drugs that can treat mucormycosis. Sanjay Patil, chairman of the IMA's Hospital Board of India, said, "There was a lot of confusion before the district administration started regulating remdesivir. Officials should ensure there is equitable distribution and families are not left searching for drugs like liposomal amphotericine B." Specialists said dedicated 'mucormycosis cells' at state-run medical colleges attached to hospitals or tertiary care centres can improve diagnosis and response.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/doctors-across-region-now-report-severe-shortages-of-key-anti-mucormycosis-tablet/articleshow/82691188.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Reason: the health authorities have stopped the vaccination on Sundays and public holidays. But this vital piece of information was not conveyed to the public in advance. “We have been operational throughout the week during April, as directed by the government. It was a part of Tika Utsav, which has now concluded,” said district immunisation officer Dr Manjit Singh. He said, “Those who are coming for the second dose need not get themselves registered again. They can walk to any nearest dispensary for the vaccination.” Smriti Kumari, who had come to the Sector 8 dispensary, said, “I was here for my second dose and took appointment between 11am and 12noon. We were nether informed over phone nor was there anyone in the dispensary today.” Sapna Jain, another beneficiary who had come for her second dose, said, “I had been waiting for last 30 minutes, but no one was here. We had to leave our small children at home.” For the 18+ years category, online booking slot was not opened, so no one could take an appointment. “The government wants us to be covered under vaccination but we get a discouraging response here. We are upset and want to know if the doses have exhausted or not,” said Tina Gupta, another beneficiary. A total of 57 vaccination sites have been working throughout the city since last month. Till date, 2,79,079 doses have been given, of which 73,614 have been completely immunised.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/2nd-dose-takers-fume-as-centres-locked/articleshow/82684432.cms||Shimona Kanwar

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Little vibration in Bowbazar during Urvi breakthrough||KOLKATA: If the Rs 8,575.9crore East-West Metro project has already been through the construction of river tunnels through the Hooghly, considered engineering marvels in India, Saturday’s historic “breakthrough” was no less unique. “Breakthroughs” are needed at the end of a tunnelling activity when the giant tunnel boring machine (TBM) is made to punch through a wall that integrates the tunnel with an underground Metro station. In this case, the diaphragm or D-wall was built 22m below Durga Pituri Lane off Bowbazar to integrate the two sections of the same Howrah-bound tunnel. One section covers 1.6km from Esplanade till Durga Pituri Lane while another 800m stretch is from Sealdah station till the same spot. These two sections were bridged on Saturday after the “breakthrough.” A senior official of Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation (KMRC), the implementing agency of the 16km East-West Metro corridor project that will eventually join Sector V with Howrah Maidan, said, “Piercing through the usual RCC diaphragm would have created a lot of vibration that could have affected the surrounding area and the old buildings nearby. The piling wall didn’t vibrate when the TBM broke through it because of the rotary character of the piles.” Both the engineers of KMRC and ITD ITD-Cementation had racked their brains for this special breakthrough. For, it was at Durga Pituri Lane that a building collapsed on August 31 in 2019 and that around 700 residents had to be evacuated as water gushed into a under-construction tunnel. The TBM digging the westward tunnel ran into an aquifer, resulting in water seepage and a subsidence. Both the defunct TBM and the working one will now be lifted out of the retrieval shaft at Durga Pituri Lane.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/little-vibration-in-bowbazar-during-urvi-breakthrough/articleshow/82691177.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

---||Chandigarh||Covid-19: Punjab initiative to tackle rural spread||CHANDIGARH: Warning the people to avoid the kind of situation that was prevailing in the villages of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Sunday announced ‘Pendu Covid Fateh’ programme as part of a ‘Corona Mukt Pendu Abhiyaan’ to tackle the fast spread of deadly virus in villages. Capt Amarinder said the programme needed the involvement of all sections of the community and ordered the health and the rural development departments to spearhead the campaign with large scale mobilisation of the community in the villages. The CM said the entire staff of these two departments should be utilised to spread awareness among the villagers of the dangers of Covid and the health and wellness clinics should become the fulcrum. Community health officers, panchayats, school teachers, anganwadi and Asha workers, village police officers, youth volunteers must be mobilised on a large scale to steer the programme, he added. Directions were also issued that the Guardians of Governance (former defence officials) and the police force should work closely on this. He said it was the need of the hour to ensure that there was adequate sampling and vaccination in rural areas. Amarinder said the biggest worrying issue was the casual attitude of the people towards symptoms like cold and cough, which they did not report timely. The chief minister also said the symptomatic persons should be given basic medicines like paracetamol and cough syrup, and vitamin C, at their doorsteps. At the same time, such persons should be encouraged to get themselves tested and they should be supported in home isolation if tested positive. He directed the health department to provide additional Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) kits exclusively for the purpose of testing in rural areas. The health department was asked to consider opening Covid Care Centers (L1) wherever required, with the support of NGOs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-launches-initiative-to-check-spread-of-covid-in-villages/articleshow/82693047.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||4 pvt hospitals flouting price caps: Report||Chandigarh: Four private hospitals have been found flouting the price caps fixed by the UT administration for Covid treatment, according to an inquiry report submitted to Dr Amandeep Kang, director health services. The health department will take legal opinion on Monday before proceeding in the case. The hospitals have, however, been asked to refund all the excess amount charged and display the rates for the public. A health department’s team had visited Eden hospital, Apollo hospital, Care Partner Heart hospital and Healing hospital, all authorised for Covid treatment. Sources said the bill books were checked, but some of the hospitals did not submit the bills. The team found a hospital was selling Remdesivir, an antiviral drug, for Rs 4,000 bought from the government’s allocation for Rs 1,300. An oxygen cylinder was being sold for Rs 12,000. A day’s rate for hospital beds was fixed as Rs 16,500 with a ventilator, including medicines and investigations, billed for Rs 20,000, excluding the cost of the diagnostics and doctor’s consultation. The rates fixed for moderately ill people for isolation bed with oxygen supportive care is Rs 9,000. For severely ill patients without ventilator, the cost is Rs 14,000 and with ventilator it is Rs 16,500. The non0NABH category’s cost for moderately ill patients is Rs 8000, severely ill patients without ventilator is Rs 13000 and Rs 15,000 with ventilators. “Our teams will again visit Eden hospital and check more documents. We are not aware why they were hoarding more oxygen cylinders than the requirement,” said Dr Kang. For those who have mild illness and not willing for home isolation of government-run Covid care centres, may opt for health facilities in private care centre on the basis of payment. For this category, the cost would vary between Rs 5,500 for NABH accredited hospital and Rs 4500 for non NABH accredited hospital, including basic investigations. Eden hospital had also been found using more oxygen than its requirement. The administration has already marked an inquiry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/4-pvt-hospitals-flouting-price-caps-report/articleshow/82684443.cms||Shimona Kanwar

A patient with mucormycosis needs at least six to eight vials of the injection every day. Currently, there are two pharma companies — Cipla (Gujarat) and Bharat Serum (Maharashtra) — that manufacture the drug. There are some other firms that import the drug. Mucormycosis has been seen mainly in people who've recovered from Covid. Patients need extensive surgical and medical treatments. “We are considering to regularise distribution of liposomal amphotericin B through the district collectorate,” said Shyam Pratapwar, assistant commissioner (drug), Food and Drugs Administration (FDA), Pune. One patient will need at least six vials of the drug every day, which means a daily requirement of nearly 1,800 vials.

The families of the patients taking them in emergency can now directly learn about the bed availability from the ambulance driver. “This will be useful for the patients and their families as they will be in hurry” Dr K Ramesh Reddy, director of medical education ( DME) said. There are about 400 ambulances in the state, mostly in the city. Looking at the case surge during the second wave, the state government has given permission to more than 1,200 hospitals in the state for the treatment this time. With many people looking to take beds in bigger hospitals, there has been increased scarcity in these hospitals. “During the first wave, we had given permission to only a few hospitals. Now, almost every treatment centre with more than 50 beds having basic amenities to treat Covid-19 patients has permission. People should take beds depending on their medical condition,” Reddy said. Officials observed that many small hospitals which can accommodate patients with mild and moderate symptoms are not being utilised. “Not everyone require super-speciality treatment. Only if oxygen treatment is required, bigger hospital may be needed,” observed an official. The tendency of going to small hospitals is just beginning in the city. My uncle is 72 with comorbidities. He had Covid-19 infection and we could not secure a bed in a big hospital. A friend suggested a medium level hospital at the outskirts. He recovered in 10 days” K Sridhar, a private employee said. Out of 1,200 permitted private hospitals, only around 100 will be big and about a dozen will be super-speciality with over 500 beds. The rest of the hospitals will also have beds, pointed out another official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ambulances-linked-to-covid-bed-dashboard/articleshow/82693068.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Such passengers would be tested on arrival at the airport. In a tweet, the Pune airport said the exemption was only for those travelling for a medical emergency or a death in the family. The authorities said such passengers must inform the airlines about the emergency and provide a proof to avoid any hassles on arrival. While extending the lockdown-like restrictions till June 1, the state government had mandated carrying a negative RT-PCR report (not older than 48 hours) for those entering Maharashtra through any mode of transport. When asked how airlines would ascertain that a flyer was traveling on an emergency, an airport official said, “Flyers must inform the airline about the kind of emergency and show proof, if possible. If airlines are convinced, then those passengers would be allowed to board. After undergoing the swab test at the Pune airport, they will be allowed to leave for their destination. If the report is positive, the flyer would be contacted by the local health officials.” Flyers with booked tickets to Pune had their doubts. “What proof should one provide if it is a family emergency? Is the classification of ‘emergency’ only limited to medical issues or death in the family? There is no clarity, so I postponed my trip,” one flyer said. Pune airport director Kuldeep Singh didn’t respond to multiple calls and SMSs.

The police took him to Sassoon Hospital where he was declared dead. Gandhale said, “We did not find any suicide note. His relatives told the police that his uncle had died because of Covid infection a few days ago and he was depressed after testing positive.

The drive started in the morning but within a few minutes, the stock was exhausted. The vaccination was being administered at 30 centres across the district. The main centre, Dr Ambedkar Institute of Medical Sciences, Phase VI, was closed by 10 am. Civil surgeon Dr Adarshpal Kaur said, “Yes, our vaccine stock is over. We were left with 200 vials that were exhausted within the first hour. We expect to get the next stock by Monday or Tuesday. We will then resume the drive. At present, only industrial workers are being given the shot.” At Zirakpur centres, the beneficiaries who had queued up for hours raised a hue and cry when they were told that there was no vaccine. Many accused the local administration of not arranging the vaccines on time. The situation was similar at the drive-through centres as the vaccination process ended within an hour. Vaccination will be discontinued at the centres till Mohali receives fresh batch of vaccines. Mohali is administering both Covishield and Covaxin at its centres across the district.

Panacea filed a suit against Sanofi in the Delhi High Court which seeks to restrain the launch of a hexavalent vaccine infringing its patent in India, sources told TOI. Typically, such disputes in the past have been sparked by MNCs protecting their turf. Significantly, it’s also perhaps one of the first instances of a dispute over a vaccine protected by a patent. Sanofi assured the court that it will not manufacture or market the product which infringes the amended (patent) claim filed by Panacea, legal sources said. Panacea’s suit is driven by the need to protect its hexavalent combination vaccine, EasySix which was developed to protect newborn babies against six diseases --diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, meningitis (due to haemophilus influenzae type b), hepatitis B and polio. The company obtained a patent in 2016 for the fully liquid ready-to-use whole-cell pertussis (wP) based hexavalent combination vaccine, which competes with Sanofi’s Hexaxim and GSK’s Infanrix. It may be noted that Sanofi’s Hexaxim uses a different tech platform, aP (acellular pertussis). The company is now planning to launch a wP-based one, following marketing approval in February 2021. A questionnaire seeking a comment from Panacea went unanswered. When contacted, a Sanofi Pasteur India spokesperson said: "On May 10, Sanofi Healthcare India was notified of a lawsuit filed in Delhi high court by Panacea Biotec for an alleged infringement of their patent IN272351. On May 11, a preliminary hearing was held and Sanofi in keeping with its commitment to respect innovation and patent laws has confirmed to the Court that it does not infringe upon the amended patent claims of Panacea." In 2019, Panacea amended the patent in line with the commercial product of the hexavalent vaccine. "...Learned senior counsel for the defendant (Sanofi) states that without prejudice to the rights and contentions of the defendant before the Opposition Board / Controller of Patents the defendant will not manufacture or market the product which infringes the amended claim filed by the plaintiff (Panacea) on 16.05.2019," according to the judgement accessed by TOI. In a separate development, Panacea and Sanofi India have also been engaged at the Patent office, with the latter opposing the granted patent in 2017.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/domestic-drug-firm-panacea-sues-sanofi-over-vaccine-for-kids/articleshow/82696257.cms||Rupali Mukherjee

She also said that if Covaxin for the 18-44 age group can’t be provided, the Centre should deliver more doses of Covishield. Atishi said that Delhi is left with only one day of stock of Covaxin and five days stock of Covishield, for those who are of 45 years of age or older, healthcare workers and frontline workers. She said that a consignment of Covishield was received on Saturday, but no stocks of Covaxin have been sent by the central government. “We request the Centre to make the stock of Covaxin available as soon as possible, because there are a lot of people who have been administered the first dose of the vaccine and in the upcoming days they will need their second dose,” she said. “If the second dose is not administered on time, then the efficacy of the first dose will reduce,” she said. She also said that there is not even a single day’s stock of Covaxin left for those in the 18-44 age bracket and six days stock of Covishield is available. All centres administering Covaxin to this age group have been closed down as a result. She said the government can increase the volume of Covishield if doses of Covaxin are not available. Atishi said that on Saturday, almost 1.2 lakh people have been vaccinated in Delhi, out of which 80,197 people have been given the first dose and 37,846 people the second dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/one-day-stock-of-covaxin-five-days-of-covishield-left-atishi/articleshow/82693083.cms||---

While an announcement is unlikely on Monday, sources in TNCC do not rule it out too, based on the views expressed by the majority of the members.According to the sources, only four senior MLAs – S Vijayadharani, J G Prince, S Rajesh Kumar and K Selvaperundhagai – are in the race for CLP leader, as they have been campaigning for support among the elected MLAs as well as senior party leaders to get the edge.“For the first time, there is no known factional support for any particular MLA among the elected party legislators. Whoever gets the majority of the support among the MLAs is likely to get elected as the CLP leader,” a party insider said.While parties like BJP have completed the election process over a week ago, the process in the Congress got delayed as central observers, especially Kharge, had reservations over travelling amidst the peaking of Covid numbers. The delay has already caused some embarrassment to the party as Vijayadharani and Prince played musical chairs in the state assembly last week. While the former took the front row seat on the day elected members were sworn in, the latter occupied it on the day the assembly speaker was elected, creating a flutter in the state unit, sources added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/congress-legislators-to-meet-on-monday-to-select-new-clp-leader/articleshow/82696264.cms||D Govardan
---||Nagpur||In 30 days, 43 wild animals fell into open wells, 10 died||Nagpur: With the death of two tiger cubs by drowning in Tekepar canal well near Bhandara a few days ago, the issue of open wells becoming death traps for animals has once again come under spotlight. As per the forest department’s record, in the last 30 days (April 15 to May 15), 43 wild animals, including three tiger cubs and an Indian rock python, fell into open wells in the region. These numbers, however, do not include leopards that fell into wells in Western Maharashtra during the same period. While one tiger cub could be rescued, the other two drowned. Out of the 43 animals, 10 that died include four sloth bears as no help could reach in time or rather the incidents came to light late. Apart from tigers, other animals included jungle cats, wild boars, nilgais, blackbuck, sloth bears, and jackals. “Wild animals are dying in open wells at an alarming rate as both the forest and rural development departments are turning a blind eye to the issue. Memories of such tragedies are short-lived,” says conservationist Prafulla Bhamburkar. “During the IUCN project, implemented in Pench-Navegaon-Nagzira corridor during last three years, of the 147 identified open wells, we covered 40 in five forested villages. These wells were 30-40 years old and did not have parapet fencing,” said Pervez Shahid Khan, founder of Save Environment And Tigers (SEAT). “There have been at least three GRs issued since 2012 to cover open wells falling in the buffer zone of tiger reserves and villages adjoining forests, but zilla parishad and forest officials hardly take a review. The issue is raised only when tragedies take place,” says state wildlife board member Kishor Rithe. “Unless offences are registered under the Wildlife Protection Act (WPA), 1972, for the death of wild animals against those leaving such wells open, the issue will remain neglected. Three days ago, two nilgais fell into an under-construction 40-feet well near Amravati due to sheer negligence by the owner, who did not barricade the area or temporarily close the well,” said Rithe. “There have been several cases of electrocution by farmers in which Schedule-I animals have died, but offences are not registered under WPA and Electricity Act. Even if cases are registered, there is no conviction which emboldens people to continue with illegal practices. The same is with open wells,” said Bandu Dhotre, another state wildlife board member. Dhotre says herbivores mostly move near agriculture fields. These ungulates are followed by carnivores and many times it is observed that both, prey and predators, fall into open wells. “Though several wells have been covered in Tadoba buffer under Dr Syama Prasad Mookerjee Jan Van Yojana, there is little enforcement to cover more such wells,” he adds. Chandrapur CCF NR Praveen admits, “We don’t register offences against farmers for wild animal deaths in an open well, but we have asked them to temporarily cover these wells with bamboo mats owing to lack of funds.” “After the death of four sloth bears in an open well in Wadoli in Chandrapur last month, the DyCFs concerned have been told to take a follow-up of the issue. A review on open wells with zilla parishad officials will be held soon,” said Praveen. ALL IS NOT WELL * April 15: 6 nilgais rescued from Katol * April 17: A herd of 15 nilgais rescued from Ner in Yavatmal * April 17: 10 wild boars saved from Mandavghorad in Hingna * April 24: A 3-month-old tiger cub rescued from Dabgaon in Chandrapur * April 28: Four sloth bears, a male and a female and two cubs drown * May 8: Indian rock python rescued from Salebhata near Bhandara * May 13: 2 tigers die in siphon well near Bhandara||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/in-30-days-43-wild-animals-fell-into-open-wells-10-died/articleshow/82691271.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Mumbai||12 days of curbs in Nashik hit veggie supply to Mumbai||NASHIK: Vegetable supply to Mumbai from Nashik has been severely hit due to the enforcement of 12 days of strict restrictions by the Nashik district administration. Nashik, which is an agricultural hub, is known as the “Kitchen of Mumbai”. The Nashik Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC), which is the largest wholesale vegetable market in Nashik city, provides around 70% of the vegetables auctioned to Mumbai and suburbs. The APMCs in Nashik are shut due to the restrictions. APMC officials said, over 500-550 tonne of vegetables worth Rs 3-4 crore are auctioned daily at the wholesale market in Nashik city. “Of which, around 400 tonne of vegetables are usually ferried to Mumbai using more than 100 pick-ups every day. Nashik is a major supplier of vegetables to Mumbai and the suburbs,” said a senior official of the Nashik APMC. “But the auction of vegetables has been affected due to the closure of all the APMCs in Nashik district for 12 days because of the ongoing restrictions,” said an APMC official. The official said business transactions through sale of vegetables, amounting to Rs 16 crore, have been affected due to closure of APMCs in the past four days. Few traders are buying vegetables directly from farmers and supplying them to Mumbai. However, the volume is less than 30%, he added. According to the traders, ever since the strict restrictions came into force, around 100-120 tonne of vegetables are being supplied to Mumbai per day. “The problem is that all vegetable mandis in Nashik are closed and hence farmers are unable to bring their produce to these mandis for the traders to pick up. Only the traders who can afford to send their vehicles directly to the farmers can supply the vegetables to Mumbai,” said Ranjat Shinde, a trader from Nashik APMC, who supplies vegetables to Mumbai. “Traders get different types of vegetables in huge quantities at the mandis, but it is difficult to buy from individual farmers,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/12-days-of-curbs-in-nashik-hit-veggie-supply-to-mumbai/articleshow/82693090.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Govt hospitals told to make proning routine||HYDERABAD: In a fresh recourse for treatment to Covid-19 patients, the government has asked all government hospitals make proning — where patients are made to lie on their abdomen to boost their oxygen levels — a daily routine. Directives to hospital superintendents said that proning should be carried out for about 30 minutes each in the morning and evening. For this, alarms will sounded at 10.30 am and 4.40 pm. “This medically accepted position will improve oxygenation levels in the patients whose oxygen saturation level is around 90. Patients will be benefited from further drop in oxygen levels” director of medical education, Dr K Ramesh Reddy, said. There are different positions for patients depending on other medical conditions. This also helps people under home isolation, he added. The government directives also said that support staff and nurses should be present with patients while proning is being practiced as it may be difficult for patients with back and neck pain. District collectors were told to make sure all hospitals follow this regime and send a daily report to authorities. After the Union ministry of health and family welfare recently released guidelines on proning to help patients, Maharashtra became the first to come up with a comprehensive document with Telangana following suit. Experts say that proning will not prevent mortality but will certainly help patients with breathing problems. “The WHO has advised 8 to 12 hours per day of proning, in shorter periods. But this should be done only under supervision and guidance of doctors,” Dr Kiran Madala, an ICMR-certified researcher said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/govt-hosps-told-to-make-proning-routine/articleshow/82693081.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

---||Pune||Pune-based duo creates online portal for easy access to coronavirus information||PUNE: Pune-based duo Chinmayi Dumbre and Arif Amirani have made the daunting task of finding information about availability of beds, oxygen and medicines a breeze. One just needs to glance through the website www.covidpune.com, developed by them in March, to have all the relevant information at fingertips. “We believe in giving authentic data by working directly with the government. To reduce the chances of human error in compiling and updating the data, the website uses web crawlers, bots and other automation techniques. Along with the names of hospitals where beds are available, we also publish the geographical location and when the data was last updated. The information on the website is updated every 15 minutes,” said Amirani. Options for search, selection of regional languages, colour coding of data make it a convenient user experience even for those not well-versed in technology. While Amirani is in charge of the technological aspects, Dumbre looks after product evolution. The initiative is funded by them. The project took two-and-a-half months to complete from the stage of conception to launch. The inspiration to develop the portal was spurred by a personal loss. Dumbre lost his father to Covid-19.  “We initially started the portal to provide relevant information to people living in Pune but as the second wave hit, and more people started leveraging the platform, the advisers on board suggested that we cater to people in other cities as well,” said Dumbre. Apart from Pune, users can also avail information about facilities available in cities like Nashik, Nagpur, Surat, Delhi, Rajkot, Gandhinagar, Beed, Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Bengaluru.  The website also features information for Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Telangana. “If you’re based in Pune or Bengaluru but have relatives in Delhi or Rajkot, you can use the portal to check all the information and help them make necessary arrangements,” said Amirani. “We get calls, messages and emails from users providing us feedback and letting us know how the portal has helped them. Many have requested us to include more regional languages, which we are working on at present as the aim is to make the portal useful for people at grassroots’ level as well,” added Dumbre. Over 8lakh people from Pune have accessed the portal from Pune. Overall, 15lakh people from across the country have visited the portal. “I spent hours trying to find a hospital to admit my parents who tested positive, and then I came across this website. I was able to immediately contact some hospitals on the list and got lucky. This is a great service during such hard times,” said Harini Ravichandran, a city resident. “Looking through various posts on social media for any kind of Covid-related information is a waste of time. This website made it possible for me to find a bed for my father-in-law,” said Irfan Shaikh, another resident. “Parents of two of my friends, were critical. My friends ran from pillar to post trying to locate beds, oxygen, Remdesvir injection etc. We could provide care to our parents only because we happened to come across this website through a forwarded message,” said Siddharth Karia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/duo-creates-online-portal-for-easy-access-to-coronavirus-info/articleshow/82691281.cms||---

---||Delhi||Officials, staff engaged in running of Delhi HC to be treated as frontline warriors||NEW DELHI: A condition insisted upon by a senior high court judge for his approval to a ‘full court’ decision has benefited more than 500 officials and court staff engaged in running the Delhi high court, who will now be treated as frontline warriors by the judiciary. Ever since the second wave of Covid-19 forced a lockdown last month, judges and lawyers have been arguing from the safety of their homes or offices. But the court staff and registry officials come to the high court daily, braving rising infections and deaths, to keep the wheels of justice whirring. They need to remain physically present to scan documents, ensure glitch-free virtual hearings, upload court orders, issue digital copies, etc. On Saturday, justice Siddharth Mridul during ‘full court’ on continued working of the high court during the lockdown, made his nod conditional on the high court taking care of medical treatment, expenses and rehabilitation of staff members and their kin if they get infected. The court decided to prepone summer vacations for the district judiciary from June to May, citing the “alarming rise in Covid-19 cases, and its toll on judges and court staff”. However, it has stuck to the original vacation schedule of June first week for itself. In a note seen by TOI, justice Mridul pointed out to his colleagues that as many as 500 officers and employees attend the high court physically every day. This is to cater to the virtual hearings carried out daily by 25-odd courts. “Whilst, we the judges of this court and the advocates, who appear before us, function from the safety and security of our homes and offices, these officers and employees are being exposed on a daily basis...especially given the highly contagious nature of the present strain of Covid-19,” justice Mridul wrote, adding that any decision on continued working of the high court does “possibly expose them to contracting the infection.” The senior judge observed that “our decision to continue the regular functioning of the high court till the scheduled summer vacation on June 6, 2021, should be subject to our assuring the entire court staff who are required to attend the court physically to ensure its continued functioning (are safe)...that should any of them—our frontline warriors—or their family members are infected by the Covid-19 virus, the high court would provide them all the necessary medical assistance and facilities...as well as rehabilitative support to recover from the same.” He said such a step would “go a long way in instilling confidence and alleviating the fear palpable in the employees, officers and other staff, who are required to physically attend the court...” As per sources, chief justice Patel welcomed the note terming it “a very valuable suggestion” and shared it with all the judges. He ordered for justice Mridul’s note to be placed before a committee dealing with medical aid for subordinate judges and staff for “taking action on the suggestions.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/officials-staff-engaged-in-running-of-hc-to-be-treated-as-frontline-warriors/articleshow/82693132.cms||Abhinav Garg

Zensar can potentially pay up to $33 million till 2024 to acquire the Arizona-based firm, subject to clearance by US regulators and performance-related incentives, Zensar CEO and managing director Ajay S Bhutoria told TOI. “We have identified five major areas of growth, which includes advanced engineering, data engineering, and software as a service (SaaS), among others. This acquisition helps in that regard. M3bi brings expertise in data engineering, AI, machine learning, and a marquee list of clients in the US market, including Fortune 500 companies,” Bhutoria said. Despite being based in Pune, Zensar’s core markets are in the United States, Europe, and South Africa. And the pandemic has affected Zensar’s revenues in the past few quarters. “M3bi, like us, has significant interests in banking, finance, and insurance, which have done well over the past year. We have also improved our EBITDA and cash position,” he said. Like other tech companies, Zensar said that it has also started to hire, with nearly all its employees working from home in different cities in India. Bhutoria said that it will adopt a wait-and-watch approach before “returning to the office” in India. “The rapid pace of vaccinations in the United States means that we can think of a return to office sooner there than in India. Work-from-home is working extremely well,” he remarked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/punes-zensar-acquires-us-technology-company/articleshow/82689490.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

Besides, 2,485 cases have been filed against those not wearing masks, 278 for not following personal distancing and 55 against those who opened their shops despite restrictions. Many of the motorists found to have ventured out unnecessarily were asked to write an apology letter saying they would not repeat the violation and get their vehicles released in the evening. The drones operated by both police personnel and private personnel hired for the purpose, kept hovering in the sky and were monitored by senior officers. The complete lockdown, in force across the state from May 10 to 24, has been intensified over the past few days to curb people from roaming around unnecessarily. In Chennai city, there are 200 police check points including 118 set up by the traffic police where drones are also used. At least 25 personnel have been deployed at every checkpoint in the city and up to 40 in important junctions and inter-district connecting roads. On the Adyar bridge, at least 50 food delivery agents were stopped on Sunday and made to wait on the roadside at 8am. “They are allowed to operate only within a prescribed time period. So, we decided to keep them until a specific time to prevent them from travelling unnecessarily,” said a senior officer. Though a complete lockdown was in force, many stepped out for unnecessary reasons, he said. “Many cited emergencies like purchasing medicines and going to hospitals but did not carry any valid proof,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/drones-help-police-nail-more-than-3000-lockdown-violators/articleshow/82696270.cms||---

Gotawala first said that his ideologies have changed which forced him to change camps. Later he alleged that workers are not being given their proper due by the BJP. “People who have been supporting (BJP) are now having second thoughts. I, on the other hand, believe in serving people so my supporters and community members encouraged me and I joined AAP,” said Gotawala. “Many others were going to join AAP but due to Covid guidelines we decided against gathering a huge crowd and only 35 of my supporters formally joined the new party,” Gotawala said. He was elected as councillor from ward 13 during the board of 2000-05.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/ex-bjp-councillor-quits-party-to-join-aap/articleshow/82689572.cms||---

A total of 507 patients had been shifted out till Sunday night, senior civic officials said, while many stable patients had been discharged. The shifting was planned due to warnings about the cyclone Tauktae. Civic data showed that from the BKC jumbo centre, 166 patients were shifted, of whom 101 were sent to the Nesco facility in Goregaon, while 20 on ICU were moved to SevenHills, Andheri. From the Dahisar jumbo centre, 240 patients were shifted and from the Mulund facility, 110. The challenge lay in shifting ICU patients, who were on BiPAP (non-invasive ventilation). A senior BMC official informed that private ambulances with BiPAP machines were hired. Taking advantage of light traffic, 240 patients were shifted from the Dahisar facility early on Sunday. By 8.30 pm on Sunday, only 11 ICU patients were waiting to be shifted. Dean Dr Deepa Shriyan said the most critical ones would be moved last. She said the BMC had planned the evacuation three days ago. Around 80 patients were discharged and 50 were moved to covid care centres, while 99 were sent to Nesco and 75 to SevenHills. “Since we shifted the patients at night, we could reach these hospitals within 20-25 minutes,” she said. The BKC jumbo centre used 18 ambulances with oxygen support to move patients. In the end, 125 patients on oxygen were moved across seven hospitals, including Nesco, SevenHills, Sion, Nair, and Cooper. BKC also shifted 35 patients on mechanical ventilators, 32 on non-invasive ventilators and eight on high-flow nasal cannulas. Dean Dr Rajesh Dere said patients on ventilators were shifted using cardiac ambulances. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said that of the total patients shifted, nearly 160 were in ICUs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-over-500-covid-patients-shifted-out-of-three-bmc-jumbo-field-hospitals/articleshow/82693178.cms||Richa Pinto

The incident took place when the man, identified as Chanar Singh Sammal, went into the forest to bring back his cattle. According to the forest officials, Sammal had left his cattle for grazing in the morning and had gone with two other villagers to get them back at 3pm. “The area falls under Pratapnagar range and has tall grass and shrubs. The tiger was waiting for the three of them, hiding in the grass. And as soon as they came close, it caught Sammal and dragged him quickly into the deep forest. The two others went after the animal. They found the victim’s body later in the area,” an official said. The locals then informed the police which has now taken the body into custody and sent it for postmortem. The villagers, meanwhile, are demanding that the department should put up a cage to catch the tiger and declare it a maneater. “We are investigating the matter and if needed we will try to catch the tiger as well.

Over the last one month, numerous people had come out to support those in quarantine, especially in delivering food and medicines. With the government now allowing public movement from only 6 am to 10 am, many are now forced to depend on online delivery platforms. “I was earlier seeking food from a home-cook who was sending me two meals a day for Rs 240. Ever since the lockdown , I am spending almost double the amount on food from online platforms,” said Vinod Agarwal, a resident of Gachibowli. Several volunteers are facing similar issues as they are unable to extend help to those in need. “I was sending food to five families in the neighbourhood. Once the lockdown was imposed, I couldn’t cater to three families which were slightly far away from my residence. Even online platforms are levying huge amounts towards delivery charges,” said Anjali Bhatnagar, a home-cook. Some volunteering groups have even applied for e-pass and have approached the authorities. Volunteers from Relief Riders, a group of cyclists helping people deliver food and medicines among other essentials, reached out to Arvind Kumar, MAUD secretary on social media seeking e-passes. The secretary asked them to submit details of volunteers to arrange e-passes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/lockdown-hits-covid-19-patients-as-volunteers-grapple-with-restrictions/articleshow/82693149.cms||Preeti Biswas

The number of active cases in Nashik rural had dropped from 10,997 on May 12 to 8,219 on May 15 — a drop of almost 25%. “The number of fresh Covid cases has dropped significantly and because there is constant recovery also among the patients, the number of active cases has dropped by 25 percent,” said Dr Kapil Aher, the district health officer. The number of the active cases in hotspots in the rural areas including Nashik rural, Niphad and Sinnar talukas also has dropped. “These three talukas are the ones that still have Covid active cases running in four digits, but the numbers have dropped significantly. It may be noted that there were about six talukas which had between 1,000 and 3,500 active cases three days ago,” the officer said. Nashik rural taluka had 1,845 active cases on May 15 (against 2,199 cases on May 12), Niphad had 1,004 (against 1,321) and Sinnar had 1,075 (down from 1,472). The number of cases in the remaining talukas is between 100 and 800.Nandgaon taluka was another major hotspot during the second wave, but the number here had receded to about 600 by May 12. The taluka currently has 288 active cases. “Since the severe restrictions are in place, the numbers have fallen. This is helping curb the spread of Covid and helping us provide better treatment of the patients in the rural areas,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/covid-cases-in-nashik-rural-areas-drop-by-25-in-3-days/articleshow/82687699.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

With cinema halls being closed for major part of the last 12 months, these businesses are struggling to stay afloat amid recurring expenses, debt repayments and zero revenue. Pratik Munot, promoter of Panchasheel movie hall, said expenses of even a non-functional cinema hall can be overbearing. “We are still paying property taxes even though the business is closed. There are maintenance expenses which we cannot ignore, else the building and furniture will get negatively impacted,” said Munot. Sanjay Surana, promoter of Kamaal Talkies, said in Maharashtra, very few single screen theatres will be able to survive. “I believe that half of us in Maharashtra will shut down before the government allows theatres to reopen. Apart from civic taxes and maintenance, we have to pay utility bills, keep on payroll sufficient number of staff for the property’s upkeep and security etc. Personally, I am struggling to meet expenses and my savings are being wiped out fast,” said Surana, who is also the movie exhibition partner for Liberty, Janki and Buty Cineplex (formerly Smruti) theatres. Rohit Buty, promoter of Buty Cineplex, said it was indeed a taxing time for their sector. “We have had to cut down our overheads by quite a bit, but even after operating with bare minimum resources, we are incurring heavy losses due to fixed expenditures,” said Buty, who relaunched the theatre in 2019 under the family name. Even after the government allows reopening of theatres, the overall perception is that it will be a challenge to get the crowds back. But film distributor Manohar Wadhwani is confident that cinema halls will do roaring business once again as big banner films are ready for theatrical release. “People go to theatres for the experience, which can never be replicated at home. Big star-studded films are ready for release since last one year and these are major crowd pullers. From the producers’ side, a theatre release makes much more financial sense and that’s why they have not gone for OTT or satellite launch,” said Wadhwani. Even after reopening, limited seating will impact revenue and Munot says ticket prices can’t be raised drastically. “Even though seating will be at 50% or 75% capacity, we can’t compensate by high ticket prices. There’s a balance which has to be maintained keeping in the mind the audience’s budget comfort,” said Munot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cinema-halls-struggle-to-stay-afloat-worried-about-future-too/articleshow/82687706.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Mumbai||No need for cyclone panic in Mumbai, expect patchy rainfall till noon: Expert||MUMBAI: The reason for upgrading the cyclone warning for Mumbai and neighbouring areas was owing to expectations that the storm would slow down and thus affect the region instead of bypassing it, Shubhangi Bhute, scientist, IMD Mumbai, said on Sunday. “On Sunday afternoon, the cyclone was moving at 13 kmph, which we forecast may come down to 11 kmph… With the storm forecast to move 120 km off the Mumbai coast on Monday, we expect rains and strong winds,” she said. The Coast Guard said all fishing boats, except 18 in Maharashtra and one in Gujarat, have reached their harbours or taken shelter at nearby ports. IMD said cyclonic storm Tauktae was over east central Arabian Sea on Sunday evening and moving north-northwestwards at 16 kmph. It was 320 km south-southwest of Mumbai and very likely to intensify during the next 24 hours. On Sunday, cloudy skies persisted almost all through the day, with the Colaba observatory recording no rain and Santacruz trace rainfall. Mahesh Palawat from Skymet said there was no need for Mumbai to panic but patchy rains would be witnessed at different parts till Monday afternoon. “There are no chances of water logging or flooding anywhere but then it is better to stay alert. The reason for upgrading the alert by IMD could also be that earlier the system was to be crossing the Gujarat coast between Porbandar and Naliya around May 18 afternoon or evening. But now it is expected to cross the Gujarat coast between Porbandar and Mahuva (Bhavnagar district) around May 18 early morning. This means that during the crossing to Gujarat coast, the distance from Mumbai will be reduced from 300-350 km to 100-150 km,” he said. Maximum temperatures in Mumbai remained on the higher side, with Colaba recording 34.8°C (1°C above normal) and Santacruz 36°C (2.5°C above normal).

---||Delhi||Nurturing a positive attitude in kids in the times of pandemic||NEW DELHI: Anjali Tiwari, Class VII student in a Delhi government school in north-west Delhi, has a fixed morning schedule these days. Even though the schools are closed, she gets up early and then goes out to water the marigold she has planted. She then finishes her drawings and revises lessons from her textbooks. For close to 200 students like Tiwari living in the resettlement colonies in Holambi Kalan, Narela and Mongolpuri, these activities are now a priority in the mornings. Such pastimes were conceived to keep the children engaged at home and to divert their attention from the pervasive gloom created by Covid-19. The initiative is being run by NGO AV Baliga Trust. Its dedicated set of volunteers continuously engage with the children and guide them on caring for the plants. For now, with Covid a dangerous reality in the city, such instructions and activities are sent to the kids online. Those without mobile phones in the family walk to the NGO centres, all of which are located within the community. Covid forced the summer vacation for the students to begin early. The schools will remain closed till at least June 9. Amar, the co-ordinator at the Holambi Kalan centre, said, “With schools closed, these children would mostly be idling at home. So, we thought of engaging them with kitchen gardening, drawing, painting and a bit of academic work. When we interact with them, we also learn if they are doing well or if any of their family members and neighbours are facing problems. In many cases, through these children, we have been able to provide medicine to those in need.” Gardening is something that the children are most excited about. “The didi at the centre told us about growing plants. So, I have a marigold plant,” explained Tiwari. “I have planted it in a small pot because there is no space outside my house. I am taking good care of it.” Another Class VII student, Vansh Kumar, is happy about the garden activity. He nurtures a tulsi plant in a pot. “I really enjoy growing plants, also the drawing activity. They are really good,” said Kumar. He doesn’t like it much when he is given activities related to his school lessons. There are some students who are now so interested in gardening that they have planted different plants in a tray and excitedly watch them grow.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/nurturing-a-positive-attitude-in-kids-in-the-times-of-pandemic/articleshow/82719768.cms||Shradha Chettri

City’s Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMCH) has been asked not to fill up six PG seats in medicine department (MD medicine) out of 12 allotted last year and three seats of ophthalmology department (MS ophthalmology) out of five allotted last year. On the same line, Akola GMCH lost two seats in community medicine, while Dr Panjabrao Deshmukh Memorial Medical College in Amravati has lost four seats in surgery (MS surgery department). “The NMC has deliberately reduced the available postgraduate seats in Maharashtra for 2021 for students who are working day and night in hospitals to save lives in these difficult times,” alleged former deputy mayor of Nagpur Shekhar Sawarbandhe. “Losing PG seats means losing specialist doctors in this Covid pandemic time. We appeal central government to restore these seats before admission process starts,” he added. The authorities at all the three medical colleges claimed they have sent compliance reports and waiting for reply from the NMC. Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS), which prepares the seat matrix for PG admissions in the state, has written to the state department of medical education to raise this issue with NMC. Sources at the NMC told TOI that the compliance reports have been received from Maharashtra colleges, but there still are some deficiencies. “The central government has postponed the PG-NEET to August 31. These seats are to be filled up through this entrance test only. So, the colleges have enough time to fulfil the compliances before the admission process begins,” said an NMC official.

No proper checks are being done to the disinfection liquid before spraying it in civil areas and slums in the Cantonment. Though SCB officials welcome the initiative taken up by the former elected members and non-governmental organisations (NGOs), they appealed them to get the disinfection liquid checked for quality as per World Health Organisation (WHO) standards. However, those performing ‘Çovid Seva’ have been ignoring their pleas. Almost everyday, disinfection activity is carried out in the Cantonment “It is unfortunate that none of the persons has approached us to check the quality of the disinfectant. They ever ignored our plea to take prior permission,” a senior SCB official of the health and sanitation wing, told TOI. As per officials, the disinfectant gives out a strong smell during the activity and leaves behind spraying marks on walls, but complaints have been received there were no tell-tale marks of the spray and it was odourless, the official said. “I used to spend Rs 2,000 towards liquid, tanker hire and crew charges per trip,” a former ward member claimed. Regarding quality of disinfectant, he claimed they were following WHO-endorsed chemicals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-seva-adds-to-woes-of-scb-officials/articleshow/82693180.cms||---

The NGO has created a bank of oxygen concentrators and plans to lend it to those in need free of cost. Chhanyado had placed an import order for 100 oxygen concentrators of which 40 have been delivered so far. The NGO will be lending the concentrators community and primary health centres and isolation centres in rural areas. “Right now, cases in Surat city are low but in future if any patient needs the concentrator during treatment or for post-treatment procedures, we will lend it at against a token deposit amount,” said Mehul Desai, an advisory committee member of the NGO. Apart from getting the concentrators free of cost, the patients or their kin won’t have to run around to get the machine. “Our men will take the concentrator to the patients’ homes and install them. We will instruct the patients about how to operate. Once their need is over, our men will bring back the concentrators and return the deposit money to the patient,” said Desai, whose grandfather had founded Chhanyado. “We will also be ordering larger concentrators which can be used in hospitals,” he added. Desai informed that his friends and other good Samaritans of the city helped him raise the funds for buying the oxygen concentrators.

With no income, it has become difficult to arrange food and I have been unable to pay my monthly rent of Rs 3,500,” Ayesha said. Ayesha is one of the many transgender people who have been hit hard due to the lockdown. To help such people, NIPUN, an NGO, has started distributing dry rations and sanitary kits among them. The NGO distributed dry rations to 76 transgenders on Sunday and 110 on Monday. Most of the beneficiaries were from Kapashera, Najafgarh and Dwarka areas. Times ViewMost transgenders are socially discriminated against. Job opportunities are limited for them. It is great to know that an NGO is helping them out. But the government too should step in and do its share.“The Covid-induced lockdown has left transgender people at heightened risk of hunger and poverty since most of them make their living by begging, street entertainment and paid sex. They are not socially privileged to operate within the online world as they are predominantly dependent on social interactions and functions,” said a volunteer of the NGO. Pradeep Kumar, secretary, NIPUN, said, “Most of the transgender people do not have ration cards. As they have no work or income, they have been badly hit. They need support from the government and public. We will identify more transgender people in Kapashera to provide them free ration.” Rashi, a transgender person (30) who received dry ration from the NGO on Monday, said, “We have been struggling to make ends meet. Our condition slightly improved in January this year, but the lockdown has again made us sit at homes. Even if we go to beg at traffic signals wearing masks, the passersby ask us to return home due to the pandemic.” Soni (name changed), a transgender who works as a sex worker, said, “Ever since the lockdown began, I am left with no customer. We request the government to help us.” The NGO will be distributing dry rations to families of migrant workers in Meera Bagh in Paschim Vihar on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hit-hard-by-covid-transgenders-find-succour/articleshow/82719862.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

After meeting with the staff Jadhav said, “The incident that also included abusing and throwing paver blocks was nothing short of terrorizing the patients, their relatives and the staff of the hospital.” “Obviously, the doctors and staff were shocked by the incident and traumatised. During discussion I informed them that the administration was completely in their support. I also pointed out that all of them were frontline workers who are saving lives of Covid patients and should not get distracted by such incidents,” Jadhav said. He also highlighted that many Covid patients were admitted to the hospital and needed doctors and nurses for treatment. Talking to TOI, Jadhav said he has already spoken to the commissioner of police Deepak Pandey, requesting stringent action against the suspect to cut down chances of repeat of such incidents in the future. According to him, doctors and healthcare workers of the hospital are devoting several hours every day due to which recovery rate of patients admitted to the hospital is at 98%. Deputy commissioner of police Vijay Kharat said apart from Section 353 (assault on government servant) of the Indian Penal Code, sections of The Maharashtra Medicare Service Persons and Medicare Service Institutions (Prevention of Violence and Damage or Loss to Property) Act, 2010, The Epidemic Diseases (Amendment) Act 2020 have also been slapped against the accused who is currently absconding. Police have also seized the car of the accused from Vavi village in Sinnar. Mayor Satish Kulkarni also condemned the incident. “While BJP corporator was not directly involved, we condemn any such incident since the doctors and health workers across Nashik are giving their 100% towards treatment of the patients,” he said. Call and messages sent to the BJP corporator remained unanswered. Radhakrishna Game to inquire into Tajne case Deputy chairman of the state legislative council Neelam Gorhe called up divisional commissioner Radhakrishna Game and asked him to carry out an inquiry into the case of Rajendra Tajne, the husband of BJP corporator Seema Tanje, driving his car into the NMC-run Covid hospital. “We strongly condemn such an act in which the ones in power are creating ruckus in the Covid hospital and terrorizing staff,” said Gorhe||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/civic-chief-visits-new-bytco-hosp-boosts-morale-of-staff/articleshow/82687733.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Responding to a tweet from actor Nikhil Siddhartha, KTR directed the Warangal district collector to immediately rein in the management of the private hospital. Actor Nikhil had tweeted that a private hospital in Warangal said it would charge Rs 1 lakh for first day and Rs 75,000 per day for remaining days for a Covid-19 patient’s treatment. He further tweeted: ”Is this fair? Requesting @KTRTRS anna office to look into this.” In another complaint through a tweet, one Ranvitha from Mahbubnagar shared the images of bills including advance paid to a private hospital and urged KTR to show concern and do the needful as the hospital was collecting exorbitant charges and patients’ family needed to pay Rs 6 lakh more. KTR immediately directed tourism minister and local MLA V Srinivas Goud and the district collector to help the family in need. The attendants of patients from neighbouring states are continuing to seek KTR’s help for oxygen and other necessities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/crack-down-on-fleecing-hosps-ktr/articleshow/82693201.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Business||RBI not in favour of fresh insolvency freeze||NEW DELHI: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has shot down suggestions of a fresh suspension of the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code (IBC) due to the second wave of Covid-19, while making it clear that banks can still restructure distressed but viable loans, ensuring that their balance sheets remain transparent. During initial discussions with the government, RBI has indicated a freeze will not help anyone in the long run as it will only show lower level of non-performing assets (NPAs), government sources told TOI. The government has not completely shut the door on the issue but the regulator’s reluctance will certainly weigh on the decision. Last year, RBI went along with the government decision to suspend IBC provisions for six months, which was subsequently extended to a year, but it had reservations. Due to the last round of freeze, several businesses managed to avoid reference to NCLT, enabling managements to stay in the saddle. The moment a case against a company is admitted, the promoters lose control as an insolvency professional runs the show along with a committee of creditors until the resolution process is completed. “It is kicking the can down the road. Any banker would know the exact situation of NPAs on his books even with the freeze but the balance sheet will reflect it after a few quarters,” said a source. The corporate sector has pitched for a fresh suspension, arguing that there will be additional stress in the wake of the lockdown announced across most states to check the surge in cases, which are still rising by over three lakhs daily. Officials, however, said that the demand was being amplified by a section of the industry that was facing stress even before the pandemic hit India. Besides, by all accounts the corporate performance has been encouraging up to the March quarter and the assessment is that the recovery this time will be faster than last year, given that businesses have not completely shut down and supply chains remain open. Government sources said that the steps announced by RBI, allowing restructuring for small retail and business loans, will ease the pressure on the most vulnerable segments. “The slightly larger borrowers have some cushion. We are keeping a watch along with RBI. It will take a little time to assess the full extent of damage,” said an officer. Separately, the finance ministry is also working with the state-run lenders to see how best the loan restructuring scheme announced by RBI can be implemented at a time when many individuals may find it difficult to visit branches. Although the Centre had announced a pre-packaged insolvency resolution window for micro, small and medium enterprises — which is in addition to the restructuring offered by RBI — it has so far seen limited response as large parts of the country started shutting down soon after the mechanism was put in place. Besides, sources said, RBI had allowed a one-time restructuring window for small businesses and banks have the option to use that facility until June. For the larger players, the June 2019 circular allows banks to restructure loans, provided they set aside funds and the NPA classification remains unchanged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-not-in-favour-of-fresh-insolvency-freeze/articleshow/82696293.cms||Sidhartha

Both of them have been remanded in police custody for three days.According to Devraj Borse, the senior police inspector of cyber crime, the matter came to light based on a tip-off about the fake Covid 19 negative certificates being delivered to the people who want e-passes to travel. Police sepoy Rahul Palkhede received the tip-off about such certificates. He along with Ganesh Zinzurke, a resident of Satpur, who was presented as a decoy customer, went to the Hi-tech Cyber Café at Thakkar Bazaar and sought an e-pass for three people going to Dhule for a wedding. Metkar went through the details of addresses presented and said he would charge Rs 500 for the same. He also said the e-pass will not be allowed for a wedding but issued only for emergency work. In the evening the police received a message that an e-pass had been issued. When they went through the details, they found that Zinzurke (decoy customer), who had not taken an RT-PCR test, had a Covid negative report from a private laboratory.The police went to the cyber café again and asked the operator for the details, where it was revealed that the fake certificate of RT-PCR was submitted to get the e-pass. When asked how it was done, Metkar said Rahul Karpe would edit the earlier certificate and then the records were deleted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/two-held-issuing-fake-covid-ve-reports/articleshow/82687771.cms||Abhilash Botekar

The district currently has over 80 mucormycosis patients along with three confirmed deaths. Also, the number of people being affected by black fungus is on the rise. Since the treatment cost is high and the number of patients are on the rise the task force headed by civil surgeon Dr Ashok Thorat met district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal at the latter’s residence on Saturday night following which the six hospitals were finalised. “We have finalized six hospitals where surgeries and treatment for black fungus will be carried out. We will be using the services of ENT experts along with others that will be required to treat a patient,” Bhujbal said. The hospitals where operation theatres will be set up include Civil Hospital, General Hospital Malegaon, Dr Vasantrao Pawar Medical College, Hospital and Research Centre, SMBT Hospital in Igatpuri, New Bytco Hospital and Zakir Hussain Hospital,” he added.The guardian minister has said the task force should also prescribe protective measures required to be taken against the spread of the disease and at the suggestions made would be implemented by the administration. “The task force should prescribe medicines required for prevention and treatment of the infection. The same will then be implemented by the respective authorities. I have also asked the authorities to plan purchase of medicines as well so that the suffering of the patients can be minimized,” Bhujbal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/6-hospitals-to-treat-black-fungus-in-nashik-district/articleshow/82687758.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: 200 attend criminal’s funeral; 80 detained||PUNE: The police on Sunday night detained 80 men and seized 15 two-wheelers, a day after they had booked over 200 people for attending the funeral of a criminal on police record. The criminal, Madhav Waghate (28), was killed by ten men over a trivial issue at Bibvewadi in the early hours of Saturday. In defiance of the ongoing lockdown-like restrictions, the crowd had followed the ambulance carrying the criminal’s body on their two-wheelers and later gathered in large numbers at a crematorium in Katraj. Speaking to TOI, deputy commissioner of police (zone II) Sagar Patil said, “The detained men had participated in the funeral procession on their two-wheelers. We have formed 15 police teams to identify and detain those who went in the procession and assembled unlawfully.” It may be recalled that in February, city-based gangster Gajanan alias Gaja Marne travelled to Pune in a cavalcade of high-end SUVs and cars after he was released from the Taloja jail in Navi Mumbai. Following this show of strength, the Pimpri Chinchwad and Pune police had filed several cases against Marne and his accomplices. According to the Bibvewadi police, ten men, all with criminal backgrounds, had killed Waghate, a resident of Sahakarnagar, with cement paver blocks and sticks at Bibvewadi. Waghate had been arrested by the Sahakarnagar and Bharati Vidyapeeth police on several occasions in body offence cases. He had also been externed from the city and district limits. His externment ended two months ago and he had returned to the city. The police said Waghate’s two friends from Bibvewadi had fought on Friday night over one of them keeping the picture of another criminal as his display photo on his mobile messaging app. “Waghate learnt about the fight and wanted to mediate. However, the 10 men, who were associated with one of the criminals, came to know that Waghate was visiting the area and planned the assault. As soon as Waghate reached there with a friend, they hit Waghate with the paver blocks and sticks. The friend managed to run away,” the police said Police have so far arrested three men in the case. Patil said, “We have registered two separate cases with the Sahakarnagar and Bharati Vidyapeeth police stations against the 200 men for participating in an illegal funeral rally and for unlawful assembly. The procession went to the Katraj area from Sahakarnagar in the evening. The crowd had gathered in the slum pocket and suddenly emerged on the road following the ambulance carrying Waghate’s body.” “The videos of the motorcycle procession and the assembly of the men on two-wheelers went viral on various social media sites, following which the police swung into action,” said a senior police officer. The state government has banned the gathering of five or more people and taking out rallies or processions on public roads during the present lockdown-like restrictions. Sub-inspector B S Khengre of the Sahakarnagar police station said, “We have identified the men who led the procession behind the ambulance after studying the CCTV footage from the road. We have noted down the numbers of the motorcycles and scooters. We will soon arrest them.” Waghate’s murder took place during the strict curbs on movement at night in the city. “The men had gathered in large numbers despite the restrictions in the city. This puts serious questions on our policing and patrolling,” a resident posted on a social networking site where the video was uploaded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/200-attend-criminals-funeral-80-detained/articleshow/82691462.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: On-screen sleaze, gaming & gambling addiction up||PUNE: De-addiction centres, a helpline, experts, parents and some young people who want to get rid of the habit are all on the same page over the long hours students spend online either gaming, gambling or watching pornography. Reports from Childline, a 24-hour helpline for children in distress, and two de-addiction centres in the city, Muktangan and Anandvan, indicate that there has been a major increase in the number and severity of addictions. College students are also addicted to web series and online gambling addiction was noticed in the older generation, mostly working professionals. The age has gone down with even 6-year-old children addicted to online gaming, the three observers noted. Muktangan said three of the 10 currently under treatment have screen addiction problems. There have been over 35 enquiries and 20 cases since the pandemic started related to internet addictions. Sonali Kale, a psychologist working with Muktangan, said there is more aggression among children when denied internet access. “Schools are closed and they are unable to meet their friends so parents let them use their phones. But there are some games, where children are playing with random strangers and even chatting/talking with them without knowing their age, gender or motive which is very dangerous. We had cases of gaming addiction in a child as young as six years old,” she said. She is currently treating three children, including a 16-year-old, who has porn addiction and two others who are 21- and 17-year-olds with gaming addictions. “One child lost Rs 40-50 lakh online in games before his parents realised he needs help. The other has just passed standard XII but is hooked to the screen. Children are also learning to manipulate parents to achieve their goals for more screen time. Lying is one thing, but manipulation, especially at such a young age is dangerous,” Kale said, adding that porn addiction was prevalent in young couples too leading to marital discord and separation. Ajay Dudhane, chairman of Anandvan De-addiction and Rehabilitation Centre, said in 2019-20, they had 312 calls but in 2020-21, till February they had 465 calls. The OPD patients in the same time period grew from 118 to 262 while the in-patients increased from 48 to 62. “Since the pandemic started, the numbers have increased. We had two in-patients in the age group of 8-15, then 22 in-patients in the 16-21 age group and 24 in-patients above the age of 21 who were admitted for screen and then for some other addictions too,” he said. Dudhane said online gambling is a growing issue among young adults. “This is a serious problem among young people which needs to be addressed as it also leads to loss of money. Among children, due to their long hours on the screen, and with less and less parental monitoring, their entire sleep cycle is upset, leading to aggressive behaviour as well as physical discomforts. The problem with web series is that youngsters are hooked to them. After binge-watching, when they talk to friends, it is again about these series. Hence, they are more or less living their entire life either watching the web series or thinking about it or talking about it,” Dudhane said. Anuradha Sahasrabudhe, director of Dnyana Devi Childline, has taken up internet detox camps for children and internet/porn addiction-related awareness programmes. “With schooling and even meeting friends happening online, and with less parental supervision, the cases of addiction have gone up, which needs to be addressed,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/on-screen-sleaze-gaming-gambling-addiction-up/articleshow/82689734.cms||Ardhra Nair

The banks will be opened at 51 locations with the help of NGOs, traders’ associations, social or political organisations and local police. Last year, such a facility was started at Sadar Bazar, Timarpur, Chandni Chowk Metro Station, Daya Basti and a few other places. “Mask banks, which opened last year, operated for four months after which a majority of them were closed. One of such banks at Bara Tooti Chowk in Sadar Bazar was receiving maximum visitors. Labourers, shopkeepers and others regularly visited the outlet for masks. Those, which are still functional, continue to receive demand from the needy people who can’t afford to buy masks,” said mayor Jai Prakash. “In the wake of the recent surge in Covid cases, we aim to make preparations before markets are opened. By wearing masks, people can protect themselves from the infection as well as avoid paying a penalty of Rs 2,000.” Besides asking the officials to prepare a list of organisations willing to donate masks, the mayor also asked councillors to identify at least one location each in their respective areas for opening a mask bank. Mask-dispensing machines in busy areas are being planned too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/north-corpn-to-resume-its-mask-banks-in-busy-areas/articleshow/82719919.cms||Vibha Sharma

---||Pune||Pune: Daughters collect Rs 17,000 to get back man’s impounded auto||PUNE: His daughters are the real strength for 53-year-old autorickshaw driver Chintamani Gaikwad, a resident of Mangalwar Peth. Gaikwad’s autorickshaw was seized by representatives of a finance company in February when he failed to pay the instalments of loan taken to buy the vehicle because of last year’s lockdown that hit his earnings. This was when his daughters, 22-year-old Shweta and 20-year-old Komal, decided to help their father who was slipping into depression. “Our daily income drastically reduced since the lockdown last year. Though I have been an autorickshaw driver for more than 25 years, I bought my own vehicle only in 2018. After the lockdown hit, I was unable to pay the monthly instalment of Rs 5,500. Business never improved and in February representatives of the finance company took away my vehicle when I was looking for passengers and told me to pay Rs 17,000 within a week. I couldn’t do anything to stop them,” Gaikwad, who later complained to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in a letter, said. When his daughters found out about their father’s helplessness, they decided to act. “ Back in February, I was working in a beauty parlour and my younger sister was working in a laboratory. We approached our employers for advance against our salaries telling them about the problem our family was facing. Together, we were able to arrange the money and paid the finance company and got back our father’s autorickshaw by the end the month,” Shweta said. The problems are far from over. With the second wave of the pandemic, Shweta said they were getting calls from the finance company again. “Close to Rs 12,000 is pending. The situation this time is different as I am forced to sit at home as the beauty parlour shut down two months ago. My brother lost his job. Only my younger sister is working and taking care of the whole family. It is impossible for us to pay the instalment,” she said. Shrikant Acharya of the Aam Aadmi Rickshaw Chalak Sanghatna, told TOI that between 3,000 to 4,000 autorickshaw drivers have lost their vehicles to financial institutions in the last three/four months. “We met deputy CM Ajit Pawar in April and he had instructed the Pune divisional commissioner to meet the financial institutions. In some cases, the finance companies have ‘sold’ the autorickshaws after confiscating them. In one such case, we have written to the RTO urging them not to transfer ownership. We have been writing to RBI and the financial institution too,” Acharya told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/daughters-collect-rs-17k-to-get-back-mans-impounded-auto/articleshow/82689767.cms||Joy Sengupta

---||Pune||Number of individuals vaccinated against Covid goes past 25-lakh mark||Pune: The number of vaccinated individuals in Pune district went past the 25-lakh mark on Saturday with another 6,000 beneficiaries added to the list. As of Sunday, May 16, the district has given first doses to 19.51 lakh beneficiaries; 5.59 people have received both their shots. A report prepared by the district health office (DHO) said that the Pune rural administration has registered the highest number of Covid-19 vaccine beneficiaries - more than 9 lakh people have been given their first dose. And 2 lakh people have received both doses. Officials in Pune rural attributed the high number to an aggressive vaccination drive that involved more than 200 vaccination centres. In the urban centres of the district, 6.95 lakh people in PMC limits have been given their first jabs and 2.49 have received the full dosage. In PCMC limits, 3.55 lakh people have been given one dose and 1.09 people have received the second jab. Authorities said numbers could’ve been much higher if vaccine supply to the region had stayed steady. Key targets have been missed due to the scarcity. Both the PMC and the PCMC have now floated global procurement tenders to get vaccines from international suppliers and manufacturers. Officials said if the civic bodies manage to get positive responses, the pace of the Covid vaccination drive could see a substantial boost.In Mumbai, the BMC last week became the first civic body to file a global expression of interest to purchase 50 lakh vaccines (1 crore doses, considering two doses per person).BMC officials said they are open to a deal with any approved vaccine manufacturer that comes forward to provide the 1 crore doses. Apart from Covaxin and Covishield, the civic body will consider Sputnik V, which was developed in Russia and accorded emergency use authorisation in India, and shots developed by Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson.Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said supply of doses is set to improve. “The vaccination in the district is likely to pick up pace from next week as the supply of both Covaxin and Covishield is likely to be streamlined from both the state and Centre,” Deshmukh said.He added that due to shortages, Monday’s vaccination drive is likely to be severely limited.Officials in the PMC and the PCMC, in statements to the press, said they will be suspending their vaccination drives on Monday. District immunisation officer, Sachine Edake, said the region has nearly 4,000 Covaxin and 6,000 Covishield doses in its reserves, enough for a few vaccination centres in Pune rural. On Sunday, only 24 sites in the district were able to hold drives due to vaccine shortages. A total of 2,752 people were vaccinated in the region, out of which 1,579 beneficiaries were from the Pimpri Chinchwad civic limits. In PMC areas, 1,143 beneficiaries got their jabs. In the rural areas, only 30 people were vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/number-of-individuals-vaccinated-against-covid-goes-past-25-lakh-mark/articleshow/82691500.cms||Piyush Bhusari

---||Pune||Post-Covid infection kills Cong MP (46)||Pune: Congress’s Rajya Sabha member and former national president of Indian Youth Congress Rajeev Satav died at a private hospital here due to post-Covid complications on Sunday. He was 47. Satav was an alumni of Fergusson College. “After testing positive, he had recovered and tested negative. But he suffered from bacterial infections which damaged his lungs and he succumbed,” state health minister Rajesh Tope said. Satav was admitted to the hospital in April-end and was on ventilator support. After his recovery, he was diagnosed with a cytomegalovirus infection which made him critical. His case yet again underscores the challenges of post-Covid care and the growing susceptibility to opportunistic infections caused by lowering of immunity levels. “We have lost a learned and promising leader,” deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said. Leader of the opposition in the state assembly Devendra Fadnavis said, “The death of Congress leader Rajeev Satav is very shocking. May his family get the strength to come out of this grief,” he said. Satav’s political journey was impressive. He started out as a panchayat samiti member in 2002, became the national president of the Indian Youth Congress in 2010), served as an MLA in 2009-14, and later as a member of both the Lok Sabha (2014-19) and Rajya Sabha (2020). A close confidant of former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, Satav was given key responsibilities, including the role of Congress in-charge of Gujarat during the assembly elections in 2017. Satav, whose mother was Rajnitai Satav, defied the ‘Modi wave’ in 2014 to win in Hingoli. A science graduate who later completed his law studies from Pune, Satav was a soft-spoken politician who connected with the masses. He is survived by his wife and two children. In his condolence tweet, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, “Anguished by the passing away of my friend from Parliament, Shri Rajeev Satav Ji. He was an upcoming leader with much potential. Condolences to his family, friends and supporters. Om Shanti.” In his tweet, Rahul Gandhi, said, “I’m very sad at the loss of my friend Rajeev Satav. He was a leader with huge potential who embodied the ideals of the Congress. It’s a big loss for us all. My condolences and love to his family.” Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said, “Due to his humble nature, Rajeev Satav has developed many friends beyond party and politics. He was known as a scholar who had deep faith in the parliamentary system.” The last rites will be performed at Kalamnuri in Hingoli on Monday, local Congress functionaries said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/post-covid-infection-kills-cong-mp-46/articleshow/82691522.cms||---

Dhore said a decision in this regard would be taken at this week’s standing committee meeting. Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) has given the first dose to over 3.53 lakh beneficiaries and the second dose to 1.09 lakh beneficiaries. A statement from the mayor’s office said vaccination was the best resort to tackle the Covid-19 crisis in Pimpri Chinchwad, and to achieve vaccination of all eligible adults, the civic body has decided to procure the vaccine through a global tender. The standing committee chairman Nitin Landge has been informed about the move. The statement read, “At present, the vaccine supply from the state government has been meagre, which would delay the overall vaccination drive. Considering the addition of the 18-44 age group to the drive, the supply of vaccines needs to grow in proportion. It has been also observed that citizens from outside Pimpri Chinchwad municipal limits are registering for vaccination, affecting availability for the residents of the twin towns.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pcmc-to-float-global-tender-for-15-lakh-vax-doses/articleshow/82691518.cms||---

The Akhil Bharatiya Marathi Chitrapat Mahamandal (ABMCM) stated the film submission for the state award nominations had been done much before, but the screening for the judges and its announcement were still pending. “The National Film Awards were announced by the Directorate of Film Festival and awards were also given for the same. The state government needed to conduct the awards similarly. Announcement of winners is possible if not conducting the ceremony,” Meghraj Rajebhosale, Mahamandal’s president, said. Every year in May, the cultural department of the state government conducts the state film awards for the films that have been released in the previous year. The awards have gained immense prestige over the years, being the official platform of the state government to recognize Marathi filmmakers. Apart from the memento, the award also carried cash prizes that motivated filmmakers. A senior filmmaker said, “It is true the state government is tackling other important issues at present. However, the situation had improved last year after October and the government could have declared the awards for 2019-20 at least. A ceremony is not required, but just the declaration of results is enough.”Another filmmaker, Sameer Vidwans, said, “Once everything starts becoming normal, I think the state government will definitely hold the ceremony. Meanwhile, they can declare the winners.”National award winning director Shivaji Lotan Patil said, “Maybe once the situation normalizes, the state government should take this up on priority.”State minister of culture, Amit Deshmukh, said, “Arranging the screening, getting together the jury and other mandatory procedures have been difficult in the past one-and-a-half-years. There have been two Covid waves and the entire state government machinery has been focused on fighting the virus. However, we shall soon hold a discussion with all stakeholders to make a decision on this.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/filmmakers-demand-declaration-of-maharashtra-state-film-award-results/articleshow/82689825.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Pune||One held for robbing migrant workers at railway station, 5 accomplices on the run||Pune: The Government Railway Police (GRP) arrested a 27-year-old man on May 1 for robbing migrant workers of cash at the Pune railway station in the last two months. Police claimed that the man was part of a gang of six men, who would impersonate as policemen and rob workers of Rs500 to Rs1,000. The police were searching for the five others. “The police were searching for the impersonators after several migrant workers had reported to the Central Railway authorities that ‘policemen’ had taken away their cash. The CR authorities submitted two complaint applications to the GRP and requested a probe,” Sadanand Wayase-Patil, the superintendent of police, GRP Pune, said. “ We found two men in uniform in the CCTV camera footage. We cross-checked their description with our policemen, but it didn’t matched,” he said.The GRP ruled out the involvement of policemen. “Two weeks ago, one of the men was arrested. He was found wearing a uniform of a constable. He admitted to robbing 17 migrant workers of cash, while posing as a policeman. He said his accomplices robbed many others,” he said. Wayase-Patil said, “The suspects would enter the station premises, wearing the uniforms, from an opening located on the Raja Bahadur Mill Road. They would either check luggage of the workers or promise them railway tickets for their destinations.” While searching the workers’ bags, the suspects would claim they had leads against their involvement in drug trafficking. They would question them asking them where they had hid ‘ganja’ and then take away their cash, he said. The suspects robbed many passengers in the last two years in the same way. The police will also probe the previous cases, he said. As of now, the GRP has registered two cases under relevant sections of the IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/one-held-for-robbing-migrant-workers-at-railway-station-5-accomplices-on-the-run/articleshow/82691579.cms||---

The boat, which set sail from Nagapattinam for fishing in the Arabian Sea, was on its way to Bitra Island in Lakshadweep with two other boats to escape heavy rain and winds. While the other boats reached the shore, Murugan Thunai lost contact and since then there is no information about it. CG ships under Lakshadweep unit were deployed at sea and are now searching for the boat; they are yet to get a lead. It is unclear where the boat sank. According to reports collected from fishermen in other boats, there were 10 crew members on board and an aerial search will also be conducted using CG’s aircraft. “The whereabouts of Murugan Thunai is unclear. We are also checking whether the boat has reached any of the islands. The land-based search is coordinated by Lakshadweep police but they haven’t found anything. If the boat sank, an aerial search could find the wreckage,” said ICG sources. Thaddeus, the driver of Noah’s Ark, a boat from Thenagapattanam that accompanied Murugan Thunai, said that they lost contact with the boat amid huge waves. “The wind was so strong and the waves almost sunk our boat; but by God’s grace we managed to reach the shore safely,” he said. Meanwhile, another boat from Tamil Nadu, Andavan Thunai had sunk off Lakshadweep coast. There are unconfirmed reports that eight of the crew members escaped and reached the shore in one of the islands. “It is unsure whether they swam to the nearest island or were rescued by other boats. CG is yet to get in touch with them but according to the details collected from the fishermen, eight fishermen from the sunken Andavan Thunai are alive. The total number of crew members is unclear,” said sources. The weather in and around Lakshadweep remains adverse with high waves and strong winds. The search and rescue mission by coast guard too is affected by rough weather.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/coast-guard-launches-search-to-find-missing-tn-fishermen/articleshow/82687830.cms||---

---||Delhi||An ‘Auschwitz’ in the gardens of Delhi: Petitioner on Central Vista||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court on Monday wrapped up the hearing on a PIL to stop construction work at Central Vista during the pandemic, but not before the petitioners and the Centre indulged in hard-hitting arguments. Opposing the Centre’s stand before a bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and justice Jyoti Singh, the petitioners termed the project “a central fortress of death” and dubbed that it might turn into an “Auschwitz” in the gardens of Delhi— triggering a strong condemnation from the solicitor general, Tushar Mehta. On its part, the Centre alleged that the PIL was a “facade” and a “second shot” to somehow stall the project, which was not to the liking of the petitioners, even after the Supreme Court had cleared it. Starting the arguments, senior advocate Sidharth Luthra, appearing for the petitioners, accused the Centre of “shooting the messenger” instead of taking note of the petitioners’ message of health, life and safety for the people of Delhi, including the workers and police staff at the construction site. Luthra said it was no longer the Central Vista, but the “central fortress of death”, and compared it to the “Auschwitz”, as workers and others exposed to the infection might pass it on to their families. He contended that the Centre’s submissions on the availability of medical facilities, testing centre, among others, on the site were all false, or had been put in place after the PIL was filed. The lawyer alleged that empty tents were set up and there was no bed or bedding for the workers to stay or sleep in the first week of May. Luthra added that, while the Centre claimed that some workers stayed back willingly to work on the project, no proof of their willingness was shown. Opposing the claims, the SG said one of the petitioners had long been “venomously” opposed to the project long before it got the go ahead from the Supreme Court and had even written several articles. “The petitioners are not concerned for the health and safety of workers at the other constructions going on in the city. Public interest is very selective (in the instant case) regarding the health of the workers,” he added and urged the court to dismiss the plea. Construction firm Shapoorji Pallonji, which has been awarded the tender for the project, also opposed the PIL, saying it lacked bona fide. Senior advocate Maninder Singh, appearing for the firm, told the court that there was no law under which he had to place on record a worker’s willingness to work. He also questioned the locus of the petitioners to question the deadlines fixed for completing the project, underlining that the company had to finish it by November so that the Republic Day parade could be held in Rajpath. He added that half of Rajpath had been dug up, and if the work was stalled, then, when the monsoon would come, the pits would fill up with water, which could lead to collapse of the adjacent areas, and become a breeding ground for dengue and other vector-borne diseases. The high court was hearing a plea by Anya Malhotra and Sohail Hashmi, who had contended that the project was not an “essential activity” during the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/an-auschwitz-in-the-gardens-of-delhi-petitioner-on-central-vista/articleshow/82720092.cms||Abhinav Garg

Experts attributed this to varied measures over last two months, but most importantly on decline in infectivity of the virus. The daily cases too dipped to the 71-day low of 726 in the city. The Nagpur district’s Covid toll for the day was 30 with cases at 1,133, the lowest in last 68 days. On the other hand, recoveries remained high at 4,519, which brought down active cases to 29,843. The active caseload was over 62,000 at the start of this month, putting tremendous pressure on medical infrastructure and availability of life saving drugs. The sharp plunge in cases was recorded despite no reduction in daily testing, which remained over 15,000. Probably for the first time, the out of district toll at 11 was higher than the city’s. Considering the population size, Nagpur municipal limits has generally seen more deaths than rural and other district patients succumbing here. The 16 days of May have recorded 1,063 deaths at an average of 66 casualties per day. This is lower than April’s 77 per day, as there were 2,324 deaths. Covid deaths started surging in second wave since March 19 with a sudden spike of 35 fatalities, of which 23 were from the city. Between March 19 and Sunday, the district has recorded 3,987 Covid deaths at an average of 68 per day. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B told TOI that the drop in fatalities is a reflection of cases coming down for the last 15 days. “Most importantly, we need to be more careful in the days to come. We don’t know how this virus will behave when the restrictions are lifted. We need to maintain this trend and low positivity rate. These are the two key factors to contain the disease,” he said. Radhakrishnan agreed that as availability of beds has improved, patients are getting timely hospitalization, which is one of the reasons behind low fatalities. “Lockdown, increased beds, seamless oxygen and Remdesivir supply are some of the reasons. We are also now supplying oxygen to other districts so the load from there came down,” he said, warning people not to celebrate and remain alert. Dr Mohan Nerker, who has treated over 1,000 Covid patients, said the number of patients has reduced in last few days. “Many are taking treatment on OPD basis. Admissions are for patients being shifted from other hospitals. Earlier, patients were directly reporting to us,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/days-covid-toll-falls-to-single-digit-in-city-first-time-in-58-days/articleshow/82691583.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Doctors say they are getting numerous queries daily from Covid recovered patients on the issue. People think black fungus is contagious and can pass through contact or oxygenation or by use of humidifier. Warning against unauthenticated messages on social media, experts said that black fungus is not contagious and mainly affects immunocompromised individuals and those on prolonged steroids. They also ruled out the possibility of infection spread from oxygenation and humidifier. Dr Anany Gupta, gastroenterology expert at AIIMS New Delhi, said, “Black fungus does not spread from animals to people. Those with low immunity for various reasons may get it. High steroids for a prolonged time also reduce immunity, making patients prone to such infections.” Prof Sheetal Verma of microbiology at KGMU said, “Mucor is commonly found in soil, plants, decaying fruits and vegetables, and manure in the form of spores. The infection occurs in the sinus or lungs when someone breathes in these spores. But these spores are destroyed by the immune system in most cases. It happens very rarely to those with very low immunity.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/black-fungus-not-contagious-depends-on-multiple-factors/articleshow/82693379.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

District collector S Shanavas has issued a red alert as the water level reached 419m. Surplus water will be allowed to flow through the spillway shutters when the water level rises above 419.41m. The collector has warned the people staying on the banks of Chalakudy river to stay alert as the surplus water from the reservoir would be released to the river. KSEB officials who are manning the dam, however, said there was a let up in the rains and the water level was rising only slowly. “Anyway we have kept the spillway shutters open and there will be some overflow when the water level crosses 419.41m,”said a KSEB official. Meanwhile, more relief camps were started in Thrissur and Chalakudy taluks on Sunday as heavy rains accompanied by strong winds battered several parts of the district for the third consecutive day. Two relief camps were started in Chalakudy and one was opened in Thrissur. Authorities had already started some camps in Kodungallur, and Chavakkad on Saturday. Of the 17 camps reserved for Covid positive patients, four camps are for people who are in quarantine. Altogether, 480 people from 174 families have been shifted to the various camps so far, the release said. Several low-lying areas in the district were inundated following the incessant areas. But coastal areas like Kodungallur and Chavakkad were the worst-hit. However, there was a dip in rainfall by Sunday evening in several parts of the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/red-alert-issued-as-water-level-rises-in-peringalkuthu-dam/articleshow/82687917.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The accused duo had taken shelter in the forest of Aheri in Gadchiroli district, but the cops tracked them into the Naxal heartland and nabbed then on Monday afternoon. Sources said Abid Ali was sitting with his friend in a shed on his farm in Ambadevi ward of Warora on Saturday evening. Two unidentified people, faces covered with masks, came and shot him from close range. The duo fled the spot leaving their gun and bike behind. Warora police rushed the injured Ali to sub-district hospital but he was declared brought dead. There was tension late on Sunday night, as a large mob crowded the hospital and kin of deceased refused to take the dead body till the assailants were arrested. With mounting pressure, SP Arvind Salve handed over the case to LCB in-charge Balasaheb Khade for investigation. Three teams of LCB and a team each of Warora, Bhadrawati and cyber cell were formed for investigations. Cops soon detained two youths, who were in contact with main accused Deva Naukarkar. Cyber cell then traced the location of Deva Naukarkar and his accomplice Gaurav Walke to Aheri tehsil. A team of LCB was dispatched to Aheri, and the duo was arrested after search operations in the forest area. PI Khade said Deva Naukarkar had shot Abid Ali. Exact reason behind the murder is still unknown, and cops are interrogating the accused duo.

Citizens confined to their homes heard the wind tearing through open windows before a lull and then starting up again. As many as 40 trees fell in the city between 3pm and 9pm, but no casualties were reported, fire brigade officials said. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the city is expected to get light to moderate rain (15.6 – 64.4 mm) with isolated heavy (64.5-115.5 mm) rain very likely in the ghat areas on Monday. It will be associated with thunderstorms /lightening and winds at 30-40kmph. Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather forecast division of IMD, Pune, said the entire state’s weather is under the influence of cyclone Tauktae. On Sunday, Shivajinagar and Lohegaon observatories recorded 2.8mm and 1.2mm rainfall, respectively. The wind did not damage any Covid health infrastructures in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporations. Hence, no patients were shifted, officials said . “We have discussed the likely impact of the cyclone in Pune with the civic disaster management team. As per the analysis, there would be no need to shift any patient from the hospital,” Rajendra Muthe, a senior PMC official, said. Electrical motors pumps have been installed to remove the water if any waterlogging takes place in them. The facility, which has 800 beds, currently has 456 patients. Shirish Poredi, spokesperson on Covid-19, PCMC, said by Sunday evening no shifting of patients or the damage to the existing healthcare infrastructure was reported by any of their units. “Our staff at the jumbo unit and other medical facilities are on alert,” he said. Meanwhile, the roofs of 15 houses in two villages located near Bhimashankar forest in Khed tehsil were damaged by the wind. District collector Rajesh Deshmukh said, “The revenue officials took stock of the situation. The panchanama is being done. There is no casualty reported across 13 tehsils of the district. Our revenue and disaster management teams are ready.” Chief executive officer of Pune Zilla Parishad Ayush Prasad said, “All 1,400 gram panchayats are on the alert. We have told them to shift persons staying in buildings with bad walls and roofs to safer places. Earthmovers with workers are ready for clearing roads. In-charges of primary health centres have been instructed to be ready with medical aid and ambulances.” (With inputs from Gitesh Shelke, Prasad Kulkarni and Piyush Bhusari)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/windy-monday-too-with-spells-of-rain-for-pune-wet-day-for-state/articleshow/82691660.cms||Sandip Dighe

---||Pune||Cantts have higher fatality rate than municipal areas||Pune: The three cantonments — Pune, Khadki and Dehu Road — with an estimated total population of three lakh, currently have a higher Covid case fatality rate (CFR) than Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad civic limits and Pune rural, a report by the Pune Zilla Parishad has said. The cantonments have an average CFR of 2.2%. In Pune city, CFR is at 1.6%, in PCMC limits, it’s 1.4% and Pune rural is at 1.3%. Cantonment officials said a lack of medical resources limited response during the pandemic. Ayush Prasad, CEO of the zilla parishad, said efforts are on to improve treatment facilities in the cantonment zones. He added that the ZP will also provide Dehu Road cantonment with more manpower to deal with Covid. “We are working in coordination with cantonment boards to reduce the CFR to less than 2%,” he said. The three cantonments have recorded total of 14,288 Covid cases since the pandemic broke last last year. A total of 12,523 patients recovered, 326 succumbed and 1,439 cases remain active.Dr Sunita Joshi, resident medical officer of Dehu Road Cantonment, said many patients couldn’t get care on time, especially oxygen and ventilator-supported beds. “Also, we were unable to start our dedicated Covid centre on time due to lack of doctors and staff. We could start it only on May 1. This contributed to the 2.2% CFR,” Joshi said. In Khadki Cantonment Board, CEO Pramod Kumar Singh said, “Since the KCB doesn’t have a dedicated Covid hospital, we are completely dependent on PMC and PCMC for health care. And we faced difficulties while trying to secure ventilator beds. This is among key reasons why our CFR is at 2.3%.”Pune Cantonment Board has recorded a CFR of 2.1%. A senior doctor from the PCB said they were able to respond quicker due to the 10 ICU beds and 80 oxygen beds at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Cantonment General Hospital.“The CFR is over 2% in PCB as many residents who were admitted at private hospitals succumbed,” the doctor said. Healthcare activists said the cantonments should've had better facilities right from the start. “Total population of all three cantonments is nearly 3 lakh. There are only 10 ICU beds, which are in PCB's hospital. Each cantonment should have had at least 20 ICU beds. Cantonments are financially dependent on the district administration. The Ministry of Defence should send funds,” said Sanjay Kawade, an activist from PCB limits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cantts-have-higher-fatality-rate-than-municipal-areas/articleshow/82691636.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Kochi||No govt representative at Soumya’s funeral||Idukki: The absence of a state government representative at the funeral of Soumya Santhosh, who was killed in a missile attack by Hamas in Israel last week, gave rise to a controversy. At the same time, an official from Israel did visit Soumya’s home to pay homage and acknowledge her service in that country. Though district collector H Dineshan placed a wreath for governor Arif Mohammed Khan, local MLA Roshy Augustine was conspicuous by his absence. When TOI tried to contact him over the phone, it was switched-off. Power minister M M Mani, who represents the neighbouring constituency, was also not present for the funeral on Sunday. Idukki MP Dean Kuriakose told TOI that the government had ignored the woman who lost her life in a foreign country. “It amounted to total disrespect considering the circumstances in which she was killed abroad. I think the government forgot her death. A government representative was not present for the funeral; nobody was there to convey a condolence message to the family. On Saturday no government official was there on its behalf to receive the woman’s body from Nedumbassery airport in Kochi. The district collector, who attended the funeral, came there as a representative of the governor,” claimed Kuriakose. But, a family member admitted that though there were no government representatives at Sunday’s funeral, minister Mani and MLA Augustine had visited the family sometime last week. “We hope that government representatives will visit us soon,” they said. Soumya Santhosh, a caregiver, was killed in a rocket attack on Tuesday evening minutes before she was about to move away from the area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/no-govt-representative-at-soumyas-funeral/articleshow/82687934.cms||---
---||Kochi||‘Soumya, an angel for the people in Israel’||Idukki: Israeli consul general Jonathan Zadka, who visited the home of Soumya Santhosh at Keerithode in Idukki on Sunday, likened her to an angel. “For the people in Israel, Soumya was an angel. This is a very complicated time for one and all. Soumya was killed and she was the victim of terrorism. It is an unbelievable loss to her family and her son. The Israeli government will provide all support to her family. Our thoughts are with her family,” he said, while paying his respects. Zadka handed over a badge, which contained the flags of Israel and India, to Soumya’s son Adone. The diplomat reached Soumya’s home around 11am and interacted with her family. According to her family, Soumya and four more persons from the family worked in Israel. Soumya’s sister-in-law Sherly Benny is working at Ashdod as a caretaker. It was she who informed the family about the incident. The funeral was held at Keerithode Nithya Sahaya Matha Church on Sunday at 2pm. Idukki bishop Mar John Nellikkunnel led the funeral. Local MP Dean Kuriakose, collector H Dineshan (representing governor Arif Mohammed Khan), Kerala Janapaksham leader P C George and Idukki panchayat president Giji K Philip attended the funeral. Bindu Raju, another sister-in-law of Soumya, said, “I worked over 9 years in Israel and the consul general assured all support to the family. Normally, before joining the job every person took an insurance policy in Israel. The family will get the insurance claim.” “Soumya was killed in a terror attack and the government there considers her a soldier who lost her life to protect the country. The diplomat didn’t offer financial assistance to the family but he said the Israeli government is with us. The diplomat added that in the coming days, he will inform what Israeli government will do for the family,” she said. Soumya Santhosh (32) from Keerithode was killed in a rocket attack at Ashkelon in Israel on Tuesday evening as she was on a video call with her husband Santhosh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/soumya-an-angel-for-the-people-in-israel/articleshow/82687973.cms||Sandeep Thomas

---||Delhi||Tauktae to make presence felt in city for three days||New Delhi: The capital is likely to receive rain for the next three days due to the impact of cyclone Tauktae. Met officials said the remnants of the cyclone would cause rain in Delhi-NCR from Tuesday night to Thursday afternoon. The peak activity is expected on Wednesday with “moderate” rain in most parts of Delhi-NCR and “heavy” rain at isolated places. Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist, India Meteorological Department (IMD) and head, Regional Weather Forecasting Centre, said, “After crossing Gujarat coast, Tauktae will start weakening and move towards Rajasthan and Haryana. As a result, the rain activity will first happen in south and east Rajasthan, followed by Haryana, western Uttar Pradesh and Delhi-NCR.” “Very light” rainfall is likely in most parts of the city on Tuesday, while “moderate” and “heavy” rainfall are expected at isolated places on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively. “Peak activity over Delhi-NCR will be on Wednesday when moderate rain will occur over most places along with isolated heavy shower. Wind speed of 50kmph will also prevail over the region on Wednesday,” said Srivastava. According to Met department, Delhi may receive light rain in the first half on Thursday along with gusty winds at the speed of 30-40 kmph. On Monday, the capital saw cloudy sky under the influence of the cyclone. The maximum temperature was 37.8 degrees Celsius— two degrees below normal— and the minimum was 23.6 degrees Celsius— three notches below normal. The relative humidity oscillated between 66% and 28%. With rain likely over the next three days, the maximum temperature may dip from Tuesday. The day temperature may come down to 33 degrees on Tuesday and drop further to 30 degrees on Wednesday and Thursday. The normal maximum temperature till Thursday is 40.2 degrees Celsius. Mercury level is expected to rise from May 22, when the day temperature may touch 38 degrees Celsius.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/tauktae-to-make-presence-felt-in-city-for-three-days/articleshow/82720189.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Virus is down, but not out: 525 in grip, 20 die in 24 hours||LUCKNOW: The daily Covid-19 cases declined further on Sunday, but deaths spiked, indicating that the virus might be down, but not out. In the past 24 hours, 525 people tested positive for the novel coronavirus infection and 20 succumbed to the complications triggered by the disease. As many as 1,944 people, mostly asymptomatic or with mild symptoms, also recovered, bringing the number of patients with active infection down to 11,045. The decline in cases has come as a big relief. Exactly a month ago, the pandemic had peaked with 6,598 cases. The transmission rate has now dropped by 13 times. However, the threat is not over and experts have advised people to follow all precautions. Experts also said the decline in cases would translate into less casualties by next week. Doctors attributed the downward turn of the curve to Covid curfew, vaccinations and increasing number of people following safety protocols. The second wave that started on March 15 has been more infectious and deadlier than the first. Overall, the second wave that started on March 15 has infected 1.5 lakh people and killed 1,074 so far. About 1.4 lakh patients also recovered in the same period. Over 65% of the total 2.3 lakh cases and 47% of the total 2,246 deaths in the entire pandemic, took place in two months of the second wave so far. Data shows that the working class, people in the age group of 20-60, were the most affected in the second wave in comparison to elderly in the first wave. Further, the virus affected more men than women. Young population in the 20-29 age group, both male and female, had the highest infection rate. ICCC helpline for counselling gets distress calls, queries: Two days after the Integrated Covid Command Centre (ICCC) opened a helpline (0522- 4523023) for Covid counselling on telephone, the centre received at least 12 distress calls on Sunday for psychosocial and mental stress caused by Covid-19 infection. The team also received 33 calls for medical assistance with queries for medicine doses and side-effects, while 14 calls were regarding corona test and inoculation, and one for sanitization.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/virus-is-down-but-not-out-525-in-grip-20-die-in-24-hrs/articleshow/82693404.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||88% lockdown pass requests rejected||Chandigarh: The UT administration has rejected over 88% of the requests for movement passes during the two-week lockdown period, citing non-emergency or absence of documents. A total of 14,790 people had applied till Sunday, while only 1,800 requests were approved -- most for them for cremation and performance of last rites -- according to the data. Some of the permissions were for marriage-related functions. People need to file an online request to get the passes. The authority is asking for documents rather than allowing a simple request, the major reason for the maximum rejections. “A total of 15 employees are working in three shifts, with five in each shift, to give the permission. We ask for documents from the applicant. The moment the applicant sends them, we study them and if found genuine, we allow the person to move from one place to another. In many cases, it has been found that the applicant failed to upload the document related to his reason like medical card in case of a medical problem or anything else,” sources said. The administration has already allowed people going to the railway station and airport, and movement of pregnant women or critical patients to hospitals. Sources said besides the online application, they have been getting hundreds of calls related to movement passes. “In many cases, we easily resolve the issues, but in some cases, people make unnecessary excuses to get the passes, which we have to reject,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/88-lockdown-pass-requests-rejected/articleshow/82687990.cms||Deepak Yadav
---||Lucknow||Citizens weave plasma network to save lives||Lucknow: In April 2020, Mahanagar resident Aditi Behel and her father contracted Covid-19. Aditi’s health deteriorated and she suffered from pneumonia as well. All through, she tried to find volunteers on the internet who could provide help at her doorstep, but couldn’t find any since the country was under lockdown then. Looking at the situation of April 2021, when the second wave began with an increased demand for medicines, hospital beds and ventilators, among others, Aditi thought about what she could do. After some thought, the 22-year-old started a plasma network on social media to help Covid patients and raise awareness among survivors to donate plasma. On April 16, she started an Instagram handle called ‘plasmadonor.lucknow’ mentioning the eligibility criteria for potential plasma donors. She later created a Google form where donors can register all information as blood group, name, age, gender, negative Covid test report, weight and medical conditions. After registration, Aditi personally contacts donors and asks them on which date they are willing to donate plasma and posts the information on her page. “I daily get approximately 500 requests from Covid patients’ families for a plasma donor. As soon as the donor registers and completes 15 days of recovery period, I post information in the group. I connect whoever requests on the post first with the donor. Authentication and verifying of details is done by me at both ends for no future hiccups. We have very few donors and high demand,” said Behel. One such donor, Mayank Singh, who took to Instagram to share his experience, said he was inspired by cricketing legend Sachin Tendulkar and went for an antibody test. After finding that he is eligible to donate plasma, he registered on Behel’s page and within minutes, received a call from a person whose father was Covid positive and in a critical state. Singh donated plasma on April 30 and was supposed to get the first shot of the vaccine on May 1. “But, when the doctor told me that I won’t be able to donate again till a month after vaccination, I decided to donate once more after 15 days and then take the vaccine. Difficult times are the best times to prove your worth,” said Singh. Prakash Sahu donated plasma for two patients at the same time after recovering. “I felt very happy after donating, it was a great feeling. The whole process is very safe. I will encourage everyone who can donate plasma to go and do it. It can save someone’s life,” said Umesh Kanoujia, another donor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/citizens-weave-plasma-network-to-save-lives/articleshow/82693440.cms||Aditi Singh
---||Nagpur||Cases of breakthrough infection in city doctors but most recovering quickly||Nagpur: The cases of breakthrough infections — means getting infected by Covid-19 weeks after taking both doses of vaccine — have been seen in many doctors in city. While most of them are getting away with mild symptoms, some of them are getting hospitalized so that they can monitor health parameters for further studies. TOI spoke to some doctors who got Covid-19 after both the doses to know their experiences. “I got symptoms like fever 2 weeks after my second dose,” said senior cardiologist Dr Aziz Khan. “Symptoms were mild and stayed just for a few days. I was completely alright within a week,” he added. “No vaccine provides 100% immunity. Even after full immunisation, there is a chance of infection. But, vaccine protects against serious manifestations. Presently, we have vaccine as the only weapon to move towards normalcy. We must take it and move on,” said Dr Khan. Doctors, health workers, and hospital staff were vaccinated in first phase of Covid-19 vaccination that started in January. Many doctors and their staff completed second dose in February or March and the two-week period after their vaccination completed in April. As doctors and hospital staff are more exposed to the Covid-19 patients, they have high risk of getting infected. General people may not get so many ‘breakthrough infections’ if they continue to follow Covid appropriate behaviour. “I have treated around 76 healthcare workers, many our own staffers and doctors. None of them required oxygen. Just 1-2 days of fever and cough and that’s all,” said pulmonologist Dr Rajesh Swarnakar. A cardiologist in Khamla who got admitted in hospital said that vaccination helps but it’s not full proof protection. “Although my disease was mild, but discomfort was definitely there. So vaccination doesn’t give license to bring down our guard. It gives good protection but we must keep on wearing masks,” he said. A study conducted on more than 3,000 health workers by Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, Delhi, revealed that only 0.06% of people need hospitalisation after Covid vaccination and 97.38% vaccinated were protected from virus. No such study has been conducted in Nagpur or Maharashtra so far. However, no severe manifestation or death of a fully vaccinated health worker or a doctor due to Covid-19 has been reported in Vidarbha so far. One of the recent and much discussed case of breakthrough infection in country is of Padmashri cardiologist Dr KK Aggrawal, who, according to his family members, is ‘battling a serious bout of Covid-19 infection’ in New Delhi at present. Doctors told TOI that they keep on getting alerts on their internal WhatsApp groups about deaths of fully vaccinated doctors mostly from various metropolitan cities in India, but hardly any of them gets media attention.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cases-of-breakthrough-infection-in-city-doctors-but-most-recovering-quickly/articleshow/82691721.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Delhi||Delhi Police constable to rescue of 82-yr-old vaccine seeker||NNEW DELHI: A Delhi Police constable came to the rescue of an 82-year-old retired teacher who lived alone in north Delhi and was unable to go for vaccination due to difficulty in walking. The elderly shared her ordeal with constable Kuldeep, the beat officer, who visited her regularly to check on her well-being. Kuldeep not only took her there in his vehicle, but also carried her to the centre and back in his arms. He also helped her register for the vaccination on the portal. The police brass appreciated his act. Meanwhile, Delhi Police continued its crackdown on people on the wrong side of the law during the pandemic. An AIIMS staffer who had demanded Rs 5 lakh from a Covid patient for admission to a hospital was arrested from north Delhi’s Rohini. A man lodged a complaint with the Covid Cell at the police headquarters alleging that two people, who he contacted through an acquaintance, had taken Rs 2.8 lakh for admission of his Covid-positive wife to Safdarjung Hospital. An FIR was registered and a probe initiated. It came to fore that Pankaj Kumar, who was working at AIIMS Hospital in haematology lab, had promised admission in lieu of the money. He asked the victim to contact his sister. The money was taken as an advance. The siblings fled to Himachal Pradesh with the cash. In another operation, two people were arrested for black marketing of Remdesivir and 12 vials of the injection were recovered. The victim informed the East district police that he had been looking for the injection and had met a man, Manish, who provided him one vial of Remdesivir injection for Rs 40,000 and further offered to provide five more vials in the evening for Rs 2 lakh more. The cops laid a trap and arrested Manish and his associate from near LBS Hospital. During interrogation, the accused disclosed that they had BSc degrees from Dr BR Ambedkar College, Agra, and were working as medical representatives. They added that Manish used to acquire injections from, Bihari, who used to meet him near SM Hospital, Agra, and they used to sell these injections at higher prices to the needy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/constable-to-rescue-of-82-yr-old-vax-seeker/articleshow/82720321.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Acute shortage of plasma at King George’s Medical University||LUCKNOW: The state plasma bank in the transfusion medicine department of the King George’s Medical University is facing acute crisis of Covid plasma used for providing convalescent plasma therapy to critical patients. The donations have nosedived in the past one month as people are afraid to step into hospitals. Besides, people are abstaining from donation due to a myth that plasma extraction can rob them off antibodies and they can fall ill again. Also, there is confusion among many regarding eligibility for donation. Only two or three voluntary donors are coming daily against the requirement of 9-10. The department gives Covid plasma to needy patients in exchange for a donation by a donor who had been infected with the disease in the past. In emergency cases, Covid plasma is given without a donor. “There is an urgent need of voluntary donors who can help us increase the stock so that we can help patients as we did last year during the first wave, when at least 500 patients were benefitted across the state,” said head of the department, Prof Tulika Chandra. “In our plasma pool, as of now, we have about 4-6 units of A, B, O blood groups and two of AB,” she added. Those vaccinated can also donate plasma: “A person vaccinated against Covid-19 can also donate, if she/he is naturally infected by the virus before or after taking the jab. The condition is that the donation can be done 28 days after taking the last shot. The maximum time period, the donation can be done is four months. The vaccine should be taken when a person is not infected,” said Prof Tulika Chandra, head transfusion medicine, while clearing the confusion over donor eligibility. She said that even diabetic and hypertensive patients can donate plasma under restricted conditions. “If a diabetic is not on insulin and has maintained blood sugar levels for six months can donate.

A test is done of all the donors irrespective of the category before donation to determine whether the donor has adequate antibodies or not.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/acute-shortage-of-plasma-at-kgmu/articleshow/82693476.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Youth supplying drugs at night parties held by Special Task Force||LUCKNOW: The Special Task Force (STF) nabbed a drug peddler who used to supply methadone drugs for late-night parties through courier packets. The accused, Danish Siddiqui aka Ish Ali of Azamgarh, was staying in Chinhat. ASP STF Satyasen Yadav said it was for the first time that they had found such nature of drugs being brought in the city. On the basis of intelligence and physical ground network, they had tracked Danish, said Yadav. “Danish has confessed to his crime and disclosed that he met some boys at a party about seven months back. Through these boys, Danish came in contact with a New Delhi native in December. The man used to send Danish drugs through courier at a rate of Rs 20,000 for 10gm. Danish used to sell the same at a rate of Rs 4,000/gm at night parties,” said Yadav. STF said Danish had sold Rs 5 lakh worth of drugs in the past seven months. Investigation found that the drugs were delivered inside routers and later through cigarette packets they were sent to the customers. “Danish has physically not met the supplier. He only takes orders and then payment is made via different apps,” said an officer privy to the probe. STF officials said that efforts were on to trace the entire chain linked to the supply of drugs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/youth-supplying-drugs-at-night-parties-held-by-stf/articleshow/82693512.cms||---

Adjusting for local need, around 88 lakh tonnes will be procured. This time, FCI is procuring the fine variety of rice too at a cost of Rs 1,888 for both fine and coarse varieties. Till now, nearly 40 lakh metric tonnes of paddy has been procured. FCI is ready to procure additional five to six lakh tonnes. Fine variety is being produced as there was change in consumption in Kerala, Tamil Nadu where usually the coarse variety is preferred There are indications that rural areas will see a Covid- 19 spread, what precautions have been taken? We are making sure that social distancing and other protocols are maintained...farmers are mostly disciplined but many of our agriculture extension officers have been infected and are recovering. We don’t see a major problem in procurement There is a demand from maize and jowar farmers on price and procurement... Despite the financial odds, state government in the last seven years has spent around 8,000 crore only in interest as there is a time lapse between FCI’s payment to us for procurement. State has to give guarantees to civil supplies corporation before reimbursement comes from FCI and make interest payments for the loans taken. The cost of maize procurement and price increase for jower will cost us around 800 crore. We have placed the requests of maize and jowar farmers before the chief minister Despite campaigning on regulated farming there is huge paddy cultivation in the state... We have become the rice bowl of India but it is a doubled-edged sword. Villages have heaps of paddy but there is huge cost involved. We are certainly telling farmers to not grow paddy as second crop. Instead alternative crops like oilseeds will be economical and beneficial What is the status of Rythu Bandhu and loan waiver schemes Rythu Bandhu in this season will be implemented around July when there is clarity on cultivated land. The extent and number of beneficiaries will be similar to last time. There will not be any cap in the scheme. Farmers having loans up to Rs 25,000 were given the benefit. Next phase will be for loans from Rs 25,000 to 50,000||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/fci-will-procure-fine-coarse-rice/articleshow/82691847.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Revanth was stopped by the police at Begumpet on his way to distribute food packets to the doctors, nurses, attendants of Covid-19 patients, and migrant workers at Secunderabad Railway station and Gandhi hospital in Secunderabad. “When I asked them how they can stop a local MP from helping the needy, the police told me that they have instructions from the top in the government. The government is stopping the Congress leaders from extending relief and help to the needy during lockdown,” he alleged. He accused the TRS government of not only failing to control the spread of Covid-19 but also not being able to supply medicines, oxygen and vaccines, and facilitate beds with ventilators in hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/revanth-attacks-trs-on-covid-relief/articleshow/82691852.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||As footfall drops, Delhi airport's T2 suspends operation||NEW DELHI: Delhi airport’s Terminal 2 has been shut down for operations from Monday midnight. All the flights will now operate only from Terminal 3 of the Indira Gandhi International Airport, an official said. The move comes keeping in mind the drop in footfall, following the restrictions and lockdown curbs in several states. Around two months ago, the airport was mulling opening Terminal 1 in addition to the already functioning Terminal 2 and 3. However, footfall began dropping as cases began rising countrywide. An airport official said the footfall had crossed around 1 lakh passengers per day at the start of the year, however, it was currently down to around 35,000 passengers per day. “We have decided to close operations at Terminal 2 to make it easier for airlines to operate and manage their staff. It will also be easier for passengers to fly from one terminal,” said the official. Once the footfall returns to a significant figure again, T2 will resume operation and passengers will be given prior notice, in case their flights were booked in advance, the airport said. “All flight operations at #DelhiAirport will be shifted to T3 effectively from May 10 00:01 hours. All passengers are required to complete their web check-in at home for a contactless journey,” Delhi airport tweeted on Monday. GoAir and IndiGo airlines were among those posting on Twitter and reminding passengers to reach the correct terminal for their flight. Currently, Delhi airport is handling around 320 flights per day. Before the pandemic, it was handling over 1,400 flight movements each day. On average, it has been receiving around three flights each day with international aid over the past three weeks, including items such as oxygen concentrators and cylinders, PPE kits, N95 masks, rapid test kits and medicines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/as-footfall-drops-t2-suspends-operation/articleshow/82720396.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: This ‘wood bank’ invests in humanity, compassion||Case I: Civic authorities found the body of a woman, Ramdai, lying outside a crematorium in Ghazipur district. When no one came for hours to claim the body, they understood that her kin must have abandoned her body fearing infection Case II: Lakhana was seen crying next to the body of his wife at the district hospital’s mortuary. When asked, he said he had no money to perform her last rites LUCKNOW: The fury of coronavirus pandemic has devastated many families, especially the underprivileged ones, which do not have enough money to ensure proper treatment to their loved ones or to perform the last rites Covid-19 victims in a dignified manner. To provide respite to people in distress, a philanthropist from Ghazipur district, Virendra Singh, and businessman Sanjay Rai Sherpuria, have started a unique bank, Baikunth Dham Antyeshti Lakdi Bank (wood bank), to arrange for the cremation of unclaimed bodies or of those who do not have money for rituals. The initiative comes at a time when people are deserting their Covid-19 positive kin in their final journey and even dumping bodies in rivers. “People like Lakhana lend a face to the larger problem that emerges amid the Covid-19 crisis in individual families. There is no dearth of cases like that of Ramdai. While we must try to save as many lives as possible, it is equally important to ensure that those who have departed are given a decent farewell,” said Virendra Singh, who has been cremating unclaimed bodies as and when required, with or without the help of local authorities. The self-motivated, unemployed youth has earned the titled of ‘Laawaris ka waris Virendra’ in Ghazipur district for shouldering the unique responsibility. The idea of setting up a wood bank struck Singh when he first met Sanjay Rai Sherpuria at the district hospital. Both of them felt bad that the pandemic was pulling human values to such a low level that relatives are not ready to touch the bodies of their dear ones. “I asked Virendra what to do about such people and he simply replied… karna kya hai… inka antim sanskar karna hai… As a businessman I offered him money but he refused. So, I provided him with truckloads of wood for free to perform the cremation of the poor and needy. This is how the bank started,” Sherpuria recalled. “Reports of dead bodies being dumped in the Ganga strengthened our resolve that something must be done to check this,” he said, adding that the cost of funeral in Covid-19 times has gone up by 4-5 times. “On an average, about 6-7 mann (maund) of wood is required for cremation. The cost of one mann wood has gone up from about Rs 250 to Rs 1,000-1,250 nowadays. Then the cost of performing other rituals is also about Rs 2,000-3,000 which adds up to around Rs 8,000-10,000 per cremation. This is not even the total annual earnings of many families in poverty-stricken Purvanchal region,” he said. The bank has also started a helpline number to facilitate people approach them. Posters have been put up at the crematorium and outside hospitals. “In two days, we have helped 10 persons. We are also getting calls from village heads but we are using discretion and taking the help of civic and hospital administration to identify those who genuinely need help,” Singh said, hoping that more people would join the cause. “The facility will be extended to eight other ghats of the district next week,” Sherpuria said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/this-wood-bank-invests-in-humanity-compassion/articleshow/82693544.cms||Shailvee Sharda

Maharashtra’s highest single day toll of 985 was registered on April 28 this year. In a silver lining though, discharges were miles ahead of new case detections. On Sunday, Maharashtra reported 34,389 new Covid positive cases, a 47-day low, taking the overall case tally to 53,78,452. It was also the third day in a row that the state registered below 40,000 cases after recording up to 68,000 infections in a single day a month ago. The 59,318 discharges took the number of recoveries to 48.3lakh. New cases in Mumbai continued to be under 2,000 for the fourth day in a row. The city reported 1,535, new infections and 60 deaths taking the case tally to 6,87,830 and deaths to 14,224. The city’s positivity rate dropped to 6.8%. Of the deaths, three were below the age of 40 years and 19 were between 40 to 60 years. The city now has 33,574 active cases, while the state has 4,68,109 patients under treatment. Dr TP Lahane, head of the Directorate of Medical Education and Research said the 24-hour mortalities continue to be high in the state. “There are at least 30 each ‘brought dead’ instances and an equal number of deaths within 24 hours. Both these factors indicate that patients are referred late and by the time they get to tertiary centres there is nothing much left to do,” he said. CM Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday interacted online with over 17,000 physicians and appealed to them to help the state reduce the fatality rate. He also sought better preparedness since monsoon was round the corner and it could complicate handling of Covid. The CM asked for more rapid antigen tests instead of RT-PCR. The state numbers indicate more cases are now being reported from rural or semi-urban parts than cities. Pune rural reported 2,990 and Solapur rural 2,988 new cases which are higher than Mumbai’s daily count and that of Nagpur circle. New cases in Ahmednagar (2,569) and Satara (1,662) were more than Mumbai, while Sangli’s daily count was 1,279. Nashik rural and urban reported over 1,000 cases each. Amravati is once again seeing a surge after recording a drop in cases. Of the total deaths, Nagpur circle reported the highest in the state at 172, while Pune circle had 155 and Mumbai 152 whereas Kolhapur circle had 142 and Nashik 100. Kolhapur rural alone reported 81 deaths and Solapur rural 78, higher than crowded cities like Mumbai and Pune. According to the state health department, of the 974 deaths reported, 415 occurred in the last 48 hours and 253 in the last week. The remaining 306 are more than a week old.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-sees-2nd-highest-toll-at-974-new-cases-at-47-day-low/articleshow/82693683.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

They trudged back with bulging bags. Vegetables imported from other states — capsicum, beans and tomato — are already dearer and prices may escalate further owing to panic-buying. As people scrambled to stock up basic goods for sustenance between 7am and 10am, the Covid-appropriate behaviour was a casualty, with one leaning over another to pick up their items of choice. Since doctors advise higher protein intake, the gatherings around chicken and egg stores were thicker. “Today, we emptied our stock in just an hour. We anticipated a rush and got a good stock. But even that fell short,” said Prasun Ghosh, a chicken retailer at Behala old market. The vegetable markets across the city faced supply issues. Many vendors, who come by trains and buses, could not reach markets on time. “These were some teething issues on the first day of restrictions. The supply line will ease. But diesel prices are a big spoiler for which prices are on an upswing,” said Salil Ghosh, secretary of the Vegetable Vendors’ Association of Zinzira wholesale market. “Prices have more than doubled since Eid. With restricted time for mandis, we are unable to cater to the customers for longer hours. Add to this panic buying, which may lead to another round of price rise,” said Anup Gupta, wholesaler at the Koley Market. There was crowding around every vegetable vendor as people were throwing caution to the wind. Police kept announcing safe distancing and timely closure of markets as people continued swarming vegetable and grocery shops. Prices of vegetables like capsicum, beans and tomato, which are imported from other states,have increased over the past couple of days. On Saturday, wholesale price of tomato was between Rs 18 and Rs 22 per kilo while the retail price touched Rs 50. Wholesale price of beans and capsicum was Rs 45 and Rs 38, respectively, while the retail prices were between Rs 120 and Rs 150. The queue before the grocery stores got lengthier with every passing minute, forcing shop-keepers to distribute coupons among the first 50 customers in the queue with a commitment to supply them or deliver them goods at their doorsteps. “We tried to supply customers as much as possible. But each of the customers brought a long list and we had a trying time in fulfilling their demands,” said Arijit Dey of Sri Krishna Bhandar, Kidderpore market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/panic-buying-across-city-may-push-up-veggie-prices/articleshow/82690140.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Lucknow||Silver lining: Recoveries double than fresh cases in Uttar Pradesh||LUCKNOW: Corona-battered Uttar Pradesh had something to cheer on Sunday with the state clocking twice the number of recoveries than fresh cases over a 24-hour span. As per the state health bulletin, 24,837 people recovered from the infection, which is more than double of Sunday’s Covid count of 10,682. The trend, which is indicative of the raging pandemic touching a corner, began since Saturday when as against 12,547 fresh cases, 28,404 people were discharged from hospital after treatment. Experts said, this could ease the pressure on the state’s stretched medical facilities even as the government ramps up measures, including extending the partial lockdown by a week. However, fatalities rose from 281 on Saturday to 311 on Sunday, taking the total death toll to 1,63,003 till date. A maximum number of 27 deaths were recorded in Meerut, followed by 20 in Lucknow and 13 in Kanpur. Basti and Chandauli recorded 12 casualties each. Additional chief secretary, medical and health, Amit Mohan Prasad, maintained the recovery rate had touched 89%. Scaling up testing, 2.7 lakh samples were tested in 24 hours, taking the total samples tested since the outbreak of pandemic to 4.46crore. As per state government figures, the number of active cases fell to 1,63,003 on Sunday from Saturday’s figure of 1,77,643. The biggest improvement was noticed in chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s home turf of Gorakhpur, where number of fresh Covid cases dropped from 801 to 433 in 24 hours. Meerut, which has been topping the daily tally, witnessed a dip from 879 to 701 in a day. Improvement was also noticed in case of Lucknow, where number of fresh Corona cases dropped from 617 to 525 in last 24 hours. Significantly, Varanasi, the parliamentary constituency of PM Narendra Modi saw a slight surge in new cases – the count went up from 476 on Saturday to 496 on Sunday. The situation remained unchanged in Kanpur, which recorded 197 fresh cases. Also, total number of citizens vaccinated in UP touched 1,47,64,942 by Sunday.

---||Delhi||Delhi: For street vendors, latest Covid wave jolt deadlier||NEW DELHI: Street vendors have just one topic of conversation these days: income woes and the absence of any official relief. “Early this year, when Covid-19 appeared to have spent its fury, we were hopeful that our business would revive,” said Jitender, 45. “And to an extent it did. But what followed was deadlier. I have myself lost two people in my family.” Jitender had taken to selling momos at a Janakpuri market after losing his job due to the economic crisis created by the lockdown last year. He has no savings left. “I sold most of my belongings because I didn’t have money even to buy food,” the 45-year-old said. “We have seen terrible times. Now I worry that people won’t consume street food when this lockdown is lifted.” The situation has been similar for Akash Yadav. He shifted from UP to Delhi in 2019 with hopes of big earnings in the city. He opened a roadside shop in Tilak Nagar and sold women’s apparel at affordable rates. All went according to plan until March 2020, when the pandemic forced the closure of markets. “There were a few customers who helped me financially last year, but this year I feel ashamed of begging for help,” said Yadav. “Recently, my sister-in-law fell seriously sick and I didn’t even have the money to book an ambulance.” Yadav is now being assisted by one of his regular customers in creating an Instagram page, which he hopes to use to sell clothes online. Those selling essential goods have better prospects than toy seller Mohammad Hammad. “I used to make at least Rs 4,000 at the Saturday weekly market in Pitampura. Now I can’t sell anything,” he frowned. “I have to feed a family of six and my younger kids have spoiled at least 20 of these toys by playing with them. Since I can’t feed them properly, the least I can do for them is to let them play with the toys,” the 38-year-old said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/for-street-vendors-latest-covid-wave-jolt-deadlier/articleshow/82720473.cms||Pankhuri Yadav
---||Nagpur||77 Covid deaths at home in April, 1,120 in city hospitals||Nagpur: Seventy-seven Covid patients died in their homes in the city, whereas 1,120 succumbed to the deadly disease in hospitals in April. Doctors say the Covid deaths at homes may be because of not getting hospital beds or late diagnosis or even due to delayed treatment. As per Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) data, 1,233 patients of novel coronavirus died in the city during the peak of the highly contagious and virulent second wave in April. However, the case fatality rate (CFR) was lesser during the period — 1.05% — due to higher number of cases detected — 1,17,846. Of the 1,233 deaths, the civic body could not get details of 36 deceased and hence its calculations were based on analysis of 1,197 deaths. Of these, 77 (6.43%) had died in their homes. No home deaths were reported in the previous months this year. The city had witnessed severe crisis of hospital beds in April due to increased caseload. Two (0.17%) patients were declared brought dead in April, says the civic body’s data. There were three brought dead cases out of total 84 deaths in January and four of total 80 in February when there was no bed shortage. In March, the number of brought dead increased to 18 (4.04%) of the total 446 Covid deaths. Earlier, Government Medical College & Hospital (GMCH) and Indira Gandhi Government Medical College & Hospital (IGGMCH) used to keep brought dead in mortuaries, test for Covid-19 and hand over the bodies to the NMC for cremation if the result came positive. Lesser number of brought dead cases in April, however, raise a question as to whether Covid testing protocol was followed or not. Analysis of the NMC data also reveals that 174 (14.54%) patients had passed away within 48 hours of hospitalization, while 169 (14.12%) patients had succumbed within 48-72 hours of being admitted. Highest number of deaths was after 72 hours of hospitalization. 775 (64.75%) patients managed to get hospital beds but could not survive despite getting treatment for over 72 hours. Infectious diseases specialist Dr Nitin Shinde told TOI, “Proper investigation needs to be done as the number of brought dead cases registered was very less in April. Many patients could not get hospital beds in April owing to much higher number of cases detected. The disease was virulent in the second wave so health of a few patients, irrespective of comorbidities, deteriorated and died despite diagnosis in time and hospitalization in early stage.” Convener of Vidarbha Hospitals Association Dr Anup Marar said, “253 patients died at home or brought dead or succumbed within 48 hours of hospitalization. This is a glaring example wherein patients stayed back at their homes may be due to overconfidence or ignorance or non-availability of hospital beds. Also, they may not have followed guidelines of medication, timely follow up of tests, monitored oxygen saturation level twice in a day and also after six minutes of walk.” “The authorities need to ascertain age, comorbidity status and vaccination status of every deceased for further study. Inculcating self-discipline, strict adherence to treatment protocols by doctors and patients along with timely admission in well-equipped and manned Covid hospitals will go a long way in reducing mortality rate,” he said. Interestingly, rural parts of the district did not witness any home deaths in April, if the data of zilla parishad (ZP) is to be believed. In Nagpur rural, 400 (46.67%) of the total 857 Covid casualties had occurred within 48 hours of hospitalization, 92 (10.74%) within 48-72 hours and 365 (42.59%) after 72 hours in April. After the peak of first wave in October, the district had registered 2,900 deaths. There were no home deaths and 12.38% were brought dead then. Of these, 35.07% died within 48 hours of hospitalization followed by 8.97% within 48-72 hours and 43.58% after 72 hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/77-covid-deaths-at-home-in-april-1120-in-city-hospitals/articleshow/82691922.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

The centres have been set up with the assistance of the state government and have about 3,000 beds, including 299 oxygen beds. “These centres have isolation and quarantine facilities along with immediate required medical aid to asymptomatic and mild symptomatic police personnel, Covid care centres have also been established at 34 PAC Battalions,” said ADG, law and order, Prashant Kumar. He added that a provision of 628 beds has been made for better treatment and health care of PAC personnel, out of which 45 are oxygen beds. “As many as 589 police personnel were admitted for medical treatment at these Covid care centres, out of whom 244 have recovered and discharged, while 322 police personnel are under treatment in these centres,” said Kumar. A 107-bed Covid care centre for frontline workers by Government Railway Police (GRP) and a 236-bed Covid centre by the Training Directorate have been set up to provide immediate and proper medical treatment to the police personnel, the ADG said. Police commissionerates in Kanpur and Lucknow have also set up ‘oxygen banks’ for families of cops in need and also public as per their need. The idea of Covid care centre in the Police Lines was mooted in Kanpur zone by ADG Bhanu Bhaskar and Kanpur police commissioner Asim Arun and later replicated in other districts of the state. Due to the absence of Police Lines in rural Varanasi, Covid care centre has been set up in the Commissionerate Police Lines. Covid care centres are also being operated in Chakia State Hospital in Chandauli, in Girls Hostel of Veer Bahadur Sports Stadium in Gorakhpur and in District Hospital in Shravasti. Police departments of some districts have arranged more beds from their own resources. Of these, 200 beds in Gorakhpur, 120 beds in Aligarh, 110 beds in Hardoi have been increased. 90 beds out of which 40 are oxygen beds have been set up in Ghaziabad. Besides, Covid care centres with 60 beds in Bahraich, 66 beds with 16 oxygen beds in Muzaffarnagar, 57 beds including 20 oxygen beds in Lucknow Commissionerate, 30 oxygen beds in Meerut, 52 beds including 10 oxygen beds in GB Nagar Commissionerate, 16 oxygen beds in Kanpur Commissionerate and 54 beds in Varanasi Commissionerate are being operated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/covid-care-centres-for-cops-operational-in-66-districts/articleshow/82693597.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Usual Sunday at airport, but app-cabs fleece flyers||Kolkata: Reduced flights, passengers reaching airport several hours before the departure schedule, some spending the night outside the terminal, app cabs charging extra over the booked fares and cops and airport officials stepping in to help passengers in distress. As restrictions kicked in on Sunday morning, it was a virtual replay of scenes that had been played out at the airport last July and August when twice-a-week restrictions were imposed to check the Covid situation. Flights though operated as usual. “There were no major cancellations on Sunday and we don’t have information about any passenger missing a flight either. Our officials were on the ground and were in constant touch with local police to ensure passengers travelling to and from the airport were not stopped and even necessary vehicles to commute,” said a senior airport official. On Sunday, 56 flights operated into and out of Kolkata, 10 less than what it was last Sunday but six more than Saturday. Airlines officials said the low flight count was owing to a steady dip in passenger load over the past 10 days with the state making negative RT-PCR report mandatory for incoming fliers. While some passengers had stayed the night over to avoid inconvenience, others began trickling in as early as 5.30am on Sunday, some over 10 hours before the scheduled flight time. Tapas Biswas, a resident of Tehatta was booked on an afternoon flight to catch but said left home at 2.30am and reached the airport by 5.30am. Another passenger, Abdul Halim Biswas, a resident of Nazirpur in Nadia, reached the airport 10 hours before his flight. Most passengers on Sunday had their own commute. For others, cops had arranged for some pre-paid taxis with “airport pre-paid service” stickers pasted on windshields. There were no AC buses. But passengers who booked app cabs complained of being fleeced.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/usual-sunday-at-airport-but-app-cabs-fleece-flyers/articleshow/82690144.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Kolkata||Grocers seek mid-week supply breather to stock up||Kolkata: Neighbourhood kirana stores faced a strange dilemma as the restrictions kicked in on Sunday. The new curbs have allowed them only enough time — between 7am and 10am — to sell but no time to replenish their stock. The wholesale markets, which are out of the ambit of the new restrictions, do not open before 10am. So even if they send the goods, the neighbourhood standalone store will be shut by then. “Throughout last afternoon, I tried to replenish my stock as much as possible so that I could sell the items to customers. But the stock will last for a couple of days. It is very difficult to sell things and place orders and receive goods,” said Amiya Ghosh of Tara Maa Stores at Barisha. As panic buying continued for a second successive day, the stocks flew off the shelves faster. “It would be of great help if the government allows a stocking window, when buying and selling will not take place at all. Some items like atta, maida, easy-to-cook noodles, biscuits, edible oil and butter just flew off the shelves within an hour,” said Anadi Chowrasia, an owner of a grocery store near Charu Market. Many shops tried to ration high demand-items. “I serve my neighbourhood. I receive a lot flak if certain items are not available for a longer period of time. I have to make everyone happy. I am rationing one piece or pack per customer for some items,” said Gautam Pal of Sidhheswari Bhandar in Behala Panchanantala. Another problem is the movement of goods vehicles that has been restricted since Sunday. Wholesalers TOI spoke to said there were only a handful of van rickshaws and small vehicles that were insufficient to cater to so many standalone stores. “Due to shortage of labourers and good vehicles, it will be difficult for us to send edibles to so many standalone shops. If small stores owners bring their own vehicles, it will be easier to replenish the stock,” said a flour wholesaler in Posta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/grocers-seek-mid-week-supply-breather-to-stock-up/articleshow/82690173.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Train passengers struggle at stations||Kolkata/Howrah: Long-distance train passengers at Howrah and Sealdah railway stations faced trouble on Sunday — the first day of enhanced restrictions — with only a few yellow cabs and app cabs operating from both complexes. Taxi drivers were seen charging a fortune as those travelling with families were bluntly told by drivers either to cough up excessive fares or deboard. With complaints mounting against yellow cabs, Howrah City police coordinated with the state transport department and arranged special buses to drop passengers to their destinations. Police also spoke to some regular pre-paid taxi owners and drivers and sent out the message that no taxis were being stopped for checking. "We managed to increase their numbers at Howrah station considerably by noon and the crisis ebbed by evening," claimed a Howrah City police officer. The situation was no different at Sealdah station. Nilanjan Basu, who wanted to travel to Behala from Sealdah station with his family, was asked to pay Rs 800. He ultimately bargained for Rs 500. Trips to Liluah or Pailan saw drivers charging between Rs 1,500-Rs 2,000. As the numbers of complaints increased, the Sealdah traffic guard arranged for 40 taxis between 7.30am to 8.30am with ACP Aloke Sanyal reaching the pre-paid booth and ensuring passengers were not fleeced by drivers. A senior police officer said they were in touch with the state transport department that informed them on Sunday that buses would be stationed outside Sealdah station to ferry passengers. Cops also called up union leaders of metered cab operators and asked them to keep pre-paid taxis available for passengers. By evening, cops diverted taxis from Burrabazar-Posta and even north Kolkata to pre-paid counters at Howrah and Sealdah.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/train-passengers-struggle-at-stations/articleshow/82690150.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: BJP settling scores with rural voters after losing polls, says Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav||LUCKNOW: Accusing the BJP of ‘failure to check the spread of Covid-19 infection in rural areas’, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday said the government is trying to settle scores with the village folks for supporting the SP in the recently concluded panchayat elections. He also attacked the government for recommending a power tariff hike of up to 12%, that too at a time when power consumers are struggling with their businesses and the common man is finding it hard to arrange two meals a day. “BJP is rattled by the manner in which the people in villages supported SP in panchayat polls and it seems the government is trying to find an opportunity in pandemic and settle scores with the voters,” Akhilesh said in a statement. He said BJP’s faulty policies and intent has brought the state and its economy to a standstill. People don’t have a source of livelihood, youth don’t have jobs, businessmen don’t have business and farmers are fighting Covid-19. The widespread misery and pain that has now engulfed the rural populace has led to resentment which is growing by the day, he said. Instead of extending relief, the government is all set to burden the middle-class with a hike in power tariff. This explains that the government is more concerned about the profits of a handful of industrialists and not even bothered about how common man and small traders will sustain their livelihood. “The state government and the power corporation want a regulatory surcharge on power consumers of all the categories. This will lead to an increase in cost of power by up to 12%,” he said. “It seems that the mantra of changing a crisis into an opportunity mooted by the BJP for industrialists may have been rejected by the people, it has been welcomed by the government with open arms,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-settling-scores-with-rural-voters-after-losing-polls/articleshow/82693624.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

Besides arranging for a public announcement system, strong steps will be taken to penalise defaulters for not wearing masks or maintaining social distancing. Arrangements at Covid hospitals, quarantine facilities, newly opened crematoriums and vaccination and testing centres were also discussed in the meeting. “We have increased the number of pyres from 230 to 603. We have also got 13 hearse vans and three new crematoriums at Inderpuri, Rohini Sector-26 and Panchkuian. During the meeting, their operation and maintenance were reviewed,” said Jai Prakash. “We have received approval for two more plants under the PM Cares Fund at Mrs Girdhari Lal Maternity Hospital and Kasturba Hospital. These plants will generate around 1,000-1,500 litres of oxygen per day,” said the mayor. East Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Nirmal Jain convened a separate meeting with the commissioner and other senior officials of the civic body. After the meeting, Jain said lodging arrangements were being made for doctors, nurses and para-medical staff on Covid duty at Swami Dayanand Hospital within the complex. The number of vaccination centres has been increased for those in the 18-44 years age group from 7 to 14, he added. Dr Mukesh Kumar, director-hospital administration, said that the number of vaccination centres had been increased from 23 to 30. The municipal corporation has finalised the recruitment of 30 junior resident doctors, two senior resident doctors and 60 auxiliary nursing midwives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/east-and-north-corpns-review-post-lockdown-arrangements/articleshow/82720527.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Lucknow||Nishad Party spreads its wings in west Uttar Pradesh||LUCKNOW: The Nishad Party, which has its influence confined to Purvanchal, is now gradually widening up its base in western UP districts. Bulandshahr, Baghpat, Pilibhit are a few districts where it has added new members to its fold. With eyes set on the Vidhan Sabha elections next year, the Nishad Party is fast emerging as a robust organization of committed workers. In an effort to raise the multi-level organizational unit, Nirbal Indian Shoshit Hamara Aam Dal (Nishad) party has given its cadre a target of enrolling at least 30,000 members in every vidhan sabha constituency. The party would contest elections only on those seats where this target will be met. “A membership drive which was launched after January 26 is still continuing. In some of the Vidhan Sabha constituencies we have enrolled 40,000 to 50,000 members,” said party president Sanjay Nishad. Now, the party workers have been given the target to make new members,” said party president Sanjay Nishad. The party has started screening of probable candidates for the assembly elections. The stronger contenders have been given the charge of raising the party's organization in their areas. “We have made it clear that at every booth the party should have at least 20 women and 20 youth as its members. We wish to win by reaching out to women and youth,” said the party president. To make the management and execution of party activities easier the party has divided the state into five parts -- four of its already existing ‘prants’ — Eklavya, Hiranyakashyap, Nishadraj and Goraksh prant — and a new one Rajdhani prant to specifically focus on Lucknow. A separate IT cell has been created to not let physical restrictions limit the reach of the party. IT cell heads have been appointed in districts and zones. “In at least 520 blocks we have appointed IT cell heads,” said Sanjay Nishad. The IT cell’s role becomes prominent in spreading the ideology of the party when people-to-people contact has been restricted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/nishad-party-spreads-its-wings-in-west-up/articleshow/82693650.cms||Neha Shukla

Officials said a project is on the anvil which will help thousands of students enrolled in state government-run degree colleges and universities across the state access online classes on a single platform. According to state higher education minister Dhan Singh Rawat, the decision has been taken to make sure that the quality of education doesn’t get compromised and students are well prepared for their semester exams. He further said that the students should not get complacent and continue with their exam preparation. Recently, Rawat held a meeting with the vice-chancellors of different Uttarakhand universities and officials of the state higher education department, in which it was decided that the state will observe the Covid-19 situation and will take a call on holding the offline semester-end examinations in the coming months. If the Covid-19 situation is stable in Uttarakhand, then, the department will hold offline exams in the coming months. Meanwhile, due to the rising Covid-19 cases in the state, the state higher education department will remain closed till May 18 and all staffers will be working from home. The order is not valid for the fourth-class employees of the department as they have to be present at the directorate as per their roster.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/state-mulls-single-online-learning-platform-for-all-colleges/articleshow/82699595.cms||Mohammad Anab

Residents claim that even after uploading all the necessary details, it is taking them 15-20 days to get the certificate generated. The civic body has, however, denied it. MK Gupta, president of GK-I S block RWA, forwarded the letter to SDMC commissioner Gyanesh Bharti on Monday. “The problem is that without a death certificate, relatives can’t access the bank account, lockers, insurance policy or other things of the deceased person. Someone who is not tech-savvy or educated will face even more problems in unloading details and understanding the system. Grieving families should not be made to face all these hassles. It is better if some alternative arrangements are made,” said Gupta. “In my area, 25 people have died in the past 45 days and most of them faced issues in getting the certificate issued,” he said further. SDMC officials, however, denied these allegations and said that the department was taking not more than 2-3 days for issuing the death certificate and daily monitoring was being done to review the exercise. “It barely takes 2-3 days if the person has applied properly and submitted all documents,” said an official. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/online-death-certificates-its-a-struggle/articleshow/82720596.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

While the Thane civic body intends to purchase five lakh vaccine doses in the coming days, the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) wants to procure at least four lakh doses of Covid vaccines directly from manufacturers across the world. In Thane, the announcement was made by commissioner Dr Vipin Sharma on Sunday, following directives by guardian minister Eknath Shinde who emphasised the need for broadening the vaccination drive in not just the city but the entire district. Mayor Naresh Mhaske said the vaccine purchased by floating global tenders will help the corporation widen the ambit of the vaccination drive. “We have already delivered over three lakh doses and covered over two lakh residents, including frontline and healthcare workers and senior citizens and those in the 45 plus age group,” Mhaske said. “We are preparing for the third wave, and immunising the residents ahead of it will help us stay in control. We have issued directions to the health department to float the tenders soon,” added Dr Sharma. Meanwhile, the Thane civic body has identified and finalised nearly 85 private hospitals operating in the city to deliver the vaccine shots after tying up with housing societies and commercial units. A prominent corporate house has already delivered nearly 2,200 doses after aligning with a private hospital, said a municipal official. “We have chalked out plans to fight a possible third wave that may hit the region any time in the next few months. Vaccination is a vital tool to minimise the damage in the coming days, though the number of fresh cases are diminishing gradually. We have decided to float the global tender for procurement of the vaccines due to delays in getting the vaccines from government sources and further prolonging will not be affordable,” said NMMC commissioner Abhijit Bangar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/now-thane-navi-mumbai-too-float-global-tenders-for-vaccine/articleshow/82696650.cms||---

---||Delhi||Covid-19: Positivity rate at 10.4% in Delhi, deaths still high at 262 in last 24 hours||NEW DELHI: The capital on Sunday recorded 6,456 new Covid-19 cases while the positivity rate dipped further to 10.40%, the lowest in a month and a half. The number of Covid-19 fatalities, however, remained high at 262. The number of new cases recorded in the last 24 hours was marginally higher than Saturday’s 6,430 cases, but the Sunday count was also from a higher number of tests — 62,059 — compared with 56,811 tests a day before. The positivity rate was 11.32% on Saturday. The last time the positivity rate in Delhi was lower than Sunday’s was on April 11, when the capital saw 10,774 fresh cases from 1,14,288 tests, with a positivity rate of 9.43%. After reaching a high of 36% on April 24, it has been steadily declining, along with Covid-19 cases. Sunday is the fourth day in a row that the figure stayed below 15% and the seventh that it is lower than 20%. The consistent dip in cases has resulted in 10,818 vacant hospital beds, including 8,687 oxygenated ones, out of a total of 27,571 Covid-19 beds as on Sunday at 10pm, as per Delhi government’s online Corona dashboard. The number of available ICU beds was 727 out of 6,485. As per Delhi government’s figures, the dip in cases has also meant that the number of patients being discharged from hospitals is increasing every day in proportion to new admissions. For instance, while Friday saw 1,256 admissions, the number of discharged patients was 1,331. On Saturday, the number of patients who were discharged was even higher at 1,379, while new admissions dipped to 1,052. With 9,706 patients recovering on Sunday, the number of active cases stood at 62,783, compared with 66,295 on Saturday. Of them, 39,211 — 62.4% — patients are recuperating in home isolation. With more people recovering from the disease every day than the daily new cases, the number of active cases has dipped by 37% from the all-time high number of 99,725 reported on April 29. In the last 24 hours, 62,059 tests were carried out, including 45,094 RT-PCR and 16,965 rapid antigen tests. With 262 Covid-19 fatalities recorded on Sunday, the toll now stands at 21,506 with a fatality rate of 1.5%. In May, 5,359 people have died.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/positivity-rate-at-10-4-deaths-still-high-at-262-in-last-24-hours/articleshow/82692033.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Shooter used Turkey-made pistol to kill dons inside jail||LUCKNOW: Investigators looking into the sensational shootout inside Chitrakoot jail have found that sharpshooter Anshu Dixit used a 9mm Turkey-made Zigana F pistol to eliminate criminals Muqeem Kala and Merajuddin on Friday morning. According to experts, Dixit fired 15 rounds from his Zigana F pistol, manufactured by TSA (Trabzon Silah Sanayi A),), a Turkish firearm manufacturing company. Police and jail department are investigating how Dixit managed to procure the firearm inside the high-security prison. A senior officer privy to the investigation said, “Initially, we thought it was a country-made 9mm pistol but when it was sent for examination of ballistic striations, its measurement and steel and chrome body left the experts surprised.” It surfaced that Dixit fired at least 15 rounds and any country-made pistol, even those manufactured in Munger (Bihar) and Khandwa in Madhya Pradesh, could not hold so many rounds of fire. “Wear and tear begins in country-made pistols after 4-5 rounds are fired and cartridges get stuck in the nozzle,” a ballistic expert said. Dixit’s post-mortem report also did not show any burns on his index finger suggesting that the firearm was safe to use. SP, Chitrakoot, Ankit Mittal, told TOI that he had come to know that the readings on the pistol suggest that it was imported and added that the matter was being investigated. “Other jail inmates will also be questioned soon,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/shooter-used-turkey-madepistol-to-kill-dons-inside-jail/articleshow/82693708.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Murder convict on parole gives Pune police the slip||LUCKNOW: A murder convict, who was on parole for his daughter’s marriage in a Sultanpur village, managed to give police the slip on Sunday. Identified as Ved Prakash Singh (51), the man was convicted for life in a murder case in Pune. He was escorted to Sultanpur by the Maharashtra police. SP Sultanpur, Vipin Mishra, told TOI that Ved was a native of Anchalgolwara Pakhrawli village under the Dehat police station of the district. “Ved was shifted to Mumbai in early 90s where he was engaged with a dairy related business. In 1994, he had committed a murder there and was sentenced to life imprisonment,” Mishra said, adding that in 2001 Ved managed to escape from prison. After about eight years in 2019 he was nabbed from his ancestral village here by the Maharashtra police. Later, he was lodged in Yerwada prison in Pune. The SP said that on April 30 Ved had sought 10-day parole to attend his daughter’s marriage in his ancestral village which was granted to him. “On May 10, a sub-inspector and two constables of Pune police escorted Ved from Yerwada jail to his village. They reached the village the next day,” the SP added. Sub-inspector Sachin Nimbalkar, who had escorted Ved from Pune jail, said that on reaching his house in the village they had ordered Ved’s relatives to lock him in a room. “On May 15, when the police went to open the lock Ved was not there. He had fled from the room after breaking a window grill,” Nimbalkar said. The SI said that they tried to trace the murder convict but he could not be spotted anywhere. The SP said that an FIR was lodged in this connection and efforts were on to nab the convict.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/murder-convict-on-parole-gives-pune-police-the-slip/articleshow/82693721.cms||---
---||Kolkata||On opening day of ‘blanket restrictions’, Kolkata locks itself in||KOLKATA: The city locked itself in for most part of Sunday with a few stepping out on streets amid the enhanced restrictions. Barring the three hours in the morning — 7 am to 10 am, when some markets witnessed excessive crowding — the rest of the day was witness to empty roads. Public transport mostly stayed off the roads. The day also saw several cases of mask violations. A total of 344 persons were hauled up for not wearing masks. On Saturday, this figure stood at 157. However, this figure was 186 on Friday, 194 on Thursday and 191 on Wednesday. The previous Sunday (May 9) witnessed 176 such violations. Lalbazar, though, believes the real challenge will begin on Monday with several more emergency and essential service workers along with those wanting their vaccine hitting the roads and the cops tasked with the responsibility of identifying the freeloaders. Cops set up at least 30 nakas at different points of the city. A list of 56 markets have been drawn up that will see extended police presence, Several two-wheeler and four wheeler riders were asked to return. Only those on essential services, those going for vaccination and other health emergencies and those headed for stations and airports were allowed. Till 8pm on Sunday, cops arrested as many as 104 persons and seized 117 vehicles for flouting restriction norms. Near the second Hooghly Bridge and the Howrah Bridge, nearly every vehicle entering Kolkata was checked in the morning. The cops who hit the streets to implement the restrictions said that in general, the compliance was one of the highest. “We hardly found two-wheeler or four-wheeler riders out without a reason. At important nakas like Hazra crossing, we kept officers from two police stations and one guard. In addition, we spent a lot of time to shut markets on time and ask people in certain slum dwellings to stay indoors,” explained an OC from a south Kolkata police station. Lalbazar has prepared itself for the special night restrictions too. “Besides the health sector workers, the ATM workers will be allowed along with other essential service providers. But no others will be allowed on the roads. For that, we are putting four different patrols at night between 9pm and 1am. Two police vehicles and two teams on bikes will be patrolling the lanes and bylanes. We have carried extensive miking throughout the day. Hence, those who have no business on the road will be prosecuted,” said an officer. However, cops faced their real challenge implementing the social distancing at public spots in the pockets of Beniapukur, Topsia and Park Circus-Taltala, forcing Kolkata police to indulge in a cat and mouse game. “Though there is no restriction on individual movement, we are trying to implement social distancing too,” said a senior cop at Lalbazar. Police sources said that with almost all senior officers, on the roads to take stock of the situation, Lalbazar is likely to deploy a section of its elite combat battalion to “bring discipline in some chosen zones.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/on-opening-day-of-blanket-restrictions-city-locks-itself-in/articleshow/82692027.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Nagpur||Fewer people travelling to Pune as compared to returnees||Nagpur: The state government’s decision to impose lockdown-like restrictions following increase in Covid-19 cases has led to an exodus of people, who may be migrants and families from other states settled in Pune, the second-largest metropolitan city in Maharashtra. The trend may continue with the government extending the curbs till June 1. Data obtained from the railways for the two special trains 01039-01040 Gondia-Kolhapur-Gondia Express & 02279-02280 Howrah-Pune-Howrah Express which are operating daily shows that while occupancy in these trains from the Pune direction is 114% and 96% respectively, the same is 59% and 62% for trains going towards Pune. This means that fewer people are travelling to Pune than those returning. Data from May 1 to 12, shows that only 13,662 passengers travelled from Gondia-Nagpur to Pune-Kolhapur, which is 1,138 per day. On the other hand, 17,429 passengers returned from Pune, which comes to 1,452 passengers per day. For return journey from Kolhapur, the train occupancy was 96% while occupancy towards Gondia-Kolhapur was just 59%, indicating few passengers are travelling to Pune while those returning are more. The number of passengers (21,965) booking tickets from Pune and cancelling (4,536) them, perhaps due to non-availability of berths, is also more. Similar is the situation with 02279 Pune-Howrah Express. During these 12 days, 22,291 passengers travelled from Pune (1,857 per day), while 13,097 travelled to Pune (1,091 per day). The occupancy in the Howrah-Pune train was 62% and Pune-Howrah 114%. In these 12 days, 36,710 passengers booked tickets and 14,419 cancelled as berths may not be available. “Lack of occupancy is one of the prime reasons to cancel trains. Barring these two trains, all have been cancelled. The rush from the Pune side may be because many workers from West Bengal and Odisha are returning as lockdown-like restrictions were extended. Secondly, due to educational institutes and the IT sector offering work from home (WFH), there is no rush in trains to Pune,” said Central Railway officials. Official said in case of Kolhapur-Gondia Express, most of the passengers are travelling to roadside stations in Vidarbha, maybe for emergency reasons only. Most people are not travelling due to mandatory RT-PCR reports too. Any decision on restarting trains is taken by the headquarters, they said. However, taking advantage of the limited number of trains, private bus operators from Pune are resorting to manipulation and exploiting passengers. “As the operators are not getting sufficient numbers, spillover passengers of two buses are also being accommodated in one bus causing inconvenience to others. These operators are also paying fine when countered by authorities,” said a section of passengers. “Like the limited number of trains, private buses are also operating with minimum numbers. It is possible some operators may be violating norms but these must be from outside Maharashtra and may be ferrying migrants. Owing to cost-benefit ratio, it is not feasible to run another bus for a few additional passengers,” said a section of bus operators from the city who have stopped plying their buses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fewer-people-travelling-to-pune-as-compared-to-returnees/articleshow/82692039.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

I feel the restrictions should continue for some more time. Even if the state government does not extend the same, panchayats in Calangute will extend the restrictions. I think all panchayats should do the same,” he said. He said the panchayats in his constituency were the first to implement restrictions on the movement of people and close down all non-essential activities in late April following a surge in Covid-19 cases. “It was only after this that other panchayats and the government announced lockdowns and curfew,” he said. Lobo said all panchayats should ensure that the people don’t go to the primary or community health centres to get themselves vaccinated because people also go there to get tested for Covid, so there’s a risk of infection. “There has to be separate vaccination centres. There are many primary and other schools in villages which can be converted into vaccination centres,” he said. “We have to get all youth vaccinated to win the war against Covid-19. The vaccination programme is going to go on for some more months because the second dose has to be given after 80 days and there are many youths,” Lobo said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-should-extend-curfew-says-lobo/articleshow/82671663.cms||---

An NGO working for the welfare and empowerment of the elderly has revealed that 82.4% of the respondents complained about anxiety due to rising Covid-19 cases and casualties around them over the past month. Agewell Foundation, an NGO working since 1999, interacted with around 5,000 elderly people through its helpline and found them battling anxiety, sleeplessness, panic attacks, depression, irritation, stress, nightmares, feeling of emptiness, fear of contracting Covid-19 and loss of appetite. An analysis of its data shows that 70.2% of the elderly had been suffering from sleeplessness, insomnia and nightmares due to poor quality of sleep. During the past month, 63% of them had also developed symptoms of depression due to loneliness and social isolation. Further, 63.3% of the respondents complained of unceasing stress during the pandemic. Over half (55%) the elderly said they felt weak due to change in lifestyles, restrictions and other factors. At the same time, 52.2% were suffering from loss of appetite. An NGO official said that in view of the current surge in Covid-19 cases across the country and a huge burden on the healthcare system, older people were afraid of the consequences in case they contracted the disease. They seem worried about getting a bed and proper treatment in hospital if they or their family members ever need it. During lockdowns and Covid-19-induced restrictions, social isolation or social distancing of the elderly is termed as a serious public health concern due to their bio-psychosocial vulnerabilities, which is a major cause of loneliness, particularly for those who are living alone or forced to live alone without family support and care. Himanshu Rath, founder of Agewell Foundation, said, “During the second wave of cases in the pandemic, there was an overall 50% rise in the number of older people seeking counselling for psychological issues like depression, anxiety, sleeplessness, fear, stress, sense of loneliness or isolation, etc.” He added, “Most older people, despite having access to resources, are finding themselves helpless and vulnerable in the situation. It has devastated their peace of mind and life. They need urgent help in the form of counselling, useful tips, and information, healthcare as well as emotional support.” In most families, Rath said, older people are pushed to a corner by their own family members as they are no longer allowed to look after or interact with their grandchildren, no visitors are welcome and their involvement in daily household activities are minimal. The official said that the elderly people also seemed concerned about the future of their children and grandchildren. Seeing them idle at home deprived of social lives or outdoor activities makes the elderly feel more helpless. The pandemic has posed many challenges such as non-availability of domestic help, difficulty and fear in accessing healthcare facilities, loneliness due to lockdown, stigma in the family and society, even elderly abuse and abandonment, the NGO claims. The foundation said older people with mental health disorders and disabilities were more vulnerable during such a crisis. Due to poor health conditions and a fast decreasing immune system, they are more likely to get the infection, which leaves them neglected, even unattended in many cases, it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/seniors-press-panic-button-as-covid-anxiety-and-loneliness-take-a-toll/articleshow/82692127.cms||Pankhuri Yadav

Fortunately, no life was lost, nor any property damaged in the explosion, an official said. Reinforcement has been rushed to the spot and the area cordoned off to nab the attackers, he added. Meanwhile, J&K Police said that two sons of deceased Tehreek-e-Hurriyat chief Muhammad Ashraf Sehrai and four other people have been arrested for raising anti-national slogans during Sehrai’s funeral at Tikkipora in Kupwara last week. Sehrai (77) had died of Covid-19 under detention in Udhampur jail, Jammu. “Both sons of Late Sehrai & 4 others have been arrested for raising antinational slogans during funeral. But, they haven’t been booked under PSA. Please don’t spread rumours,” J&K Police tweeted on Sunday. Earlier, there were rumours on social media that Sehrai’s sons were arrested under the stringent Public Safety Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ied-blast-in-shopian-no-collateral-damage/articleshow/82696358.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||Mumbai||‘Black fungus’ operation: Maharashtra to train 100 ENT doctors||MUMBAI: Over 100 ENT surgeons across the state will be trained to perform debridement surgeries on mucormycosis patients who need aggressive operation to remove the fungal growth followed by antifungal treatment. In a bid to curb the rise in cases of ‘black fungus’, members of the state task force have also recommended the use of sterile water in the oxygen humidifier flasks used in ICUs and its frequent sterilisation to arrest any fungal growth. The growing problem of mucormycosis was discussed by CM Uddhav Thackeray and Covid taskforce members in a virtual conference attended by thousands of doctors across the state on Sunday. Thane-based ENT surgeon Dr Ashesh Bhumkar, who spoke at the event, has committed to help surgeons upskill to tackle the infection. Maharashtra has around 1,500-2,000 cases of the invasive fungal infection in Covid patients. “In a week’s time, we will have an army of ENT surgeons, who would know how to effectively operate on mucormycosis. The surgery is known to them, but it requires an aggressive approach,” said Dr Bhumkar. He urged the CM to ensure adequate supply of antifungal drug Amphotericin B. “Unlike Remdesivir, we know that Amphotericin B certainly cures mucormycosis. The debridement surgery is needed to remove the tissues killed by the fungus. Once that is done, physicians can carry on the treatment with antifungal drugs,” he said. The state has floated a tender for one lakh vials of the drug. Covid taskforce members also spoke about prevention and better hygiene measures in ICUs. Dr TP Lahane, head, Directorate of Medical Education and Research said the sterile water used in oxygen humidifier flasks that are used to deliver oxygen to patients must be changed daily. “Patients should also apply betadine to keep their nostrils clean and deter the fungus from entering,” he said. Intensivist Dr Rahul Pandit said the humidifier flask must be sterilised and replaced for every new patient. Taskforce member Dr Shashank Joshi said mucormycosis is a fallout of high sugar levels, elevated either because of Covid itself or the steroids prescribed, and a fall in immunity. With the rise in sugar levels, there is abundant iron in the blood for the fungus to feed upon. “Rationing the use of steroids can check such infections,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/black-fungus-op-state-to-train-100-ent-docs/articleshow/82693789.cms||Sumitra Debroy

In the first tender issued on May 7, the state government placed a condition of storing vaccines between 2 and 8 degree Celsius, which effectively put mRNA (messenger RNA) vaccines like Pfizer and Moderna out of the race as these need temperatures as low as minus 70 degree Celsius and minus 20 degree Celsius. Talking to TOI, state government spokesperson Siddhartnath Singh said, procurement of vaccines would be done as per Central guidelines. The state government spokesperson also scotched speculation about Chinese vaccine manufacturing firms being part of the bidding process. Representatives of Pfizer had attended the pre-bid meeting called by UP Medical Supplies Corporation (UPMSC) on May 12. Kishore Gupta of Pfizer urged the corporation to take a “suitable decision” in this regard. He also said his company’s proposal to supply vaccines to India is under consideration of the Centre. The meeting was also attended by representatives of Serum Institute of India (SII), Dr Reddy’s Lab (manufacturing Russia-made Sputnik), Zydus Cadila and Bharat Bio-tech. The SII representative said, the company was unable to participate in the bidding process as pending orders for vaccines were significantly high. As per the amended tender, seller of vaccines which require transportation and storage in sub-zero temperatures like -20 degree/ -70 degree/ -80 degree, will advise and facilitate transportation till the consignee place and enable safe storage till it’s dispatched to the vaccine administration outlet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-amends-global-vax-tender-pfizer-moderna-can-now-bid/articleshow/82693728.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Chandigarh||Covid restrictions in Punjab extended to May 31, this time with strict enforcement||CHANDIGARH: Taking note of the continuing high Covid positivity rate as well as the case fatality rate (CFR), Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Sunday ordered extension of all the existing curbs in the state up to May 31. He ordered strict enforcement of all the restrictions. Chairing the virtual Covid review meeting, Amarinder said the deputy commissioners will continue to determine opening of shops in a staggered manner and enforce other restrictions to check the spread of Covid, especially in rural areas. The deputy commissioners can also make suitable amendments based on local conditions as long as these do not dilute state’s overall restrictions. Amarinder also said while the restrictions so far had shown results, with some decline in day-on-day positivity and cases coming down from around 9,000 to 6,000 in this period, there was need to extend the same in view of the high positivity of 13.1% as of the May 9-15 period, with CFR standing at 2.4%. He also directed the district administrations to investigate complaints of fleecing of patients by some private hospitals, warning that these would be shut down if they continue to indulge in such practices. Such cases have to be strictly dealt with, he said, directing the police department to crack down on those found indulging in hoarding or black marketing of any Covid-related essentials or medicines. Amarinder was also concerned over the spread of the new fungal disorder (black fungus) associated with the Covid and underlined the need to increase surveillance for this disease and ensure that medicines to treat this disease are available with the state. These should be procured before there is panic for these medicines as well, he said. The chief minister also asked the health department to also re-examine the standard operating procedure (SOP) to see if there is anything that can be done to prevent this disease from occurring. Dr K K Talwar termed the fungal infections as a serious issue, which could be attributed to either high use of steroids or use of distilled water in oxygen. Addressing the issue of oxygen availability, Amarinder said while the state, through judicious measures had been able to prevent any mishap, the situation should be closely monitored by the health department. The state government had successfully arranged for PSA plants and oxygen concentrators to tackle oxygen shortages. The state was expecting over 2,500 oxygen concentrators on the ground within this month, he said. The chief minister also asked the deputy commissioners to ensure that food kits are delivered to those in quarantine, and complimented the director general of police (DGP) on the successful launch of the `Bhojan Helpline’. He also asked DGP Dinkar Gupta to ensure strict compliance of the restrictions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/covid-restrictions-in-punjab-extended-to-may-31-this-time-with-strict-enforcement/articleshow/82692068.cms||---

Interestingly, the panel has no representatives from the teachers’ fraternity, to which government teachers have objected. On Saturday, an order was issued by the state government stating that the district-level committee will look after the proper implementation of the New Education Policy in schools of Rajasthan. The nodal agency for that will be Shiksha Sankul in Jaipur. Although the nine-member panel is important from the implementation of NEP, keeping teachers away from this will not be beneficial. Rajasthan Primary and Secondary Government School Teachers Union vice-president Vipin Sharma said, “We know what is going on the ground and what policy can have a detrimental impact on the school as we are the ones implementing it. The government should make a member either from the teachers’ organisation or a teacher who has done some work in school education. This should have been done but they are not focusing on it.” Moreover, a portion of NEP has already been implemented. The policy says the concept of having separate Anganwadi for kindergarten should be done away with and from the nursery section to class XII, all the classes should be conducted on school premises. This has already been implemented in the Rajasthan schools by the state government recently. In many schools, Anganwadi is merged with schools. Teachers said the student-teacher ratio hasn’t improved as around 1 lakh posts are still vacant in the education department. Sharma said currently for primary classes till class V, two teachers and in upper primary, five teachers are provided. The gap in the teacher-student ratio has impacted the quality of education in schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-teachers-want-to-be-part-of-nep-panel/articleshow/82700500.cms||---

Congress, led by Mulug MLA D Anasuya (popularly known as Sitakka) and NSUI state president Balmoori Venkat staged a protest by submitting a request letter to the statue of Ambedkar at Liberty cross roads on Sunday, demanding that the state government also provide for free ambulance services to Covid-19 patients. Sitakka and Venkat said the poor did not even have money to cremate their their family members who had died of Covid-19. They demanded that the state government extend Rs 1,500 financial assistance to the poor, especially daily wage earners, who have gone without income during the ongoing 10-day lockdown. Stating that the pandemic has caused an unprecedented loss to the people on all fronts, Venkat demanded inclusion of Covid-19 treatment in Aarogyasri scheme and also free vaccination facility at home to all in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/free-cremation-for-covid-victims/articleshow/82692093.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Yogi Adityanath on whirlwind tour of Covid hotspots, visits 11 districts in 16 days||LUCKNOW: When chief minister Yogi Adityanath visited Noida, Meerut and Ghaziabad on Sunday to review measures in tackling the lethal run of Covid’s second wave, he notched up 11 visits to UP’s hot-spot districts in 16 days since emerging from self-quarantine. And he’s scheduled to tour two more districts — Muzaffarnagar and Saharanpur — on Monday after hitting the ground running with whirlwind tours of Moradabad, Bareilly, Gorakhpur, Aligarh, Agra, Mathura, Varanasi and Ayodhya after coming out of isolation on April 30. Officials said, the CM, in fact, managed to reach out to 38 districts through virtual review meetings while in quarantine after he contracted the virus a month ago. “I have been monitoring and taking stock of arrangements at the ground level to ensure preparedness. I will be continuing my visits to various districts,” Yogi said. The CM’s whistle-stop tours of Covid-hit districts followed a mammoth surge in cases with the tally touching 38,055 on April 24. The state government scrambled to flatten the soaring graph by enforcing a partial lockdown and ratcheting up preventive measures amid reports of a virus spread in rural areas after panchayat elections, sources said. A senior official in the chief minister’s office said, CM Yogi held at least three video-conference meets with district magistrates and chief medical officers and presided over two cabinet meetings virtually during his isolation period. Yogi’s statewide tour was marked by his first-ever visit to Aligarh Muslim University, where several faculty members had succumbed to the virus. The CM not only pitched for vaccination of AMU professors, but also asked district authorities to ramp up coordination through integrated command and control centres. “The CM has been issuing strict directions to curb black marketing of life-saving medicines and oxygen,” a senior official said. He said, the government has largely focussed on increasing number of beds in hospitals and scaling up contact tracing. Experts said, Yogi essentially faces the challenge of making the existing healthcare system work to meet the crisis. “Enforcement of CM’s directions at the grassroots is crucial in controlling the pandemic at this point of time,” a senior official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogi-on-whirlwind-tour-of-covid-hotspots-visits-1-1-dists-in-16-days/articleshow/82693732.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Nagpur||Girl plotted grandma’s murder to grab her retirement benefit cash, gold||NAGPUR: A teenage girl and her lover roped in four friends to murder her 62-year-old grandmother last week, so they could lay their hands on Rs 15-20 lakh cash she had got as retirement benefit and some gold. Police cracked the murder of Vijaya Tiwalkar and nabbed four of the six youths involved in the crime. MIDC police arrested four persons; Nilesh Paunikar, Qadir Khan alias Baba, Farid Zakhir Ansari and Mohd Qamre Alam, for stabbing Tiwalkar to death. The masterminds, victim’s granddaughter and her boyfriend, are still on the run. Tiwalkar, who retired as a cook with State Reserve Police Force (SRPF), had got her job on compassionate grounds after the death of her husband. Her granddaughter hatched a plot with her boyfriend to steal Tiwalkar’s cash and gold. The couple roped in their friends to execute it. City police chief Amitesh Kumar said it was unthinkable a teenager would plan to eliminate her grandmother for money and valuables. “The masterminds will be nabbed soon,” he said, adding, “The gang had no prior criminal record.” After reaching Tiwalkar’s place shortly before midnight, the granddaughter had kept her boyfriend waiting outside the house. The four others were waiting somewhere else. After the granddaughter signalled her friends, Paunikar, Ansari and Alam sneaked into the house from the rear side. The senior citizen happened to see the unidentified persons entering the premises. As she raised an alarm, Paunikar, Ansari and Alam pounced upon her. Tiwalkar tried to fight back, but her granddaughter pinned her down. She held her legs while the three accomplices throttled her with a pillow. As they could not control Tiwalkar, the granddaughter asked Paunikar to slash the victim’s neck. The four had then rummaged through the place for the cash and gold, but it’s learnt they could manage to find only some cash and a couple of ornaments before fleeing the place. The gang had got around Rs2,300 from the granddaughter and her boyfriend before fleeing. MIDC police team led by senior inspector Hande, inspector Dinesh Labde, Asst PI Rajesh Hattigote picked up the suspects for questioning from Gulshan Nagar with the help of Kalamna police under supervision of Zonal DCP Noorul Hassan. MIDC police team comprising assistant sub-inspector Ashish Dubye, Yogesh Bahadure and Vijay Kale managed to zero down upon the four from a desolate place at Gulshan Nagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/girl-plotted-grandmas-murder-to-grab-her-retirement-benefit-cash-gold/articleshow/82692110.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Mumbai||Help reduce fatality rate, Maharashtra CM urges family doctors||MUMBAI: Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray along with members of the state task force on Sunday interacted with family physicians and appealed to them to become ‘Mazha Doctor’ in the fight against Covid-19. In a two-hour interaction, the chief minister urged doctors from various branches of medicine, including allopathy, homeopathy and ayurveda to provide patients guidance and support.  Addressing nearly 17,500 family physicians in the first of its kind initiative in the country, Thackeray said family physicians are usually aware of the medical history of each member of the family hence they could play a critical role. “As family doctor, he/she should guide the patient, monitor oxygen levels, status of comorbidity and advise if there’s a need for hospitalisation. This will help reduce case fatality rate in the state,” said Thackeray. Maharashtra’s case fatality rate was 1.5% as on Saturday.  Anticipating the third wave of Covid and the threat to children, the CM said the state has set up a separate task force of paediatricians that will also interact with family physicians soon. The meeting was attended by task force members Dr Sanjay Oak, Dr Shashank Joshi, Dr Tatyarao Lahane, Dr Rahul Pandit and Dr Ashesh Bhumkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-help-reduce-fatality-rate-uddhav-urges-family-docs/articleshow/82693755.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

This deadly fungal infection is afflicting those who have recovered from Covid infection. Doctors believe that high doses of steroids administered during Covid treatment has made patients susceptible to black fungus post Covid recovery, specially those with uncontrolled diabetes. Sudheer Kumar Garg, Bareilly chief medical officer, has written a letter to IMA to ensure that information about all such cases is immediately shared with the health department. So far, three patients from Bareilly district and one each from Shahjahanpur, Farrukhabad and Pilibhit district have been detected with mucormycosis. They have all come to Bareilly for treatment. Dr Garg told TOI, “The black fungus cases are now being reported every day as people are getting aware about the fungal infection. It attacks the paranasal sinus and spreads towards the eye and brain. Most of the affected patients have been found to suffer from uncontrolled diabetes. If it is detected at an early stage, which is happening in many cases, treatment can be started. Since Bareilly is a centre and patients from nearby districts and Uttarakhand come here for advanced treatment, it is highly likely that the number of cases will increase in the days to come.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/six-cases-of-black-fungus-surface-in-bareilly/articleshow/82688370.cms||---

Two of the city’s biggest temples, Kalighat and Dakshineswar have announced their closure in keeping with the government order. However, Kalighat sevayats have told devotees that they can turn to the official fund of the temple and transfer donations online. Dakshineswar is yet to start any online transactions yet. Even after the partial restrictions had come into force from the beginning of the month, the temples had followed their original timings that had come into effect after they reopened last year. They had earlier pointed out that since temples had not been specifically asked to follow any restrictions, they were waiting for further orders. Now with the new set of restrictions having come in, a complete closure was required, they said. “We appeal to all to send in their offerings by fund transfer. This will be used for the daily puja of the deity, which will go on as usual. There are many who mandatorily visit the temples on birthdays and other occasions to offer their pujas. Since this cannot be immediately done, a fund transfer should help them,” said Dipankar Chatterjee, secretary of the committee of Sevayats. Devotees can also come up to the gate and hand over sarees and other offerings to the sevayats, who would take these inside to offer to the deities. “Morning arati, afternoon bhog and evening arati will go on without visitors but the offerings can always be carried out by us,” he said. Dakshineswar Temple is going in through a process of restoration and the shutdown will hit it hard, said temple trustees. “We have not thought of any online fund transfers as of now. The temple will be absolutely shut for devotees and no one will be able to send in any offerings. However, we will continue with our daily pujas of the deity,” said Kushal Chowdhury, a trustee member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kalighat-dakshineswar-shut-gates-to-devotees/articleshow/82692095.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

Now, it will not be easy for developers in the state to not construct houses for the EWS and LIG in their schemes. As per the township policy rules, builders or developers launching a group housing scheme or high-rises must construct houses for EWS and LIG categories. Till date, no project has been cancelled and developers who have defaulted have not initiated construction. Sources said, developers had shown apprehension to construct houses for the poor on premium land and in schemes. Following this, relaxation was provided to construct houses for EWS and LIG category on some other project land. However, many have not adhered to the policy. After the new rules, developers cannot construct EWS and LIG houses at distant locations. An official said, the civic body provides relaxation in land conversion, building map approval and other charges to developers for constructing houses for EWS and LIG category. In return, the private builders have to develop schemes and invite applications through lottery in the presence of representatives of local bodies. “If a developer was constructing apartments in a posh locality, then he would provide houses to EWS and LIG sections in far-flung areas. However, as per new rules, it would be mandatory to provide houses in 800 metre periphery of the main project,” said the official. After receiving several complaints, the Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) also constituted a panel of chartered accountants to audit the houses and plots constructed under various provisions of the Chief Minister Jan Awaas Yojana. The zone commissioners were directed to monitor the houses and plots constructed under the scheme. Strict rules were framed after it was observed that many developers are not constructing houses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/udh-fixes-norms-to-ensure-houses-for-poor/articleshow/82692091.cms||---

The current damaged electrical appliances like fans, refrigerator, cooler, mobile phones on charger and lights. As the high-voltage current passed through electric wires damaging electrical equipment, people ran out of their houses. Mohammed Rafiq was reading a newspaper outside his house heard the cries of his relative who was stuck with the refrigerator. “Rafiq’s sister-in-law Shipa Begum, who came running to rescue the child, suffered a jolt and also got stuck with the fridge. Rafiq gathered courage and tried to unplug the fridge wire and received a major jolt which threw him to the ground. He was rushed to a hospital and was declared brought dead,” said police. The other injured in his family are out of danger in a local hospital. Another injured Mohammed Shahid, whose room was close to the transformer, said that he could see fire in it. “When I heard a loud bang from the transformer, I realised it was the time to run for cover. I lifted by two toddlers and threw them out of the room to save from the current which damaged our ceiling fan,” said Shahid. The sense of fear was so high that no one was ready to enter their houses to collect the belongings. Police said fire did not erupt else a major tragedy could have happened in the area. The power department has ordered an inquiry into how the transformer caught fire which led to the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/high-voltage-current-kills-1-damages-several-equipmen/articleshow/82692121.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||City group develops low-cost portable ventilator||Nagpur: City research group Satej Medinnova has developed a comprehensive non-invasive portable ventilator that can serve people especially in developing countries. Named PranaSetu, the ventilator is affordable, easy-to-operate, and has oxygen-use-efficiency features. It is a three-in-one device having continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), and high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) with integrated humidifier. Priced at 2.9 lakh, the group led by physician and paediatrician Dr Satish Deopujari has also initiated a drive seeking community support to donate these ventilators to hospitals and institutes in need. Satej is a group doctors, engineers, entrepreneurs born out of the Covid-19 exigency and includes Tejas Kshatriya, Abhay Santoshwar, Mukund Deshmukh, Ashutosh Gawande, and Latesh Agrawal besides Dr Deopujari. It aimed for a user-friendly device that can be put to immediate use during ongoing pandemic, which has seen a huge rise in patients needing respiratory support and a scarcity of skilled hands to treat them. The product is focused on delivering the necessary support to the patient without demanding huge oxygen supply or highly trained doctors. Being non-invasive, it averts complications and the available manpower can focus on more patients thus improving the outcome. Through PranaSetu, CPAP can be delivered to the patient with vented masks, which is easy to wear. This is the first device to provide CPAP, BIPAP, HFNC with ‘Oxysave’ algorithm and has features and alarms normally available with a high-end ventilator. Dr Deopujari said, “PranaSetu could avert complications among Covid-19 or other patients with respiratory problems while achieving oxygen-use efficiency because of its non-invasive feature. Our tests yielded promising results – it used as much as 60% less oxygen while achieving the same efficiency that any good ventilator will,” the veteran pediatrician, who is also an adjunct professor at several regional engineering institutes and Indian Institutes of Technology, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/city-group-develops-low-cost-portable-ventilator/articleshow/82692163.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Mumbai||BMC vaccination centres on cyclone holiday today||MUMBAI: In response to the warning about cyclone Tauktae, the BMC on Sunday cancelled the vaccination drive for Monday at all public centres. The three-day walk-in-only drive of the BMC will now commence on Tuesday and continue till Thursday. Senior citizens and differently-abled persons may walk in for the first dose of Covishield on these three days. On Friday and Saturday, vaccination will be with online appointments only. Owing to the new directions from the Centre to increase the gap between two doses of Covishield to 12 to 16 weeks, municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal said only healthcare and frontline workers now qualify for the second dose of Covishield since their vaccination had started on January 16 and February 3, respectively. People from these two categories may even take the walk-in route for their second dose, said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. For people above 60 years of age and people between 45 and 59 years of age with co-morbidities, vaccination had started on March 1, so the earliest they qualify for the second dose is after Sunday, May 23. The Centre issued a new guideline on Sunday that if any Covishield recipient had already booked an appointment for the second dose, he should be allowed to take the vaccine even if the period of 84 days has not been completed. “It is reiterated that the online appointments booked for the second dose of Covishield prior to the change (in dosage interval), must be honoured … [T]hey must not be turned away,” a letter issued by Vikas Sheel, additional chief secretary, Union health ministry, said. More than 21 lakh people over 45 years of age in the city, which is over 65% of this population, have taken at least one dose of the vaccine. Fewer than 20% have taken the second dose.

I salute the endeavour of engineers & all the workers,” he said in the tweet. As per the online Corona Beds dashboard of the Delhi government, 250 beds each were operational at both the Covid facilities that are annexed to GTB and LNJP hospitals and have come up at the Ramlila Ground next to GTB and Delhi’s main Ramlila Ground close to LNJP hospital.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Social media backs Gorai youth’s fight against housing society, wins him ‘Oscar’||MUMBAI: A Gorai-based resident, Bhagyesh Sawant, recently received a letter from his housing society that he cannot keep a pet in his flat as per rules and will also have to pay a fine for violation. Sawant, who absolutely adores his 10-month-old Shih Tzu pet dog Oscar, said there was no way he was going to part with his pet or pay any penalty since it is legal to keep pets in the house. The face-off over the pet ended on a happy note, though, when the housing society formally took back its letter written to Sawant on Friday evening after a few animal lovers raised this issue on social networking sites. “I’m happy and thankful to all those who supported my case on social networking sites. I also thank my society, Gorai Chand Ganga CHS, for revoking its earlier decision against keeping a pet. I was verbally told that I will have to pay a fine of Rs 5000; however, it has been peacefully resolved for now,” said Sawant. City-based animal activist, Madhu Chanda, and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA India), were among those who had shown concern on this issue on Twitter and other sites. When TOI contacted the society secretary, Nagendra Kaginkar, he said, “We have no problem if the residents keep pets in their houses. However, we have noticed that some common areas, like lift etc., become dirty when pets are taken out. But we have now taken back the letter issued to Sawant.” Sawant responded by saying that he always ensures that the society premises remain clean when he takes Oscar out for a walk. Meanwhile, district animal welfare officer of AWBI, Mitesh Jain, commented, “Many animal feeders in other places are harassed by animal haters in certain societies over trivial issues. One Powai-based animal feeder, Madhavi Desai, has been slapped with Rs 20,000 penalty by her society for ‘littering’. The society has conveniently not mentioned her animal welfare activities as a reason because they know that animal activists will then come to her defence. I request all societies to show compassion for all animals and animal activists, especially during the current tough situation of the pandemic.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-social-media-backs-gorai-youths-fight-against-hsg-society-wins-him-oscar/articleshow/82692207.cms||Vijay Singh

Credai West Bengal president Sushil Mohta pointed out that the construction industry mostly hires daily wages workers who are employed by subcontractors on a ‘work and pay’ basis. In other words, if there is no work going on, these workers are not paid by the contractors. “We, therefore, request you to allow the 50% of the usual workforce to work on the construction sites, where they are staying. Many of our members who have started foundation or basement work, it is important for them to come above the ground level otherwise, during the monsoon there is always a risk of earth movement, which can cause damage to neighbouring structures,” Mohta wrote in a letter sent to the chief secretary. Credai has requested the state authority to allow movement of essential construction materials, such as, sand, stone chips, cement and ready-mix concrete within the state.

The incident took place at Bhupalsagar town recently when Ankit, son of Kishan Taunk, tested positive and was quarantined for 14 days. However, before the quarantine period got over, Ankit got the RTPCR done again and his report came negative. On getting the negative report, the groom and his two relatives went to Pratapgarh’s Manpura village in Chhoti Sadri tehsil for wedding without apprising the authorities or the health department. When the officials came to know about it, SDM Sukharam Pindwal, tehsildar and BDO went to the groom’s home and told the family members to pay Rs 1 lakh penalty for violation of norms. As the family expressed inability to arrange the sum, the authorities lodged a police complaint. The officials said even if the groom’s report is negative, one has to still abide by quarantine norms and cannot come out of the house before 14 days. College owner violate quarantine protocol A college owner breached Covid protocol and met the collector for donating funds to help Covid patients.

Of the 80, five were frontline workers (FLWs) though the initiative is exclusively for elderly citizens, considering their comfort. Sunday’s turnout was the lowest as yet, even though the drive was on the full day, while 105 had been jabbed despite limited vaccination hours on the inaugural day on Friday. NMC had set a target of 100 jabs each at the two parking lots, at Glocal Mall and Trillium Mall. The lukewarm response left the civic administration contemplating if the drive-in can be opened up for 45+ category too. Officials were clueless about the continued poor response to the drive-in programme, which was expected to draw huge crowds as seen at regular centres in March, when elderly citizens first became eligible for the jab. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B told TOI, “We will see if the drive-in facility can be offered to other beneficiary groups. It might a Sunday effect, and citizens assuming it would be a holiday for inoculation too,” he said. NMC officials said there is also a lot of confusion among beneficiaries. The frequent policy revision and suspension of drive for 18-44 years category in the state has left other beneficiaries in a dilemma. The overall turnout at other 97 centres too was abysmal. Only 5,697 took the jab as against a target of 9,700. On Saturday, NMC had resumed first dose for 45+ category, taking the day’s figures to over 14,000. In a press release, the civic body said first and second dose for 45+ group would continue on Monday as well. But 12-week gap, as mandated by the health ministry, is necessary for the second dose, it stated. The civic chief said those who had booked their schedule will be allowed to take the second dose. “Walk-in for second dose won’t be allowed unless 12 weeks has been completed from the first,” he said. The 12-week gap norm won’t be applicable to 45+ beneficiaries who registered for second dose last week, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/drive-in-loses-steam-12-week-gap-waived-for-already-registered-45-group/articleshow/82692235.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

The district has 15 blocks comprising 690 gram panchayats but information is available only for a handful of villages. Yet the data reflects a manifold rise in Covid cases after the panchayat elections when compared to the same period last year. A total of 92 Covid-19 cases were reported in rural areas last year in the period between April 15 and May 15. Following the second wave of Covid-19, the number has increased to 445 while the toll has gone up to over 500 in the past three weeks in the district. These cases were reported following the RT-PCR test. The number would have been higher if data on HRTC and antigen tests were to be included, said sources. According to the health department, Covid-19 medicines have been distributed to 1,250 people in the past one week. Village motioning committees have been activated in all the 690 villages in the district. Chief medical officer of Agra district, Dr RC Pandey said, “All the rural health centers have been alerted. Arrangements are being made to ensure proper treatment of Covid-19 patients in rural areas. Teams have been constituted to conduct door –to-door screening at villages. Health department workers are reaching out to people suffering Covid related complications. All the people with suspected symptoms will be tested.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/rural-agra-battles-covid-19-in-absence-of-tests-docs-medicines/articleshow/82688470.cms||Deepak Lavania

Several villages in the region have become containment zones after scores of deaths were reported in and around panchayat elections. “The government has already issued an advisory on May 2. Screening committees have been formed which are at work. Covid-19 kits are being provided to people with symptoms.

If such a proposal gets through the LDF meeting scheduled on Monday, Kerala Congress (B) MLA K B Ganesh Kumar and Congress (S) MLA Kadannappally Ramachandran may share a portfolio by turns. Janadhipathya Kerala Congress MLA Antony Raju and INL MLA Ahammad Devarkovil may share another cabinet berth. The portfolios and who should be inducted first in the cabinet from among the parties would be decided later in the LDF meeting. Despite resistance from LJD, the CPM leadership has refused to budge from its stand that LJD and JD(S) together would be considered as one single constituent. Kerala Congress (M) is learnt to have once again claimed for two cabinet berths, but to no avail. The party is expected to raise the demand in the LDF meeting on Monday. CPM has offered KC(M) the chief whip post with cabinet rank. KC(M), meanwhile, elected Idukki MLA Roshy Augustine as the parliamentary party leader, thus ensuring the cabinet berth for him.

---||Nagpur||Nitric oxide makes sexual activity good for you, bad for coronavirus, say sexologists||NAGPUR: There is a clear therapeutic or healing effect of sexual activities on immunity, mitigating co-morbidities like high blood pressure and hypertension, reducing stress and also trigger the release of ‘feel-good’ hormones endorphins, say experts. They highlighted this in connection with the association of nitric oxide, which is connected to erection of our sexual organs, and killing of coronavirus when administered via a nasal spray, which is currently under testing in UK and Canada. Renowned psychiatrist Dr Avinash Joshi, also a sex counsellor, said nitric oxide is responsible for erection in men and also arousal of clitoris and nipples in women. “Scientists are now claiming that nitric oxide based nasal spray also has potential to kill coronavirus in the nasal cavity,” he said. “Generation of nitric oxide takes place in the body for a short period during sex, especially in helping erections. But it may also have some curative effect during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic,” he said. “Nitric oxide is a vasodilator too, which helps in better flow of blood in the arteries, which again is good for health.” Dr Joshi also claimed the ‘intra-psychic conflicts’ is a major producer of stress, which again lowers immunity to a big extent. “Sexual activities free mind and release the stress and hence we can associate it as an immunity booster too,” he said. Sexologist Dr Sanjay Deshpande, also chairman of the Council of Sex Education and Parenthood International, stressed on the significance of vasodilation process during sexual activities. “Vasodilation opens up the arteries and allows better flow of the blood to the organs, which remain well-oxygenated in the process,” he said. “Sex helps to maintain the body structures and functions in normal course and vice versa,” said the sexologist. Dr Deshpande also highlighted that sexual activities increase the neuromuscular tone too. “During orgasm, the body becomes rigid and later relaxes. This contraction of the pelvic area and genitals can be categorized as neuromuscular actions, which are sort of exercises too, which are helpful for the body,” said Dr Deshpande. He added that vasodilation process can go a long way in reducing co-morbidities like high blood pressure and hypertension. Dr Deshpande also highlighted the beneficial effect of sex in releasing endomorphin hormone, which is a natural pain reliever and makes one feel happy. “Sex combines the effects of exercise and also a meditative state as you tend to focus on nothing except the coitus activity during it. In order to fight corona, exercise and meditation are both advised for a stronger body and calmer mind. It also has a spiritual dimension,” he said, adding sex is a rare exercise where two bodies help each other to reach a common goal. Psychiatrist Dr Rajesh Rathi also said sex rejuvenates the body and brings lots of positivity. He also said that sex works well at both physiological and psychological level. “There are quite a number of walk-ins nowadays for consultation, but we tend to tell them that it’s all about quality and not frequency,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nitric-oxide-makes-sexual-activity-good-for-you-bad-for-coronavirus-say-sexologists/articleshow/82692284.cms||Soumitra Bose

The administration did not give out the exact number of deaths in Libberheri village but said "several people have died". A senior government official said teams from different departments like revenue, health and police have been pressed into service to know the exact cause of deaths. Joint magistrate of Roorkee, Namami Bansal, told TOI, “We still have no data that could point to that these deaths happening due to Covid-19. It (the deaths) might be due to Covid-19 or some other fever or ailments. But we have intensified our efforts to test every Covid-19 suspect in the village.” Villagers believe it all started when a few of them returned from Maharashtra, where they used to work. And they brought the infection to the village which has a population of about 12,000. “My elder brother lost his life due to Covid-19 as many others did. Several people are still suffering from this deadly fever,” said 35-year-old Dharmender. On May 10, when an RT-PCR test facility was set up in the village, 10 out of 71 tested positive for Covid-19. Shubham Kumar, a member of the group that organised the testing camp, said, “Locals are also at fault. They are still not aware about Covid-19. Despite our efforts, they did not come out for the testing.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/30-dead-in-roorkee-village-in-may-say-locals-probe-on/articleshow/82688498.cms||Tapan Susheel
---||Delhi||Ensuring poor don’t die for lack of help in Delhi||NEW DELHI: After discovering that people were being overcharged for ambulances, Delhi-based NGO Wishings and Blessings decided to launch a free ambulance service to help the needy, who did not have enough money to ferry their loved ones to a hospital.  Simultaneously, the NGO has been distributing ration kits and medical essentials such as oximeters, masks and sanitisers to the underprivileged. The NGO said it began work last year with the “Wishings and Blessings Covid Relief Project” being launched on March 25, 2020, the first day after the lockdown was put in place. While initially focusing on food and later medicines, the ambulance service was launched by the NGO after it got reports of people finding it difficult to receive timely medical intervention. “During this crisis, one prime thing is ensuring that Covid-positive patients reach hospitals and get treatment as promptly as possible. Unfortunately, the destitute cannot afford to rent vehicles for safe transport to healthcare facilities. There is a dearth of ambulance services that the underprivileged can make use of, especially those that are equipped with oxygen support. Our services provide aid to exactly this demographic free of cost,” said Dr Geetanjali Chopra, the NGO’s founder and president. Currently, the NGO has two ambulances, one of which is equipped with oxygen support. More ambulances are planned to be put into operation. Those wanting to avail the non-oxygen ambulance can contact on 85956 20046, while those wishing to use the oxygen ambulance can call 83688 86870. The organisation is currently targeting night shelters and shelter homes across the city at locations like Sarai Kale Khan, Delhi Gate, Munirka, Safdarjung and Okhla to provide food and essential items. “We are humbled to be able to offer aid directly to those on the ground. The rise of Covid-19 cases is extremely worrying and the relief distributed ensures that there is regular monitoring of the beneficiaries and immediate care and action can be taken if people fall ill,” added Chopra. Apart from Delhi, the NGO is undertaking Covid relief efforts in Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal. It stated that so far it had provided over 20 lakh meals and distributed over 70,000 dry ration kits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ensuring-poor-dont-die-for-lack-of-help/articleshow/82692317.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

According to police, two men lost their lives after their motorcycle rammed into a bullock cart in an area under Mansoorpur police station in Muzaffarnagar on Saturday late night. The deceased, Kashif (20) and Mudassir (22), residents of Khalapar in Muzaffarnagar, were returning home after attending a function. KP Singh, station house officer of the Mansoorpur police station, said, “The family members of the deceased took the away bodies without informing police.” Earlier on Saturday evening, four youths lost their lives when their motorcycles coming from opposite directions collided in Saharanpur district’s Chilkana road.

---||Mumbai||Very heavy rain forecast, 6.5k shifted in Maha as Tauktae heads for Gujarat||Mumbai: The weather bureau has upgraded its Monday alert for Mumbai, Thane and Palghar from green to orange (indicates heavy to very heavy rain at isolated places). For Raigad, a red alert has been issued, forecasting extremely heavy rain at isolated places. IMD said cyclonic storm Tauktae was over east central Arabian Sea on Sunday evening and moving north-northwestwards at 16 kmph. It was 320 km south-southwest of Mumbai and very likely to intensify during the next 24 hours. On Sunday, cloudy skies persisted almost all through the day, with the Colaba observatory recording no rain and Santacruz trace rainfall. The state disaster management cell said that over 6,500 residents from the coastal districts of Ratnagiri (3,896), Sindhudurg (144) and Raigad (2,500) have been shifted to safer places. The Coast Guard said that all fishing boats, except 18 in Maharashtra and one in Gujarat, have reached their harbours or taken shelter at nearby ports. Briefing Union home minister Amit Shah about Maharashtra’s preparedness, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said the state has issued alerts to coastal districts and taken steps to ensure that power and medical oxygen supply to hospitals in those areas do not get disrupted. Considering the warning about Tauktae, the BMC has cancelled the vaccination drive for Monday across all public centres. The BMC has also warned people against going near the sea. An official said the civic body is on alert for those residing by the coast and evacuation will be done if need be. Shubhangi Bhute, scientist, IMD Mumbai, said the reason for upgrading the weather warning for Mumbai and neighbouring areas was owing to expectations that the storm would slow down and thus affect the region instead of bypassing it. “On Sunday afternoon, the cyclone was moving at 13 kmph, which we forecast may come down to 11 kmph… With the storm forecast to move 120 km off the Mumbai coast on Monday, we expect rains and strong winds,” she said. Mahesh Palawat from Skymet said there was no need for Mumbai to panic but patchy rains would be witnessed at different parts till Monday afternoon. “There are no chances of water logging or flooding anywhere but then it is better to stay alert. The reason for upgrading the alert by IMD could also be that earlier the system was to be crossing the Gujarat coast between Porbandar and Naliya around May 18 afternoon or evening. But now it is expected to cross the Gujarat coast between Porbandar and Mahuva (Bhavnagar district) around May 18 early morning. This means that during the crossing to Gujarat coast, the distance from Mumbai will be reduced from 300-350 km to 100-150 km," he said.

AIIMS-P’s nodal officer of Covid-19 Dr Sanjeev Kumar said, “We are expecting that the trial would begin from June. I think same procedure will be followed in kids as well. The volunteers will get the vaccine shot on day zero and day 28,” he said. The AIIMS-P had earlier successfully conducted the clinical trials on 1690 volunteers above 18 years of age. Dr Rajiv Ranjan Prasad, former president of IMA-Bihar, said some paediatric cases of Covid-19 have also been diagnosed in the second wave and the western countries have started giving vaccines to kids above 12 years. “However, vaccination of kids below 12 years has not started anywhere in the world yet. The dose for kids will not be same as of adult (0.5ml),” he said. Dr B P Jaiswal, a paediatrician, said herd immunity would be achieved only after vaccination of children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/aiims-p-selected-for-vaccine-trial-on-children/articleshow/82688761.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Delhi||Will take all steps to check black fungus cases: CM Arvind Kejriwal||NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday said Delhi government will take all necessary steps and precautions to check cases of black fungus or mucormycosis in the city. The fungal infection is caused by a group of moulds known as mucormycetes present naturally in the environment. Recently, several states, including Delhi, have reported a rise in the number of black fungus cases among people recovering from Covid-19. A day after the Haryana government classified black fungus as a notified disease and directed all districts to share data, it received a list of 70 confirmed cases by Sunday evening. Forty of these patients are admitted in hospitals in Gurugram. There are more than 200 suspected cases of mucormycosis across Haryana. “For the black fungus (cases), Delhi government will take all the steps and precautions necessary,” Kejriwal said in a statement. In an advisory released on May 9, the Centre had said that mucormycosis may turn fatal if it is not taken care of. The fungal infection mainly affects people who are on medication that reduces their ability to fight environmental pathogens. Dr Ajay Swaroop, chairman of the ENT department at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital here, said the use of steroids in the treatment of Covid-19 coupled with the fact that many coronavirus patients have diabetes could be one of the reasons for the rise in the number of black fungus cases again.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cm-will-take-all-steps-to-check-black-fungus-cases/articleshow/82692324.cms||---

The injured are being treated in a private hospital in Sanchore. The incident led to a tense situation in the village which prevailed even on Sunday. One family sat on dharna at the mortuary and refused to take away the body of Pratap Ram (25). They were demanding the culprits’ arrest. Police succeeded in arresting one accused while others managed to flee. The deceased’s kin were adamant that till all the eight accused are not caught they will not take the body for cremation. It was only after a lot of persuasion from police that they agreed to accept the body. Police teams have been sent in search of the accused. Barmer SP Anand Sharma said that two cousins from Vishnoi community in Chotu village had a long-pending dispute over ancestral land. On Saturday morning heated arguments forced the police to come and pacify the two families. However, in the evening a youth from one of the families passed a comment on the other family which led to a fight again. One family tried to forcibly take away the youth of other family after which the family fired with two country-made pistols. Those injured are Ramesh Kumar, Kishan Lal, Dinesh and Jagram.

---||Kochi||KCZMA sends draft to local bodies for discussion||Kochi: The Kerala coastal zone management authority (KCZMA) has sent the draft Coastal Zone Management Plans (CZMP) to local bodies for discussion. CZMP 2019 have been prepared by the national centre for earth science studies (NCESS) for seven districts Kannur, Kozhikode, Malappuram, Thrissur, Ernakulam, Alappuzha and Kottayam. The draft was prepared using the 1:25,000 scale map by identifying and classifying the coastal zone regulation (CRZ) areas within the respective territories in accordance with the CRZ notification 2019. The report says that the CZMP database, scrutinized by the technical scrutiny committee and finalized by the national centre for sustainable coastal management (NCSCM), shall be used as the base for revision or updation of the existing CZMP. The reports were presented before KCZMA last month. According to KCZMA minutes, a detailed discussion on demarcation of islands and status of mangroves was also held. Members opined that the absence of an integrated island management plan (IIMP) in the CZMP should be clarified with the environment ministry through the NCESS before initiation of public consultation process. The criteria required for preparation of IIMP for smaller islands will also be included in the clarification, according to KCZMA minutes. The draft plans are being prepared for nine coastal districts and some parts of Kottayam. In the letter dated April 22, the local governments have been asked to discuss with the public and other stakeholders and reply within two weeks. However, there is concern that the report could get published without proper discussions, especially in Ernakulam, which had seen pulling down of four residential apartment buildings in Maradu and a restaurant in Aluva following the Supreme Court orders. “With such Covid conditions, how can this report be discussed in two weeks. The deadline is already over. We hope that the final report will be published considering the responses, comments and suggestions given by the stakeholders in the respective areas,” said advocate Sherry Thomas, secretary, Kerala Latin catholic association (KLCA). KLCA has written to the chief minister seeking extension of the time given by KCZMA to the local bodies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kczma-sends-draft-to-local-bodies-for-discussion/articleshow/82688513.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

Jaisalmer is leading in the bid to arrange oxygen. Through the efforts of the district collector, Adani Green Energy limited provided 175 oxygen cylinders to the district administration, which are proving to be very useful for the public in this hour of crisis. Similarly, Power Grid Corporation of India limited has agreed to provide Rs 111.20 lakh under CSR the oxygen plant being set up at Jawahar Hospital in Jaisalmer. The plant will be set up by June 5 and there will be availability of 225 oxygen cylinders in the hospital.

---||Chandigarh||No place for communalism in Punjab: CM Captain Amarinder Singh||CHANDIGARH: Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Sunday slammed BJP leaders, accusing them of “parroting” Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s “provocative” statement on Malerkotla. Asserting that Punjab, through its history, respected all communities, he warned BJP leaders that their attempts to drive a communal wedge between Punjabis would backfire. The BJP leaders had said that Amarinder’s decision to announce the Muslim-dominated area of Malerkotla as a district on Eid was a “political and communal decision.” Amarinder retaliated saying that the BJP leaders were blindly jumping to the defence of the Uttar Pradesh chief minister. He said the UP CM “is hell bent upon destroying his own state, which is reeling under total lawlessness, communal and caste divisions and lack of governance.” Amarinder also took on Yogi saying that his treatment of the Covid situation in the state was insensitive, with criminal cases being filed against those pleading for help for their loved ones. Taking a dig at BJP leaders issuing statements criticising Malerkotla’s declaration as a district on Eid, he said, “If any of you want to know the greater history of Punjab, please let me know. I will send you some books on the subject.” According to him, Punjab’s history encompassed diverse communities. “From the time of Maharaja Ranjit Singh or in our cis-Sutlej states, there was never ever any communal tension. In fact, many of Maharaja Ranjit Singh’s ministers were Muslims and Hindus. Faquir Azizud-din and his brothers, Nurud-din and Imamud-din were ministers in Ranjit Singh’s court. His commander-in-chief was a Hindu, Dewan Mohkam Chand; his artillery was also manned by Muslims and no other community was part of his artillery,” he pointed out. He said that he had made this commitment during his last tenure as chief minister in 2002-2007 and unlike the BJP, he believed in fulfilling his promises. Amarinder went on to criticise his Uttar Pradesh counterpart for “destroying the secular fabric of the country.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/no-place-for-communalism-in-punjab-amarinder/articleshow/82692345.cms||---
---||Delhi||Businessman Navneet Kalra arrested in oxygen concentrator case||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police is learnt to have arrested absconding restaurateur Navneet Kalra late on Sunday after a fortnight-long cat-and-mouse chase in connection with the recovery of a large number of oxygen concentrators from his restaurants. Kalra had run out of options after being refused relief from the lower court and the high court. A lookout notice was issued against him and six teams were trying to catch him. Sources said that Kalra was tracked to a farmhouse in Gurugram on Sunday afternoon. However, it is unclear if he was finally arrested from there. While the Crime Branch has been investigating the case, south district cops were involved in the arrest, a source said. Cops are likely to divulge details on Monday. Sources said that section of ‘culpable homicide not amounting to murder’ could also be added to the case as some people who used the concentrators reportedly died. A legal opinion is being taken in this regard and statements of the victims are being recorded. Kalra, who runs Khan Chacha, Town Hall, and Nege & Ju restaurants in Khan Market and Lodhi Colony, had claimed in court that he was being unfairly accused of wrongdoings when every transaction is on record. Apart from recovering the hoarded concentrators in these locations, the cops had also found many of them in a south Delhi farmhouse, belonging to Matrix Cellular. Soon after, police raided his premises, but Kalra went underground with his family. A senior police officer said that there were apprehensions that Kalra may try to flee the country, after which the lookout circular was issued. Through a lookout notice, cops alert all immigration and sea ports to detain an individual if he tries to board a flight. The police have filed an FIR under IPC sections pertaining to cheating, violating public order and criminal conspiracy, apart from sections of Epidemic Diseases Act and Essential Commodities Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/businessman-kalra-arrested-in-oxygen-concentrator-case/articleshow/82692414.cms||Raj Shekhar

While the official YouTube channel of the Ranchi Archdiocese has released a video clip of Father Joseph who after talking to Father Stan through his lawyer has discussed his medical condition, a written statement of the same dialogue has been tweeted by JJM appealing to chief minister Hemant Soren and all other MPs and MLAs from the state to approach Maharashtra CM and ensure treatment, vaccination and release on bail of Father Stan because of the extraordinary condition arising out of the pandemic. Father Joseph in his video message has said that Stan is suffering from Parkinson’s and hearing problems. “From my personal experience, I know that he is highly tolerant, yet during the last telephonic interaction through his lawyer, I was able to understand that he is in pain and needs medical attention,” Father Joseph said. He added that despite suffering from multiple ailments, Stan has been denied vaccine because he does not have an Aadhaar card. “The condition of inmates inside Tajola jail is grim. There are no allopathic doctors, nurses, support staff or medicines to look after the sick. Only an Ayurvedic doctor is providing treatment to the inmates,” he said. Stan has complained of cough, fever, running stomach and extreme weakness. The JJM in its tweet said that many of the accused in the Bhima-Koregaon violence case are elderly and suffering from multiple ailments. “They should be immediately released on bail,” the Mahasabha sais. Attaching a video clip of PUCL virtual meeting of October 20, the JJM also reminded NCP MP Supriya Sule of her promise that proper care would be taken of the inmates. “Under the prevailing condition of rising cases of Covid-19 in Maharashtra, we appeal to her to look after the well-being of all those incarcerated in the Bhima-Koregaon case,” a functionary of the JJM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/ranchi-archdiocese-seeks-cms-help-in-securing-bail-for-fr-stan/articleshow/82690120.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

In view of the cyclone alert issued by the Indian Meteorological Department and directives issued by chief minister Vijay Rupani, the district administration issued instructions to ensure interrupted oxygen supply to Covid-19 designated hospitals.  The state government had asked each district to form urgent rapid response teams while asking them to take action with zero casualty approach.  Directives were also issued to the department of roads and buildings and forest department to ensure that the communication network, roads and power supply are maintained properly, and power supply is quickly restored if it is affected by falling of trees or otherwise affected by the cyclone.  Authorities have been asked to maintain electricity supply in all Covid hospitals with additional support of diesel generator sets while ambulance and ICU ambulances with advanced life support systems will be kept standby.  Vadodara collector Shalini Agrawal held a video conference with suppliers, traders and others engaged in supply of medical oxygen at Covid-19 hospitals across the district.  Huge banners, hoardings were removed by the Vadodara Municipal Corporation and by the district administration from rural areas of the district.

Andhra Pradesh’s electricity demand surged to 196 million units per day during this first fortnight, as against the last year’s 170 MU per day. According to the state officials, the energy demand for this month is expected to be an average 190 MU per day. The lockdown and pandemic-induced disruptions had reduced the electricity demand in 2020. But the economy or the industries have not been much impacted by the second wave, leading to the surge. The energy consumption in the first week of May was 1,399 million units, as against 1,139 MU in the first week of May last year, representing a 23% increase. The national energy consumption peaked by 25% during this same period. In what could be an indicator of economic revival, the discoms expect that the electricity demand would increase by 12% even in June. State energy secretary Srikant Naguapalli said that meeting the growing energy demand is not a constraint for the power utilities of Andhra Pradesh. “The state government is supporting the power sector in augmentation of generation capacities, transmission and distribution, renewable energy generation, and other advanced technologies. We have a robust power system in place in meeting the requirements of all categories of consumers,” said Srikant. The energy secretary added that the energy consumption in the domestic sector in 2018-19 was 14,071 million units. “This had increased by 20% in 2020-21 to 16,896 million units. The solar generation capacity was 3,800 MW in 2020-21, as against 3,029 MW in 2018-19,” said Srikant. The secretary said that due to Covid-19, the revenues from industrial and commercial sector had severely affected in 2020. “In this crucial period, the state government has come to the rescue of the power utilities that incurred a loss of around Rs 4,300 crore in the form of subsidy to the tune of Rs 17,904 crore in 2019-20,” said Srikant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/states-energy-consumption-rises-by-15-in-may-first-fortnight-despite-pandemic/articleshow/82688524.cms||---

On the first day of the curbs which will continue till May 27, the government's online portal that issues the e-passes crashed owing to heavy traffic, the state transport department said. Talking to TOI, transport officer Kiran Kumari Pasi said, "The portal was designed to generate 200 e-passes in a second. Since it was the first day, we had an overwhelming amount of online traffic and the portal's server was down because of it. The technical glitches are now fixed and it's working fine." He said since Saturday, over 2.36 lakh e-passes have been issued through the portal. In a recent order by the state department of home, jail and disaster management, residents of the state will have to procure e-passes to go out of their homes to buy essential commodities till May 27. The passes will be valid for three hours from the issuing time. Both state and central government employees and those working in the essential service sector can get a one-time pass which will be valid till May 27. Hearses, ambulances and private vehicles being used for medical emergencies and vaccination have been exempted from procuring the passes, the order said. All vehicles entering Jharkhand those travelling between the districts will need to display the passes. Meanwhile, Pawan Agarwal, a Kokar resident, who has been trying to procure a pass, said, "I tried for nearly four hours but failed to get a pass.

---||Ranchi||State govt starts distribution of kharif seeds after beating pandemic hurdles||Ranchi: The state government has kicked off the distribution of seeds for the kharif season weeks ahead of the monsoon this year. Talking to TOI, state agriculture minister Badal Patralekh said that they have managed to place order for 44,000 quintals of seeds, mainly for paddy, in record time through the tendering process despite several challenges posed by the pandemic. In the first phase, the department has begun seed distribution in 11 districts covering Santhal Pargana and Kolhan, from where monsoon enters the state. “From May 25, we will officially fan out in other districts too,” he said. In the first phase, 4,288 quintals will be distributed and gradually the programme will be intensified in the first week of June, Patralekh added. Badal, a Congress MLA from Jarmundi, claimed that for the first time since the creation of Jharkhand, seed distribution was taking place well in advance keeping in mind the interest of the farmers. “Earlier, there were often reports of untimely distribution of seeds. Owing to this problem, farmers faced difficulties in sowing the sees on time, which ultimately impacted the kharif produce. Hence we began advance planning this time in spite of the Covid-19 pandemic, to ensure timely procurement of seeds. The virus has so far impacted many officials in his department too, but everyone worked in mission mode to get the tendering process done on time and place orders,” he said, adding that in some districts like Godda and Sahibganj, falling under Santhal Pargana, substantial quantities of seed were dispatched for distribution. “Godda received 1,000 quintals of seed initially while about 300 quintals were dispatched to Sahibganj. The distribution through government authorised centres has begun,” he said, adding that at a time when the virus has led to job losses and shrinking economy, the state government was trying to ensure that the farming sector remained unaffected. The minister added that the agriculture department was also keeping a strict vigil to curb black-marketing of fertilisers. Three companies — IIFCO, YARA and Indorama — are permitted to sell fertilizers in the state at government-approved rates. “I have directed the departmental secretary to issue directives to all districts to curb any instance of black-marketing. I am also visiting different districts regularly to keep an eye on malpractices. For example, on Saturday, I discovered some shops were over-charging fertilizers in Deoghar. A probe has already been ordered into the matter,” he said. Meanwhile, Congress spokesperson Alok Dubey said that different cells have been set up by the party’s state unit to assist with Covid-related requests. “With the monsoon season ahead, our teams in different districts are also working on the ground to help the local administration with relevant inputs on illegal activities to plug any gaps,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/state-govt-starts-distribution-of-kharif-seeds-after-beating-pandemic-hurdles/articleshow/82690143.cms||ASRP Mukesh
---||Nagpur||Now, MIS striking kids in Covid-cured families||Nagpur: Many of us are now aware of the fact that children, under 10 years of age, generally remain asymptomatic even if they catch Covid-19 infection. Most of them recover without symptoms while some of them have mild effects. Hospitalization and oxygen therapy is rare in Covid-19 children. But, as they are developing antibodies, some of them might suffer from post-Covid multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Children, especially in families where parents and elderlies have tested positive and recovered, are developing this complication in large numbers. Though these numbers are limited in Nagpur, more cases are coming from districts like Yavatmal, Buldhana and Washim. Doctors have advised parents to observe symptoms of MIS-C in their kids, especially one month after their Covid recovery. Leading paediatrician from Yavatmal and president of Yavatmal chapter of Indian Medical Association (IMA) Dr Sanjeev Joshi told TOI that he has treated at least six such cases in last two months, which is very unusual. “After mother becomes Covid-19 positive, young kids are likely to get the infection. They don’t show any symptoms, but develop Covid antibodies. Such kids suffer from MIS-C,” said Dr Joshi. He has referred many patients to Nagpur’s leading children hospitals too. Colors Hospital, for instance has seven patients of MIS-C under treatment. They are between 2 and 12 years of age. According to him, the initial symptoms of MIS-C are like that of Kawasaki disease. Doctors can treat it if they diagnose it early. Most children recover without any problems. But, in case the inflammation affects coronary arteries, it may cause a lifetime heart disease for a child as the damage is irreversible. Dr Pankaj Agrawal, secretary of Academy of Paediatrics, Nagpur chapter, said paediatricians in city are coming across MIS-C cases, especially in later part of the second wave. “I have treated a few patients in our setup, but the number is not much in Nagpur. Some patients require paediatric ICU treatment,” he said. Veteran paediatrician Dr Vasant Khalatkar said Covid-19 test of such children may appear negative, but blood test can confirm MIS-C. “These kids are already recovered from Covid-19, so they have antibodies in high amount. The same causes inflammation and problems. Parents should not neglect the symptoms, especially after the second wave recedes,” he said. MIS-C Alerts MIS-C is a serious condition that appears to be linked Covid-19 Some organs and tissues — such as heart, lungs, blood vessels, kidneys, digestive system, brain, skin or eyes — become severely inflamed in MIS kids It’s a syndrome and not a disease — because much is unknown about it Most children who have it eventually get better with medical care Parents who have recovered from Covid-19 should not neglect symptoms in kids after 1 month of recovery High fever for more than 24 hours, severe stomach pain, difficulty in breathing, gray or blue colored skin, lips or nail beds are initial symptoms||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/now-mis-striking-kids-in-covid-cured-families/articleshow/82692423.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

A letter was issued by additional chief secretary Arun Kumar Singh asking all deputy commissioners to strengthen health services in rural areas along with streamlining of testing facilities, establishing isolation centres and making arrangements for testing centres and carrying out appropriate awareness campaigns. According to the letter, a nine-member task force is to be constituted at each block which will be headed by respective block development officers who will be responsible to carry out testing, running of isolation centres and arrangement of ambulances, medicines as well as other essential items used in treatment. The task forces will also be responsible for proper management of dead bodies of infected patients. As per the letter, in order to intensify testing up to the panchayat level, Aanganwadi sevikas and sahiyas will be roped in who will be conducting tests of suspected patients through Rapid Antigen Testing (RAT) kits. The teams will be provided training to conduct the tests and will have to report the positive patients to isolation centres and arrange proper medical consultation. In order to treat asymptomatic patients, a total of three to five isolation centres will also be created at each panchayat level. All such centres will be tagged with the nearest community health centres as well as sub-divisional hospitals. The order also directed the task force members to submit a daily report to the state health department on the situation in their respective blocks and to carry out awareness programmes on appropriate Covid behaviour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/dcs-directed-to-strengthen-covid-fight-in-rural-areas/articleshow/82690077.cms||Gaurav Pandey
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand govt starts distribution of kharif seeds after beating pandemic hurdles||RANCHI: The state government has kicked off the distribution of seeds for the kharif season weeks ahead of the monsoon this year. Talking to TOI, state agriculture minister Badal Patralekh said that they have managed to place order for 44,000 quintals of seeds, mainly for paddy, in record time through the tendering process despite several challenges posed by the pandemic. In the first phase, the department has begun seed distribution in 11 districts covering Santhal Pargana and Kolhan, from where monsoon enters the state. “From May 25, we will officially fan out in other districts too,” he said. In the first phase, 4,288 quintals will be distributed and gradually the programme will be intensified in the first week of June, Patralekh added. Badal, a Congress MLA from Jarmundi, claimed that for the first time since the creation of Jharkhand, seed distribution was taking place well in advance keeping in mind the interest of the farmers. “Earlier, there were often reports of untimely distribution of seeds. Owing to this problem, farmers faced difficulties in sowing the sees on time, which ultimately impacted the kharif produce. Hence we began advance planning this time in spite of the Covid-19 pandemic, to ensure timely procurement of seeds. The virus has so far impacted many officials in his department too, but everyone worked in mission mode to get the tendering process done on time and place orders,” he said, adding that in some districts like Godda and Sahibganj, falling under Santhal Pargana, substantial quantities of seed were dispatched for distribution. “Godda received 1,000 quintals of seed initially while about 300 quintals were dispatched to Sahibganj. The distribution through government authorised centres has begun,” he said, adding that at a time when the virus has led to job losses and shrinking economy, the state government was trying to ensure that the farming sector remained unaffected. The minister added that the agriculture department was also keeping a strict vigil to curb black-marketing of fertilisers. Three companies — IIFCO, YARA and Indorama — are permitted to sell fertilizers in the state at government-approved rates. “I have directed the departmental secretary to issue directives to all districts to curb any instance of black-marketing. I am also visiting different districts regularly to keep an eye on malpractices. For example, on Saturday, I discovered some shops were over-charging fertilizers in Deoghar. A probe has already been ordered into the matter,” he said. Meanwhile, Congress spokesperson Alok Dubey said that different cells have been set up by the party’s state unit to assist with Covid-related requests. “With the monsoon season ahead, our teams in different districts are also working on the ground to help the local administration with relevant inputs on illegal activities to plug any gaps,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/state-govt-starts-distribution-of-kharif-seeds-after-beating-pandemic-hurdles/articleshow/82690145.cms||ASRP Mukesh

Two tankers, carrying 16 tonnes of oxygen, left Air Water Company’s oxygen producing unit at Kolar in Karnataka and reached SVIMS on Sunday morning. Police ensured that the vehicles did not have to stop anywhere and could maintain adequate speed by clearing traffic in advance cutting journey time by two hours on the Bengaluru–Tirupati highway. “In an attempt to fight Covid-19 collectively, we created green corridors for smooth movement of vehicles transporting oxygen,” said Tirupati urban SP Ch Venkata Appala Naidu. According to the SP, all tankers bringing oxygen are being equipped with GPS trackers and their movements are being closely monitored. Special teams have been appointed to oversee smooth movement of oxygen-laden vehicles to the city. Police are coordinating with their counterparts in other states to ensure movement of oxygen without hindrance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/green-corridor-takes-o2-from-ktaka-to-tirupati/articleshow/82688530.cms||Sandeep Raghavan
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh’s blood banks fast running dry||VISAKHAPATNAM: Blood stocks, particularly of negative blood groups, are depleting fast at blood banks in Andhra Pradesh as not many donors are coming forward to donate blood during the pandemic. All 18 blood banks of Indian Red Cross Society (IRCS), private blood banks and banks attached to district hospitals are seeing a shortage. There are around 850 units of blood at the 18 IRCS-run blood banks in the state, said BVS Kumar, state coordinator for blood banks and projects of IRCS. “We have 617 children registered with the Red Cross who need blood transfusion twice or thrice a month,” Kumar added, while appealing to people to come forward to donate blood. K Srinivasa Rao, secretary of IRCS in Visakhapatnam, said that blood is required on a regular basis for certain kinds of patients. While thalassemia patients require regular blood transfusion, pregnant women undergoing c-section, people undergoing major surgeries and accident victims also need blood, Rao said. On regular days, IRCS Visakhapatnam manages to store at least 300 units of blood. Right now, the blood bank is receiving barely 40–50 units. Further, there is a shortage of negative blood groups which are anyway rare, Srinivasa Rao said adding that the pandemic coupled with the summer will really affect patients in need in near future. Meanwhile, blood banks are also receiving constant requests for blood plasma of Covid-19 recovered patients used for the treatment of Covid-19 patients. “We are finding it difficult to find plasma donors who have recovered from Covid-19. We request people to find blood donors because we have very little stock,” a representative of a private blood bank said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/aps-blood-banks-fast-running-dry/articleshow/82688537.cms||Nalla.Babu
---||Nagpur||Not allowing kin to meet admitted Covid patients inhumane: Govt doc||Nagpur: A professor of forensic medicine at Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (MGIMS) in Sevagram has written to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and union health ministry saying hospitals in the state are allegedly being “inhumane and cruel’ towards Covid patients by not allowing their relatives to stay or visit them. “Personally, interacting with relatives can be extremely therapeutic for the patient and can give the desire to survive in the most difficult situations in life. But in Covid, not allowing relatives to stay or visit the patients is a big blow for them as well as relatives,” said Dr Indrajit Khandekar while recounting his experiences of treating Covid patients. He observed that even some non-serious patients lose hope of survival and refuse treatment because they are tired of struggling alone. He said relatives need to only use a mask to meet their patients.TOI spoke to some hospitals regarding Khandekar’s claims. Seven Star Hospital Covid unit in-charge Dr Mohan Nerker said they have been allowing relatives to stay with patients only after they test negative. “Some patients had to stay longer for three to four weeks. Once they test negative, we move them to non-Covid unit and allow relatives to meet them. It helps in fast recovery and gives a sense of well-being,” he said. Dr Nerker said they haven’t yet allowed any relative inside a Covid ward. “We too use full protection such as PPE kits, mask, face shield and gloves,” he said.Dr Tushar Gawad, director-administration at Alexis Multispeciality Hospital, said they do not allow physical presence of relatives with Covid-19 patients. “We do video calls with family of the patient on a daily basis but do not allow physical presence of relatives. Focus is on reducing crowding at the hospital. Also the risk of relatives being Covid-19 positive can’t be ignored,” he said. As an exception, said Dr Gawad, relatives are allowed meet Covid-19 patients with all necessary safety measures on a case to case basis at the discretion of the clinician. “Also, our clinical psychologist works in close coordination with our clinicians to help expedite recovery of patients. In general, we have observed very few relatives wish to be with Covid-19 patients,” he said. GMCH medical superintendent Dr Avinash Gawande said it will only increase the spread of infection if relatives are allowed. “There is no guarantee that relatives will follow all protocols if they are allowed to enter Covid wards. We don’t allow relative to stay or meet Covid patients. On requests, we facilitate video calls,” he said. Dr Imran Noor Mohammad, director of Asian Critical Care Hospital, said they have been allowing relatives, especially in ICU. “Generally, a patient goes in the ICU on 8th or 9th day when viral replication is almost over and patient becomes less infectious. If patient is in early infection, we do not allow. If at least once a day they are allowed to meet or feed patient, it has a positive impact on patient’s psychology,” said Dr Mohammad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/not-allowing-kin-to-meet-admitted-covid-patients-inhumane-govt-doc/articleshow/82692509.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

A recent cabinet meeting discussed the same along with ten other projects. Oceanariums are large-scale seawater aquariums used to display marine species. Officials say that the oceanarium in Visakhapatnam will span across 10 acres and will be a tunnel-shaped structure that provides a 360° view of the ocean. More than 2,000 people will be able to see the oceanarium at a time. The Port City’s oceanarium will house thousands of marine species brought from all across the globe. Tourism minister Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao said, “We have discussed many projects and will take steps to prepare a detailed project report and identify land once the pandemic comes under control.” According to the tourism minister, the project will be executed in a public-private partnership (PPP) mode and is likely to cost over Rs 300 crore. The minister said that a number of tourism projects have not taken shape because of the pandemic. “The entire state administration is busy dealing with the pandemic. Our utmost priority now is public health. We will focus on the oceanarium and other projects once the conditions are under control,” said Srinivasa Rao. The proposal to develop an oceanarium in Visakhapatnam was mooted for the first time during the TDP regime. However, the project did not see light of day. Now, with the government planning a slew of measures to develop the state’s tourism industry, the oceanarium proposal has once again come to the fore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/oceanarium-to-give-vizag-360-view-of-marine-life/articleshow/82688550.cms||Siva G

Day’s toll, at 146, was the lowest since April 11. With near double recoveries than new cases, the recovery rate which was below 80% in the first week of May is now inching towards 90% mark. While the total caseload surpassed 10.25 lakh mark, number of recovered patients is all set to surpass 10 lakh on Monday. The region conducted more than 54,000 tests on Sunday. As the number of new patients was less, it is a strong indicator that the infection is now coming under control. Now, 87,605 patients, less than 9% of total cases reported in Vidarbha, are under treatment. Districts in Nagpur division have shown remarkable improvement. Bhandara reported just 96 new cases, a two-digit figure for the first time in last many days, even as more than 2,000 tests were conducted. In Gondia, 128 out of near 2,500 tests were found positive. Gadchiroli (240), Wardha (418) and Chandrapur (674) also reported fewer cases as compared to their weekly average.

---||Nagpur||CBSE schools hope to complete board practicals before June deadline||NAGPUR: CBSE schools in Nagpur are hoping to get permission from local authorities to enable the completion of Std XII practicals before the central board’s June 11 deadline. All schools were midway through the process in February when the lockdown was announced. As Covid cases increased drastically, both Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and district collectorate put further restrictions in place, thus ruling out any chance of practical exams resuming. With the statistical evidence of slowing down of Covid second wave in Nagpur, schools feel they might get the green signal from authorities to conduct practicals. A school principal said, “We have completed almost half of our practicals. And during that time too, we observed all necessary Covid distancing guidelines. In fact, schools are the safest place outside homes because a lot of planning goes into conducting these practicals. The entire campus, which used to host over a thousand students, is now having just 20 or 25.” Another principal said, “The entire system is a well-oiled machine now. We all have the experience from a few months ago in which we conducted these practicals by strictly adhering to safety protocols. So, there’s no reason why the authorities would deny such a request.” However, some teachers told TOI that practical exams must be avoided. A teacher said, “No school is talking about the infections which spread because of the practical exams. There were students whose family members were Covid-19 positive and yet the child came for an exam. We came to know about such incidents much later, through other students after they discussed all these things in their social media groups. Also, a teacher turned positive in a big CBSE school, but the principal gave leave only to that teacher and ordered the practical exams to continue as per schedule.” Schools have till the second week of June to complete the practicals and send the marks to CBSE. However, the central board will likely extend this, as cases have been rising sharply even in Delhi where the board’s headquarters is based.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cbse-schools-hope-to-complete-board-practicals-before-june-deadline/articleshow/82698171.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Goa||Goa: All Covid hospitals given power backup, says chief minister Pramod Sawant||PANAJI: A ferocious Cyclone Tauktae hit Goa with an intensity barely seen in the tiny state's recent history, bringing down power supply in many parts of the beleaguered state, with several pockets going powerless for over 15 hours and counting. The state’s dependence on overhead power lines resulted in the strong cyclonic winds uprooting electricity poles and trees, tripping both high-tension and low-tension lines, and throwing normal life out of gear. The unrelenting cyclone also slowed down the work of power restoration in many parts, with continuous winds, powerful gusts and heavy rain hampering the department’s work. Chief minister Pramod Sawant told reporters on Sunday that it would take two days for power supply to be completely restored throughout the state. The worst affected areas were Bardez in North Goa and Mormugao in South Goa. Goa Medical College (GMC) too suffered a 15-minute power outage, Sawant said, adding that all Covid hospitals were provided backup generators. Pre-empting a situation like this, the electricity department had engaged 250 workers through all available contractors across Goa. Superintending engineer, North Goa, Stephen Fernandes told TOI that despite this, the department was overwhelmed. “Too many big problems have arisen simultaneously across the state," he said. "We are sorting them all out, but the strong winds and rain are not giving us any relief. We had already kept 250 people sourced from all contractors in Goa, and stationed them at all power sub-stations. We have now sought another 150 workers from Belgaum and Kolhapur, and are using whatever resources we have to ensure that power is restored as soon as possible.” With Covid-19 widespread in Goa, the department had to make do without several of its own line staffers. “The situation is such that almost every family has someone or the other who has tested positive," a department engineer said. "We don’t have our full strength of line helpers and technicians, as either they or one of their family members are down with Covid. Although we have brought in additional labour, they have to be guided by our staff, who cannot be everywhere at the same time." Residents in Mapusa, Siolim and Aldona were among those who told TOI that they were without power supply for 20 hours since early Sunday , and in Old Goa, for 24 hours. "Many of us have stocked up on fish and meats during the lockdown. We fear the worst," a Siolim resident said. Similar outages were also seen in Ponda and Valpoi (where around 50 poles were damaged), Bicholim and other places. Poles were not only broken but uprooted. Further inconveniencing citizens were the water problems they faced as a result of the power problems.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cm-all-covid-hospitals-given-power-backup/articleshow/82694236.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Goa||Uprooted trees throw life out of gear in South Goa||Margao: Cyclone Tauktae, that passed along the state’s coast, left behind a trail of destruction in almost all parts of South Goa. Stormy winds and incessant rains threw normal life out of gear. Huge trees that got uprooted blocked the free flow of traffic along major as well as arterial roads of Salcete. Fire services personnel were kept on their toes throughout the day clearing the roads of fallen trees and branches. The national highway at Cuncolim was blocked after a number of trees and snapped high tension power lines came crashing down. An oxygen tanker also got stuck on this road before a team from the National Disaster Response Force (National Disaster Relief Force) cleared the blocks. Electricity poles lay broken, thereby snapping electricity lines that lay along roads at many places. Linemen from the electricity department were seen working in the heavy rains restoring power. However, many parts of South Goa went without power for several hours. In some places like Xeldem in Curchorem, power hadn’t been restored until late evening. In Margao, both the access roads to TB hospital, Margao, a Covid-19 vaccination center, were blocked as huge trees fell across them. With fire brigade personnel engaged elsewhere, locals helped in clearing one road, while the other was cleared by the team of NDRF personnel. Tin sheets of house roofs were also blown away at many places in Margao, and the occupants had a hard time sheltering themselves from the incessant rains. Margao MLA Digambar Kamat visited affected houses, assessed the damage and took stock of the situation. Water logging was witnessed at many places in Margao, Fatorda, Shirvodem, Navelim, Arlem, thereby making it difficult even for pedestrians to use the roads. Mobile phone services were down as was the internet, including the state service provider, BSNL. Those working from home had a hard time on account of failed internet connectivity. Coastal parts of Salcete were the most affected on account of sea water ingress, damaging fishermen’s structures. Leader of the fishermen association Olencio Simoes demanded that the state government compensate the affected fishermen. “It’s because of the sand dunes in the coastal areas that the damage on account of the cyclone hasn’t been that much. The government should now drop the idea of reducing the CRZ limit by 50m. The water resources department should now come out with effective solutions to arrest soil and sand erosion,” Simoes said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/uprooted-trees-throw-life-out-of-gear-in-south-goa/articleshow/82694399.cms||Govind Kamat Maad
---||Goa||Salcete villagers help cops clear trail of destruction left by cyclone||Colva: Cyclone Tauktae has left a trail of destruction in Salcete as it passed by Goa. The worst hit has been taken by the electricity department as most of Salcete is without power since 4am on Sunday. Junior engineer in-charge of coastal villages in Salcete Govind Bhat said that more than 40 electrical poles have been destroyed and the low tension (LT) transmission line has snapped at numerous places. His counterpart in Benaulim Siddhesh Velip too told of similar damages. Fierce winds which started on Saturday have continued to uproot plenty of trees. Fire services deputy director Nitin Raikar said that they have registered more than 100 calls and in his estimate the loss to property will be close to Rs 1 crore. As the fire services could not attend to all the calls, locals assisted police to clear trees fallen across the roads at various places. Colva police inspector Anand Shirodkar said that he is very grateful to the panch members and locals in his area for braving the gusty wind and torrential rain and helping police in clearing the roads. A large number of tourists were seen visiting the Benaulim and Colva beaches and taking videos of the rough sea. A family from Uttar Pradesh with a small child were taking a video of the sea at Colva. They said that they were stuck in Goa due to the curfew. They said that they love the beach, but this is the first time they have seen the fury of the sea. There is no more shore left, it is just water, they said. The wind speed was so fierce that riding two-wheelers was also a task.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/salcete-villagers-help-cops-clear-trail-of-destruction-left-by-cyclone/articleshow/82694531.cms||---

The team of personnel were flooded with calls from interior areas as well as urban parts of Canacona, to the extent that emergency calls went out to the police force stationed who were roped in to clear uprooted trees. Canacona deputy collector Udhay Prabhudesai said that though there were no casualties reported, trees that crashed on NH-66 blocked vehicular traffic till 11.30am on Sunday. Policemen from the local police station were clearing the highway at Karmalghat. With strong winds uprooting trees in this major green cover area most of the trees crashed on to electricity poles leaving residents without power. Electricity department sources said that power was unlikely to be restored even till Monday as many power lines snapped and poles damaged. Councilor of Colomb ward Shubham Komarpant said that several houses were damaged after roofing sheets got blown away and were flung all over. The impact of strong and gusty winds that continued through the day have ravaged the coastal area since last night. Villagers of Mashem and Galgibaga expressed fear after the sand bar that separates Mashem creek and the sea gave way, with sea water entering the creek. Villagers contacted local authorities to visit and take stock of the situation. The sandbar had breached last monsoon and heavy sea waves that pounded the sandbar threw open the sea and creek.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mashem-galgibaga-villagers-worry-as-sea-breaches-creek-after-sand-bar-gives-way/articleshow/82694618.cms||---

Currently, Tamil Nadu’s average daily requirement of medical oxygen is around 480 tonnes to 500 tonnes, but the availability is only 440 to 470 tonnes. There is acute shortage of oxygen beds across hospitals in the state and patients are forced to wait for hours to get a bed allotted. In an interactive meet with journalists in Chennai on Sunday, Stalin said liquid oxygen has been brought from Amsterdam through Indian Air Force planes. The CM, however, did not elaborate on the quantum of oxygen received. On Saturday, industries minister Thangam Thennarasu had tweeted that four cryogenic containers, with a capacity of 20 tonnes each, have been brought from Amsterdam. Stalin also said 500 cylinders to transport oxygen have been received from Singapore. The Centre last week increased the quantum of oxygen allotted to TN from 220 tonnes to 419 tonnes after the CM shot off a letter to the PM requesting a minimum of 500 tonnes from the Centre. The state’s oxygen need may increase to 840 tonnes over the next two weeks, Stalin’s letter had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-brings-oxygen-from-amsterdam-to-increase-beds-in-hospitals/articleshow/82696468.cms||---

CM Arvind Kejriwal said continuing the lockdown for the fifth week was necessary to ensure the trend of decline in Covid-19 cases and positivity rate continues. “We do not want the gains made in the past few days to be lost all of a sudden,” he said. The city has been under lockdown since April 19, with stricter curbs imposed last week, which will now remain in effect till 5 am on May 24. In effect, the entire NCR remains under lockdown with Haryana also extending all existing curbs till May 24, a step UP had already taken on Saturday. Lockdown extension: Don’t want to lose gains made in four weeks, says KejriwalDuring a visit to GTB hospital on Sunday, Kejriwal said, “The lockdown is to continue as it is, no concessions will be given. I hope in the next week, there will be greater recovery. As far as I can understand, Delhi is slowly coming back on track.” Speaking on shortage of vaccine doses, Kejriwal said it was not clear when the capital would get more shots needed to inoculate a larger number of beneficiaries. “Regarding Covaxin and Covishield, we have written both to the Centre and the two companies to provide us with the vaccines, but there is no indication of the vaccines being given to us,” he said. Recently, Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain had said that the Covid situation can only be considered “under control” when the positivity rate dips to 5% or less and not more than 3,000 to 4,000 fresh Covid-19 cases are reported per day. All lockdown restrictions already in place for the last four weeks will continue and the e-passes issued to individuals engaged in essential services will remain valid. The two additional measures put in place last Sunday included the shutdown of Delhi Metro, even though other modes of transport continue to ply with restrictions in place. A complete prohibition is in place against organising any marriage ceremony at public places, marriage halls, banquet halls, hotels etc. Marriage ceremonies can be organised in a Court or at home but not more than 20 people are allowed to attend these ceremonies. The guests are allowed to travel on production of the wedding card. In an order of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority issued on Sunday regarding the extension of the lockdown, all district magistrates and other senior officials have been asked to ensure Covid appropriate behaviour like wearing face masks and maintaining social distancing at Inter-State Bus Terminals, Railway Stations, shops selling essential items, mandis etc. The authorities have also been asked to keep a hawk eye on any shop of nonessential commodities or services and weekly markets functioning illegally. The Delhi Police has been asked to ensure effective checking by putting adequate checking points and pickets to prevent unnecessary movement of people during the lockdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/lockdown-extended-in-delhi-ncr-for-a-week/articleshow/82696479.cms||Sidharatha Roy

---||Goa||As Goa struggles, good Samaritans from Mum, B'luru despatch oxygen to state||Panaji: Amid an unprecedented surge in Covid-19 cases and with patients struggling for oxygen cylinders, good samaritans from Mumbai and Bengaluru took it upon themselves to reach out to Goa. The Dil Se Foundation has dispatched 30 80-litre cylinders each from Mumbai, while a Dura cylinder arrived at Goa from Bengaluru on Sunday. The Sauramandala Foundation had donated two 450-litre cylinders, which were to be deployed at two hospitals in Goa for seamless oxygen supply. On May 12, entrepreneur Shruti Chaturvedi took to social media to plead for oxygen cylinders, after the state admitted before the Bombay high court that it did not have enough oxygen cylinders. Strangers in the metros also noticed reports of patients dying every night at Goa Medical College (GMC) due to erratic supply of oxygen. Electrical engineer Nagakarthik MP noticed that GMC was struggling to meet its oxygen requirement, and decided to do something about it. “One of the Dura cylinders was unloaded at South Goa while the other was diverted to respond to an SOS need in Karwar,” said Nagakarthik, the co-founder of Sauramandala Foundation. With the state government installing a 23,000-litre liquid oxygen plant at GMC, the need for the second dura cylinder was no longer felt. Roland D'Cruz, a Mumbai-based entrepreneur with roots in Siolim, read a Times Of India report about people dying due to shortage of oxygen cylinders at GMC. D'Cruz got in touch with dean Dr. Shivanand Bandekar, and offered to send across oxygen cylinders. Eliciting no response from Bandekar, he reached out to Chaturvedi, who had filed a PIL regarding patients’ plight at GMC. “I reached out to the local team of Dil Se foundation led by Chinnu Kawatra in Mumbai to arrange for oxygen cylinders to be sent to GMC at no cost,” said D'Cruz. On Saturday, just after the truck with oxygen cylinders left Mumbai, health department officials said that the cylinders were no longer required as the liquid medical oxygen plant was ready..||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/as-goa-struggles-good-samaritans-from-mum-bluru-despatch-oxygen-to-state/articleshow/82694730.cms||Newton Sequeira
---||Goa||State issues order to take over 50% beds in pvt hosps||Panaji: The state government on Sunday issued orders for taking over Covid admissions in 21 private hospitals from Monday, for a period one month or until further orders. The state government said that 50% of the beds in private hospitals will be reserved for Covid patients. The hospitals will be taken over “along with staff vehicles and services under Section 65 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005,” revenue secretary Sanjay Kumar stated in his order. He said that with a Covid surge being witnessed in Goa and other parts of the country, the situation could aggravate. The state government said that in order to make for sufficient provision of beds for Covid patients, private hospitals had earlier been directed to reserve a certain percentage of their total bed capacity. However, Kumar said that they have received information that private hospitals are either not admitting Covid patients or are charging exorbitant fees and denying treatment to DDSSY beneficiaries. While the government will take over the 50% of the beds at private hospitals with admissions being handled by designated government officers, the existing hospital management will continue to operate the hospital and its services. Payment for the treatment of DDSSY beneficiaries will be made by the government to the hospital based on the treatment provided and upon verification of the bills as per the rates fixed by the public health department for treatment of Covid. “Any person not complying with the directions will be liable to be proceeded against as per the provision of Sections 51 to 60 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, besides legal action under Section 188 of IPC,” Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-issues-order-to-take-over-50-beds-in-pvt-hosps/articleshow/82694759.cms||---
---||Goa||Rainfall to continue in state, to reduce only from May 18||Panaji: The severe cyclonic storm “Tauktae” (pronounced as Tau’Te) resulted in extremely heavy rainfall. Some rain gauge stations at Goa recorded rainfall exceeding 20cm. In view of increased rainfall activity and possible impact such as flooding and the possibility of landslides, a red alert has been issued for Goa by the India meteorological department (IMD). “For Monday there is an orange warning issued by the IMD,” scientist at IMD, Rahul M said. In the early hours of Sunday, Tauktae was over the east central Arabian Sea and moved nearly northwards with a speed of about 9 kmph and intensified into a very severe cyclonic storm and lay centred over the east central Arabian Sea, about 150km southwest of Panaji. The India meteorological department said that it is very likely to move north-northwestwards and reach Gujarat coast in the evening hours of May 17. As of 6pm on Sunday, the cyclone shelter was 210km from Panaji, but the outer bands of the cyclone kept on coming to Goa thus bringing in stormy rain through the night along with strong windspeed of 80-90kmph. Very heavy rainfall of 12cm or more could take place at a few places in Goa on Monday because the winds will be south westerly. May 18 onwards there will be drastic reduction in rainfall since the system will be too far away to have any impact over Goa, the IMD said. “By that time the system will be at Gujarat coast making a landfall there.” Rahul said. People were holed up inside their homes through the day as a safety precaution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rainfall-to-continue-in-state-to-reduce-only-from-may-18/articleshow/82694766.cms||Nida Sayed
---||Chennai||Remdesivir to be sold directly to Tamil Nadu private hospitals||CHENNAI: After milling crowds at remdesivir sales counters opened at six places in government hospitals across Tamil Nadu sparked fear of turning into super-spreaders, the state government has decided to sell the anti-viral drug directly to private hospitals treating patients from Tuesday, and not to the family and friends of the infected. The decision was taken at a review meeting chaired by chief minister M K Stalin on Sunday. A new online portal will be launched on Tuesday through which private hospitals can register their requirement, a press release said. ‘Hospitals required to submit records of patients in need of O2’ Health minister Ma Subramanian said, “Hospitals will be asked to submit medical records pertaining to oxygendependent patients. After going through the documents, Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation will approve remdesivir vials. Hospital representatives can collect them from sale depots.” A K Ravikumar, state secretary, Indian Medical Association (IMA), said once the changes come into effect, government should not prioritise bigger hospitals (with 100-beds or more) and provide the drug to all Covidempanelled hospitals based on a common waiting list. Or else, the government can collect a weekly or15-day indent from private hospitals and supply the required quantity upfront. In order to monitor usage, hospitals can be asked to return used vials and upload patient details before making request for the next batch (as it is done for supplying vaccines), he said. Health authorities said that they will continue to monitor private hospitals to ensure they administer remdesivir only to eligible patients and the drug is sold only at the price fixed by the government. Though remdesivir is recommended only for severe cases, some private physicians are recommending it to all patients thereby increasing the drug’s market demand. This has led to hoarding and black marketing of the drug. Chennai police arrested people for trying to sell a vial for ₹15,000 to ₹35,000 last week. The government has promised to take legal action against those who sell it at exorbitant rates and prescribe it without necessity, the press release said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/remdesivir-to-be-sold-directly-to-tamil-nadu-private-hospitals/articleshow/82696502.cms||Ram Sundaram

Crime branch sleuths said that the duo admitted to having committed the crimes in Fatehgunj, Harni and Warasia. The accused duo, identified as Rajvirsingh Sikhligar and Kirpalsingh Sikhligar, were nabbed by cops on Saturday, within a few hours of them targeting a woman. The duo snatched the gold chain of Laxmi Tiwari who was waiting for a bus on the RC Dutt Road. They were nabbed on Ajwa Road on basis of a tip-off and CCTV footage. During their interrogation, they admitted to more such crimes they had committed in the past few days. The police are now searching for four other accused including Tejpalsinh Sikhligar, Vikkisingh Sikhligar, Daljitsingh Sikhligar and Sunny Sikhligar. Over the last few days, chain snatcher gangs have targeted several women, some of whom were out for walk in nights.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/cops-detect-three-more-cases-of-chain-snatching/articleshow/82688905.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Missed vaccine on Sunday? Government allows jab on Monday||PANAJI: For many young adults, the joy of finally securing their vaccination appointments was short-lived, as Cyclone Tauktae's ferocious assault on Goa ensured that they couldn't reach their centres to get the jab. The number of persons vaccinated on Sunday were a mere third of those who got inoculated on Saturday. Some health centres like Balli, Candolim, Porvorim, Corlim, Siolim, Mayem and Casarvanem, couldn't vaccinate on Sunday due to power outages and as healthcare workers couldn't travel, but state immunisation officer Dr Rajendra Borkar said that they would vaccinate on Monday if conditions are favourable. Other centres faced issues such as trees blocking access and patchy internet. In some, healthcare workers showed up but not enough beneficiaries turned up to get the jab. Most centres shut by 1pm due to the cyclone's unrelenting ferocity. A young man who tried to risk going for his jab returned home disappointed after finding the cyclone too strong and roads blocked. “I left the house at 10am for the 11-1am appointment at Aldona PHC with some hesitation," he told TOI. "There was devastation, with strong winds, dozens of trees and branches uprooted, waterlogging along the Saligao-Parra road, and a huge banyan tree blocking the road. I took a detour, but the internal road had more trees and power lines fallen. I realised it was not worth it, and there was no guarantee that the health department staff would have reached, so it was a wasted risk and I returned home disappointed." In another instance, a mother was unable to take her daughter for her vaccine but will try again on Monday. “A lot of people in our neighbourhood are infected. The mutant virus is quite lethal, and we have to protect the youth first. They are still young and its more important that they get their first dose rather than senior citizens getting the second dose. Most of us have lived our lives,” the mother told TOI. Borkar told TOI that in many instances, healthcare workers braved the weather conditions and waited for beneficiaries to show up to get vaccinated. He also said that it was not true that health centres couldn’t conduct vaccination as the vaccines hadn’t reached it. Vaccine stock for four days is delivered at a time, he said, adding that vaccines are not sent to health centres on a daily basis. The health department is planning to open the next set of vaccination slots for the 18-44 age group soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/missed-vaccine-on-sunday-govt-allows-jab-on-monday/articleshow/82694792.cms||Lisa Monteiro

---||Mumbai||From hospital, she helped Dharavi celebrate Eid||MUMBAI: A few days before Ramzan Eid, Shaheen Jamadar's phone started buzzing non-stop. A bunch of people from Dharavi were calling up to inquire where she had disappeared. It was festival time and they were in need of rations and clothes that she had been organising for them through an NGO ever since the lockdown began. Jamadar had tested positive for Covid-19 and had been hospitalised 12 days ago. But the fact that people wouldn't be able to celebrate Eid kept gnawing at her and she got to work from her hospital bed. When the moon was sighted on Thursday night, ration kits had already reached all 170 families that had approached Jamadar for help. "Mai toh phir bhi zinda hu. Lekin yeh logo ke paas khaana pani kuch bhi nahi hai, bhuke mar jaayenge (I'm surviving at least. But these people have no food or water and will starve to death)," Jamadar explained over a phone conversation from her isolation ward. Her effort inspired other Dharavi residents to such an extent that they pooled whatever little sums of money they had and donated it to the NGO instead of making an annual contribution to the local mosque for Eid. Jamadar, 38, who lives in the same community at Dharavi, has been working for social causes for six years. In 2020, she joined a crowdfunded group, Enrich Lives Foundation, run by three women-- IIT engineer Shievani Upadhyay, lawyer Samrudhi Chothani and entrepreneur Rashmi Balwani. "Since inception, we have given out 8000 ration kits across Dharavi through various volunteers, besides clothes, snacks and 10000 sanitary pads," said Upadhyay. The group also started an initiative to coach around 300 school students in Dharavi in basic English and Maths as online education was a luxury these children couldn't afford. Jamadar was actively involved in all initiatives. "Being a lead volunteer from the NGO for Dharavi, it is my responsibility to identify needy families and fill up forms with their requirements," she said. From her hospital bed, she started collating a list of people who needed aid, in the run up to Eid. "We are required to visit each such family to verify their requests. As I couldn't step out of the Covid ward, I sent out my husband and son for door-to-door visits. I then asked each family to send me copies of their Aadhar cards, phone numbers and ration requirements," Jamadar said. The details were all keyed in into a Google form online and sent to the NGO. When the supplies arrived, Jamadar again coordinated with her husband and son to handle the distribution. Geo-tagged photos of the distribution were sent back to the NGO. "Records of every beneficiary are maintained and random checks are carried out to ensure that no needy individual is left out," Upadhyay said. Jamadar, meanwhile, can't wait to get discharged from hospital so she can resume field work and reach out to more people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/from-hospital-she-helped-dharavi-celebrate-eid/articleshow/82696519.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Goa||Cyclone Tauktae grounds flights in & out of Goa||PANAJI: All air operations were suspended for a day at the Goa International Airport on Sunday due to cyclone Tauktae, which crossed the state approximately 150km off the coastline. Along with gusts of wind at 80-100kmph and heavy rainfall, Tauktae also led to visibility at the airport dropping to less than 500m at one point of time, prompting Airports Authority of India and the airlines to cancel arrivals and departures for a day. Airlines issued advisories to their passengers informing them that flights had been cancelled. “Considering the prevalent weather conditions in, around and enroute to Goa due to the very severe cyclone Tauktae, all airlines have cancelled their flight operations to and from Goa for a day,” Goa airport director Gagan Malik said. Goa international Airport will resume operations on Monday with the first flight scheduled to take off at 3:25, an Air India Goa Delhi flight, AI 886. Flights were suspended because of the cyclone. Domestic airline IndiGo while informing its passengers that flights to and from Goa, Belagavi, Hubli and Kolhapur were impacted, offered a refund or the option to reschedule the tickets. SpiceJet and Vistara also followed suit and warned their passengers that all departures and arrivals at Goa and their connecting flights were affected. “Passengers are requested to keep a check on their flight status,” SpiceJet said. Vistara said that due to the weather disturbance over the Arabian Sea, flights along the west coast and Chennai would be affected till May 17. The impact on passengers was minimal as the number of flights and passengers has plummeted after being on a decline since April. Goa has the highest positivity rate for Covid-19 cases, and with the state government imposing restrictions, the number of passengers per flight has reduced to less than 30. The IMD issued a red colour warning for Sunday stating that extremely heavy rainfall, squally winds of speed 80-90kmph gusting to 100kmph were very likely along the coast of Goa. The cyclone passed Goa around midday as it moved in a north northwest direction. Since it is a very severe cyclonic storm, the gale winds continued for most of Sunday even after the weather system passed Goa.

The tenure of the last chairman of the body Justice RMS Khandeparkar ended on April 15, 2018. A senior official said that the state government will start the procedure to appoint a new chairman and also members of the SPCA. The three-member SPCA comprises a chairman and two other members. Even after the chairman’s retirement, the two other members of SPCA had continued hearing cases but were unable to pass orders without a chairman. In November last year, with over 83 pending complaints filed against police personnel the state government closed down the functioning of SPCA till it was reconstituted. In 2014 the state government issued a memorandum restricting SPCA from taking suo motu cognisance of misconduct by the police personnel. The move had drawn wide criticism from activists and public as there is an increase in the number of cases filed against the law enforcers over the last five years. SPCA had recommended disciplinary proceedings against some personnel and even directed some of the men in uniform to perform social service. This required them to educate members of 10 village panchayats about SPCA, it’s function, purpose and utility as well as the procedure followed by SPCA to dispose complaints in case the police failed to file a first information report (FIR). Most of the complaints with SPCA relate to police refusing to register FIRs. Other complaints are of police personnel assaulting complainants when an FIR was asked to be registered. In one such case the complainant had stated he had been harassed by the police while registering an FIR. Other complaints include abuse of power and arrest without valid reasons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/3-years-on-police-complaint-authority-still-non-functional/articleshow/82694864.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Congress to seek dismissal of government over Covid deaths||PANAJI: Accusing the BJP government of “murdering the innocent Covid patients,” Congress said it intends to write to President Ram Nath Kovind and Goa’s interim governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari, seeking the dismissal of the “insensitive, irresponsible” government led by chief minister Pramod Sawant. The party, which held a virtual meeting with All India Congress Committee’s Goa desk in-charge Dinesh Gundu Rao, also plans to write to the president with a demand for a full time governor. Koshyari is also handling the charge of Maharashtra. Rao held a video conference with state party functionaries and a few MLAs to analyse the Covid-19 trajectory in Goa and to take stock of the party’s efforts to provide relief to those affected by the pandemic. “All the members unanimously condemned the BJP Government for murdering the innocent Covid patients and for its failure to provide basic fundamental right to life to the people of Goa,” said state general secretary Amarnath Panjikar. The meeting was attended by state president Girish Chodankar, opposition leader Digambar Kamat, Poriem MLA Pratapsingh Rane, Navelim MLA Luizinho Faleiro, coordination committee chairman Ramakant Khalap and others. Congress Covid Cell chairamn Dr Pramod Salgaoncar also participated and gave valuable suggestions. The party functionaries condemned the BJP government’s “neglecting attitude” which has resulted in deaths due to shortage and interruption of oxygen. The government’s move to prescribe Ivermectin tablets, against the advice of World Health Organisation and medical experts, was condemned. “The party has demanded that the government must immediately stop using Ivermectin tablets as a prophylactic,” Panjikar said. The party has demanded that the state must increase free Covid testing centres and vaccination centres, clear doubts about the vaccination process and create medical infrastructure to handle the second and third Covid-19 wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cong-to-seek-dismissal-of-govt-over-covid-deaths/articleshow/82694936.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: ‘Declare state of emergency to combat Covid-19’||PANAJI: The Goenchea Raponkarancho Ekvott (GRE) - a collective of Goa's traditional fishermen, demanded that chief minister Pramod Sawant should declare a state of emergency under article 360(1) or 356 similar to other countries, “like Romania, Czech Republic, Ethiopia, Spain, Italy, US etc who had declared the same” in order to stop Covid surge last year. General secretary of GRE, Olencio Simoes said that the state government had failed to control Covid-19 positivity rate and the death rate in Goa adding that even the fishing community is being declared “as positive” (referring to Covid). “The Directorate of Health Services has completely collapsed and the state administration and leadership have failed to control the pandemic. The consequence of the government’s negligence, mismanagement and error of judgement has made Goans bear the brunt of it,” he said. He also said that a state of emergency is the need of the hour to curb the spread of Covid. He demanded that more Covid centers should be constructed or operationalized and oxygen supply needs to be pumped up. ‘Patients under home isolation should be under the strict watchful eye as many patients are roaming freely, thus violating Covid related protocols. Caretakers of Covid patients in the hospitals are freely roaming around which is further aggravating the Covid situation. Therefore the state government should convert all hotels under The Disaster Management Act, 2005 to Covid centers to provide better treatment facilities to patients to minimize the death rate as we have already lost 1,937 lives,” he said. “It is sad that even after Covid cases and death rate per million were highest last year in India, the Goa government did not act quickly despite forewarnings but were busy approving all disastrous projects of the Center which the people have been opposing since several years,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/declare-state-of-emergency-to-combat-covid-19/articleshow/82694932.cms||---

Tamil Nadu's cumulative death toll increased to 17,670 -- fourth highest in the country -- with another 311 dying in the last 24 hours. Of them, around 27% (84) had no comorbidities like diabetes or hypertension. The number of people testing positive every day continues to be on the rise in Tamil Nadu. On Sunday, 33,181 tested positive. But in disease hotspot Chennai, the daily infection count has dropped by roughly 6%. From 6,640 on Saturday, it came down to 6,247 on Sunday. In Kancheepuram, new cases dropped by 26% in the last 24 hours. A total of 1,119 tested positive in the district on Sunday. On Saturday, 1,521 had got infected. But the daily infection rate was higher in the other two neighbouring districts --Thiruvallur (1,835) and Chengalpattu (2,041) -- compared to Saturday. These people have started to reach out to Chennai hospitals in more numbers compared to previous weeks. Chennai has only nine ICU beds and 230-odd oxygen beds vacant, according to recent government data. To reduce this shortage, health minister M Subramanian on Sunday inaugurated a 100-bed Covid healthcare centre at Injambakkam in Chennai's suburb. "Of this 33 are oxygen-supported beds and efforts are on to convert the remaining 77 into oxygen beds in two or three days," he said. Coimbatore, which is the second-worst affected district, reported 3,166 new cases on Sunday -- almost double of what was reported two weeks ago. Similar trend was observed in other major TN cities like Madurai (1,095 new cases), Trichy (1,569) and Salem (822). In the last two weeks, the number of active cases in Tamil Nadu has increased by 82%. As many as 2,19,342 people are undergoing treatment in hospitals and at homes as on Sunday. Of them, roughly 66,000 (30%) are in Covid hospitals and 24,000 (11%) are in Covid care centres. The demand for oxygen beds and ICU is on the rise as only 2,500 such beds are vacant across the state. Not just in Chennai, finding a O2 bed has become almost impossible even in districts like Cuddalore and Dharmapuri. Sunday being a complete lockdown, the vaccination figures dropped down as anticipated. A total of 21,801 got their jabs on Sunday. It was 62,353 on Saturday. So far, around 69 lakh people got vaccinated in Tamil Nadu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/salem/over-300-die-of-covid-19-across-tamil-nadu-33000-test-positive/articleshow/82696570.cms||---

It pointed out to a municipality-owned premises at Malbhat on the land acquired for pickup stand, having sufficient number of rooms, that could be used as a Covid vaccination center or any other related activity. The MCC ground having large halls, and BPS Club in Pajifond, Margao, are the other two locations suggested by the Shadow Council. “With nearly 2,500 positive cases under the Margao urban health center alone, it turns out to be a desperate situation when patients, particularly Madgaokars, call for help to get admission in a hospital in Margao, and we can do nothing for them,” Savio Coutinho said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/use-mmc-premises-as-vax-centre/articleshow/82694943.cms||---
---||Goa||Jesuits of Goa offer free isolation facilities at Raia||PANAJI: While many in Goa might have the privilege of self-isolating within their homes with perhaps the comfort of a separate room and washroom, but for the underprivileged this extra space is a luxury they might not be able to afford. The Jesuits of Goa province have started home isolation facilities at Pedro Arrupe institute Raia for asymptomatic patients who have tested positive for Covid-19. It is a free service mainly for the poor and the needy in Goa and are being monitored by doctors and caregivers. The facilities also include self-contained rooms, wifi and nursing staff. It all began with a call from Fr Orville de Silva who thought that something had to be done for the society as Goa is in the throes of the second wave of the pandemic. Within no time people from various walks of life stepped up to help the Raia Jesuits with donations, helping hands and volunteering their services. At the institute people who wish to isolate themselves after testing positive for Covid are being helped by the Jesuits. Even pre-symptomatic patients and patients with mild symptoms can avail of the facilities. If any patient shows severe symptoms during their stay at the institute, they will be shifted to a Covid care hospital. “Our team led by Dr Brennan Tavares and on-call doctor, Dr Alan Pereira devote time to take care of our patients. If they feel that the patients need to be transferred to a hospital we will try and transfer them to one, subject to a bed (availability) but treatment will start as well,” said Vernon Xavier, member of the Pedro Arrupe institute - care and compassion center. “Our panel member Pascoal Noronha helps us out in any way possible by organising free food,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/jesuits-of-goa-offer-free-isolation-facilities-at-raia/articleshow/82694958.cms||Nida Sayed
---||Delhi||Chefs in Delhi cook up tasty treats for Covid-19 patients||NEW DELHI: When restaurateur Radhika Khandelwal saw home chefs posting online about cooking meals for Covid-19 patients, she realised that with her experience as a trained chef and availability of her professional set-up she could manage far more meals. She also felt that such meals didn’t need to be just staid dal, chawal and roti and could be rich in nutrients needed for recovery from the disease. Khandelwal tied up with farms in and around Delhi and requested them to donate their extra produce for the meals. She posted about preparing meals for Covid-positive patients in home quarantine in Greater Kailash-II, where her restaurant Fig n Maple is located. Within no time, she received many orders. Eat, pray, love: Hotels send out Covid mealsSince then, she has been sending out almost 200 meals covering 60-80 families in the locality. The meals include an array of dishes, right from tamarind fish curry to Vietnamese eggplant with noodles, Burmese hot pot and risottos made of barley paired with either pumpkin or beetroot, chicken with grilled peaches and kodo millet, Vietnamese fish with noodle, pumpkin coconut risotto and chicken or veg noodle soup. Chef Anchal Bhalla Chopra of Tastesutra started sending out food to her friends and family members battling Covid-19 after realising that there were many people who didn’t have anyone to cook for them, but needed nutritious meals to recover quickly. As word went out, friends and family members chipped in with help. The Sainik Farm RWA decided to help with deliveries, along with home delivery services WeFast and Dunzo. Within no time, she was sending out 150-200 meals daily. Many professional chefs, restaurants and hotels are using their experience and kitchens to send out nutritious meals to Covid-19 patients, health workers and the underprivileged across the city. Rather than merely preparing rice and rajma in bulk, these meals are nutritious, hygienically prepared and reasonably priced or if there’s a donor, free of cost. Restaurateur Karan Nambiar observed that many senior citizens were in isolation. Their children were in different cities and domestic workers were not being called to avoid undue exposure to the disease. Their major issue was food. He turned his burger and pizza cloud kitchen into a meal preparation centre for senior citizens and Covid patients. Alumni from his alma mater, Modern School, pooled in resources and he started sending out hygienic good quality lunch boxes free of cost. A lot of his friends and customers regularly started donating for the meals. As a result, his kitchen has been able to send out almost 2,500 meals so far. Hotels, too, are busy sending out Covid-19 meals along with regular gourmet orders. Hyatt Regency has joined hands with Entrepreneurs Organisation Delhi, a business network, to deliver set menus for lunch, mid meals and dinners to Covid-affected families or frontline workers. Some of their major demand has come from hospitals where the workforce needs quality meals just like patients. JW Marriott Aerocity has been delivering meals to Covid-positive patients within a 10-km radius. With multiple facilities being turned into Covid care centres and for housing doctors, Taj Hotels is using its experience of preparing nutritious meals and delivering over 20,000 meals within the city to medical personnel in hospitals. Restaurateur Varun Puri of Imly said that unlike last year, this year has been about battling health emergencies within the family. Food has become an important aspect of recovery. Food delivery services also started a “ghar ka khana” section, which enabled many brands to tweak their menu to suit the needs of patients. From outlets like I Sacked Newton donating meals in Noida to Lite Bite Foods’ multiple brands delivering subsidised meals across the city, restaurants have also become the preferred outlets for people willing to donate meals to the underprivileged. As a result, they have started giving about 2,000 meals to the underprivileged daily. Puri said nowadays many people were gifting Covid meals to friends and looking at options to meet the protein, carbohydrates and vitamin requirements for faster recovery of patients. He added that a balanced diet was the need of the hour and many people were ordering that for friends or family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/chefs-in-delhi-cook-up-tasty-treats-for-patients/articleshow/82696571.cms||Amin Ali

Turning this belief on its head, the Goa State Biodiversity Board (GSBB) has taken the first step to becoming the only government body in the country to begin production, along with local communities, of products derived from local bio-resources. Around 14 women in the hamlet of Talemata in Pale-Cotombi, Bicholim taluka, have processed over 1,000 jackfruits sourced from local farmers, among other produce. The products are now ready to be sold as jackfruit chips, jackfruit pickle, bimbli squash and karmala squash. The board is planning to set up five other centres mainly in the mining belt in Goa. While a part of the income derived from the sales will be paid back to locals involved in the processing unit, the rest of the amount will go back into conservation of the local biodiversity and into funding other sustainability efforts. That is not all, those who purchase the products will be able to scan the QR code on the packaging to learn the entire story behind the produce, including the fields from where the fruit was harvested, the farmer involved and how the by-product from the fruit was extracted. Only sustainably harvested bio-resources are being utilized to make the products which are set to be marketed under GSBB brand name ‘GoVan’. “We have only just introduced the first few products and we are in the process of taking feedback from consumers and standardizing them (the products). The products are currently only available for sale with the board and at the multiprocessing centre at Pale. Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), the local biodiversity management committee and the panchayat organized training for the women involved at the processing centre, while it was Goa Shipyard limited (GSL) who provided the funds under corporate social responsibility (CSR) to help set up the state-of-the-art plant,” said GSBB member secretary Pradeep Sarmokadam, adding that trainers from Kerala were also brought in to train the women in processing jackfruit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/biodiversity-board-helping-local-communities-sell-local-produce/articleshow/82694972.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

With gusty winds blowing citizens pointed out that the flag ran the risk of either tearing off or coming off and falling to the ground. Messages and videos of the flag which appeared on the verge of being torn apart were being forwarded. Around 10am the flag finally tore from its attachment and landed about 100 meters away in front of Sai Baba Temple. A team of Vasco railway police picked up the flag in the heavy rain and strong wind as few onlookers also rushed to help due to the bulk of the flag at the Joshi Chowk circle. Photos of the police helping retrieve the flag were circulated and was appreciated by residents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vasco-railway-cops-retrieve-natl-flag/articleshow/82694993.cms||---
---||Pune||Post-Covid infection kills Congress MP Rajeev Satav||PUNE: Congress's Rajya Sabha member and former national president of Indian Youth Congress Rajeev Satav died at a private hospital here due to post-Covid complications on Sunday. He was 47. Satav was an alumni of Fergusson College. "After testing positive, he had recovered and tested negative. But he suffered from bacterial infections which damaged his lungs and he succumbed," state health minister Rajesh Tope said. Satav was admitted to the hospital in April-end and was on ventilator support. After his recovery, he was diagnosed with a cytomegalovirus infection which made him critical. His case yet again underscores the challenges of post-Covid care and the growing susceptibility to opportunistic infections caused by lowering of immunity levels. "We have lost a learned and promising leader," deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said. Leader of the opposition in the state assembly Devendra Fadnavis said, "The death of Congress leader Rajeev Satav is very shocking. May his family get the strength to come out of this grief," he said. Satav's political journey was impressive. He started out as a panchayat samiti member in 2002, became the national president of the Indian Youth Congress in 2010), served as an MLA in 2009-14, and later as a member of both the Lok Sabha (2014-19) and Rajya Sabha (2020). A close confidant of former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, Satav was given key responsibilities, including the role of Congress in-charge of Gujarat during the assembly elections in 2017. Satav, whose mother was Rajnitai Satav, defied the 'Modi wave' in 2014 to win in Hingoli. A science graduate who later completed his law studies from Pune, Satav was a soft-spoken politician who connected with the masses. He is survived by his wife and two children. In his condolence tweet, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, "Anguished by the passing away of my friend from Parliament, Shri Rajeev Satav Ji. He was an upcoming leader with much potential. Condolences to his family, friends and supporters. Om Shanti." In his tweet, Rahul Gandhi, said, "I'm very sad at the loss of my friend Rajeev Satav. He was a leader with huge potential who embodied the ideals of the Congress. It's a big loss for us all. My condolences and love to his family." Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said, "Due to his humble nature, Rajeev Satav has developed many friends beyond party and politics. He was known as a scholar who had deep faith in the parliamentary system." The last rites will be performed at Kalamnuri in Hingoli on Monday, local Congress functionaries said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/post-covid-infection-kills-congress-mp-rajeev-satav/articleshow/82696628.cms||---

It was producing 50 tonnes a day and was catering to the oxygen needs of central and southern districts. Even as hospitals from those regions got alarmed and started sending out alerts, officials at the nodal centre for oxygen swung into action and diverted supplies from north and other places to make up for the shortfall. Some private hospitals in Chennai city too ran low on oxygen supplies on Sunday and made desperate calls to the government helpline (104) requesting support. Bigger hospitals such as Fortis in Vadapalani were provided oxygen tanks just in the nick of time. AK Ravikumar, state secretary of the Indian Medical Association, said, "At present the oxygen distribution channel is working in a haphazard manner, especially while refilling the cylinders. Many hospitals are made to run from pillar to post". With oxygen refilling being done at Gummidipoondi, the vehicles had to wait for six hours for their turn. In order to prevent hoarding of cylinders, the state had barred agents at oxygen refilling points. Instead, hospitals are asked to send a representative directly to these points. “It has been a hand-tomouth existence for us as far as oxygen supply is concerned. While the average daily requirement for Tamil Nadu has been 480-500 tonnes, we have been managing with a supply of 440-470 tonnes. There is actually a gap between demand and supply,” official sources said. But they are confident that oxygen supply will get streamlined within a day or two, with Tamil Nadu implementing an action plan to ensure steady supply of the 100 tonnes of oxygen allotted from Odisha. It has deputed two officials - A Periasamy, conservator of forests, Salem, and Nishant Krishna, under-secretary in agriculture department – to be based in Bhubaneswar and Kalinganagar and coordinate the logistics.

But when they saw how people were contributing to the fight against the coronavirus, eight-year-old Mithun Sanjith and six-year-old Mithran Sanjay from Chengalpet decided to break their piggy banks and givetheir contents to the government. The coins and notes they had assiduously put away ever since they drove their dream cars at a mall two years ago made up a tidy sum. Their mother Pramila helped them count the money that came to ₹10,045. Their father Shiva, a journalist with a Tamil daily, said at first he did not take him seriously when Mithun asked if he could donate the money. The boys really wanted the toy cars, but they had put off a trip to the mall because of the pandemic. But then the children broke open the piggy bank and offered the money, saying they would rather give it away than buy the cars. Since Saturday was Mithun’s birthday, they decided to hand over the money on that day to Chengalpet collector John Louis, who gifted him a book. The collector lauded Mithun Sanjith, a class three student of V S Star matriculation school, and Mithran Sanjay, a class one student of Good Shepherd public school in Kalpakkam. Shiva said the boys used to get worried watching TV news and hearing him on the phone discussing the pandemic. They would press him not to leave home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-kids-break-piggy-banks-to-help-fight-covid/articleshow/82696631.cms||Sindhu Kannan

New cases are being reported from each village on daily basis. Urban pockets were the predominant contributors to the case load growth in the beginning of the second wave. Factors such as increased density of population, mobility, and activity level have been generally attributed to the propensity of the pandemic in the urban areas than in rural areas. But the pandemic has fast spread its tentacles to the rural Andhra Pradesh. Of the 1.37 lakh cases registered in the second week of May in Andhra Pradesh, more than 72,000 cases were identified in the rural areas of the state. For example, East Godavari officials had to set up a medical camp and restrict the entry of outsiders in Gollavilli village in Uppalaguptam mandal after the village witnessed several deaths and a series of positive cases within a short span. In several villages, the locals themselves have erected barricades made of wooden sticks or thorny bushes to block the entry for outsiders to prevent the transmission. The villages are also forming committees to check the spread of the disease. The absence of a robust health infrastructure and testing mechanism and lack of awareness over the pandemic would only make matters worse in the rural parts of the state, health experts warn. The villages are now witnessing a good response for Covid-19 vaccination programme due to increased fears over the pandemic.

The decision has been taken after discussions with representatives of tobacco growers and traders. The board had launched auctions in 21 centres on March 15. Although it continued auctions for about two months, the board has finally decided to put off the proceedings in view of the appeals from the officials and stakeholders. The farmers have so far sold about 27 million kg of stock against the total expected production of 110 million kg during the current season. Although the board has permitted growers to produce about 115 million kg, the production has dipped by about 5 million kg due to weather conditions. However, the board officials noted that the farmers produced fine quality leaf during the current season helping them get reasonably good price. According to the board chairman Yadlapati Raghunatha Babu, the growers fetched an average price of Rs 161.80 per kg against Rs 143.20 they got last season. The farmers got nearly Rs 19 per kg more than the previous year’s price, said Raghunatha Babu. He said that the tobacco auction season faced similar ordeals last year due to the first wave of Covid-19 as growers could sell only around 7 million kg by May 15. He said that they have launched the auctions well in advance by following Covid-19 protocols at all auction platforms. “With the situation going bad to worse, we have decided to put off the auctions keeping in view of the welfare of all those involved in the process including growers, traders and officials,” said the board executive director Addanki Sridhar Babu. He said that about 68 employees of the Tobacco Board tested positive and one died due to Covid during the auction season. He said that the auctions have been stalled only for one week to assess the situation. He said that the board would take a call on resuming the operations on May 24 if the situation eases in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/tobacco-board-halts-auctions-for-a-week/articleshow/82700738.cms||Samdani MN

He said APPCB has tagged all vehicles carrying bio-medical waste from Covid-19 hospitals, Covid care centres with GPS for better monitoring. Parida in a statement on Sunday said that 594 Covid-19 notified hospitals in the state are generating about 38 metric ton bio-medical waste (BMW) per day. “Even though scientific disposal of bio-medical waste of Covid-19 patients has posed the biggest challenge for APPCB, we are closely monitoring the collection, transportation and treatment of the medical waste,” said Parida. He said that APPCB has prescribed detailed guidelines for treatment and scientific disposal of Covid-19 waste at quarantine camps, quarantine homes and home care and others. AP Pollution Control Board has made it mandatory for all hospitals, dispensaries, quarantine centres and testing laboratories in the state dealing with diagnostics and treatment of Covid-19 suspected, confirmed patients to register themselves and use the mobile app while handing the medical waste with proper segregation and transportation to CBMWTFs for treatment. He said that the biomedical waste generated during Covid-19 patient isolation, testing and care needs special consideration. He said that there were 12 Common Bio Medical Waste Treatment and Disposal Facilities (CBMWTF) connected to these 594 Covid-19 notified hospitals for collection and scientific disposal of Covid-19 medical waste, for which a mobile app has been developed. He said that they have made it mandatory for the Covid-19 hospitals to register, update the generation, segregation details of medical waste through the app and transportation to the CBMWTF is also being tracked through GPS. Continuous Ambient Air Quality (CAAQ) monitoring is also being done at the CBMWTFs to ensure that the emission standards are within the permissible limits,” said Parida. APPCB has prescribed detailed guidelines for handling, treatment and disposal of Covid-19 waste. “Only used masks, gloves and tissues or swabs contaminated with blood, body fluids of patients including syringes, medicines if any generated should be treated as bio-medical waste and the same is to be collected in a separate yellow bag. Masks and gloves used by persons other than Covid-19 patients should be kept in a paper bag for a minimum of 72 hours prior to disposal of the same as general waste after cutting the same to prevent reuse,” said Parida. He said that Covid-19 positive patients in home isolation should handover domestic hazardous waste generated during home-care in a separate yellow bag to municipalities and gram panchayats who must hand it over to the nearest CBMWTFs for disposal as bio-medical waste.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/medical-waste-mgmt-emerges-as-challenge/articleshow/82688518.cms||Samdani MN

While Trinamool Congress blamed BJP for instigating the violence at a time when everyone should lend a hand to fight Covid, BJP claimed it was a local protest and the party had nothing to do with it. Three persons have been arrested. The violence started after workers from Bangnan panchayat-2 went there to clean the crematorium. When around 100 locals stopped them, police intervened and tried to reason with them. The locals attacked police, prompting a lathicharge. TMC Bagnan MLA Arunabha Sen said, “We cannot turn Bengal into Uttar Pradesh where bodies will be thrown on rivers. BJP had instigated locals.

The team plans to try and recreate the incident based on evidence collected so far. A forensic team is likely to provide technical support in this endeavour. The SIT is expected to again speak to Jorapatki villagers and try to match their statements with those recorded by five Bengal police officers from Mathabhanga. Sources said SIT wants to finetune its evidence and questions before it begins quizzing the six CISF personnel who have been individually summoned to Bhawani Bhavan headquarters in Kolkata to appear between May 25 and June 2. According to sources, the team might be stationed in Cooch Behar for some time “till they are satisfied with the investigation’s progress”.

The deceased identified as Karina Kumari was a Class IX student of Kasturba Gandhi residential school at Barmasiya and police have started an investigation to find the reason and the cause of her death. According to the police, Kumari was staying at her home with her mother Sunita Devi (38), a widow, and her two siblings -- an elder brother and a younger sister. Police said both her siblings were away from home on Saturday night and she was staying with her mother. Her mother, however, said she has no idea how was daughter was killed and said someone could have dragged her out and killed her after sexually abusing her. Talking to TOI, officer-in-charge of Shikaripara police station, Sushil Kumar, said, "Although we are yet to conclude the nature of her death, the statement of her mother is not convincing. We found that victim's mouth was stuffed with a towel.” He said they suspected the girl was burnt by pouring kerosene over her "The possibility of the deceased being raped or gang raped cannot be ruled out and can only be ascertained after the post mortem. Her mother is currently under interrogation as the prime suspect,” Kumar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/mother-suspect-in-death-of-minor-girl-in-dumka-village/articleshow/82689641.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Body of missing 66-year-old businessman found floating in river||KOLKATA: The body of a 66-year-old businessman — who had recently recovered from Covid, but was apparently exhibiting some post-recovery complications — was found floating in the Hooghly, more than 12 hours after he had gone missing under mysterious circumstances early on Sunday, and just a while before the enhanced pandemic restrictions kicked in. Shrawan Kumar Birla, a resident of Karaya Road in Ballygunge, had left home around 5am in his car. The car itself was found abandoned on the Howrah-bound flank of Vidyasagar Setu 30 minutes later by a traffic cop, the driver’s door open and the ignition keys still inside. Sources close to him told cops that Birla was an avid cyclist and morning walker, who rarely used his car in the morning. Also, he had not informed anyone before leaving. Police sources said Birla had been detected Covid-positive about 20 days ago. He was treated in hospital, and was declared negative a few days ago, but was not completely well, suffering from some post-Covid complications. His wife, too, had Covid. Police said Birla ran an car spare parts business, with an office on Prinsep Street. His wife, too, runs a business. The couple have two grown-up children — a son, settled in Mumbai, and a daughter who stays in Dubai. DCP (South) Akash Magharia said the family had not lodged any written complaint till late evening. The Hastings police station, which is investigating the case, took help of trained divers and trained Disaster Management Group (DMG) personnel, who searched the river to ascertain whether he could have fallen in. The search yielded results only around 6.30pm, when his body was found from the banks of the river in Nazirganj ghat, several kilometres downstream from the bridge on which his car was found in the morning. The body was taken to SSKM Hospital, where Birla’s wife identified it. “We have begun investigations. We cannot surmise how he died before the post-mortem report comes in,” said the DCP. “We are probing all angles, and are even trying to find out whether he had suffered some losses in his business, or was upset for some other reason.” The cops will visit the family to record their statements on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/body-of-missing-66-year-old-bizman-found-floating-in-river/articleshow/82693417.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

TOI spoke to several beneficiaries, most of them aged between 46 and 60 years, who have been administered their first jab and are currently waiting for their second dose. They said they do not understand the logic behind the decision while elderlies are concerned if the vaccine will be effective against the virus in days to come with the gap of 84 days between two doses. Rakesh Kumar, a professor said, “I was infected and my condition had deteriorated during the last wave after which I took the first dose post recovery. I was supposed to take the second dose on Tuesday but with the new decision I guess I will not be eligible the does after four weeks.” Expressing his doubts, Kumar said, “If it is beneficial to take the second dose after 10 weeks then what about others who have taken them at a gap of 28 days and 42 days?” Indu Choubey, a homemaker who got herself inoculated a month ago, was worried for her children and said, “My daughter went for her first dose on Monday and she said that she will be taking the dose only after three months. However, I was administered the vaccine within 40 days of the first dose. Why is the government taking such decisions and will it reduce the efficacy of the vaccine?” Even as beneficiaries remained confused over the efficacy and strategy of the government in increasing the gap between the two doses of Covishield, healthcare experts supported the move and said the situation remains dynamic on vaccination and government has taken a right decision. They also conceded that the gap will also provide time to prepare the healthcare system as covering the targeted population is a herculean task. Talking to TOI, public health expert and professor of preventive and social medicine at Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (Rims) Dr Devesh Kumar said, “The decision to increase the gap between the doses is correct as it is based on a study which has been concluded recently. People shouldn’t be worried about the efficacy of the vaccine as they start developing antibodies from the first shot itself and the second shot acts as a reactivator for the immune response developed by the vaccine. The efficacy remains intact and people who are going to take it after a gap of 12 weeks will surely benefit from it.” Adding further, he said, “The changes in the gap between two doses are a result of scientific study worldwide and it remains dynamic as the pandemic is still evolving.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/beneficiaries-wary-of-increased-gap-between-vax-doses-experts-back-govt-move/articleshow/82689576.cms||Gaurav Pandey

While a state-level meeting was conducted over the development on Saturday, the state government will discuss it on Sunday. Officials of the state health department told TOI that they did not keep a record of the patients infected by black fungus but said they are ready to hold a discussion with the Centre about the disease and its management on Sunday. Additional chief secretary (health) Arun Kumar Singh, however, stressed that the government is taking the rising cases of the disease seriously and is keeping a close watch on the development. He said, “We are going to hold a meeting with the Centre on Sunday to discuss the matter. The state will follow the protocols related to identification, treatment and management of mucormycosis as suggested by the Centre.” Meanwhile, state health minister Banna Gupta held a state-level meeting to review the spread of the infection, on Saturday. According to sources at Rims, Raj Hospital, Bhagwan Mahavir Medica and a private nursing home owned by Dr Abhishek Kumar Ramadhin, four patients each are being treated for black fungus apart from one at the Bokaro General Hospital. Moreover, Bokaro district has reported two deaths and one suspected case is under observation. Unofficial sources said one patient had died in Dhanbad earlier this week. ENT specialist and surgeon Dr Ramadhin said till date, one black fungus patient died at Medica whereas two others are in critical condition at Medica and his nursing home. “The only patient who died under my treatment had a heart attack and the cause was not the fungal infection as she was responding well to treatment,” he said. Ramadhin said the sudden shortage of anti-fungal medicines from the market is also causing a lot of problem during the treatment of such patients. "Just like Remdesivir, commonly used anti-fungal medicines — Amphotericin-B, Liposomal Amphotericin and Fluconazole — have vanished from the market when the cases were first reported," he said. Commenting on the situation, health minister Banna Gupta said the fungal infection has some link with the widespread use of steroids in the treatment of Covid. "According to health experts, it is not spreading like Covid virus but is infecting only those with compromised immunity. We will ensure that some effective protocol is in place soon to treat such patients and avoid more cases," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/15-cases-of-black-fungus-in-state-centre-to-hold-discussions-today/articleshow/82679927.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

---||Jaipur||Petrol prices rise again, over Rs 99/litre in Jaipur||JAIPUR: Fuel prices went up again on Sunday pushing the rates to over Rs 100 in 12 of the state's 33 districts. In Jaipur, petrol crossed Rs 99 mark as prices went up by 22 paisa ro Rs 99.02 per litre. Diesel prices also rose to Rs 91.86 with an increase of 29 paisa. During the recent state elections in various states, prices were kept unchanged, but after the results on May 3, it started increasing continuously. The price of premium petrol has risen above Rs 100 in most districts. If the trend continues, diesel would also cross the mark in two weeks. In Sriganganagar, diesel costs over Rs 95 per litre. Given the fact that the ongoing corona pandemic has dried up revenue sources of the government, it will be highly unlikely that the state will go for VAT cuts to provide relief to the people. Govt reduced VAT in FebIn February, the state government had reduced VAT on petrol and diesel by 2% to 36% and 26%, respectively, and said that reductions would cost the state a revenue loss of Rs 900 crore. After reducing VAT, it had urged the Centre to cut its taxes to reduce the burden on the people. So far, the Centre has not taken any decision to cut taxes. Rising automobile fuels prices makes every thing costlier and stokes inflationary pressure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/petrol-prices-rise-again-over-99/litre-in-jaipur/articleshow/82696731.cms||---

---||Bhopal||Gwalior’s Prachi qualifies for Tokyo Paralympic||BHOPAL: Gwalior’s canoeist, Prachi Yadav, has qualified in kayaking and canoeing for Tokyo Paralympic and she will be the only entry from India in this category at the mega event. Yadav was a champion para-swimmer for India, but switched to paracanoe at the behest of her coach, who realised she had a better chance of getting to Paralympics. Prachi has long arms, and the coach thought this would serve her well as a paddler. Talking to TOI, Prachi said, “I have no words to express my happiness at this moment. I had never thought of qualifying for the Olympics. My family is on cloud 9 after learning about my qualification.” Prachi has a disability below her waist. MP in Tokyo: No hurdle big enough to stop PrachiFor a game like kayaking and canoeing, legs play an important role. As I can’t use legs, I have to use the upper part of the body to move the boat. It becomes even more difficult when you are competing at the international level. However, with the help of coach Mayank Thakur and executive member of IOA BS Kushwaha, I could manage to reach this level in my career,” said Prachi. Hailing from a middleclass family, Prachi had lost her mother to cancer in 2003. “I have two siblings among whom I am the second. My father, Jagdish Yadav, is a retired government employee. It was not easy to take up canoeing as our financial condition was a big challenge,” said Prachi. Even for participating in the World Championship from which she has secured the qualification, she had to run from pillar to post. “Coaches and other people helped me financially and sent me for the qualification event. I can’t repay the support they have given to me,” said Prachi. Her coach Mayank Thakur who is also chairperson, Para India Kayaking and Canoeing Association, had built a special boat for her practice. “She did not have a boat. As she was a promising player me and my team made a special boat for her. Our efforts paid dividends in the form of her Paralympic qualification. She has the potential to win medals for the country,” Thakur told TOI. As there were no para players, Prachi had to practice with the other players. “She is an amazing talent. She always practised with the normal category players. I think this has also helped her develop better endurance and strength,” said Thakur. Executive member, IOA, BS Kushwaha said, “This is exemplary. She has made all of us proud. Such athletes will motivate others in the future. We have a full-fledged para water sports centre in Bhind where such players are developing.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/gwaliors-prachi-qualifies-for-tokyo-paralympic/articleshow/82696812.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Now, book 2nd jab via WhatsApp chatbot||KOLKATA: Now chat with a web robot to fix a schedule for the jab at a KMC vaccination centre. The civic body utilised the two-day weekend break to introduce a chatbot — a software application used to conduct an online chat conversation via text using artificial intelligence — that will guide people seeking the second vaccine dose and help book a slot to avoid crowding. In the first phase, KMC will offer the service for its centres at Bidhan Sishu Udyan, South City School and Roxy Cinema building. It will thereafter be extended to is centres in various wards. The Covid vaccination appointment booking system can be accessed through the WhatsApp number 8335999000. A person has to type “Hi” and the bot will then respond, guiding the person through the rest of the process. “Bookings for inoculation on May 18 will start from 10am on May17,” said an official. The KMC is offering the service in association with the state health department. According to the KMC board of administrators’ chairman Firhad Hakim, the facility would be made available for 45+ recipients at specified KMC clinics. KMC is offering the second dose of Covaxin at some of its clinics. Frontline Covid warriors, including healthworkers, can also walk into any clinic and take Covishield or Covaxin shots. Also, any individual who has taken a Covishield first dose and missed the second dose can walk in for it if 84 days have lapsed since the first jab. Those who are slated to take the jab on Monday spent the better part of Sunday trying to figure out how they can reach the vaccination venue amidst the restrictions imposed on public and private transport. “My husband and I have our second dose of vaccination scheduled on Monday but I don’t know if it would be a violation to take our motorbike to the vaccination centre. Last time, we had to stand in a queue behind 100 others for the first jab. What I have been hearing from relatives, friends and in the media, I don’t even know if I would at all get the vaccine even after risking a trip amidst the restrictions,” said Tanima Mondal (46), a resident of Behala. Kolkata Police officers, however, had a simple solution: carry proof of first vaccine dose in case you are seeking the second jab and for those seeking the first dose, produce the relevant SMS alert. Apart from KMC vaccination centres, government hospitals and a couple of private hospitals will also resume the vaccination drive from Monday between 10am and 4pm. Hospitals have arranged for bus service to pick and drop vaccinators and other officials required to run the drive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kolkata-now-book-2nd-jab-via-whatsapp-chatbot/articleshow/82696813.cms||Saikat Ray

As of now it is functional in six medical colleges of the state, said sources. An official wishing anonymity said, “Chief minister has instructed in the video conferencing that mucormycosis units will now be set up in all the 13 medical colleges of the state”. “As of now, there are around 120 patients in the six medical colleges of the state. Approximately around 35 patients are at Gandhi Medical College Bhopal and similar patients are at MGM medical college Indore”, said the official. Official sources said that government is now stepping up the treatment arrangements for black fungus. A total around 2000 doses of amphotericin injections are being procured from Gujarat; it will be delivered as soon as possible via helicopters, added official sources. Experts say that it is mainly those patients whose immune system has been compromised develop mucormycosis when they inhale mucor spores released by fungus. The excessive use of steroids and antibiotics in Covid-19 patients, has adversely affected the immune system of patients. Dr Bhuvnesh Garg who has been raising the issue of fungal infection and unchecked use of antibiotics in Covid-19 patients said, “I have been writing to everyone for the past one year, that unchecked use of antibiotics and steroids should be avoided”. Talking about the Covid-19 patients, Garg said, “It is not virus I call it myrus — term coined by Garg to express Covid-19 as a combination of virus and fungus—and most medicines have been ineffective primarily because it is not only virus but the combination of viral and fungal infections have made it deadly”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-special-units-in-all-13-govt-med-colleges-to-tackle-black-fungus/articleshow/82696847.cms||Amarjeet Singh

Senior police officials took rounds of the city to check people not coming out of their homes. Cops also kept an eye from the CCTVs installed in different city areas and tipped the local police teams. The senior officials hit the streets and took action against those venturing out without any valid reason. The police officials arrested the people unnecessary moving out, sent them to the police stations concerned of the area and later released them after completing the formalities. Officials said two buses move in different city areas to take the people moving out to the police stations. Objective is to give a message that tough action would be taken on venturing out during the pandemic. However, officials ruled out to detain such people overnight like done in the state's industrial capital Indore, pointing that it would leave the possibility of spread of coronavirus. Police remained on toes in different city areas and allowed people on streets only with a serious valid reason. Barricading and diversions were put in place to restrict the vehicular movement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/350-fined-in-a-day-for-roaming-out-without-mask-in-bhopal/articleshow/82696893.cms||---
---||Noida||Noida hospitals can’t deny treatment to those from outside district: Yogi||Noida/Ghaziabad: Since Noida is an NCR city, no hospital can deny treatment to patients from other districts, chief minister Yogi Adityanath told officials on Sunday. He also clarified that healthcare facilities should not ask for any residential proof like Aadhaar card while admitting patients. When cases had been rising by leaps and bounds in April, hospitals in Noida admitted only those patients who had local addresses on their Aadhaar cards. This is something other NCR cities like Gurgaon also followed. As a result, many patients from other districts lost their lives waiting for treatment to be initiated. Not just admissions, even the Covid control room addressed complaints of patients only if they had a local Aadhaar card. The UP government has, however, done away with a rule that made a state Aadhaar card mandatory for vaccination in the 18-44 category. The chief minister, who visited Noida, Ghaziabad and Meerut to assess the Covid situation in the three districts, also announced that three and nine oxygen plants would be set up in Noida and Ghaziabad, respectively. Across the state, his government would set up 300 such plants, the CM said. Adityanath also announced that each district in the state would have a Covid care centre or hospital for women and children. The hospitals, he said, would be equipped with ICU facilities. The chief minister said the state government had been conducting 2.5-3 lakh tests every day. “On March 2 last year, we did not have much capacity for Covid tests. Neither did we have many isolation beds for treatment of Covid patients. With support from the Centre and help from various organisations, we are conducting 2.5 lakh to 3 lakh tests every day,” Adityanath said in Noida. Adityanath also said the government would take regular updates from local monitoring committees on the situation in rural areas. “With focus on 97,000 villages across the state, the nigrani samiti are taking all necessary steps. They have also been given medicine kits,” he added. Villages across Noida and Ghaziabad have reported deaths of several people with Covid-like symptoms. The residents have also alleged lack of testing and proper treatment, which has forced many to rely on quacks. It was only after a flurry of media reports that the Noida administration began testing drives in several villages, officials have admitted in private. Earlier in the day, the chief minister also inspected the Police Lines Hospital. He also went to Bhowapur village in Ghaziabad and Chaprauli village in Noida, and interacted with residents. He also visited a Covid care centre set up by FONRWA. Officials in Noida said the administration was also preparing to conduct a survey to find out children whose parents are in hospital due to Covid or have succumbed to the infection. “We have been receiving several calls from families where both parents are battling Covid. But these children are mostly with their relatives. In such cases, we have helped them with food and medicine, and are keeping track of the children,” said Atul Soni, district programme officer. .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/noida-hospitals-cant-deny-treatment-to-those-from-outside-district-yogi/articleshow/82694938.cms||Snehil Sinha
---||Bhopal||Fearing Covid, man drinks kerosene, dies after four days in Bhopal||BHOPAL: Believing that kerosene will kill coronavirus, a man on getting fever, consumed kerosene and died. Later, his Covid test report turned out to be negative. Police said the 30-year-old man consumed kerosene to cure coronavirus on the advice of one of his acquaintances in Ashoka Garden locality on Wednesday. He died after four days of treatment at a private hospital on Saturday night. He was about to celebrate his first marriage anniversary in June. Investigating officer ASI Rajkumar Dubey said that the deceased Mahendra, 30, resided with his family in Shiv Nagar Hinotia area in Ashoka Garden and worked as a tailor. During investigation it came to light that he was suffering from fever for the past five to six days. He was taking medicines, but to no avail. “He was afraid that he was infected of Covid-19,” said ASI Dubey adding that he consumed the fuel on Wednesday around 9 pm at his residence. His condition started deteriorating and his family members rushed him to a private hospital nearby where they could not arrange a bed for him and were informed by hospital authorities to take him Hamidia hospital. Around two days back, when his family members were informed that a bed was available at a private hospital in Ashoka Garden, they shifted him there. Doctors declared him dead on Saturday night at around 11 pm. ASI Dubey said that his family members asked hospital authorities to take a sample of Covid-19 after which he was tested negative.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/fearing-covid-man-drinks-kerosene-dies-after-four-days/articleshow/82696926.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Data mismatch among government agencies hits bed allocation||BENGALURU: The Karnataka government’s efforts to streamline hospital bed management system appear to be only on paper, as confusion still persists on the ground and desperate families run from pillar to post. Following the alleged bed-blocking scam, changes were promised but the government has been unable to reconcile data mismatch among its own agencies. For instance, at 9.30pm on Sunday, according to data displayed on the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike’s Centralised Hospital Bed Management System (CHBMS), 3,628 beds were available in hospitals across the city. Of these, 70 are high dependency units beds (HDU), 14 are intensive care unit beds and seven are ICU beds with ventilators. The data said 701 patients were admitted, of which 284 were sent to HDU, while seven occupied ICU beds and 13 got ventilators. However, data collated by the Citizen Help Desk (CHD) devised by BBMP chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta gives a different picture. The CHD, which has deployed volunteers at private hospitals, collates data based on physical verification of bed status and indicates there are 2,420 vacant beds at 9.30pm on Sunday. These include 193 HDU, 9 ICU and 18 ICU beds with ventilators. The CHD said it was collating data of admission till late night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-data-mismatch-among-government-agencies-hits-bed-allocation/articleshow/82696895.cms||B V Shiva Shankar

The United Nations General Assembly has designated May 21 as the International Tea Day based on the proposal put forward by the Government of India in 2015 FAO Intergovernmental Group (IGG) on Tea. The Tea Board of India in its order dated May 5, 2021, notified all the producers to pluck their best quality tea – two leaves and a bud – for a ‘limited edition’ on May 21 and manufacturing on the next day followed by a special auction. “Both estates and bought-leaf factories can participate in this voluntary endeavour…while the maximum number of packages sent for auction should not exceed five and a manufacturing unit can offer five lots only for all categories of teas (CTC & orthodox),” said the Tea Board order. Premier tea planters’ body Indian Tea Association (ITA), too, is organising an online International Tea Conference to boost sustainability and marketability of tea in the post-Covid era. “We shall try to discuss with the tea experts across the globe and discover the way forward to the inclusive development of the sector. The goal is to encourage collective action in promoting the sustainable production and consumption of tea. Experts from Unicef, tea associations of the US, Russia (Rosteacoffee), Iran, Malaysia and Egypt will provide their inputs,” ITA said in a statement. Representatives from the Union commerce ministry, labour ministry, Government of Assam, GAIN and Solidaridad will also speak at the daylong online seminar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tea-inc-to-brainstorm-on-finding-ways-to-uplift-industry/articleshow/82695025.cms||---
