But thanks to the digital space, this new platform for the performing artistes helped them sustain the difficult times to some extent. Heres's what they had to say: 'Digital concerts have contributed to better mental health and happiness' While the online dance space came as a respite for us during the pandemic, considering it a sustainable mode of living sometimes posed a huge challenge. I have performed in over 30 digital concerts over the past few months and also taken masterclasses, apart from performing digitally in UNESCO’s amnesty international concert. My performances during the pandemic reached out to a much larger audience. By eliminating the logistical and economic barriers brought about by travel and hospitality requirements, organisers and dancers have been able to arrange more performances by taking advantage of global Internet connectivity. I believe digital concerts have contributed significantly to better mental health and happiness during troubled times. — Sohini Roychowdhury, Bharatnatyam dancer'Performing in digital concerts can never match up to the experience of performing live on stage' The pandemic has been a huge blow for performing artistes. Since the time we faced a lockdown last year, survival has been a challenge for most of us. No matter how many online classes you take or perform in digital concerts, it can never match up to the experience of performing live in front of the audience. Of late, hardly any Tollywood films is being shot, where there are several dance numbers or item songs. In the past few months, I have noticed that not many youngsters are interested in attending virtual dance classes or paying a nominal fee. But thanks to social media and online platforms, connecting with other dancers across the globe has been easier and I have also been a part of a few online dance workshops during the pandemic. — Sandy Rong, dancer, Tollywood choreographer||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-dancers-tell-us-how-digital-performances-helped-them-sustain-amid-the-covid-19-pandemic/articleshow/82356190.cms||Srishti Dasgupta

Making an announcement about the summit, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said it will be an important opportunity to elevate the multi-faceted strategic ties and enhance cooperation on regional and global issues of mutual interest. "A comprehensive roadmap 2030 will be launched during the summit, which will pave the way for further expanding and deepening India-UK cooperation over the next decade across five key areas," the MEA said. It said the five areas are: people-to-people relationship, trade and prosperity, defence and security, climate action and healthcare. Johnson was to visit India late last month. But days before the visit, he called it off in view of the coronavirus pandemic. "India and UK enjoy a Strategic Partnership since 2004. It has been marked by regular high-level exchanges and growing convergences in diverse areas," the MEA said. "The summit will be an important opportunity to elevate our multi-faceted strategic ties and enhance cooperation on regional and global issues of mutual interest," it said in a statement. The MEA said both the leaders will also discuss Covid-19 cooperation and the global efforts to fight the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-modi-to-hold-virtual-summit-with-british-counterpart-boris-johnson-on-tuesday/articleshow/82360210.cms||---

The principal secretary to the LG will be a special invitee. The CMG will interact with other officers and medical specialists as necessary,” an official spokesperson said. The CMG will meet daily to review the rapidly evolving Covid-19 situation in terms of cases, testing rates, positivity, mortality, recovery, hospital occupancy and other parameters and also review oxygen and medicine requirements and availability at all health institutions. “The group will also take immediate measures for preventing the spread and control of infection and manage the availability of resources, monitor the vaccine rollout and fine-tune vaccination strategies to ensure speedy and complete coverage at the earliest,” he added. On Saturday J&K recorded the highest-ever fatalities in the last 24 hours with 47 deaths, raising Covid death toll to 2,330, while the UT also reported its biggest single-day spike of 3,832 new cases, taking the total to 1,79,915. Meanwhile, curfew was extended till May 6 in four districts, namely Srinagar, Baramulla, Budgam, and Jammu due to rising cases of infection. On the other hand, curfew will continue in all municipal/urban local body limits of all 20 districts of Jammu & Kashmir, including the above four districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jk-constitutes-crisis-management-group-to-tackle-covid-19-spike/articleshow/82360353.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

Four people undergoing Covid-19 treatment at Acharaya Shri Chander Colleges of Medical Sciences and Hospital (ASCOMS) had died on Saturday and Sunday, and family members of one of the patients had alleged that the deaths were caused due to shortage of oxygen, while hospital management denied it. Financial commissioner, health and medical education department, Atal Dulloo appointed Jammu divisional commissioner Raghav Langer to look into the circumstances leading to the incident. The order issued by the divisional commissioner said that the inquiry officer would look into the circumstances leading to the incident. It was alleged that the patients had died at the hospital because authorities had cut off the oxygen supply for some time for reasons best known to them. A video had also surfaced on social media wherein the relatives of a deceased accused the hospital administration of “snapping” the oxygen supply, prompting authorities to take notice of the incident. Earlier, the director principal of ASCOMS Dr Pavan Malhotra had denied allegations of shortage of oxygen. “The oxygen supply to the hospital is adequate and we are not admitting any non-Covid patients to focus on the care of Covid patients," the principal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/probe-ordered-into-death-of-4-covid-patients-in-jammu/articleshow/82360404.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

Minister of external affairs S. Jaishankar is flying to London to attend the G-7 foreign and development ministers’ meeting commencing Monday and will also hold a bilateral meeting with UK foreign secretary Dominic Raab. As for whether the UK could share surplus vaccine stock with India, Raab said: "In terms of vaccines, they have their contracted supply. I have not had a request on that." Johnson and Modi are expected to agree to deepen cooperation, including on fighting the pandemic. "The terrible images we have seen in India recently are all the more powerful because of the close and enduring connection between the people of the UK and India. The UK will always be there for India in its time of need," Johnson said. The ventilators will be sent from the UK’s surplus supply to Indian hospitals to help the most severe Covid cases. Chief medical officer Chris Whitty and chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance are providing advice and expertise to their Indian counterparts whilst NHS England is establishing a clinical advisory group to support India’s Covid response. The group, which includes researchers, nurses and health professionals who have experience of India’s healthcare system, will work with Indian institutions such as AIIMS to share experience on managing Covid outbreaks. Virgin Atlantic flew 200 boxes of oxygen concentrators to Delhi on Saturday after partnering with Khalsa Aid. Further cargo space will be given free of charge on Virgin Atlantic flights this week, in association with the Red Cross. The British Asian Trust’s "Oxygen for India" appeal, personally backed by the Prince of Wales, has raised more than £1.5 million (Rs 15 crore).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/uk-sends-1000-more-ventilators-to-india-ahead-of-modi-bojo-virtual-meeting-on-tuesday/articleshow/82360540.cms||NAOMI CANTON
---||India||No patient shall be denied hospitalisation, essential drugs for lack of local residential proof: Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has directed the Centre to formulate within two weeks a national policy on admissions to hospitals in the wake of the second wave of Covid-19 and said no patient shall be denied hospitalisation or essential drugs in any state for lack of local residential proof. A three-member apex court bench, comprising Justice D Y Chandrachud, Justice L Nageswara Rao and Justice Ravindra Bhat also directed the Centre and state governments to notify that any clampdown on information on social media or harassment caused to individuals seeking help on any platform will attract coercive action. "The Central government and state governments shall notify all chief secretaries, directors general of police, commissioners of police that any clampdown on information on social media or harassment caused to individuals seeking/delivering help on any platform will attract a coercive exercise of jurisdiction by this court. The registrar (judicial) is also directed to place a copy of this order before all district magistrates in the country," it said in the order uploaded on the SC website late on Sunday night. The bench, headed by Justice D Y Chandrachud, said till the formulation of a national policy by the Centre on admissions to hospitals, "no patient shall be denied hospitalisation or essential drugs in any state/UT for lack of local residential proof of that state/UT or even in the absence of identity proof." The top court also directed the Centre to ensure that the deficit in the supply of oxygen to the national capital is rectified before May 3 midnight. "The Central Government shall, in collaboration with the states, prepare a buffer stock of oxygen for emergency purposes and decentralize the location of the emergency stocks. The emergency stocks shall be created within the next four days and are to be replenished on a day to day basis, in addition to the existing allocation of oxygen supply to the States," the bench said. It further said that emergency stocks shall be created within the next four days and is to be replenished on a day-to-day basis, in addition to the existing allocation of oxygen supply to the states. The top court also directed the Centre to revisit its initiatives and protocols, including the availability of oxygen, availability and pricing of vaccines, and availability of essential drugs at affordable prices. It asked senior advocates Jaideep Gupta and Meenakshi Arora, appointed as amicus curiae, to collate and compile these suggestions submitted by various parties. The matter is listed for the next hearing on May 10. The directions were passed in a suo motu case for ensuring essential supplies and services during the Covid-19 pandemic. The bench has taken up issues such as the projected demand for oxygen in the country at present and in the near future, how the government intends to allocate it to "critically affected" states and its monitoring mechanism to ensure supply. The Supreme Court had earlier made clear that any attempt to clampdown on the free flow of information on social media, including a call for help from people, would be treated as contempt of the court. "There should be free flow of information; we should hear voices of citizens. This is a national crisis. There should not be any presumption that the grievances raised on the Internet are always false. Let a strong message be sent to all the DGPs that there should not be any kind of clampdown," the bench had said while reserving its order on April 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-patient-shall-be-denied-hospitalisation-essential-drugs-for-lack-of-local-residential-proof-supreme-court/articleshow/82360861.cms||---
---||India||Khela Over: Mamata is Didi beyond Bengal||NEW DELHI: Mamata Banerjee on Sunday appeared to be on course to win another two-thirds majority in what was billed as the mother of all state electoral battles, decisively beating back BJP’s all-out assault led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah’s leadership, on Fort Bengal. Apart from a third straight term, Didi — who rose from her wheelchair on the day of her triumph — looked set to improve upon her very impressive 211-seat tally in 2016. This belied the dominant national narrative of either a BJP victory or a close contest, shaming pollsters. It at once bolstered her credentials as claimant to the leadership of the next anti-BJP alliance and exposed the limits of BJP in geographies defined by stubborn regional identities and demographies, hindering saffron dreams of countrywide dominance. Read AlsoHow Mamata countered BJP’s Bengal rise to score a hattrickIt was an election with many firsts for Mamata Banerjee. In a career spanning almost four decades, she had never contested a seat outside south Kolkata — much less against an estranged aide who jumped ship a few months prior to the polls. A spate of further poll-eve defections posed anotherTo be sure, Banerjee was not the only victor on Sunday. In Tamil Nadu, M K Stalin led DMK to victory, although smaller than expected, after a decade-long spell in the opposition. In Kerala, incumbent Pinarayi Vijayan defied the revolving-door rhythm of state politics to pull off a landslide for CPM — a feat that stood out also because of the rout fellow comrades suffered in Bengal. BJP too made history of sorts by scoring, along with its allies, an emphatic win over a Congress-led opposition in Assam, thus becoming the only non-Congress grouping to have retained office in the state. It opened its account in Tamil Nadu and registered a decent vote share in the face of the gale blowing in CPM's favour in Kerala. In tiny Puducherry, N Rangaswamy, founder of NR Congress, accomplished a giant personal success. He pulled NDA, which has BJP and AIADMK as junior partners, to a comfortable victory at Congress's cost and is set to begin his third term as CM. The results were marked by slow counting, perhaps due to Covid protocols. As of 11.15pm on Sunday, the EC was yet to declare 163 of 234 results in Tamil Nadu, 36 of 126 results in Assam, three of 140 in Kerala, three of 30 in Puducherry and 39 of 292 in West Bengal. The slow pace of results being declared meant that TOI was unable to process the results for final vote shares, though the broad trends were unlikely to change very much in the final stages of counting. Read AlsoBengal halts Sangh, lets daughter flyKOLKATA: Mamata Banerjee won the most important match of her life as Bengal’s voters reposed their faith in their “nijer meye (own daughter)” and propelled her to office for a third straight term. Her party, Trinamool Congress, comfortably went past the two-thirds mark in the 294-seat assembly,From the trends that emerged, Banerjee clearly outshone all others. It had to do, in almost equal measure, with the scale of her victory, the nature of opposition, and the tactics she deployed. At midnight, TMC had either won or was leading in about 215 of the 294 seats up for grabs, leaving BJP far behind with 75. The score looked even more impressive considering that she posted it in the face of a ferocious saffron challenge. Encouraged by their success in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections when BJP stunned Banerjee by winning 18 of the 42 seats, BJP poured enormous amounts of energy and resources into the Bengal campaign in a determined bid to gain control of a state that remains a pocket of defiant resistance. Read AlsoMamata, Vijayan, Stalin: As Congress fades, regional satraps provide real oppositionIn the 1990s, regional parties chipped away at Congress’s hold on power, with the United Front government marking the high point of the process, vastly enhancing the clout they first wielded during the V P Singh-led coalition, propped up from outside by BJP and Left Front. They were part of theThe PM led from the front, addressing large and enthusiastic throngs as he sought to wow the state by dangling promises of "ashol poriborton (genuine change)” and “Sonar Bangla (revival of Bengal's old glory)”. His powerful oratory seemed to supplement a grassroots effort that weaponised the chant of Jai Shri Ram to polarise the electorate over Banerjee's "appeasement" of minorities and sought to capitalise on allegations of corruption and high-handedness by Trinamool leaders. Read AlsoElection El Clásico in Nandigram goes down to the wireBattleground Nandigram produced an epic poll confrontation on Sunday as Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee and former aide Suvendu Adhikari engaged in an attritional contest that went down to the wire, with both candidates alternatively leading and trailing through each round of counting.However, the Trinamool boss, who paid a big price for underestimating Modi's pull in the LS polls, was alive to the challenge this time. She blunted the Hindutva charge by flaunting her credentials as a Shandilya Brahmin who could recite the ‘Chandi Path’ and, perhaps more crucially, whipped up nativist sentiments by cautioning the electorate against "outsiders" and unleashing “Joy Bangla" as a counterweight to Jai Shri Ram. West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee visits Kalighat Temple (PTI photo)The feisty leader, who burst into the limelight by taking on CPM cadres during the over three-decade-long ‘red’ hegemony, also turned the foot injury she suffered into attack ammo to punish BJP, which was hamstrung by the lack of an organisation and a face which could even remotely rival Banerjee — a weakness that helped the CM cast herself as Bengal's own daughter. The dramatic collapse of CPM and Congress facilitated her task, with anti-BJP sections coalescing around her. TMC supporters in Kolkata celebrate the party’s victory in the West Bengal legislative assembly elections on SundayThe spectacular win has propelled Banerjee into contention for who should lead the opposition to BJP at the all-India level. Her claim looks stronger than it did at the time of her two previous victories. Congress seems to be in interminable decline and the field, once studded with formidable satraps, has few challengers left. Unlike Stalin, Banerjee prevailed in a direct contest with BJP, and this leaves her better placed, with the support of the ‘Left liberal’ intelligentsia who backed her because of their hostility to BJP, acting as a force multiplier – at least unless and until Akhilesh Yadav defies odds in UP early next year. She is also better connected and has raised her profile with her relentless opposition to BJP. Read AlsoAfter 44 years, Kerala picks repeat over rebootThe ruling Left Democratic Front in Kerala won a historic second term in office, thanks to its level-headed and scrupulous management of the pandemic and CM Pinarayi Vijayan’s ability to withstand everything that a strident and combined Congress-BJP opposition threw at him. Vijayan’s no-nonsenseCongratulations poured in for Banerjee from all opponents of BJP who, uncomfortable with the saffron party’s strength and ambition, were apprehensive of the consequences of another satrap's downfall for themselves. But Congress and others are unlikely to acquiesce to Banerjee's claim for primacy easily. The loss in Bengal looks an even bigger setback for BJP both because of the investment it made into dislodging Banerjee and the timing. The defeat, which dwarfed its success in taking its tally from three to 75, comes just when the Centre is struggling to contain the fresh surge of Covid-19, which has raised questions and attracted criticism about its handling of the pandemic. The outcome on Sunday raises the party's stakes in early containment and may energise sections of the liberal intelligentsia who have increasingly been playing combatants in the partisan arena. It also renews questions about a strategy that relies on Modi's appeal to prevail in territories where it has no organisation to speak of and its cupboard is empty of faces recognisable beyond a district or two — a takeaway that should gladden satraps like Assam deputy CM Himanta Biswa Sarma, former Rajasthan CM Vasundhara Raje or, for that matter, Karnataka CM B S Yediyurappa. In 2019, the party benefited because Modi himself was in the fray. The advantage was lost this time. BJP tried to overcome the weakness by inducting leaders from Trinamool and other rivals but the jury is out on the effectiveness of imports with many believing that it may have ended up demotivating the faithful and blunting Trinamool’s 'incumbency'. It was never going to be an easy battle considering Bengal was a ‘tough terrain’, given the 27% share of Muslims in the electorate. Its emergence as the principal opposition at the cost of established players like the Left and Congress in such an adverse setting is no mean political feat. The state is likely to turn into a bipolar polity, at least in the near run. BJP can take solace from its success in retaining office in Assam where it overpowered a seemingly formidable alliance of Congress and Muslim outfit AIUDF — an impressive achievement considering that its pre-eminence is of recent vintage and because Muslims account for one-third of the electorate. The decision to remain aligned with AIADMK and keep it from unravelling turned out to be the right call. Not only did outgoing CM Edappadi Palaniswami defy popular wisdom to turn in a smart performance but also helped the party win four seats in the Tamil Nadu assembly. In Kerala, the party may have failed to win a seat but it held on to its vote share even in a landslide for LDF. It is, of course, part of the ruling NRC-led alliance in Puducherry. The win in Assam and the fact that Banerjee was constrained to cast herself as a practising Hindu speaks to the strength of BJP’s campaign themes, which will again be unleashed in the Uttar Pradesh polls. While UP, with 80 Lok Sabha seats, has always been key to BJP’s prominence at the national level, the Bengal debacle will transform next year's state polls into a must-win contest for the saffron side. Congress seems to be in dire straits after the stinging reverses, with the piggybacking on DMK in TN unable to mask what seems to be an inexorable slide into decline and, in the case of Bengal, irrelevance. The huge loss to the incumbent CPM-led LDF in Kerala, where it was defeated in spite of being on the right side of the pattern where the state favours the two contestants by turns, represents a personal setback for Rahul Gandhi. He, rightly anticipating his defeat in UP’s Amethi in 2019 had embraced the southern state like his political home. The Wayanad MP was involved in selection of candidates and took charge of the campaign. In the event, Congress was routed across the state, suffering losses even in pockets dominated by its ally, Indian Union Muslim League. Surprise tie-ups with Badruddin Ajmal's AIUDF and controversial rabble-rousing Muslim cleric Abbas Siddiqui achieved little except raising questions about the party's claim to be ‘secular’. The success of Assam deputy CM Himanta Biswa Sarma and Rangaswamy in Puducherry also served as fresh reminders of the leadership's inability to accommodate resourceful regional leaders. The ignominy in Bengal and the defeats in Kerala, Assam and Puducherry are sure to escalate worries about the effectiveness of a leadership structure where Rahul, while professing aloofness, continues to call the shots. He and sibling Priyanka were directly involved in the Assam effort as well. Congress has promised to hold elections for president and the results on Sunday have increased the likelihood that the contest may not be a token exercise – especially since the Gandhis are without the services of their chief troubleshooter Ahmed Patel and also because resourceful leaders like Kamal Nath could be eyeing their chances. Leaders like Punjab CM Amarinder Singh, who has been resentful of the leadership's attempt to promote his tormentor Navjot Singh Sidhu, are likely to show more boldness. In fact, the weakened Gandhis may find themselves dealing with an eruption of aspirations in other states – Chhattisgarh, for instance, as well. CPM's marginalisation in Bengal despite an opportunistic alliance with an Islamic cleric at the cost of its plank of ‘secularism’ is a blow to the party’s central leadership. The victory in Kerala may have spared the party the unwelcome prospect of not being in office in even one state, but the achievement there is ascribed by most to Vijayan. The CM, who was already asserting himself, is likely to seek and get more autonomy now. To add to the party's worries, the Bengal result has also brought out the readiness of BJP-hating Left sympathisers to shift their allegiance if they find the comrades unequal to the Hindutva challenge.

They were part of the power equation when Congress-led UPA held office and have proved resilient even after PM Modi won back-to-back Lok Sabha majorities.

At 7.54pm, Adhikari tweeted from his official handle, claiming he had won by 1,736 votes. After the last (17th) round of counting, the TMC agent demanded a recount, but the returning officer turned it down. This prompted senior TMC leaders — Derek O’Brien, Firhad Hakim and Kalyan Banerjee — to meet CEO, demanding a recount. Later, EC sources said there was no scope of even the poll panel questioning the result of the returning officer, under the Representation of People’s Act, 1951. The only way was to file an election petition in the high court. The EC’s website, updated around 11pm, declared Adhikari the winner by a margin of 1,956 votes. Banerjee had earlier said she would “accept the verdict of people in Nandigram”, but also demanded a “review”, alleging “irregularities”. She also indicated she was mulling legal action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/adhikari-wins-nandigram-battle-didi-may-move-court/articleshow/82361937.cms||---
---||Delhi||Centre asks HC to recall order on oxygen supply to Delhi with contempt warning||NEW DELHI: The Centre on Sunday moved an application before the Delhi high court bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli, seeking recall of its Saturday order in which it had directed it to provide Delhi its allocated quota of 490 metric tonnes (MT) of medical oxygen, adding that it would consider initiating contempt proceedings in case of non-compliance. The bench has directed the Delhi government to file a reply on the Centre's plea by Tuesday and will take up the matter on Wednesday. The court also clarified that it hadn’t initiated any contempt action. "We have not initiated contempt. That’s the last thing we have on our mind. We know everyone is working hard," the bench remarked, observing that the government officials were carrying out their duties despite being infected. Delhi government’s counsel Rahul Mehra urged solicitor general Tushar Mehta to withdraw the application, stressing that it would only cause prejudice to Delhi’s citizens. "Prejudice will be caused to the citizens. It’ll cost many lives. Lives have been saved because of the orders. We are very grateful," said Mehra. Mehta told the court that Delhi’s allocation had been increased to 590 MT but there ought to be a system in place so that it reaches the capital. "First of all, I must acknowledge the work done by Delhi government officers. They are working overnight, shoulder to shoulder. There is not even a remote suggestion that they are not working. I understand that they are stretched…" he said. "The Centre is providing tankers. Centre would help… It can’t be a situation where every state starts doing it. Lakshadweep is arranging tankers. A large number of non-industrial states are arranging tankers. What is required is being done," he said. The solicitor general said the supply chain of liquid medical oxygen was a scenario that was changing every day. He attributed Delhi’s predicament to a "systemic failure" and said he had no intention of hinting at or pointing fingers at anyone. "When I say systemic failure, I’m not hinting at any government. I do mention, I mean every word of it. Systemic failure is that we have a situation where every hospital comes at the last minute. We are firefighting for them. For a small state like Delhi, can’t there be a system where all hospitals make real-time data available to the state government that 12 or six hours down the line, we would need oxygen? Systemic failure doesn’t mean the state has failed," said Mehta. He said a system needs to be evolved where one didn’t have to face a burnout. He suggested using GPS to track diversion of tankers. "Please put a system in place so that you don’t have to work at midnight. Ultimately, no government, whichever party you take, can afford a situation where citizens of Delhi suffer. The question is not the intention. Intentions are good. There is something lacking somewhere. It can be done with administration… People have to sit together with experts. Find out the modalities. Find them fast. Every state is supposed to do it. It’s not a crisis where we can nationalise all tankers and distribute. Impact of the pandemic in each state would differ," said Mehta. On the argument that the Centre had been offering assistance to Delhi and the Delhi government’s stand that it had reached out to Centre for assistance on multiple occasions, the court said: "The point is that there are allegations and counter-allegations. But the point is that we are dealing with a much larger issue. We are dealing with the lives of hundreds of people." The high court also reiterated that Delhi didn’t innately have the facility of cryogenic tankers. "Delhi is not an industrial state. From where will it requisition… It can only use the good offices of industrialists. Suppose they are willing but their state has a requisition, then that’s a problem," it remarked. During the hearing, advocate Ashok Sharma, who was representing the city's MD City Hospital, said that they had stock of medical oxygen only for an hour. "We have 140 patients. My heart is sinking," he said. Similarly, advocate Arvind Nayar, representing Venkateshwara Hospital, said it had 225 patients on oxygen support and the hospital’s efforts to get through to the nodal officer had failed. "Thirty minutes left for oxygen," the counsel said. Advocate Amit Shara, who appeared for Institute of Brain and Spine, pleaded that only half an hour’s medical oxygen supply was left at the facility. "We have about 40 patients," he said.

" Advocate Shyel Trehan informed the court that at the facility she was representing people would start dying. "Down to the wire," she said pleading for oxygen supply. The court directed Delhi government’s lawyer, advocate Satyakam, to immediately take up the pleas of the hospitals. The court noted that it was grappling with the issue of oxygen shortage which could be resolved with everyone, including the suppliers, working in tandem.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/centre-asks-hc-to-recall-order-on-oxygen-supply-to-city-with-contempt-warning/articleshow/82362075.cms||Aamir Khan

This followed reported efforts on social media by two foreign missions to source oxygen cylinders from Indian Youth Congress chief BV Srinivas who has become the ‘go to’ person for Covid-related help on Twitter. The New Zealand high commission tweeted on Sunday morning from its official handle tagging Srinivas and his team about an urgent requirement for oxygen. Later though, it deleted the tweet and said in another tweet that it was trying all sources to arrange for oxygen cylinders urgently and its appeal had “unfortunately been misinterpreted, for which we are sorry”. While the Philippines embassy was also said to have sought and received oxygen cylinders from the Youth Congress, External affairs minister S Jaishankar said this was an unsolicited supply. “MEA checked with the Philippines embassy. This was an unsolicited supply as they had no Covid cases. Clearly for cheap publicity by you know who. Giving away cylinders like this when there are people in desperate need of oxygen is simply appalling,” tweeted Jaishankar. The minister was responding to a tweet by Congress leader Jairam Ramesh in which he expressed surprise that Youth Congress was having to respond to SOS calls from foreign embassies and sought to know if MEA was sleeping. The MEA also issued a statement in which, given the pandemic situation, it urged “all” not to hoard essential supplies, including oxygen. “The Chief of Protocol and Heads of Divisions are in continuous touch with all high commissions/embassies and MEA is responding to their medical demands, especially those related to Covid. This includes facilitating their hospital treatment,” said MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi. The Youth Congress-verified handle posted screenshots though to claim that they had indeed received a request for cylinders from the Philippines embassy for two patients. They also posted snippets of conversation with a supposed embassy representative. The cylinder delivered to the New Zealand high commission was apparently also meant for a critically ill patient. “We got a request for an urgent requirement of oxygen cylinders for two Covid patients in the Philippines embassy. The cylinders were delivered at the embassy on a much-solicited request. Post delivery, embassy thanked us on Facebook. All screenshots attached with names and number masked,” the IYC handle wrote at 11.25am. TOI checked the Facebook page of the embassy. There are two such pages: a verified and an unverified page. The verified page had stopped putting posts in May 2020. Since then, the unverified page has been active. The IYC handle screenshot matched the display picture from the unverified page. TOI, however, could not find the original post which the IYC had shared even on the unverified page. The last post on the unverified page was made on April 29.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/row-over-oxygen-supply-to-foreign-missions/articleshow/82362160.cms||---

At 7.54pm, Adhikari tweeted from his official handle that he had won by a margin of 1,736 votes after the 17th and final round of counting. The TMC agent immediately demanded a recount, which the returning officer turned down. This prompted a team of senior Trinamool functionaries — Derek O’Brien, Firhad Hakim and Kalyan Banerjee — to meet chief electoral officer Aariz Aftab, demanding a recount. My sincere thanks to the great People of Nandigram for their love, trust, blessings, and support, and for choosing… https://t.co/dDsQCLbqwu— Suvendu Adhikari • শুভেন্দু অধিকারী (@SuvenduWB) 1619965471000EC sources later said there was no scope of even the poll panel questioning the result of the returning officer under the Representation of People’s Act, 1951. The only way out was to file an election petition in the high court, they said. The EC’s website, updated around 11pm, declared Adhikari the winner by a margin of 1,956 votes. Mamata had earlier said she would “accept the verdict of people in Nandigram”, but also demanded a “review”, alleging “irregularities”. She also indicated she was mulling legal action. Speaking to the media before the results were declared, Mamata said, “I had raised the issue of Nandigram, about how votes were being looted. The entire state gave one mandate, can one constituency give another mandate? Is it possible? It is not.” The CM claimed "the servers were stopped" for around three hours. "They announce the winning (candidate) and after that they are saying something (else). This is some looting going on. Some cheating is also going on. We will seek a review. We will file a court case.” Mamata, however, said she didn’t mind losing Nandigram as “Bengal won the match” and that “sacrifices have to be made in struggles". Reminding everyone that she once stood up for Nandigram, the TMC chief said, "I had fought a movement here. But all is forgotten now. I will accept whatever verdict is given by the people of Nandigram…. In this match, we won 221 (seats); the BJP has lost face.” According to the results posted by Adhikari on his Twitter handle, it appeared that Nandigram’s fate was decided in the last round, when he took a 2,556-vote lead, reversing a narrow edge Mamata had held till the end of the 16th round of counting. Adhikari also thanked the people of Nandigram. “It’s my never-ending commitment to be of service to them and work for their welfare. I am truly grateful,” he said. Ironically, the last round of counting involved votes polled at Sonachura, in Nandigram-1 Block, believed to be a Trinamool stronghold and the epicentre of the anti-land acquisition movement in 2007. Sonachura has a majority Hindu population. Before the last round, it had appeared that Mamata would buck the initial trends to pull through in a cliffhanger of a contest. While it was Nandigram-1 Block that took her closer to a win, it also sealed her fate. In early morning trends, Mamata had trailed for the most part. It wasn’t before round 5 that she started to narrow down the lead to 3,110. As counting of votes polled in Nandigram-1 gained momentum, Mamata emerged as the clear leader. Nandigram electing Adhikari over Mamata could have political repercussions in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, where two elected Lok Sabha MPs in East Midnapore from the Adhikari family might seek re-election. They are Adhikari's younger brother Dibyendu, the Tamluk MP; and father Sisir, the Contai MP. Mamata hadn't lost an assembly election ever since she contested from Bhowanipore in 2011. Since her 1984 electoral debut, when she unseated CPM heavyweight Somnath Chatterjee in the Lok Sabha polls, she had lost an election only once — in 1989. Barring Prafulla Chandra Sen and Ajoy Mukherjee (Arambag) and Jyoti Basu (Satgachia), Kolkata has always elected Bengal’s CMs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/election-el-clsico-in-nandigram-goes-down-to-the-wire/articleshow/82362282.cms||Suman Mondal
---||India||Suvendu holds on to his ‘adhikar’ in biggest poll battle||NEW DELHI: On December 19 last year, when Suvendu Adhikari walked into the embrace of Union home minister Amit Shah at a rally in Midnapore, the Nandigram MLA was by far the most important Trinamool leader to jump ship ahead of the Bengal assembly polls. On Sunday, as TMC swept the Bengal political landscape, Nandigram’s “ghorer chhele” was back with a bang, handing his former boss a defeat he had predicted long ago. The baiting, however, had begun long ago. What happened on December 19, had also decoyed chief minister Mamata Banerjee into changing course.  Exactly a month later, on January 18, Mamata declared she would take on Adhikari in Nandigram, which had been the epicentre of Trinamool’s anti-land acquisition struggle in 2007. Along with Singur, it was instrumental in the Left’s rout in 2011. Read AlsoElection El Clásico in Nandigram goes down to the wireBattleground Nandigram produced an epic poll confrontation on Sunday as Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee and former aide Suvendu Adhikari engaged in an attritional contest that went down to the wire, with both candidates alternatively leading and trailing through each round of counting. But Adhikari’s connection with this belt goes further back. Among the 19 Lok Sabha seats TMC won in 2009, he clinched the Tamluk seat, which includes Nandigram. His grip over the agricultural cooperative banks, which extend seasonal credit to farmers, helped Trinamool win big here in 2011, and brought Banerjee to power. Even today, his hold on Midnapore East and West districts, and on Purulia and Bankura, is undeniable. Yet, Adhikari, son of former Union minister Sishir Adhikari, got off to a choppy start in the party. After the 2011 win, Mukul Roy was tasked to manage the party in the districts where Adhikari held sway. Leaders loyal to him were either replaced or not given party roles. As Kolkata-based leaders got meaty roles, Adhikari felt sidelined. Adhikari’s responsibilities grew after Roy’s name figured in some ponzi schemes around 2013. In his second innings as MLA, Adhikari held three cabinet berths. But Trinamool’s reverses in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls fettered him again. The party suffered some of its worst poll reverses in the belt Adhikari helmed. Religious polarisation became strong in both Midnapore districts. In East Midnapore, BJP’s vote share crossed 40% and came within a whisker of Trinamool’s. A trust deficit with the CM set in, especially after her nephew Abhishek Banerjee started eclipsing the party’s tier-2 leaders. People close to him say ‘Dada’ had made up his mind about moving on months before the December 19 rally with Shah.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/suvendu-holds-on-to-his-adhikar-in-biggest-poll-battle/articleshow/82362318.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Sweet 16 for TMC in Kolkata clean sweep||KOLKATA: Kolkata's faith in Trinamool Congress remained unshaken in a make-or-break assembly election for Mamata Banerjee, with the party making a clean sweep of all 16 assembly seats up for grabs. Wresting the Jadavpur seat from the Left Front — the only one it hadn't won in 2016 — made the victory sweeter.  The only scare came in central Kolkata's Jorasanko, where BJP candidate Meena Devi Purohit led Vivek Gupta of TMC for several rounds before the latter surged ahead. TMC had trailed BJP there in the Lok Sabha polls two years ago.  Rashbehari, another TMC bastion that was jolted in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, kept the party on tenterhooks for most part of the morning before TMC candidate and former mayor-in-council Debasish Kumar opened up a lead against BJP's Subrata Saha.  Two-time MLA Arup Biswas, who defeated Union minister Babul Supriyo in Tollygunge by his biggest-ever margin of 50,000-odd votes, dared his rival to try his luck again in the municipal polls. In Jadavpur, where CPM veteran Sujan Chakraborty had lost to TMC’s Debabrata Majumdar, the contest was onesided. Rinku Naskar, the CPM-turned BJP candidate, unwittingly helped TMC's cause by grabbing a 26 per cent vote share to push Chakraborty to the third spot. TMC continued its dominance in Behala with bold bets, including fielding Ratna Chatterjee, the estranged wife of former mayor Sovan Chatterjee, in Behala East. TMC's performance in North Kolkata would have given it the most satisfaction. The party had trailed in Shyampukur in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and led by only 861 votes at Maniktala. “The onus is on the new government to restore normalcy, and the path will not be easy. We have to begin fighting Covid from the beginning,” said minister Firhad Hakim, who won the Kolkata Port seat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/west-bengal-sweet-16-for-tmc-in-kolkata-clean-sweep/articleshow/82362395.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Edappadi K Palaniswami’s ratings as a chief minister were high, but his image makeover from that of an accidental CM four years ago to a survivor a year later to a performer in the past year was just not enough to retain power given AIADMK’s uninterrupted run for 10 years. The TN result shows anti-incumbency in the state is not always a roaring wave, it could be a silent undercurrent.

He was already behaving like a chiefBoth sides broadly played to their strengths. DMK’s tally was boosted by its performance in urban segments where it won 40 of its 156 seats while AIADMK had a better score in the rural parts, which elected 61 of its 78 MLAs. In seats with a minority electorate of over 20%, AIADMK surprisingly did not concede much ground despite the BJP being its alliance partner. It won 7 out of 27 such constituencies while the rest went to the DMK. EPS government’s poll-eve order allocating a 10.5% sub-quota within the most backward caste category to vanniyars—apparently to keep the PMK on its side—seems to have resulted in a backlash from AIADMK’s thevar base in southern TN. The western region where gounders (the community the CM belongs to) are predominant still gave it its biggest chunk of seats.  All in all, the DMK alliance’s efforts to paint AIADMK as one taking orders from the ‘outsider’ BJP paid dividends. On the other hand, AIADMK’s charges of the DMK being a family-controlled party did not matter, what with Stalin’s son Udhayanidhi winning his electoral debut from Thousand Lights in Chennai with a record margin. AIADMK, which forged an uneasy peace among factions following J Jayalalithaa’s death in December 2016, will now face another challenge if her former aide V K Sasikala tries to fish in troubled waters.  For Modi-Shah, the result is a double blow. Besides the failure to get a strong foothold in the heart of the South, it is also the loss of a friendly, even pliable, state government. AIADMK MPs, who were in good numbers in both houses before 2019, have been a supportive bunch, backing crucial bills such as CAA and farm laws notwithstanding the protests some of them registered in Parliament to play to their home audiences. Congress has fared somewhat better, winning 18 seats in DMK’s company. Having contested 25 this time (a climb down from 41 in 2016), the party remains a minor ally. The 2021 assembly election results have thus cemented Tamil Nadu’s image as a Dravidian fort impregnable for national parties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/stalin-grad-the-son-rises-after-10-years/articleshow/82362495.cms||---

He was already behaving like a chief minister. Some said Stalin was in a hurry, but it also showed his confidence and sense of urgency. “He told party leaders he had made so many promises, he has to start working immediately to deliver on them,” says senior DMK leader T K S Elangovan. Strategists had consciously put Stalin at the centre of DMK’s campaign. “His name has never resonated so much as it did in the past six months,” says the party’s political strategist Prashant Kishor. “Earlier, he was ‘Kalaignar’s son’, ‘former mayor’ … now… just Stalin, the person, the leader.” Read AlsoStalin-grad: The son rises after 10 years in Tamil NaduThe DMK alliance’s victory by a margin of roughly 80 seats wasn’t a surprise to many including discerning observers in the AIADMK.

Being Karunanidhi’s son helped him climb the ladder, but step by step — as DMK general council member in 1973, political prisoner during the Emergency, DMK youth wing leader in 1982, Chennai mayor from 1996 to 2002, party deputy general secretary in 2003, local administration minister in 2006 and deputy chief minister in 2009. The final leap took years. In the run-up to the 2016 assembly polls, he was unofficially projected as the CM candidate, but when the going got tough, Karunanidhi, then 92, said he would assume the top post. Even when Karunanidhi was bed-ridden in 2017, Stalin was still acting president; he was finally elected party president after Karunanidhi’s death in August 2018. And now, having won the Kolathur seat in Chennai third time in succession, the 68-year-old is ready to take over the administration’s reins. The inheritor bears the burden of expectation. “It is unfair that Stalin is always compared to his father,” says Elangovan. “Besides being a national colossus, Karunanidhi was a great orator and a writer, which Stalin is not. But the son catches up with his hard work.” Ashok Vardhan Shetty, who worked as a bureaucrat under Stalin, concurs. “He has the stamina. He works long hours and tours the state extensively,” says Shetty. “He is also courteous and listens to officials.” A consultant who worked with Stalin says the problem is he listens to too many people, making him indecisive. “A CM has to take a snap decision at times.

---||India||After 44 years, Kerala picks repeat over reboot||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The ruling Left Democratic Front in Kerala won a historic second term in office, thanks to its level-headed and scrupulous management of the pandemic and CM Pinarayi Vijayan’s ability to withstand everything that a strident and combined Congress-BJP opposition threw at him. Vijayan’s no-nonsense attitude and ability to take risks earned him the sobriquet ‘captain’, though within his own party it led to some restiveness on what it possibly portended. Although widely expected to return, the scale of LDF’s victory defied expectations --the front won 99 seats of the total 140, against 41 by the Congress-led United Democratic Front. The NDA, led by BJP, failed to gain any seats, and lost the sole Nemom seat it had in the previous assembly. By focusing on his government’s track record of development and emphasising its secular credentials, Vijayan managed to neutralise the opposition’s persistent attack on him and his government in relation to various graft cases, ranging from gold smuggling, ‘backdoor government appointments’ and the alleged move to open up deep sea fishing for multinational companies. BJP tried to revive the contentious Sabarimala issue, and was ably seconded by Congress, but that too failed to make any dent. By deftly declaring that his government was willing to abide by whatever the Supreme Court decided, he preempted the opposition from cornering him on the issue. Along with LDF’s increased tally, CPM too improved its share this time — from 63 seats in 2016 to 68, while CPI, the second largest constituent in LDF, won 17 seats, two less than in 2016. The loss of seats for allies CPI and JD(S) was in fact compensated by the entry of Kerala Congress(M). Vijayan himself acknowledged this at the post-results news conference, saying KC(M) has contributed significantly to the LDF’s emphatic victory Read AlsoComrade Vijayan is captain &amp; now doubly certified chief ministerIn Kerala, a political front has had a successive rerun in office only twice, the first time after the Emergency, and this time in anticipation of one. In 1977, the United Front merely benefited from hindsight but in 2021 Pinarayi Vijayan’s masterstroke was to conjure what lay ahead — an ‘undeclaredUDF, on the other hand, dropped six seats from its tally last time. Congress could retain its 22 seats while IUML got only 14 seats, four less from 2016. The other constituents could together contribute only five seats to the front this time, against six won by KC (M) last time. In his initial reaction to the poll results, opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala said the UDF would continue to keep a tab on the government. “We always tried to expose the follies of the government and we will continue to do so,” he said. More than the failure of the state leadership, the defeat is a severe setback for the AICC and particularly Rahul Gandhi who has been singlehandedly dictating things, right from the selection of candidates to campaigning. A bevy of AICC leaders had camped in the state for months to screen candidates and monitor campaigning. The party had believed in cashing on the anti-incumbency wave, and the majority and minority vote bank. But nothing worked in their favour as the people reposed their faith on Vijayan. It has to be believed Congress failed to read the writing on the wall.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/after-44-years-kerala-picks-repeat-over-reboot/articleshow/82362622.cms||---

The secret meeting, set up to end serial political killings, was a classic Nazi-Soviet style non-aggression pact between sworn rivals, neither of them with any illusion about the nature of the truce. Having built his entire career as a die-hard opponent of the Sangh Parivar, a ‘deal’ with RSS was a huge risk for Pinarayi to take ed the art of simultaneously appearing holier-than-thou and hard-nosed. From Sabarimala women’s entry and CAA to masala bonds and #FreeVaccines, his aggression always softened to something ambivalent and retreat was seen as the way forward. This late-career flexibility transformed him from a seemingly dour, uncompromising Stalinist to a middle-class messiah. As CPM state secretary for 17 years, Pinarayi erased whatever little family resemblance his party bore to Marxism, shifting its focus from proletariat to proprietorial class, from anti-tech to embracing the IT sector and from ‘people’s panchayats’ to professional governance. His administrative acumen was on display during the floods in August 2018 and 2019 and has continued through the pandemic. But the fight against Covid has been much more than that: thousands of young men and women volunteered precisely because Pinarayi evoked community fantasies of a second coming, of a renewed collectivity. It changed Pinarayi from just another comrade to ‘Captain’, one who transcended his party and its partisan politics. Marxism’s loss has been Kerala’s gain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/comrade-vijayan-is-captain-now-doubly-certified-chief-minister/articleshow/82362687.cms||Anil Nair

A team of Red Cross volunteers, led by mission director P Ramachandra Raju, visited Covid-19 wards at GGH on Sunday and took feedback from patients. The volunteers gathered information on the frequency of doctors’ visits, behaviour of nurses and other paramedical staff, quality of food and other services. “We have covered four wards on Sunday and will continue the survey in other wards for another 2–3 days. We will submit a comprehensive report to minister in-charge Cherukuvada Sriranganatha Raju and district collector Vivek Yadav,” said Ramachandra Raju, a recipient of the governor’s medal for services rendered by Red Cross during the first wave of the pandemic. Raju said Red Cross volunteers are also gathering information on use of vital medicines including Remdesivir at GGH. He said the minister in-charge is very particular about providing the best services to Covid-19 patients at GGH. The mission director further said at least 20 per cent patients who do not require hospitalisation are staying at the hospital and verification by senior doctors would help accommodate people in need.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/red-cross-holds-survey-at-guntur-ggh/articleshow/82359983.cms||Samdani MN

She defeated Suresh Katara of the Congress party by 45,649 votes. Out of the 93,179 votes counted for the by-election, Suthar bagged 67,457 votes. Her nearest rival, Katara polled 21,808 votes on the seat reserved for a candidate from the scheduled tribe. The bypoll was necessitated after MLA Bhupendrasinh Khant, who had contested after rebelling from the Congress as he was not given a ticket, was disqualified in May 2019 as his caste certificate was found invalid. The Gujarat high court also did not grant any relief to Khant, who died earlier this year. The Morva Hadaf seat has been jinxed so far. In 2012, Congress candidate Savita Khant had died on the day of the counting. She won the polls, but lost the battle for her life and the seat fell vacant in days. A bypoll took place and Suthar won on the seat in 2013. In the 2017 assembly polls, Bhupendrasinh emerged victorious as a rebel independent candidate. BJP’s tally in the 182-member state Assembly has gone up to 112 after winning on the seat.

While it is largely suspected that a spark in the ventilator triggered the killer blaze, several audio and video messages sought to debunk this theory while claiming that a little spark from a lighter set ablaze a huge stock of sanitizers kept in the ICU. The audio messages are believed to be conversations between two injured trainee nurses – Jaimini and Charmi Gohil – with the brother and sister of one of the deceased nurses Madhvi Padhiyar. Padhiyar’s brother Jay too shared a video message to the public stating that Gohil was pressurized by a doctor of the hospital to change her statement to salvage the reputation of the hospital. In the telephonic conversation, Gohil is heard telling Jay and Padhiyar’s sister that the fire had started because a lighter fell on sanitizers in the ICU ward. The sparks from it lit another trainee nurse Fariga Khatun’s PPE kit. Gohil also said in the call that as Padhiyar tried to help Khatun, her PPE kit also caught fire and the duo rushed into the bathroom to douse the flames. “It was in the bathroom that the electric cables were caught on fire which later engulfed the entire floor,” Gohil is heard saying in the recording. In another recording believed to be between Jaimini and Jay, she said that she did not witness the origin of fire like Gohil as she was the first to rush out after seeing the smoke. But after being rescued, Gohil told her about what had transpired. She is also heard alleging in the call that a doctor asked Gohil to not speak about the lighter but mention that the fire started due to the short-circuit in the ventilator. The two trainee nurses are, however, clueless about the presence of the lighter in the ICU. “I am not aware about this because I did not visit the hospital on Sunday. All government agencies are conducting the investigation and we are supporting them,” said Zuber Patel, trustee of Bombay Patel Welfare Society. Bharuch assistant superintendent of police, Vikas Sunda, said, “The forensic experts conducted a day-long investigation on Sunday and collected several samples. We will go by the conclusion of the forensic experts about the cause of fire, Sunda added that police are still to take statements of the two injured nurses. “Not only the nurses but we will also be taking statements of several other people including the patients. But since they are infected, we will talk to them once they recuperate,” Sunda added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/did-lighter-spark-trigger-the-killer-blaze/articleshow/82359569.cms||---

That is why the anti-incumbency worked against BJP, which is at the Centre, instead of the Trinamool, the ruling party of the state,” felt Udayan Bandyopadhyay, a political science professor at Bangabasi College. Kasturi Basu, one of the conveners of the platform, said, “The mandate has been an outright rejection of the divisive, communal politics of the fascist BJP, a rejection of the NRC-CAA-NPR politics and a rejection of BJP’s attempts at destroying the federal structure of India. The no-vote-to-BJP campaign wanted to highlight the importance of throwing out fascist politics and we are happy that the BJP vote share has come down substantially.” Echoing Basu, the president of Bangla Sanskriti Mancha said it is clear there is no place for divisive forces in Bengal. General secretary of CPI(ML) Dipankar Bhattacharya said, “The anti-BJP voices emerging out of this election will inspire and strengthen the fight against BJP in the country to save our Constitution and democracy.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/no-vote-to-bjp-move-leaves-mark-on-verdict/articleshow/82360798.cms||Dipawali Mitra

But it is time to refill them.” This was not another political promise, but a precise message to a focused electoral group — the women. Trinamool has pulled off a remarkable victory in Bengal and many poll specialists and politicians feel that Banerjee owes this win, to a large extent, to women voters who not only attended her rallies in large numbers but also queued up in the blazing heat to vote. Senior Trinamool leader Shashi Panja, who has been re-elected from Shyampukur, felt women voters in Bengal share a special relationship with Banerjee, who has fashioned several welfare schemes for them, including Kanyashree, free bicycles for girl students, free ration and health insurance (Swasthya Sathi) worth Rs 5 lakh — with the card made in the name of the woman in the family. “Mamata Banerjee has been working for women since 2011, when she came to power. This time, the women stepped out to vote for her because they want these schemes to continue,” said Panja. Forty-nine percent of voters in Bengal are women, so the party they favour is bound to reap benefits. In the current assembly election, Trinamool had fielded 50 woman candidates out of 294 seats. The women in rural Bengal faced the brunt of the pandemic and the lockdown when the men working in other states returned. Birbaha Hansda, who has won from Jhargram, said women have engineered Trinamool’s comeback in Jangalmahal after BJP swept the region in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. “People did not have food at home because men lost their jobs. Homemakers could not figure out what to do. The government’s free ration scheme came to their aid. Ration was also distributed through the mid-day meal system,” said Hansda. Rabindra Bharati University professor Biswanath Chakraborty said, “Mamata Banerjee promised basic income support for women to get a big chunk of the women’s votes.” Sociologist Dipankar Sen said women who voted for Banerjee also have that something which goes beyond a transactional relationship. “For many women, Banerjee is a role model. A woman who took on the patriarchal set-up head on and was at the receiving end of taunts and misogynistic comments. She was being attacked from all sides but continued with her work in a wheelchair. It worked as a huge binding factor,” he said. Political scientists also felt that long queues of woman voters outside polling stations were also an indication that they did not want to allow the efforts to communalize the society succeed. “Women and children suffer the most in a conflict. Women, both Hindu and Muslim, stepped out in huge numbers to vote to decide their own fate instead of leaving it to their male counterparts,” said Dipanjana Mullick, a political science professor in a city college.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/women-power-pushes-didis-tmc-to-victory/articleshow/82360752.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Business||Yes Bank bets on bad loan recovery in FY21: CEO||Mumbai: Yes Bank MD & CEO Prashant Kumar said that the private lender took a hit on its bottom line as the management decided to make accelerated provisioning for bad loans or non-performing assets (NPAs) to achieve a provision coverage ratio (PCR) of 79% and to ensure that legacy issues do not get carried into the current fiscal year. Kumar told TOI that the bank now had a well-provided pool of assets available for recovery and it would continue to pursue its proposal of setting up an asset reconstruction company (ARC) or have an in-house division. The pool of loans that are available for resolution or recovery now stands at Rs 59,882 crore. On Friday, Yes Bank posted a pre-tax loss of Rs 5,055 crore for the fourth quarter, which got reduced to Rs 3,788 crore after the reversal of tax provisions. Despite recoveries of close to Rs 5,000 crore in FY20, the bank was still impacted by additional provisioning requirement due to fresh slippages and additional provisions on its old book. The Rs 5,000-crore bad loan recovery in the previous year included a property-for-debt swap, which resulted in the bank acquiring the erstwhile headquarters of the Anil Ambani-led Reliance Group. Kumar said that moving into the premises would save it around Rs 100 crore in rent annually. On the decision to set up an ARC, Kumar said, “We wanted to have an arc where we have a controlling stake. The RBI thought process is that any ARC owned by a bank could be a moral hazard. The RBI has not refused our application and they have set up a committee to look into the working of ARCs.” He added that if the bank did not get to promote an ARC, it was open to participating in one or effecting recovery from within the bank. According to Kumar, the bank’s bad loans would not fit into the national ARC that was proposed by the Indian Banks Association. For the current fiscal, the bank has set a credit growth target of 15% and aimed to grow deposits faster. He said that the capital requirement would arise if growth was higher than targeted and after taking into account the pace of bad loan recovery. The Mumbai-headquartered bank has seen 3,000 employees test positive for the Covid infection, with half of them yet to recover. The bank has also lost 11 employees to the pandemic. During the year, the bank realigned its compensation and HR processes and completed the appraisal, including issuing increment letters for 20,000 employees in April 2021. A significant proportion of top and senior management compensation was made variable and linked to the bank’s long-term performance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/yes-bank-bets-on-bad-loan-recovery-in-fy21-ceo/articleshow/82360708.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Kolkata||TMC wave sweeps Salt Lake, New Town, Rajarhat||Kolkata: If 2019 was all about setbacks for Trinamool in Salt Lake, Rajarhat and urban belts of New Town, 2021 was all about regaining lost ground. Trinamool candidates Sujit Bose in Bidhannagar, Aditi Munshi in Rajarhat-Gopalpur and Tapas Chatterjee in Rajarhat-New Town swept the polls on Sunday just like their 212 other party colleagues winning back almost all the areas and segments they had trailed two years ago. In 2019, Trinamool’s Barasat MP Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar had lost 13 out of 14 wards in Salt Lake, including the home ward of Bidhannagar MLA Sujit Bose at Sreebhumi, cutting down her winning margin significantly. Trinamool’s vote share had also dropped significantly in New Town and Rajarhat segments in 2019. But this year, all equations changed as Trinamool candidates in all three segments scored decisive leads. “We had a plan and it worked perfectly. Moreover, the people here didn’t trust the turncoats and outsiders and have entrusted their faith on sons of the soil who have worked day and night for the betterment of these constituencies,” said a senior Trinamool leader in charge of all three segments. While at Bidhannagar, sitting MLA and fire minister Sujit Bose defeated his old party colleague Sabyasachi Dutta by 7,997 votes, singer Aditi Munshi swept the results at Rajarhat Gopalpur, beating BJP candidate Samik Bhattacharya by over 25,000 votes. At Rajarhat-New Town, BMC’s former deputy mayor Tapas Chatterjee had a lead of 55,217 votes over his nearest BJP candidate, bettering the party’s 2019 show of 23,649 lead from the constituency — a mix of rural and urban populace. “People of Bengal have given a fitting reply to BJP. I don’t even want to comment about my opponent Sabyasachi Dutta as I don’t consider him to be on our level,” said Bose. “People in this part of Bengal can get me even at 1.30am at night. That’s how good my reach is in this constituency. Former MP Dutta didn’t do anything in this part. My focus is generating employment and constructing a new electric crematorium and a hospital in this area,” said Chatterjee. Munshi, however, said winning or losing, her focus would have been on working for the people during the pandemic. “People in Bengal have voted for the people they love. I never considered this election as a fight, but I believe a bigger fight awaits as I have been given a huge responsibility,” she said. TOI tried to contact the losing BJP leaders, but their phones were either switched off or were not reachable since afternoon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tmc-wave-sweeps-salt-lake-new-town-rajarhat/articleshow/82360805.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Anuj was found murdered on Saturday night. Parmanandpur police outpost in-charge Jyoti Ram said Anuj was found lying in a pool of blood beside a village road at Bhatrandha around 10pm on Saturday. He said the villagers ended Sunday's protest only after they were assured that the killers would be nabbed as soon as possible. He said Anuj was the son of Sikandar Yadav, who is a former head of Gailadh block under which the Bhatrandha village falls. He said prior to protesting outside the outpost on Sunday, the irate villagers had also created law and order problem Saturday night by burning the car of one of the suspects in the village. Ram said Anuj was a native of Bhatrandha and he was invited by one Tribhuvan Yadav of the same village to a mutton-rice dinner. “Anuj left home on his bike around 4pm. His family members tried to contact him on his cellphone several times but failed. Later, he was found lying by the roadside and rushed to a private hospital in Saharsa in the night, but doctors declared him dead,” he said, adding Anuj’s bike was also found lying by the roadside with the front portion badly damaged. Ram also said Anuj’s father has lodged an FIR against Tribhuvan and Saroj Yadav of village Chitti Ghelar police outpost and one Rampravesh Yadav from Bedava Bishanpur Tola for hatching a conspiracy to kill his son. “Tribhuvan also reached the spot in his car on Saturday night after which the villager thrashed him and torched his vehicle. He later fled from the spot and is presently evading arrest. The other two named accused are also absconding,” he said. The in-charge said at one point, it was suspected that Anuj might have met with an accident. “However, such an accident is not possible on the village road until done intentionally,” he said. Ram said the body has been handed over to the family after postmortem and raids were on to nab the accused persons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/villagers-torch-car-of-accused-to-protest-murder-in-madhepura/articleshow/82359772.cms||Debashish Karmakar

These stations are Muzaffarpur, Hajipur, Barauni, Khagaria, Sonepur, Begusarai, Mansi and Naughachia, sources said, adding that the increased platform ticket rate will remain in force till May 15 only. Railways has taken this decision following an advisory issued by the Railway Board to reduce gathering of people on platforms when there is an alarming spike in the Covid-19 cases in Bihar, sources said, adding the increase in the platform ticket rate will check unnecessary entry of people on railway platforms of these stations. Besides, railways has installed four steam inhaler booths at the coaching depot at Muzaffarpur to facilitate frontline railway staff, particularly loco pilots and guards, to inhale steam before signing in on their duty as a precautionary measure, an ECR official said. Meanwhile, nine out of the 716 passengers, who reached Patna Junction on Saturday by Lokmanya Tilak–Patna special train (03202), tested positive for Covid-19. They were isolated in a city hotel by the state health department staff, sources said. Similarly, at least 27 out of over 200 passengers who reached Sitamarhi on Friday from different places by special passenger trains were detained by railway doctors for the time being due to fever. Subsequently they were allowed to go home after finding no symptoms for Covid-19, an ECR official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/platform-ticket-rate-increased-at-8-rly-stations/articleshow/82359753.cms||Kumod Verma
---||Ahmedabad||Covid-19 in Gujarat: ‘Ventilator demand grew two-fold in second wave’||AHMEDABAD: As coronavirus infections rage on, the demand for ventilators has nearly doubled in the second wave as compared to the peak demand in the first wave. The country is facing a shortage of 50,000-60,000 ventilators representing roughly 50% of the country’s total requirement, said Ashok Patel, the founder and CEO of Max Ventilators, one of the country’s leading ventilator manufacturers. His own company has recorded a two-fold rise in demand in the second wave as compared to the peak demand in the first one last year. Max Ventilators sold 1,000 units in the month of April when the second wave hit the country. In comparison, it sold about 500-600 ventilators in December and January before the demand started falling. “The demand picked up suddenly after April 4. It has doubled and we are running our facility in Vadodara at full capacity after ramping it up recently,” said Patel. Much of the demand is coming from state governments. “Forty percent of the demand is from the states,” he said. “Small hospitals, nursing homes, and private clinics make up about 30% of our April orders.” He said the remaining are from the newly set up Covid centres, medical colleges, and private hospitals. Founded in 1992 in Vadodara, Max Ventilators has decided to give priority to Gujarat as it is the company’s home state. From Maharashtra, the company has received orders for 200 ventilators. In Gujarat, it had set up about 300 ventilators in the first week of April and has received orders for 300 additional ventilators. The company has received orders from the Delhi government and from some private hospitals in West Bengal recently. Prior to Covid-19, the country’s demand was 9,000 ventilators per year, of which 8,000 were imported. During the first wave, 18,000 ventilators were installed in ICUs at hospitals across the country. About 39,000 ventilators were produced during the first wave when many Indian companies began producing, said Patel. Talking about the demand-supply gap in the second wave, he said with the number of daily cases rising above 4 lakh, there is a strong possibility that it will rise further before it peaks and a downward trend begins. There is likely to be a demand for 21,000 to 24,000 new ventilators if 4% of the patients in the new wave need ICU treatment and the number of cases rises to 6 lakh per day. “Now, given that a patient needs at least five days in the ICU, no fewer than 1 lakh new ventilators will be needed to overcome this challenge of rising numbers,” said Patel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ventilator-demand-grew-2-fold-in-2nd-wave/articleshow/82360838.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Covid surge hit polling in last two phases, had impact on results||Kolkata: The spurt in second Covid wave during the last two phases of Bengal elections has had an impact on polling in 11 seats in Kolkata and those in urban Howrah, Malda, Murshidabad, Birbhum, Dakshin Dinajpur and parts of Paschim Burdwan. Covid fears had forced people to stay indoors and with the passing of time, the turnout at polling booths had reduced considerably. Polling for Kolkata South, which was on April 26, saw a turnout of 61.7%. Similarly, Ballygunge recorded 61% as against 63.8% in 2016 assembly polls and 66.2% in 2019 LS polls. But it was not the same in rural Bengal as in most districts, it was around 80% plus voting. Rashbehari recorded the lowest turnout with 59.8%, a drop from 67.1% in 2016. Bhowanipore had recorded 66.8% turnout both in 2016 as well as in the 2019 LS polls. But this time, it was a bit low with 61.3%. The Port area recorded 64.4% this time, which is one percent more than it was in 2016. Kolkata North recorded a further slide in polling percentage. On Thursday, it recorded 59.4% turnout. Jorasanko had the least turnout as it recorded 49.8% which was almost nine percent higher in 2016. Chowringhee which is known for low turnout also had 53.3% polling in comparison to 56.2% polling in 2016. Kashipur Belgachhia also had a low turnout with 59.5% which was 64.8% in 2016. Shyampukur, too, had 57.7% polling. In urban Howrah, voting was low as it recorded 77.2% polling, with Bally recording the lowest with 71.3% polling. According to BJP leaders, the low polling had an impact on the results in Jorasanko (49.8%) and Rashbehari (59.8%). BJP veteran Meena Devi Purohit lost the Jorasanko polls. However, the polling turnout was fairly high in Malda, Uttar Dinajpur where the BJP lost a few seats because of the bipolar fight Birbhum had a high rate of polling in phase eight in all the 11 seats with 84%, followed by Malda where polling was held for six seats with a turnout of 81% and Murshidabad recorded 81% polling as votes in 11 seats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/covid-surge-hit-polling-in-last-two-phases-had-impact-on-results/articleshow/82360730.cms||---

---||Kolkata||A cakewalk for Trinamool on Mamata home turf||Kolkata: Billed as a big fight in a constituency where CM Mamata Banerjee lives and from where she had contested in the past two terms, the electoral battle in Bhowanipore turned into a damp squib with Trinamool candidate Sovandeb Chattopadhyay winning by a comfortable margin. BJP’s actor candidate Rudranil Ghosh, who had banked on the sizeable non-Bengali population in parts of the constituency to give the state power minister a tough fight, was left bamboozled as Trinamool appeared to have received support from a cross-section of the society, including Sikhs, Biharis, Marwaris and Gujaratis. “People have entrusted their faith in Mamata Banerjee and me. This has been a vote against BJP and their filthy politics,” said Chattopadhyay. Though Trinamool had, in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, trailed BJP in six of the eight KMC wards that comprise the assembly constituency that is part of the South Kolkata seat, its candidate Mala Roy had managed a lead of just 3,300 votes, thanks largely to big margins in ward 70 near Ekbalpore-Mominpur where the minority community constitutes a majority and from ward 82 in Chetla where minister Firhad Hakim lives. BJP had hoped to further polarize the vote in this election to offset the Muslim votes that make up nearly 35% of the electorate here and also attract a sizeable chunk of the 60% non-Bengali votes. Aware that slums vote in large numbers, Union home minister Amit Shah had even visited a slum in Bakul Bagan Row to reach out to the constituents. Though the Covid situation meant that many people in high-rises along Sarat Bose Road that traditionally vote for BJP did not step out to exercise their franchise this time, the empathic nature of victory pointed to Trinamool drawing support from not just Muslims and from slums in Oriyapara, Jadubabur bazar, Paddapukur Road, Rammohan Dutta Road, Chetla and Collins Lane, but even ward 70 — dominated by Gujaratis and Marwaris — that has been Trinamool’s Achilles heel in the past. In ward 70, the BJP’s lead whittled down to 1,600 from 5,000 in 2019 and in ward 71, Trinamool gained a lead of 2,000. It had trailed by 1,900 votes from this ward in 2019. “Our Gujarati brothers have definitely voted for us. They have seen us stand by them during the pandemic. They’ve also seen how the Narendra Modi government at the Centre has failed the country in this hour of need,” said Chattopadhyay’s chief campaign manager and ward 70 councillor Asim Bose. Midway through the elections, some concerns had emerged on the reaction to Trinamool’s ‘bahiragata’ or outsider pitch at rallies. But Bose and other party workers engaged with the non-Bengali community to assure them they were as much sons of the soil as any Bengali. Special emphasis was given to address the sizeable Bihari vote bank. The Punjabis anyway voted for Trinamool en bloc, incensed by the manner in which the farmers’ issue had been handled in Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/a-cakewalk-for-trinamool-on-mamata-home-turf/articleshow/82360815.cms||Subhro Niyogi

According to the election rules, the EC will now hold a by-election for this assembly seat within six months. Sinha got 89,413 votes, winning the Khardah seat by defeating his nearest rival and former party colleague Shilbhadra Dutta of BJP by nearly 28,041 votes. Khardah went to polls in sixth phase on April 22. Sinha was the chief administrator of Khardah municipality and two-time councillor from Ward 5. On April 19, during the last leg of the campaign, he complained of breathing issues. The 59-year-old Trinamool leader, a resident of Khardah’s Shantinagar, was admitted to Beliaghata ID Hospital on April 21 after testing positive for Covid-19. He succumbed to the disease on April 25. Sinha’s widow Nandita had then filed a police complaint against the Election Commission officials, including deputy election commissioner Sudip Jain, holding them responsible for her husband’s death. In the complaint, Nandita asked cops to take steps against Jain and other ECI officials “responsible for acts/omissions, which have led to the death of my husband and for committing offenses punishable under sections 269/270/304 (Part II)/120B of the IPC”. She urged the police to register an FIR on the basis of her complaint. On Sunday, Sinha’s brother Tapas, a former Trinamool councillor of Panihati municipality, went to the election counting centre at Panihati’s Gurunanak Dental College as a Trinamool agent. “We were confident of his victory as he dedicated his life to serving people. He fought a tireless campaign and was a long-serving member of Trinamool. I still can’t believe he is no more,” Tapas said. An EC official said, “A re-election in Khardah will be held within six months as the winning candidate is deceased.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/khardah-candidate-lost-life-to-cov-but-wins-seat-for-party/articleshow/82360810.cms||Sanjib Chakraborty

---||Visakhapatnam||Vaccine wastage across Andhra Pradesh brought down to below 1%||VISAKHAPATNAM: While Andhra Pradesh had reported nearly 11% Covid-19 vaccine wastage in the initial days of the vaccine rollout in March, the state scaled up daily vaccination target in the ensuing weeks, administering jabs to as many as 6.3 lakh people on April 14. As per official data by the Union health ministry, the cumulative vaccine wastage now stands at about 0.95% in Andhra Pradesh, lower than the national average. The initial vaccine hesitancy, low turnout, logistical challenges and the then local body polls were said to be the reason for the increased quantum of vaccine doses going to waste in the first weeks. The vaccine wastage in the beginning was also partly attributed to opening the vials, the quantity of which is sufficient to vaccinate 10 or 20 people based on the brand, for even one or two recipients who turned up at the vaccination sites. On the other hand, the Union government has allocated nearly 9.17 lakh vaccine doses for Andhra Pradesh, both Covishield and Covaxin, for the first fortnight of May through the ‘Government of India channel’ free of cost. States should administer vaccines provided free of cost only to priority groups (people aged 45 and above). However, the state government can purchase and procure its quota of 13 lakh doses devised under the ‘other than the GoI channel’ for the third phase of vaccination drive for people aged 18 and above. In no mood to roll out the vaccination drive for the young cohort at present, the state may also divert these 13 lakh doses to accelerate the ongoing vaccine drive for people aged above 45. Andhra Pradesh has so far received about 66 lakh vaccine doses and exhausted the doses by Saturday. According to state officials, there is no indication of arrival of fresh stocks, due to which, the state could hardly give 20 vaccines on Sunday. A state health official said the administration of Covid-19 vaccine has been streamlined in the last few weeks. “But the major challenges are inconsistent supply and availability of vaccines. The vaccination drive has been hindered by these factors every now and then, including even on Sunday.

Dahiya, who is an MBBS and MD (internal medicine) from All Indian Institute Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, said in his letter that “he is being kept away from the masses of Gujarat in this situation of healthcare and medical emergency”. He has worked in the state’s health department and has played a crucial role in the state’s handling of the swine flu epidemic. “There is a shortage of oxygen supply, beds, medicines, ventilators and other equipment everywhere which need effective disaster management,” he said in his letter. His exposure to disaster management, his knowledge acumen and his medical expertise are essential for the people of Gujarat in these testing times when the second wave has hit the people of Gujarat hard, he said, building a case for his reinstatement. Earlier, the IAS official was granted preliminary relief by the Delhi high court after he moved a defamation complaint against the woman who had accused him of bigamy. The court had prima facie observed the case in his favour. “The government is already paying him such a high salary then why can’t it use his skills and experience at a time when the state is undergoing a healthcare and medical crisis? Also, he is willing to render his services unconditionally wherever the government deems fit,” said an official in the know of the matter. His suspension was ordered in August 2019 after a preliminary committee inquired into allegations of cheating, bigamy and intimidation against the 2010-batch officer. Despite several attempts, Dahiya could not be reached on his phone. A departmental inquiry was started against him in November where V S Gadhvi, a retired IAS official, was appointed as the investigation officer. The committee was to submit its findings in three months. It was to probe into allegations of misconduct and moral turpitude. “It is more than 17 months now, but the findings of the committee are yet to be submitted to the state government,” said a state government official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/dahiya-wants-suspension-revoked-to-serve-gujarat-in-covid-19-fight/articleshow/82360746.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat sees 6% drop in new cases, 11% in deaths in 24 hrs||AHMEDABAD: It was the second consecutive day for Gujarat to record a drop in daily Covid-19 cases on Sunday. In 24 hours, the state recorded 12,978 new cases, a drop of 6.3% from the previous day. It was also the lowest daily tally in 11 days for the state. More importantly, the daily mortality got reduced from 172 to 153 in 24 hours, a drop of 11%. The drop was primarily driven by a major reduction in urban areas – Rajkot city recorded a dip of 33.8% in a day, followed by 16.8% in Surat, 6% in Ahmedabad and 4.4% in Vadodara. The cities account for twothirds of the daily tally, reveal analysis. Experts attributed the drop partially to drop in daily testing – which had reached 1.5 lakh on Saturday from 1.6 lakh on Friday. On the other hand, the number of active cases increased steadily to 1.47 lakh. “The silver lining is, there is a rapid rise in recovery rate. On Sunday, Gujarat added 1,832 new patients, which were 7,569 a week ago,” said a city-based expert. However, there is not much bearing of the reduction on the city-based hospitals where oxygen supply has still remained Achilles’ heel. A senior city-based doctor said that some of the hospitals have stopped taking patients with high oxygen demand. “The reason is the same supply can be given to three patients with moderate requirements. No one wishes to send any patient back, but a few hospitals are forced to take drastic measures,” said the doctor on condition of anonymity. Two major government hospitals – Sola Civil Hospital and Gandhinagar Civil Hospital – have in the past few days been forced to restrict the number of patients under treatment due to oxygen supply. The authorities however maintained that the facilities are soon to be ramped up. “Today oxygen has become the single most focal point for many mid-level hospitals that solely depend on cylinder supplies,” said Dr Ishan Shah, director of Sushrusha Hospital. “In fact, the expenses have increased five times in one month due to overheads such as refiling charges to keeping an ‘oxygen fleet’ which continuously goes from one bottler to another to ensure that the hospital doesn’t run out of the gas,” he said. He suggested that the authorities can think of a mechanism such as an oxygen dashboard on the lines of Covid bed availability dashboard to show which plant has how much stock and which hospitals are running out of oxygen. Dr Rohit Joshi, chairman of Aarna Hospital, said that a mid-sized hospital requires 100-150 bottles a day. “Patients with higher oxygen requirements have increased during this wave. The evenings and nights for many hospital administrators often are spent arranging cylinders,” he said, adding that the at-home patients have also emerged as the consumers for cylinders. “They should be advised to use oxygen concentrators instead of cylinders, as not all know the technical know-how.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/guj-sees-6-drop-in-new-cases-11-in-deaths-in-24-hrs/articleshow/82360732.cms||Parth Shastri

However, the number of cybercrimes between January to April, 2021 is low compared to the corresponding period in 2020. Police said cybercriminals are posing as bank officials and offering loan moratorium for a fee and using fake UPI (unified payment interface) handles for supplying oxygen to Covid-19 patients. Continuing with their traditional modus operandi, fraudsters claim to be calling as a bank official or a representative of a digital wallet company, and ask users to update their Know Your Customer (KYC) details for uninterrupted digital payments. Speaking to TOI, inspector of Cybercrimes Police Station (CPS), Vizag city, RVRK Choudhary said they have registered as many as 112 complaints between January and April in 2020. “However, this year so far we have registered around 60 complaints only and a majority of the complaints related to financial frauds. Internet banking penetration has increased and doubled during the pandemic in all parts of the state as mobile banking transactions are on the rise. But the awareness among netizens about cybercrimes is not as expected, which makes many easy targets,” he added. Police have warned against falling prey to advertisements that promise supply of oxygen cylinders, ICU beds at home and vaccination for Covid-19 on social networking sites as some cybercrooks are trying to use the pandemic to cheat people. Preliminary investigation into some cases has revealed that most cybercriminals are operating from other states or Union territories, such as Uttar Pradesh and New Delhi. Apart from OTP frauds, cases of QR code fraud have also been registered, police added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/fraudsters-capitalise-on-covid-to-dupe-netizens/articleshow/82359961.cms||Nalla.Babu
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat has 4 lakh favipiravir tablets: Govt to SC||AHMEDABAD: As the demand for favipiravir shoots up due to the surge in Covid-19 cases, the state government has informed the Supreme Court that it had a stock of 4 lakh tablets of 200mg strength as on April 27. The state’s advisory on the use of the antiviral drug favipiravir says that it “is to be administered to Covid-19 patients having mild to moderate disease” shortly after the onset of symptoms. It can shorten the course of clinical illness and reduce the infectiousness to others by reducing viral shedding. A Covid patient is prescribed favipiravir 1,800mg BD (twice a day) on day one followed by 800mg BD for 7-14 days. The government’s advisory says that it is to be given to a patient who is above 18 years, with oxygen saturation of 94 or more, and respiratory rate less than 24 per minute. In its affidavit filed before the apex court, the state government said that favipiravir “procured during April 1 and 27” was 57.8 lakh tablets. However, it also mentioned that it received 15,04,908 tablets and distributed 13,30,556. The government had a stock of 2,27,930 as on April. With the stock it received during the month and the distribution it made, the balance at the state level on April 27 was 4,01,982. Gujarat had 1,45,139 active Covid-19 cases on Sunday. Estimates of the Federation of Gujarat State Chemists and Druggists’ Association (FGSCDA) suggest that the demand for favipiravir has gone up at least seven-fold against which the supply is limited. Jashvant Patel, the chairman of the FGSCDA, said: “Short supply is definitely an issue. A given stockist gets barely 500 strips in a day.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/state-has-4l-favipiravir-tablets-govt-to-sc/articleshow/82360845.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal assembly poll results: Muslims pressed button for TMC in Congress bastion||KOLKATA: Muslims went with the Trinamool Congress displaying a consolidation in the 2021 Bengal assembly polls, more than it was in the 2016 assembly polls and the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Of the 141 assembly having Muslim presence, TMC bagged 120 seats while one seat went to Abbas Siddiqui’s Indian Secular Front and 20 seats to the BJP. The results of the 49 seats spread over Murshidabad (22), Malda (12), Uttar Dinajpur (9), Dakshin Dinajpur (6) fairly display the consolidation. Muslims pushed to the wall dumped the Congress even in the party’s traditional belt and voted for the TMC. The Congress lost ABA Ghani Khan Chowdhury’s turf Sujapur to TMC by a margin of one lakh votes. TMC also won Mothabari, Malatipur, Harishchandrapur and Ratua for the first time. In the 2016 assembly polls, Congress won eight of the total 12 seats in Malda. The BJP improved it tally from one to four apparently due to counter-polarisation. The consolidation of Muslim votes worked wonders for TMC in Uttar Dinajpur. TMC won seven of the total nine seats in the district while in 2016, Congress had bagged three seats and two seats had gone to the Left. TMC benefited the most in Murshidabad where Congress couldn’t win a single of the total 20 seats. The Congress couldn’t win a single seat in the district. TMC won 18 seats including Farrakka and Lalgola while the BJP won the Behrampore and Murshidabad seats. TMC also did well in South Dinajpur where they bagged three of total six seats and the rest went to the BJP. According to TMC leaders, the overarching majoritarian campaign of the BJP prompted the minorities to choose the party that could give them security.  It happened despite a host of TMC leaders in Malda having joined the BJP ahead of the polls. The Congress and the Left failed to earn the confidence of the minorities. TMC, on the other hand, could consolidate the support of the minorities in most of the 141 assembly seats in the districts like South 24 Parganas, Nadia in south Bengal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/muslims-pressed-button-for-tmc-in-cong-bastion/articleshow/82360837.cms||---

---||Vadodara||Covid-19 in Gujarat: ‘Ventilator demand grew two-fold in second wave’||AHMEDABAD: As coronavirus infections rage on, the demand for ventilators has nearly doubled in the second wave as compared to the peak demand in the first wave. The country is facing a shortage of 50,000-60,000 ventilators representing roughly 50% of the country’s total requirement, said Ashok Patel, the founder and CEO of Max Ventilators, one of the country’s leading ventilator manufacturers. His own company has recorded a two-fold rise in demand in the second wave as compared to the peak demand in the first one last year. Max Ventilators sold 1,000 units in the month of April when the second wave hit the country. In comparison, it sold about 500-600 ventilators in December and January before the demand started falling. “The demand picked up suddenly after April 4. It has doubled and we are running our facility in Vadodara at full capacity after ramping it up recently,” said Patel. Much of the demand is coming from state governments. “Forty percent of the demand is from the states,” he said. “Small hospitals, nursing homes, and private clinics make up about 30% of our April orders.” He said the remaining are from the newly set up Covid centres, medical colleges, and private hospitals. Founded in 1992 in Vadodara, Max Ventilators has decided to give priority to Gujarat as it is the company’s home state. From Maharashtra, the company has received orders for 200 ventilators. In Gujarat, it had set up about 300 ventilators in the first week of April and has received orders for 300 additional ventilators. The company has received orders from the Delhi government and from some private hospitals in West Bengal recently. Prior to Covid-19, the country’s demand was 9,000 ventilators per year, of which 8,000 were imported. During the first wave, 18,000 ventilators were installed in ICUs at hospitals across the country. About 39,000 ventilators were produced during the first wave when many Indian companies began producing, said Patel. Talking about the demand-supply gap in the second wave, he said with the number of daily cases rising above 4 lakh, there is a strong possibility that it will rise further before it peaks and a downward trend begins. There is likely to be a demand for 21,000 to 24,000 new ventilators if 4% of the patients in the new wave need ICU treatment and the number of cases rises to 6 lakh per day. “Now, given that a patient needs at least five days in the ICU, no fewer than 1 lakh new ventilators will be needed to overcome this challenge of rising numbers,” said Patel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/ventilator-demand-grew-2-fold-in-2nd-wave/articleshow/82364240.cms||---

---||Business||Investors beat volatility with asset allocation MFs||Mumbai: Extreme volatility in recent months in the three most popular asset classes for common people — stocks, bonds and gold — has prompted investors to lap up asset allocation funds. These mutual funds divide investors’ money in a judicious manner among the three asset classes. The funds also try to provide protection from extreme volatility in the prices of these assets. Financial planners say these funds have historically given higher returns than fixed deposits (FDs), but at a lower risk. Consider this: In the one year to March 2021, total assets managed by these funds jumped nearly 47% to Rs 15,551 crore. Investments in asset allocation fund of funds too grew, at an even faster rate of 61%, to Rs 11,475 crore, official data showed. In comparison, the total assets of the fund industry grew by 41.4% to Rs 31.4 lakh crore. Financial planners say with the market uncertainty rising, the importance of asset allocation funds has gone up. “A proper asset-allocation strategy helps investors to ride the volatility better. Such a strategy usually helps investors earn more than pure fixed income assets (bonds, FDs, etc)…it helps reduce portfolio risk substantially,” said Etica Wealth Management MD & CEO Gajendra Kothari. “And by taking the mutual fund route, one could adopt the same strategy at a lower cost and in a tax-efficient manner,” Kothari said. HDFC Mutual Fund’s senior fund manager Amit B Ganatra manages the company’s Asset Allocator Fund of Funds — the NFO for which closed on Friday. He said the scheme would aim to generate capital appreciation by managing the asset allocation between equity-oriented, debt-oriented and gold ETF schemes. “The fund aims to follow a systematic and process-driven approach to asset allocation with the help of financial model based on valuation parameters. The idea is to dispassionately manage an active asset allocation strategy in a disciplined manner with periodic review and rebalancing, which otherwise becomes a challenge for investors,” Ganatra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/investors-beat-volatility-with-asset-allocation-mfs/articleshow/82360695.cms||---

Singh, a 1985-batch IAS officer, had got infected with coronavirus in mid-April and breathed his last at a private hospital in the state capital on April 30. The divisional commissioners of Bhagalpur, Tirhut and Darbhanga divisions were among six other IAS officers shuffled by the state government on Saturday. Singh’s batchmate Sharan, who was chairman-cum-member of the board of revenue, however, will have a brief strict as the chief secretary as he is scheduled to superannuate from service on June 30. Singh was given the responsibility of the chief secretary in February on the basis of seniority after the superannuation of Deepak Kumar, who was later appointed as principal secretary to chief minister Nitish Kumar. Singh was to schedule to retire from service on August 31. Singh’s sudden demise forced a reshuffle in the state bureaucracy. Apart from Sharan, six other IAS officers were also transferred, according to a notification issued by the general administration department. A 1986-batch IAS officer, Sanjeev Kumar Sinha, was shifted from the post of chief inquiry commissioner in the general administration department to the board of revenue as its chairman-cum-member. Sinha was replaced by Sudhir Kumar (1988 batch) as chief inquiry commissioner in the general administration department. Bhagalpur divisional commissioner Vandana Kinni (1989 batch) will assume charge as additional chief secretary in the labour resources department. She will also hold the additional charge of additional chief secretary of the art, culture and youth affairs department. Mihir Kumar Singh (1993 batch) was transferred from the post of principal secretary in the labour resources department. He has been made divisional commissioner of Tirhut. Secretary of finance department Prem Singh Meena (2000 batch) has been appointed divisional commissioner of Bhagalpur. He has also been given additional charge of Munger division. Manish Kumar Singh (2005 batch) has been appointed as divisional commissioner of Darbhanga. He will be replaced by Mihir.

Non-Bengali voters, who were instrumental in the victory of the BJP in Hooghly and North 24 Parganas in the Lok Sabha elections in 2019, seem to have turned the tables on the party. BJP banked on them and left no stone unturned to consolidate these votes against the ‘Bengali’ and ‘outsider’ narrative of Trinamool Congress. In Barrackpore parliamentary constituency, which saw the victory of Arjun Singh, then a Trinamool turncoat and now a BJP candidate, the BJP returned with empty hands this time. The Hindi-speaking voters living in Bijpur, Noapara, Jagaddal, Khardah and Naihati voted for the TMC candidates. “People seemed to have rejected the turncoats in this poll,” said Naihati’s winning Trinamool candidate, Partha Bhowmik. In Hooghly, the Hindi-speaking community across Champdani, Chandanagar, Serampore and Saptagram also rejected the turncoats. The anti-incumbency emotion has acted against them whether it is Rabidranath Bhattacharya (Singur), Prabir Ghosal (Uttarpara) and Dilip Singh (Champdani). Locket Chatterjee, who had made a spectacular victory in the region in the 2019 parliamentary election, suffered a shocking defeat at Chinsurah. In Howrah, the non-Bengali Hindu people voted for BJP while the Muslim voters supported the TMC . “We were blessed by Bengali voters and Hindi-speaking Muslim voters,” said Arup Roy, TMC’s winning candidate in Howrah Central.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hindi-speaking-voters-in-kolkatas-suburbs-turn-away-from-saffron-party/articleshow/82360840.cms||Sanjib Chakraborty

In the Covid affected academic year, a recent survey found that while learning moved online and digital access remained limited, over 25,000 students remained out of schools in the state, as per data collated by the education department. Of these, the highest share of nearly 10,000 students are from Mumbai. In the first 10 days of March, the state had held drives to identify students who have fallen out of the formal education system during the pandemic year. There are a total of 1.7crore children aged (3 and 14 years) in the state. But, experts feel the number of out-of-school children will be much larger than the state’s estimate Education activist, Herambh Kulkarni said, “Even in non-pandemic times, the number of students out of school is much higher.

The fight in the constituency has been a hot discussion from the very beginning due to Ebrahim Kunju’s tarnished political image over his entanglement in the Palarivattom flyover corruption case. The victory is even sweeter for CPM state secretariat member Rajeev, who has not won in any major elections in the past. He is one of the leaders who might secure a key position in the new cabinet. While Rajeev secured 77,141votes, Gafoor could secure only 61,805 votes. The NDA candidate P S Jayaraj secured third place with 11,179 votes and SDPI came fourth with 2,385 votes.

While his mother was in Noida, he was alone, unable to figure out what to do next. He called up his friends and acquaintances but they failed to help him. He thought of taking the body to Noida but hearse car service providers demanded as high as Rs 80,000 which he could not afford. Finally, with the help of the hospital, he came in touch with an advocate, Syed Rizwan Ahmad, who has been helping people in distress. He helped the youth in giving a dignified farewell to his father in Lucknow. “I had never been to a cremation ground in my life. My mother was in Noida. I tried going to Noida but hearse service providers were demanding exorbitant charges,” an inconsolable boy said. “As soon as doctors announced that my father is no more, I went numb for hours. I kept on calling my friends and relatives but could not get help. Ahamad ji came like an angel and quickly helped me,” he said. “We cannot allow Covid-19 to enslave our courage and humanity. We have to take precautions but cannot stop helping others,” said Ahmad, who has been doing yeoman’s service to help people. Ahmad started the initiative, Mission Samvedna, after his friend, Ranjeet Singh Yadav, offered him his van which was later modified as a hearse car. “I want to tell people that whosoever is in need and requires our services, they may contact us on Facebook,” he said. In yet another case, an 85-year-old Covid patient from Daliganj succumbed to infection. As his own kin were suffering from infection, they could not find the way out. A resident of the locality and a journalist with a Hindi journal, Himashu Dixit, informed Ahmad and Yadav who reached the spot and provided a dignified burial to the elderly man. The son of the deceased said he wished that a person like Ahmad should be the country’s Prime Minister or chief minister of the state. In another case, a doctor had died but nobody was ready to take the body to cremation ground. “We were informed through a friend that the doctor’s son was in trouble and required a hearse car. We immediately reached the spot to help ferry the body,” said Ahmad. In the last one week, Ahmad and Yadav have helped at least nine families perform the last rites of their loved ones.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/advocate-friend-ensure-dignity-in-death-for-covid-victims/articleshow/82361512.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Modi-Shah magic worked in north Bengal, not in south||KOLKATA: Prime Minister Narendra Modi came down to Bengal thrice in February, five times in March and eight times in April. Union home minister Amit Shah was here every week over the past three months. But their strike rate in the districts was lower than that before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. This time, the BJP seniors’ focus was more on connecting with the Bangali bhadralok.  Modi addressed the Visva Bharati convocation, pointing out how Rabindranath Tagore was the “guiding light” for his New Education Policy. Later, Shah spent hours at Visva Bharati, listening to Rabindrasangeet and watching a dance recital by the students there, before holding an impressive road show in Bolpur. But all these efforts didn’t translate into seats in Birbhum, where the BJP won only Dubrajpur out of 11 constituencies there. Modi, however, seemed to have a high impact on the Siliguri electorate, as they voted CPM-turned-BJP candidate Sankar Ghosh to victory with a massive margin, as well as the people of Jalpaiguri. The PM and the home minister also steered the party to victory in seven of the nine seats in Cooch Behar. Modi’s visit to the seat of Matuas at Orakandi in Bangladesh also helped BJP win the seats in Bongaon of North 24 Parganas, but his magic failed to work at the Barrackpore and Barasat.  Their campaign in South Parganas took BJP to the second position in some seats, but couldn’t win a single seat from the district.  BJP seniors were in for a shock in Hooghly and Howrah that had upset them the most. BJP national president J P Nadda’s intensive campaign in East Burdwan — the rice bowl of Bengal — didn’t fetch the party expected seats either. On the contrary, a dissent against the huge election gatherings in the times of Covid was gathering among some voters in Kolkata and its periphery, prompting BJP spokesperson Shamik Bhattacharya to point out Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee, too, was holding such meetings. Modi didn’t address any meeting in Kolkata other than his opening rally at Brigade Parade Grounds in February. Shah also cancelled his roadshow later. Shah’s campaign to win over the dalits, Adivasis and namasudras didn’t work at expected levels in South 24 Parganas, Burdwan and North 24 Parganas, while the Muslim votes consolidated in favour of Trinamool. While Adivasis in north Bengal went with BJP, their counterparts in Jhargram and parts of West Midnapore didn’t favour BJP as much as they did in the 2019 LS polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/modi-shah-magic-worked-in-north-bengal-not-in-south/articleshow/82360880.cms||---

The department had sent notices to hospitals, mainly GMSH-16, in the past to take required fire safety measures, following which the hospital administration strengthened and filled the gaps. “Since our firemen and other staff of the fire and emergency department are doing multiple Covid-19 duties, the fresh fire audit of hospitals has not been done in the past over one-year. We are going to hold meeting in this regard in the coming days,” said an official. Moreover, considering fire incidents in some hospitals in other parts of the country, especially due to sudden increase in consumption of oxygen, Punjab governor-cum-UT administrator V P Singh Badnore has directed to be extra careful in terms of fire related incidents. All the fire hydrants at the Sector 48 hospital and GMCH-32 were tested. A mock drill of fire sensing was also carried out. All the fire extinguishers have been checked, refilled and re-validated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/no-fresh-survey-fire-hydrants-at-city-hospitals-are-up-to-date/articleshow/82360103.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kochi||Kerala: Lives & livelihoods matter more than graft charges||KOCHI: Lives and livelihoods assumed greater significance than allegations of corruption and nepotism in the elections. LDF has won, as expected, on the strength of its performance during two floods, several viral challenges, including the pandemic, which was highlighted in its campaign. UDF unearthed several sensational scandals, including gold smuggling, favouritism and reckless extravagance in publicity, but made no impact as these have come to be accepted in politics, regardless of parties. Both the fronts had even their own femmes fatales! The delivery of welfare and development have diminished the gravity of the allegations. Kerala is proud of its exceptionalism, with its own political equations, which are different from the rest of the country. As the only Communist elected government in the world today, it has developed its own philosophy and systems with Kerala characteristics such as accepting religion as indispensable. In the context of Sabarimala, LDF claimed that if Gods had votes, they would vote for LDF. The disconnect between the governments in Delhi and Kerala are so wide that the state does not get the benefits, which are due to it. A handicap of both BJP and Congress is that they are seen as being controlled by the RSS and the High Command respectively, who do not understand the needs of Kerala. As far as LDF is concerned, even the politburo is largely from Kerala. Even Rahul and Priyanka did not make much difference because of the impression that the Gandhi family was losing control over the party because of the emergence of the reformists known as G-23. Projecting Shashi Tharoor, a member of G-23, as the architect of the UDF manifesto misfired because the Congress leaders in Kerala have been critical of him as a “guest artist”, not conversant with Kerala’s concerns and needs. Such fixes completely undermined Ramesh Chennithala, who fought valiantly with incorrigible optimism. The historic nature of the results is that the automaticity of government change every five years has ended. This means that Kerala has become completely polarised, as public opinion may not be swayed by performance in future. Groupism and undue interference from the High Command, which itself is divided were Congress’s handicaps. But some talented young Congress leaders like Shafi Parambil, VD Satheesan, PC Vishnunath, Mathew Kuzhalnadan and T Siddique have managed to be in the legislature. BJP had exaggerated expectations and its claims were baseless and unrealistic. With its Hindu identity, BJP can succeed in Kerala only if the main Hindu organisations join it and Keralites begin to relate to the leadership of PM Narendra Modi . The induction of Metroman E Sreedharan as presumptive chief minister made no difference to the fortunes of the BJP and his own judgment was called into question. Strangely, both BJP and Congress dismissed the survey results out of hand. The challenges of the new government in Kerala are humongous, with the worsening pandemic and critical economic situation. The hope and expectation are that chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, with his rich experience of the last few years, will be able to carry the whole state with him in his quest for a better Kerala.

---||Kolkata||It’s Mamata’s victory, say winning ministers||Kolkata: Barring state tourism minister Goutam Deb and Paschimanchal Unnayan minister Shantiram Mahato, all other cabinet ministers of Trinamool Congress, who had contested the assembly elections, came out victorious on Sunday. Some TMC ministers like Aroop Biswas, Subrata Mukherjee, Firhad Hakim and Javed Khan won by whopping margins, bettering their past records. “Bengal has overwhelmingly voted for us. They have always supported Mamata Banerjee, loved her and cared for her. The saga that she has created projects the empowerment of womanhood and humanity. Her pro-people stand has allowed us to win so many seats,” said Bratya Basu, the state’s science and technology and biotechnology minister who defeated his BJP opponent Bimal Shankar Nanda by 25,500 votes in Dum Dum. Chandrima Bhattacharya, who is in charge of multiple departments like panchayats and rural development, housing and health and family welfare, said she was indebted to the people of her constituency who helped her beat her BJP rival by over 24,500 votes at Dum Dum North segment. “It’s not us but Mamata Banerjee who has won from all the segments of Bengal. She fought a lone battle against so many central ministers and emerged victorious. She has nothing else to prove,” said Bhattacharya, who had lost the 2016 election from the same constituency to CPM leader Tanmay Bhattacharya. However, a year later, she won the by-poll from Dakshin Kanthi assembly seat. Among other important ministers who won by a decent margin included food minister Jyotipriya Mullick, consumer affair minister Sadhan Pande, fisheries minister Chandranath Sinha, parliamentary affairs minister Tapas Roy, women and child development minister Sashi Panja, labour minister Nirmal Maji and law minister Moloy Ghatak. Prior to the election, chief minister Mamata Banerjee had said that some senior ministers like Amit Mitra and Purnendu Bose wouldn’t be contesting the polls because of their ailing health and Covid situation in the state. But she had promised that if voted to power, TMC would revive the Vidhan Parishad (Legislative Council) to accommodate the senior and experienced leaders. After TMC’s victory in the assembly elections, party insiders said the plan remains the same and those leaders can again be seen in the cabinet ministry in the new government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/its-mamatas-victory-say-winning-ministers/articleshow/82360847.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Lucknow||Partly cloudy sky, thunderstorms likely up to May 6||Lucknow: Partly cloudy sky on Sunday brought relief from the scorching heat prevailing for the past few days. The weather office predicted similar conditions with possibility of thunderstorm at several places in the state from Monday till May 6. Due to the cloudy sky, the maximum temperature in the city did not rise above 35.5 degrees Celsius, which was four units below normal. However, the same clouds prevented ground heat from escaping into the atmosphere, resulting in minimum temperature of 26.4 degrees Celius, about three notches above normal. State Met director JP Gupta said the two western disturbances are hovering over the Himalayan region. There is also a cyclonic circulation over Rajasthan and a trough line — a stream of small cyclonic circulations — is passing from over Madhya Pradesh. “Under the influence of these factors, sky will remain partly cloudy and thunderstorms may occur at some parts of UP, including Lucknow, till May 6,” he said. There are possibilities of light rainfall accompanied with thunderstorm, lightning and gusty wind (30-40km/hour) in some districts of the region, east and southwest UP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/partly-cloudy-sky-thunderstorms-likely-up-to-may-6/articleshow/82361519.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Moreover, several also have queries related to vaccination – right from whether they should take it to its side effects,” he said. Dr Mona Desai, immediate past president, AMA, said that the timeslot system is implemented as all of the volunteers are also working during the pandemic. “Thus, we request the citizens to be specific,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ama-launches-helpline-for-guidance/articleshow/82360851.cms||---

Accused Mahesh Soni was later arrested by Kurar police. In his statement to the police, the couple’s son, Shiva, said his parents’ relationship had been strained over the past five years. He said his father would physically and verbally abuse his wife, Poonam, 48, because he suspected she was having an extra-marital affair. Two days before the murder, the couple had a major fight and Shiva and his sister tried to intervene. But Mahesh allegedly threatened his children with dire consequences. The incident took place when the siblings were out on Saturday. Mahesh allegedly used a knife to stab his wife. Neighbours heard a lot of yelling and called up Shiva, but by the time he arrived, Mahesh had fled. Poonam was rushed to hospital, but was pronounced dead on admission. Based on Shiva’s statement, police registered a case against Mahesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-man-suspects-wifes-fidelity-murders-her/articleshow/82361536.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Amid O2 crisis, demand spikes for concentrators||Lucknow: To overcome the hassles of searching for a new oxygen cylinder and waiting for long hours in queues to get it refilled, people are using their savings to buy oxygen concentrator, an expensive medical equipment that concentrates oxygen from ambient air and acts as an alternative to liquid medical oxygen (LMO). The device is helpful in meeting the requirements of moderate Covid-19 patients in home isolation. Arjun Mallick (34), who has a small footwear showroom, decided to break his fixed deposit to buy an oxygen concentrator worth Rs 80,000 for his family. He, along with his wife and mother, had contracted Covid-19 last week. They were in home isolation as beds were not available in hospitals. “My mother needed oxygen support and didn’t want to take any risk as oxygen is in short supply. There was nobody in the house to go out and get cylinder and get it refilled frequently. I contacted a local dealer who arranged it for me from Delhi,” he told TOI. An oxygen concentrator takes atmospheric air that has about 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen and 1% other gases, filters it through a sieve, releases the nitrogen back into the air, compresses oxygen and dispenses it to the patient through a cannula. The oxygen is about 90-95% pure, less than LMO (99%), but enough for mild and moderate Covid-19 patients with oxygen saturation levels of 80-85% or above, experts said. “Concentrator is helpful in emergency for Covid patients whose blood oxygen level are gradually dipping. However, it is not a substitution of LMO needed for a critical case,” said Lt Gen (retd) Dr BNBM Prasad from critical care medicine department of the King George’s Medical University. Medical equipment dealers in Lucknow said the demand for oxygen concentrator has gone up by 10-15 times in the last few days as compared to last year. Its cost ranges from Rs 50,000 to up to Rs 1 lakh depending on the brand and quality. A new oxygen cylinder costs between Rs 20,000 and Rs 50,000 depending on the size and then there are expenses on refilling and transportation. Harshit, a dealer of medical equipment in Ashiana, said: “Earlier, some people with pulmonary diseases used to buy it but now many are buying the equipment as oxygen is not available. Many are ordering it online as well.” Another medical equipment dealer in Cantonment, Ashok Kumar, said people were requesting concentrators on EMIs and even on loans. “I get at least 20 queries daily,” he said. “I didn’t know about oxygen concentrator but after my grandmother fell critically ill and oxygen was not available, I decided to invest my six months’ salary on medical essentials, including oxygen concentrators,” said Rohit Tiwari, a sales executive and a resident of Rajajipuram.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/amid-o2-crisis-demand-spikes-for-concentrators/articleshow/82361529.cms||Mohita Tewari
---||Lucknow||Infra funds, new chain to bolster supply of oxygen||Lucknow: In an effort to ensure hassle-free oxygen supply for Covid and non-Covid patients, the district administration on Sunday decided to pump in funds to set up infrastructure for production of life-saving gas and to create a separate oxygen supply chain for non-Covid hospitals. “Work order worth Rs 9.64 crore has been placed for oxygen concentrator and oxygen generator plants to boost supply in the district. Arrangements are also being made to set up oxygen plants for private Covid-19 hospitals on their expense,” district magistrate Abhishek Prakash said. The work order list included 200 oxygen concentrators of 10 litre per minute capacity at all CHCs and Covid hospitals, 21 oxygen generators, including 20 with 45 litres per minute and one with 50 litres per minute capacity, for Covid hospitals. Eight oxygen generator plants, including five with nine cubic metres per hour and three with 30 cubic metres per hour capacity, will also come up for district Covid hospitals. In another decision taken by officer-in-charge of Covid-19 in Lucknow, Roshan Jacob, eight private registered oxygen traders have been selected for supply of oxygen to about 88 non-Covid hospitals in the city. The non-Covid hospitals primarily include those which have functional ICU facilities for special newborn care units, maternity ward, cardiac and renal, among others. “We have identified wholesale suppliers of oxygen and quota has been fixed following discussion with 88 non-Covid hospitals with functional ICU bed facilities. At least one each wholesale supplier will manage oxygen demand of at least a dozen non-Covid hospitals. The supplier will maintain record of oxygen supply to check black marketing. A fixed rate has also been decided to keep tabs on overpricing. The mechanism is expected to benefit SNCU, maternity clinic and heart care hospitals the most,” said Jacob. She said the current mechanism of oxygen refilling for home-isolated patients would remain unchanged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/infra-funds-new-chain-to-bolster-supply-of-oxygen/articleshow/82361534.cms||---

No, it’s not just about cleaning the frame, used to hold the pyre, after every death – it’s to cool down the frame so that the next cremation can be done faster! Harshad Patel, a social worker from Amraiwadi, said that for the past few weeks, the number of bodies for cremation – both Covid patients and non-Covid persons – has increased manifold. “One cremation can take anything between two to four hours. After every cremation, the mortal remains and ashes are taken from the spot and the wooden logs are arranged on the frame for the next,” he said. It’s also the practice in several other crematoriums where such frames are used, said sources, as the crematoriums are often working round the clock. “The water is also used for bathing by those who accompany the body to the crematorium,” said Patel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/dousing-fire-of-a-different-kind/articleshow/82360864.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Land for burial ground in Juhapura sought||AHMEDABAD: Looking at the increased deaths from Covid-19, the municipal councillors from Maktampura ward have demanded immediate allotment of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) land for the purpose a burial ground in Juhapura, the largest Muslim ghetto in the state. After making the request, they said that if the authorities do not heed their demand, they will move court. Three councillors from the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) — Suhana Mansuri, Mohammed Juber Pathan and Jenalbibi Moyuddin — have written to the municipal commissioner demanding land for a graveyard. In their letter, they said, “The number of deaths is increasing due to corona and there are queues at crematoriums and graveyards for the final rites of the dead. Maktampura ward has a sizable population and there is no space left in the Sanklitnagar and Namara graveyards for any more burials. The increase in deaths has posed a big issue over the burying of the dead. The corporation has till date not allotted any land for burial grounds in this area.” The councillors requested the authorities to allot land owned by the AMC. Pathan said the Sankalitnagar burial ground is too small for the increasing population of Juhapura. When the Covid-19 pandemic began last year, a private person donated his plot for burials. “But that is also full now. At least 15 graves are dug every day. Old graves are removed, but this will also not serve the purpose looking at the level of requirement. People have to take the dead to the Musa Suhag graveyard in Shahibaug, which is nearly 13km away,” he said on the need for the burial ground during this pandemic. Pathan also said that there are many large plots owned by the civic body around Juhapura and it can allot one of them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/land-for-burial-ground-in-juhapura-sought/articleshow/82360860.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Set up 24x7 central control room for Nagpur’s Covid management on lines of Mumbai: HC||Nagpur: With a view to prevent chaos and mismanagement in managing the Covid-19 situation, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Sunday directed collector and NMC to jointly set up a ‘central control room’ for the city on the lines of one in Mumbai. “Both authorities may adopt the model devised by Bombay Municipal Corporation commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal. Assistance may be sought from the legal experts, including government pleader Ketki Joshi. Once such a common order is issued, we make it clear that it would be mandatory for all hospitals, whether government, Zilla Parishad, private, society or trust, to abide by the same,” a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Avinash Gharote said, while warning that any reluctance or disobedience regarding their directives would be viewed seriously. The bench asked authorities to rope in officers from various government departments and doctors enlisted from the Indian Medical Association (IMA) and Vidarbha Hospitals’ Association (VHA). “These members shall be divided into different teams, with each team overseeing and deciding on every aspect of Covid management in the city and district. It would include the bed allocation in every hospital, private or government, distribution of all essential drugs such as Remdesivir and Tocilizumab and supply of oxygen and Covid essentials.” The bench added that the order issued for formation of control room by the collector shall include the scope of work of the teams. “These teams shall be assisted by the officers and men deployed in the field and a decision would have to be taken jointly by both authorities. The names of the officers and other persons deployed to assist shall also be mentioned in the joint order.” Earlier, the Bhandara collector was directed to request the Tirora Thermal Power Station management to make available their CSR funds for the Covid patients at Gondia, Bhandara and Nagpur. After HC rap, city receives 19k Remdesivir vials The divisional commissioner informed that 19,128 Remdesivir vials were actually received by Nagpur till Sunday and 960 more are going to be received from Zydus Cadila by evening. “We direct to ensure that these vials are distributed amongst Nagpur, Bhandara and Akola districts, as per our specific order of April 30 immediately,” HC said. VIA told to submit names of cos having oxy cylinders While adding Vidarbha Industries Association (VIA) as respondent, the HC directed it to submit details about companies using oxygen cylinders and other infrastructural facilities necessary for its production, storage, distribution and supply to various hospitals in the region. CIL told to donate Rs11.88 cr for Covid hosps The HC directed Coal India Limited (CIL), to hold its emergency meeting and approve Western Coalfields Limited’s (WCL) proposal to provide Rs11.88 crore under corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds by May 4 for installing oxygen generation plants at various Covid hospitals like GMCH, IGGMCH and AIIMS. Earlier, as per HC directives, WCL informed that it had handed over the cheque of Rs2.05 crore to collector Ravindra Thakare for the purpose. “We direct the collector to take immediate steps for utilizing WCL funds for setting up oxygen plants at the Covid hospitals providing free treatment at his discretion. We must make an endeavour to see that these plants are made functional as far as possible within 20 to 25 days,” the justices said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/set-up-24x7-central-control-room-for-nagpurs-covid-management-on-lines-of-mumbai-hc/articleshow/82360858.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Wearing the traditional sherwani and rose garland, he took the stage and was waiting for his wife-to-be to take the ritualistic seven vows.  But the wait got a tad longer as Anil and his family members had to cool their heels in the police station for flagrant violation of Covid-19 rules.  Following specific information of a huge crowd of revellers, a team of Visavadar police raided the venue and arrested Anil and seven others.  "We got information that a huge crowd had gathered for the marriage. There were nearly 200 people whereas the government has permitted a maximum of 50 people in marriage functions," said Pradeepsinh Jadeja, deputy superintendent of police, Junagadh.  Along with Anil, police arrested his brother Paresh, bride's father Chaku Morabiya, priest solemnizing the marriage Haresh Bhatt, videographer Ashish Chudasama, photographer Ashok Vasoya and cook Pravin Gujarati.  All were taken to the police station and an offence under relevant sections of IPC and Epidemic Diseases Act was lodged against them. "They were released on bail after four hours and allowed to complete the marriage ceremony with strict adherence to Covid rules," Jadeja said.  Anil's family had arrived in Limdhara from Paatla village of adjoining Bhesan taluka in big numbers for the marriage. Covid-19 rules had gone for a complete toss as hardly anyone had worn masks while social distancing was completely absent. There was complete chaos when the police raided as the villagers and other revellers scurried for cover and escaped to their houses. The post-marriage feast was also called off, said police.Cops seized the video camera and the still camera too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/awaiting-saat-pheras-groom-in-visavadar-lands-in-jail/articleshow/82359535.cms||---

He didn’t expect his marriage to be a knotty affair, where he would be forced to recite mathematical tables to be eligible for ‘saat pheras’. And what could be a cakewalk for school-going kids, turned out to be a complex brain-teaser for the groom, who flunked the test and was snubbed by his bride. Just before the ‘jaimala’ ceremony, the bride grew suspicious about his would-be hubby’s education. She broke her silence and told the groom’s party that she will exchange wedding vows only if his would-be husband recited the math table of 2. The verdict was soon out after the man failed the test. Panwari station house officer, Vinod Kumar, said, it was an arranged marriage and the the groom hailed from Dhawar village of Mahoba district. “Members of the two families and several villagers had gathered at the marriage venue. Just as the wedding was about to be solemnised, the bride walked out of the mandap, saying she cannot marry a person, who can’t recite math table of 2,” he said. After friends and relatives failed to convince the girl, police were called to mediate, but they too failed. The bride’s cousin told TOI they were shocked to discover that the groom was unread. “The groom’s family had kept us in dark about his education. He may not have even gone to school. The groom’s family had cheated us. But my brave sister walked out without fearing social taboo,” she said. Police did not lodge a case after both parties struck a compromise on the intervention of prominent citizens of the village. The deal entailed the bride and groom’s families to return gifts and jewellery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/bride-forces-would-be-hubby-to-recite-math-table-he-flunks-she-walks-out-of-mandap/articleshow/82360733.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

Worries for officials increased further on Sunday as despite all their efforts to prevent crowding at panchayat poll counting venues, a large number of people gathered at the venues. Talking to TOI, district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma said the drive to distribute medicine kits in villages is going to be intensified from Tuesday. “We are estimating that each village in the district has 15-20 Covid-19 cases. In view of the estimation, we have targeted to provide medicine kits to those infected by the virus or showing symptoms at their homes in each village.” “During this drive, we will also appeal to villagers to remain cautious and start taking medicines in case they notice Covid-like symptoms. The villagers will also be asked to contact the nearest health centres and hospitals in case they notice deterioration in their health condition,” the DM added. Till March-end, the district had recorded 22,676 Covid-19 positive cases, but when the second wave of the pandemic struck, the district witnessed a sudden surge in Covid-19 cases adding around 45,000 new cases to its tally in April alone. Initially, the trend of new Covid cases remained confined to the limits of urban localities only, but the cases being reported in the past one week show that even the rural areas, especially those bordering the city limits, have also started witnessing Covid spread.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/admin-gears-up-as-covid-spreads-its-tentacles-in-rural-areas/articleshow/82361253.cms||---

Since April 27, Prayagraj has witnessed less than 1,600 Covid cases each day, as per the health department data. Between April 27 and May 1, the district recorded 6,892 Covid positive cases, including 1,389 on April 27, 1,267 on April 29, 1,493 on April 28, 1,598 on April 27 and 1,145 on May 1. Though the number of Covid cases seem to have tabilised in the last week of April, the rising graph of deaths is worrying. As per the health department, a total of 109 Covid deaths have been reported in the past five days, including 23 on May 1, 25 on April 30, 21 on April 29, 22 on April 28 and 18 on April 27.

A senior health official said, “The declining graph of new Covid cases and rising graph of recoveries have slightly improved the recovery percentage in the district. Converting mohallas with higher number of Covid cases into containment zones and ramping up testing have helped check the spread of the deadly disease to some extent.” The official further said that the joint team of police, health department, Prayagraj Municipal Corporation (PMC) and district administration are making sincere and continuous efforts to curb spread of Covid in urban, semi-urban and rural areas. Between April 22 and 26, as many as 10,010 Covid cases were reported, including 1,743 on April 26, 1,874 on April 25, 2,054 on April 24, 2,183 on April 23 and 2,156 on April 22. Besides, 9,505 patients recovered and were discharged from the hospitals/completed home isolation, including 1,399 on April 26, 1,821 on April 25, 1,807 on April 24, 2,309 on April 23 and 2,169 on April 22. The district also recorded 64 Covid deaths between April 22 and 26, including 13 on April 26, 11 on April 25, 13 on April 24, 14 on April 23 and 13 on April 22. Statistics of the health department claimed that the district started recording less than 2,000 Covid patients per day since April 25. Between April 15 and April 24, more than 2,000 were recorded per day. The health department data stated that Prayagraj recorded 2,236, 2,436, 2,416, 2164, 2,122 and 2,137 cases on April 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 and 21 respectively, while 863, 998, 1,201, 1,530, 1,697 and 1,843 Covid patients recovered on the same dates. Moreover, the data shows 1,682, 1,628, 1,754, 2,142 and 1,891 Covid cases were reported on April 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 respectively, while the number of recovered patients was 99, 224, 290, 403 and 622 on the same dates respectively. The data further shows that the number of recovered people started rising after April 10, and kept going up. A strict surveillance is being maintained to curb the rapid spread of Covid-19 and the number of containment zones has crossed the 200-mark in eight days.

The decision was taken on Saturday evening after which the official order was released with the signatures of member secretary Ashish Tiwari and chief environment officer Amit Chandra. According to the order, a copy of which is in possession of TOI, UPPCB has decided that any new or existing industrial unit may set up oxygen manufacturing plant or undertake modification or capacity enhancement in the existing unit, by filing an application on Nivesh Mitra portal (www.niveshmitra.up.nic.in) and start manufacturing oxygen by duly complying with the standards of emission and effluent as prescribed under the provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act. Following the order, IFFCO’s unit in Aonla, Bareilly, which is engaged in production of 16.5 tons per day (TPD) nitrogen, has started working to upgrade its facility to produce 130 cubic metre oxygen per hour. Talking to TOI, member secretary, UPPCB, Ashish Tiwari said, “Aonla’s IFFCO unit has applied for permission online to modify their system to produce oxygen for medical purpose with capacity to refill 450 cylinders of D-type with capacity of 46.7 litres each and 150 cylinders of B type with 10 litres capacity per day.” “Since we are facing an extraordinary health emergency, the approval for modification in plants has become secondary. Plant operators can start production of oxygen at the earliest,” he said. “Our nodal officers will visit plants later to inspect if all parameters of modification have been met or not,” he added. IFFCO’s Phulpur unit in Prayagraj, which has a capacity to produce 36 TPD nitrogen, is also upgrading its system to produce 130 cubic metres oxygen per hour. Both these plants are expected to start operations by May-end. Besides these two public units, two private fertilizer manufacturing plants in Sambhal and Shahjahanpur, each having capacity of producing eight cubic metres per hour and 30 cubic metres per hour of oxygen will start operations by May 10 and 15, respectively. All four plants will use cryogenic systems. Currently, there are 19 oxygen plants in the state including eight in Lucknow, two each in Aligarh, Jhansi and Moradabad and one each in Ayodhya, Basti, Varanasi, Bareilly and Muzaffarnagar which produce 168.9 TPD of oxygen. Apart from 19 oxygen plants, there are five other nitrogen-cum-oxygen manufacturing units which are producing 71.86 TPD oxgyen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/uppcb-cuts-red-tape-allows-units-to-produce-oxygen-after-online-plea/articleshow/82361544.cms||---

In the same period, infections rose in Nainital district (where the reserve is situated) by over 120%and deaths by over 108%. So, is there a correlation? Director general of health, Dr Tripti Bahuguna, said, “Nainital district had been following Covid protocols but surge in data in the period between October and March indicates that tourists might not have adhered to Covid-appropriate behaviour,” Rahul, director, CTR (who uses only his first name), meanwhile told TOI that all Covid protocols were being strictly followed by the reserve. “We were carrying out thermal checking, sanitisation and all other Covid norms for visitors,” he said. He added that “the reserve recorded a large footfall perhaps because people wanted to get away and explore nature after being in the shadow of the pandemic for a long time.” As per data of the forest department, 2.01 lakh visitors were recorded at CTR in the period between October 2020 and March 2021, earning the reserve revenues of over Rs 8 crore. In 2016-17, CTR had recorded 1.66 lakh visitors ( Rs 6.93 cr revenue), in 2017-18, 1.70 lakh visitors (Rs 6.47 cr revenue), in 2018-19, 1.73 lakh visitors (Rs 6.02 cr revenue) and in 2019-20, 1.65 lakh visitors (Rs 7.37 cr revenue). While the visitor surge happened, Nainital district – where the wildlife park is located-- saw a 120.64 % rise in Covid- positive cases and a 108.77% surge in Covid deaths in the period between October 1 and March 31 as per data of the health department. While there were 5958 cases on October 1, the figure rose to 13,146 by March 31. A total of 114 deaths were noted on October 1 which rose to 238 by March 31. Incidentally, the state government had given relaxation to tourists from September onwards, as a result of which visitors were not required to bring antigen or RT-PCR-negative report while coming to the state. Sources said that although CTR followed the safety norms laid by the National Tiger Conservation Authority, such as only 50% gypsy occupancy, no permission for elderlies above 55 years and children below 10 years, but as Covid cases subsided, even the stringency at the reserve turned into leniency. During the winter season which commenced from October, the reserve saw several high-profile visitors as well, including singer Sonu Nigam, actor Randeep Hooda as well as senior judges and bureaucrats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/did-record-footfall-in-corbett-tiger-reserve-between-2-covid-waves-lead-to-surge-in-cases-in-nainital-district/articleshow/82359538.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Mumbai||Restore Maharashtra's Remdesivir quota, HC urges Centre||NAGPUR: Upset over reduction in Remdesivir’s quota for Maharashtra for the period May 1-10, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court during an urgent hearing on Sunday asked the Centre to reconsider its decision in view of the high number of active Covid-19 cases in the state. The directives came on a suo motu PIL. Justices Sunil Shukre and Avinash Gharote noticed the state’s quota was reduced to 3,74,500 vials for May 1-10 from 4,35,000 fixed for April 21-30, a reduction of 60,500 vials as per Centre’s May 1 order. “Such reduction is not consistent with active cases in Maharashtra. On April 30, their numbers were 6.72 lakh and on May 1, those were 6.64 lakh. This means there is a reduction [in cases] by hardly 1.2%, while decrease in vials is about 14.5%. This mismatch needs to be reconsidered and removed by the Centre,” the judges said. While adjourning the hearing till May 5, the bench asked assistant solicitor general Ulhas Aurangabadkar to seek instructions in this regard. They directed the state chief secretary to take immediate steps to centralise the entire process of Remdesivir procurement from the seven manufacturing companies and its distribution among all districts. FDA commissioner Parimal Singh informed the court that they were making all efforts to ensure that the companies fulfilled their daily quota to the state, but there were still shortfalls. As per the billed quantity of supplies of May 1, there was a shortage of 1,43,034 vials. He added these firms were required to clear this backlog and also continue to supply in accordance with the quota already fixed by the Centre by its two orders of April 24 and May 1. Singh said that the department of disaster management had also issued an expression of interest on April 27 for supply of 10 lakh Remdesivir vials and so far 20,500 were received. The HC also ordered the health secretary to issue within 24 hours, a fresh district-wise allocation order based on the Centre’s May 1 order. “The order shall be uploaded on Union health ministry and FDA’s websites. This system would be in operation till the whole process of procurement, allocation and distribution of Remdesivir vials is centralized by the state,” it said. While issuing notices to the seven firms, the judges directed that none of them shall supply Remdesivir to private purchasers unless the daily quota for Maharashtra is first fulfilled. The HC on Saturday directed all authorities to expedite steps for importing Remdesivir. The bench observed that the chief secretary had failed to brief the HC adequately and appropriately. “...We direct the secretary to obtain all compliances as per April 22 communication from the Union ministry,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/restore-maharashtra-remdesivir-quota-hc-urges-centre/articleshow/82361550.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Delhi||Strapped RWAs request govt for Covid help||New Delhi: To ease the problems for residents and needy people, many colonies set up Covid-19 isolation facilities with oxygen cylinders, oxygen concentrators and medicines. But the residents’ welfare association are having difficulties in continuing such operations due to deficiencies in oxygen availability and lack of flow meters, medicines and other equipment. The scarcity and the chaos at oxygen refilling stations have prevented RWAs from stocking up on cylinders for weeks, while the strict government norms have now made it difficult for them to procure medicines. The opportunistic increase in prices of medicines and gas cylinders at four to five times the normal prices is also hobbling their efforts. “Our attempt to help the people in home isolation and getting them online medical supervision has been badly affected due to the oxygen crisis,” revealed Pankaj Agarwal of Safdarjung Enclave RWA. “None of our seven cylinders has been refilled due to lack of stocks at the local Arjun Nagar refilling stations. Refilling them at the oxygen plants requires the permission of the local administration. Similarly, the purchasing medicines for Covid requires documents to be submitted. There are long queues at the pharmacies too.” There have been instances where RWAs staff have been unable to get refills for two-three consecutive days. “First of all, it is a challenge to find an empty cylinder. Even if you get your hands on one, getting it filled is another herculean task,” said Sanjay Rana, president, Greater Kailash II RWA. “Certain people are ready to help, but they are demanding money in advance, that too three times the normal rates. Still, we are doing everything to keep the operations going at our quarantine facility.” The Jangpura Extension RWA had three oxygen concentrators and six cylinders for use by the residents. “While the concentrators are being used by ailing residents every day, our cylinders were lying empty,” rued Kapil Kakkar, RWA president. “We have now given them to residents to arrange for refilling on their own as our attempts to get them refilled at stations proved futile. One of our residents requested a Remdesivir injection and it took all our effort to procure it at six times the original cost.” A member of the Lajpat Nagar 3 RWA also reported difficulties in refilling empty oxygen cylinders. “Volunteers form our colony are going to Manesar, Ballabhgarh, Sonipat and to gurdwaras and waiting there for 6-7 hours to fill a single cylinder. We need support for our efforts,” S B Singh, RWA president said. The RWAs have urged Delhi government to look into the matter given that these facilities are of much comfort for the hundreds of people in home isolation. Satyajit Vaish of NGO Manav Vikas Society in Panchsheel Park, who was helping people with oxygen, is now sending his employees to Manesar, Muzaffarnagar and Meerut to get cylinders refilled. “The existing circumstances has forced many people who do not actually need hospitalisation to get themselves admitted in a hospital so that in case of an emergency, they wouldn’t have to run around for oxygen,” noted Vaish. “This sort of thinking adds to the chaos of the already overburdened healthcare system in the city.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/strapped-rwas-request-govt-for-covid-help/articleshow/82378039.cms||Vibha Sharma

Rema’s spectacular victory in the Left stronghold, which has never elected a non-Left representative in history, has turned out to be a retribution of sorts as it comes just two days ahead of the ninth death anniversary of her husband, who was hacked to death on May 4, 2012, in one of the most chilling political killings of Kerala wherein several CPM activists were convicted. Rema defeated LDF’s Manayath Chandran of Loktantrik Janata Dal (LJD) by a margin of 7,491 votes to become the maiden MLA of RMP, an outfit of rebel CPM activists led by her late husband in 2009. She was able to maintain a lead from the beginning of vote counting till the end. Rema, who during campaigning vowed to be Chandrasekharan’s voice in the assembly, said that her win was actually the victory of her husband. “As I had said, I will be T P Chandrasekharan’s voice that will reverberate in the assembly. The people of Vadakara have voted in favour of peace and unity,” she said. Rema’s candidature had brought to the poll agenda the martyrdom of Chandrasekharan. She was able to appeal to people, especially women voters, cutting across party lines and had secured support even from traditional CPM sympathizers. She was able to secure 47.6% votes while the LDF candidate could get only 42.1% of the 1,36,673 votes polled. The election saw a drop in BJP’s vote share from 10.7% to 7.4%. Rema had to face three namesakes but they could not get many votes. Rema had contested the 2016 assembly elections as an independent candidate and had secured over 20,000 votes to come third behind C K Nanu of LDF who had won by a margin of 9,511 votes. Manayath Chandran had contested in 2016 as UDF candidate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/its-revenge-via-ballot-for-rema/articleshow/82360895.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Varanasi||Medicine shops, ambulance drivers fleecing patients on police radar now||Times News Network Varanasi: The medical stores overcharging buyers for medicines and citical instruments like pulse oximeter amid shortage triggered by sudden huge demand as well as ambulance drivers charging unreasonably high fare from patients have now started falling in police net. Police commissioner A Satish Ganesh said that on being alerted about overpricing of gadgets and instruments like pulse oximeter, thermometer and nebulisers in the market, inspector Lanka Mahesh Pandey sent a local native to buy an oximeter at Shri Krishna Medical Store. The man was charged Rs 1,400 for an oximeter, much high than the maximum retail price printed on the packing. Ganesh said the receipt given by the shopkeeper mentioned only the amount with no details of the oximeter, brand name, maximum retail price and other details. When the police team entered the shop and started seeking details of the oximeter, the shop owner failed to give a satisfactory reply following which a case was registered against him. The chief medical officer was also given a report to initiate appropriate action against the shop owner. Inspector Lanka and his team was given a cash reward of Rs 5,000 for this action, Ganesh added. Earlier on Friday, one Haider Ali alerted traffic police on its helpline number 7317202020 about being overcharged by an ambulance driver for ferrying his patient from Kabirchaura to Bhojubir. Taking prompt action, traffic inspector contacted the ambulance driver and sought reason for charging a huge amount from Ali. Following intervention of police, the ambulance driver deposited Rs 3,000 in the bank account of Ali. The CP said that it was good to see that people have started taking police help against overpricing of medicines, medical instruments and ambulance by contacting helpline or local police stations. Meanwhile, the enforcement teams formed to check hoarding, blackmarkting, overcharging by hospitals are also operating round the clock to stop such practices and help people get medical aid timely at fair price.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/medicine-shops-ambulance-drivers-fleecing-patients-on-police-radar-now/articleshow/82360753.cms||---

Till 10.30pm, the EC had declared results of 70 of 126 seats and trends of remaining 56. The NDA has so far won 47 seats and was leading in 26 while Congress and its Mahajot has won 23 seats and was leading in remaining 28. In two seats, two independents were leading. In 2016, the NDA had won 87 seats. Read AlsoNarrative must move away from demonisation, fear in AssamBJP and its allies’ comfortable win in the complex state of Assam makes history — it is the first non-Congress party to win back-to-back elections to the 126-seat assembly. Assam, once seen as a Congress bastion, is bisected by the Brahmaputra which divides the land into the north bank and the southBut no party looks to be on course to make it past the halfway mark of 63 in the house of 126 alone. BJP is likely to finish as the single largest party with 60 seats, which would be construed as no improvement given the fact that it had won the same number of seats five years back. AGP’s number of seats has come down from 14 in 2016 to eight and the alliance’s new partner UPPL had managed to win five out of 12 seats in BTC till the last update. “We will have an absolute majority. A stronger opposition means a healthier democracy,” Himanta Biswa Sarma said but didn’t want to go into the analysis of the results in view of the Covid-19 situation. Read AlsoSonowal or Himanta? BJP keeps everyone guessing on CMEven as NDA won the Assam mandate yet again, the guessing game on who will be CM — Sarbananda Sonowal or Himanta Biswa Sarma — has begun, since BJP didn’t name a CM candidate prior to polling.The election, which was fought on the issue of protecting Assam’s identity, got strongly polarised on religious lines and is likely to give four more seats to Congress and two more to AIUDF than in 2016.  What helped BJP survive the CAA fire was its ability to project NRC as an antidote to the CAA and its pledge to implement Clause VI of the Assam Accord, which proposes to protect the identity of indigenous Assamese people. Ironically, NRC and Clause VI are Congress’s creations while CAA is BJP’s brainchild. BJP also benefited from the votes cut into by anti-CAA parties AJP and Raijor Dal, which otherwise would have gone to Congress. “This election was definitely the battle for Assamese culture and Assamese civilisation and the mandate has been given to BJP to protect them. There was also PM Narendra Modi’s push for development that steered BJP,” Sarma said. Chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal and Himanta Biswa Sarma have both won their seats of Majuli and Jalukbari respectively. NDA partner AGP’s president Atul Bora has also won from Bokakhat.  Congress president Ripun Bora, who had projected himself as a CM face for Congress, was defeated, while three BPF ministers of the outgoing government lost to UPPL.

Both were declared Covid-positive after their death in a Malviya Nagar government hospital on April 27, Datta said on Tuesday, while recounting her trauma in a Twitter post. “Many people like me perhaps thought that it couldn’t happen to them! But it did happen! My mother and husband, both, died without any treatment. We failed to have access to all top-notch Delhi hospitals we used to visit! Yes, after death they declared Covid-positive,” said Datta, who was Rashtrapati Bhavan spokesperson when Pratibha Patil was the President. While her husband A R Dutta, who retired as director of the defence ministry’s training institute, was 68, her mother Bani Mukherjee was 88, the family’s story underscoring the crisis of oxygen and hospital beds in Delhi.  “My son rushed both the patients to various private hospitals in south Delhi, but were not admitted. Finally, a government hospital in Malviya Nagar admitted them” she said. Her son Abhishek, who ferried his father and grandmother from hospital to hospital when their oxygen levels plummeted, is yet to come out of the shock.  “I lost both of them within a span of an hour. My father was declared dead on arrival, while they tried to revive my grandmother, but gave up after an hour long try,” he said. One week later, the rest of the family, except Abhishek, has also tested positive, Datta said. “I have not been able to grieve for my mother and husband. My niece is low on oxygen and my son has to run around for oxygen cylinders. We do not want to risk her life as we know that every hospital will turn us down,” she said.

At the meeting attended by home secretary A K Bhalla, NITI Aayog member Dr V K Paul, Delhi chief secretary, senior officials of the health ministry and commissioners of municipal corporations of Delhi and NDMC chairman, Gauba asked Delhi government to make available all relevant information on Covid beds and other facilities/medicine to the public, through dedicated websites/ apps. This, he said, would help people in need of such facilities/ medicines to approach the right place. Dr Paul underlined the seriousness of the present situation and recommended that small nursing homes and hospitals be roped in for augmenting the medical infrastructure of the Capital. He asked for Covid care centres to be opened in hotels and similar places, as per the protocol. In order to supplement the 24x7 helpline of the Delhi Government, Paul recommended that the Delhi Medical Association be requested to offer around 50 volunteer doctors to provide medical consultation to Covid patients, on use of medicines, oxygen concentrators and other medical facilities. Delhi government briefed the Cabinet secretary on aspects such as the recent trends in active cases, deaths and positivity rate; availability and expansion plans of medical infrastructure; status of oxygen availability; home isolation procedures and helpline; ambulance services; and testing. On issues related to availability of oxygen, the cabinet secretary asked the Delhi government to make all-out efforts to lift their allocated oxygen, using all the means at their disposal; and also to ensure that the oxygen available to them is distributed rationally and in a transparent manner, ruling out any diversion or leakage. A health ministry official emphasised the need for setting up oxygen audit committees in various hospitals and medical facilities. Gauba suggested a single helpline to be created at the front end, to provide relevant clinical information to the needy people. The helpline, he said, could be serviced through a dedicated and well-staffed call centre. To ramp up medical manpower, the cabinet secretary asked the Delhi Government to create flexible procedures to engage the services of retired medical professionals. He particularly emphasised on the need to augment testing and ensure timely test results.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/after-review-cabinet-secy-stresses-on-ramping-up-citys-medical-infra/articleshow/82360902.cms||---

The French national had tested positive and was admitted at Kingsway Hospital for the last four days. He was mildly symptomatic, having fever and cough, officials said. The move comes in the backdrop of acute healthcare crisis across the country in the second Covid wave. The foreigner had been provided all necessary healthcare services, officials said. Availability of beds and other resources was not an issue amid a gradual dip in cases and hospital admissions. The French embassy decided to move the patient to Bordeaux in a medical aircraft after his medical investigation showed increased inflammatory markers and an HRCT score of 5. The Kingsway Hospital team including Dr Rajan Barokar and Dr Mohd Ahteshamoddin were handling the case and patient’s transfer to Nagpur airport. Dr Barokar said the patient was maintaining oxygen saturation level at 95. “Since his inflammatory markers were increased, we had to inform the French embassy, which asked to shift him,” he said. Aejaz Shami, AGM marketing and communications at Kingsway, said the patient was handed over to French medical team at 4.50pm on Sunday. “The air ambulance left around 5.15pm. The medical aircraft had taken off from Helsinki (Scandinavia) and taken a halt at Tashkent (Uzbekistan). After the crew took some rest, it took off and reached Nagpur around 3pm on Sunday,” he said. Shami added that after the patient boarded the air ambulance at 3.45pm, the doctor inside the aircraft conducted a medical check-up on him before flying out. Officials said the aircraft, managed by International SOS, will refuel at Ankara and reach Bordeaux on Monday (May 3, at midnight). “An ambulance will shift the patient to Agen Hospital there,” Shami said. The International SOS team were provided patient’s passport copy, RTPCR report and case summary, which are needed to apply for landing permit for the air ambulance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-ve-aviation-co-official-airlifted-to-france/articleshow/82360899.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Aurangabad||Active cases more in rural areas of Aurangabad dist||Aurangabad: The rural parts of the district have around 7,059 active cases of Covid, which is much more compared to 4,171 active cases in the municipal limits of Aurangabad.As per the official data, rural areas have been reporting more Covid cases daily than the municipal limits in the recent past, which is reflected in terms of more caseload in the former category. Aurangabad zilla parishad CEO Mangesh Gondavale on Sunday said around 19 dedicated Covid health centres (DCHC) were coming up in rural areas to boost the healthcare system. “Besides state-run Covid care centres and a few DCHCs, the private health facilities will offer healthcare to Covid patients. These private DCHCs will together have a capacity of around 2,000 beds with oxygen, ICU beds and ventilators,” he said, adding that there will be an official check on billing at these private facilities. The municipal limits of Aurangabad have already witnessed some major private hospitals getting the official tag of DCHC and dedicated Covid hospitals (DCHs). Gondavale said early testing is the key to contain the spread of Covid-19 in rural areas. “The rural population across nine talukas of the district has almost double the population within he municipal limits. The lack of awareness about early testing is one of the reasons behind the spread of the infection in rural areas and at spread faster. At our end, we are educating people about the benefits of early testing,” he said. Among nine talukas in Aurangabad district, Vaijapur has 1,452 active cases, which is the highest, while Soyagaon has the lowest cases (151). The tehsil limits of Aurangabad, which includes many fringe areas of Aurangabad city, have 1,443 active cases, show official data. Both rural areas and the municipal limits have reported 2% death rate among Covid patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/active-cases-more-in-rural-areas-of-aurangabad-dist/articleshow/82359077.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||More flamingo population at Jayakwadi||Aurangabad: Large to very large flocks of Greater flamingos are being seen at Jayakwadi bird sanctuary as the water level of Nathsagar dam is gradually receding. Assistant conservator of forest (wildlife) Rajendra Nale said it was encouraging to see flamingos in such large number at the bird sanctuary. “We expect flamingos to stay for at least next some days at Jayakwadi dam till arrival of pre-monsoon showers. This year, we also spotted many juveniles along with adult flamingos which has doubled the joy of experts and conservationists,” he said. While these attractive winged creatures were found missing during the bird census conducted on February 28, a flock of Greater flamingos was seen later during second week of March, sparking enthusiasm among nature lovers. The delayed arrival of flamingos this year was attributed to many reasons, including availability of other water bodies on the way of migration journey of flamingos. Divisional forest officer (wildlife) Vijay Satpute said sizeable population of flamingos is a good indicator for Jayakwadi bird sanctuary. “Besides flamingos, a range of other migratory birds arrived at the sanctuary this year. However, a very large geographical spread of the dam makes sighting of many birds impossible, giving an impression that birds have turned their back on the sanctuary,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/more-flamingo-population-at-jayakwadi/articleshow/82359083.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Nagpur||Nagpur’s Covid cases drop by 6,000, TPR by 3% last week||NAGPUR: Covid-19 positive cases dropped by around 6,000 in the district in the last one week as compared to previous week. Sunday saw cases falling to 5,007, which was the lowest tally in a day in 26 days. According to experts, these are indications of the curve flattening and the exact picture will be clear after May first week. Of the 5,007 cases reported on Sunday, 2,724 were from the city, 2,269 from rural and 14 from other districts. On April 6, cases were 3,75. Since then, the tally has been above 5,100 on all days with the highest 7,999 cases coming on April 24. Between April 26 and May 2, the district recorded 45,182 cases for a daily average of 6,454. During this period, 1,59,406 tests were conducted for a daily average of 22,772. Thus, test positivity rate (TPR) was 28.34%. The district registered 51,082 cases for a daily average of 7,297 between April 19 and 25. Tests were 1,61,543 for a daily average of 23,077. TPR was 31.62%. A comparison between these two weeks shows decline in cases and TPR. Cases declined by 5,900 and tests by only 2,137. TPR too dropped by 3.28%. It shows cases declined not due to reduction in tests but due to drop in TPR. The district had registered its first case on March 11, 2020. Peak of first wave was in the last two weeks of August and entire September. Since beginning of October, the cases continuously declined till second week of February this year. The district started witnessing second wave from the third week of February and rise in cases. Infectious diseases specialist Dr Nitin Shinde told TOI that weekly growth rate of cases and TPR are on decline. “These are indicators of flattening of the curve. This is typically end of 10 weeks of second wave. Surges have receded by 10 weeks elsewhere in other countries. The district, especially city, is now in that phase,” he said. On Sunday evening, number of vacant beds in private and government hospitals in the city increased to 373, of which 351 were beds with oxygen supply and 22 in ICU, as per data of the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). There were 241 beds with oxygen supply vacant in private and government hospitals in the city on Friday evening. There were 21 beds vacant in ICU. Thus, total number of vacant beds was 262. On Thursday evening, 191 beds were vacant of which 175 with oxygen supply and 16 in ICU. Vacant beds were 160, of which 146 with oxygen supply and 14 in ICU, on Wednesday while on Tuesday 139 beds (134 with oxygen supply and 5 in ICU) were vacant. Before that there were no vacant beds in the city. Guardian minister Nitin Raut on Sunday inspected newly developed Covid care centre (CCC) at Koradi. The Mahagenco in association with Datta Meghe Medical College and Shalinitai Meghe Hospital, Research Centre has developed the CCC. Raut directed the officials of Mahegenco to increase the beds from existing 20 to 50 for patients of rural areas. Currently, 10 beds are with oxygen supply and remaining are non-oxygen beds. The minister also inspected sub-district hospital (SDH) at Kamptee and gave directives to increase beds by 100. He also directed the officials to shift 42 metric tonne oxygen plant from Khaparkheda thermal power station to SDH. Later, Raut inaugurated oxygen plant developed at Asha Hospital which will help in refilling 100 jumbo oxygen cylinders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/dists-cases-drop-by-6k-tpr-by-3-last-week/articleshow/82360922.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Rajkot||Deputy sarpanch refuses to pay extortion money, shot||Rajkot: A 50-year-old deputy sarpanch of a village in Jamnagar district was shot dead after he refused to pay extortion money to local goons who were threatening to harm his sand mining business. According to the police, the victim Kantilal Malaviya, a resident of Balambha village in Jodiya taluka, was rushed to a hospital in Jamnagar where he succumbed to the bullet injuries. Malaviya was a sand-mine lease holder. The accused had allegedly demanded extortion money and threatened to harm his business if he did not pay up. Nilesh Malaviya, 38, a computer operator in Malaviya’s office, lodged a complaint against four persons including Ayyub Jasariya, Asgar Kamora and two unidentified persons. “Ayyub and Asgar had come to the deputy sarpanch’s office two days ago and threatened with dire consequences if he did not pay them. However, Malaviya did not take the threat seriously,” said a police official. On Saturday evening, when he and Nilesh were sitting in the office with some others, Ayyub, Asgar and two others came with weapons and a sword. “The four fired two rounds outside the office. To save themselves, Malaviya and others locked the office from inside. But the assailants fired at Malaviya from the window. Nilesh tried to close the window but one of the accused slashes his hand with a sword,” a police official said. Hearing the gun shots, locals rushed to the spot but the assailants managed to escape. Nilesh and Malaviya were rushed to the GG Hospital in Jamnagar where the latter died. Primary investigation suggests that the assailants fired three rounds at the spot including one which hit Malaviya inside the room.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/deputy-sarpanch-refuses-to-pay-extortion-money-shot/articleshow/82359578.cms||---
---||Kochi||How Pinarayi Vijayan scored with mass contact in Kerala||KOCHI: It was a Drishyam 2 moment for CM Pinarayi Vijayan, when the hyper active, vernacular media hounded him and asked how he could take his wife along in the same car, violating Covid protocols, as he had tested positive. The CM had replied tersely: “I see nothing wrong. During these trying times, your family is your only strength.” That show of bonding of a close-knit family in the public was a very unlikely statement coming from a weather-beaten comrade, where at party study classes they are taught that the world at large is your first family. But Pinarayi knew that his image as a benign patriarch was already sealed and this statement would only add to the sympathy in the voters’ minds. He could get away with it, because he was extracting his pound of flesh now. The CM’s transformation from a cold, heartless politician —whose party had butchered fellow comrade like TP Chandreskaran— into a caring captain, who came on prime-time television almost every other day for over a year, lecturing, advising, admonishing and lending a helping hand to the people of Kerala had made a huge positive impact, especially among the women. For the first time, Malayalam TV serials took a back seat and people listened to the CM as an emotional balm in these uncertain times. Too much importance is perhaps given to the distribution of free kits as a reason for the LDF sweep, which debases the minds of the literate Kerala voter. The LDF government could manage to bring in a public perception that Pinarayi meant business and things were under control despite Kerala logging one of the highest number of Covid-positive cases in the country today. Yes, it is a fact that CPM would have found it tough to win had the pandemic not occurred, given that many of their leaders were mired in corruption scandals. But it is not about the eruption of a tragedy, but in finding ways and means to tell people that the state is with you. Politics in Kerala has always been an art of compromise, of dilution of ideologies, be it the left, right or center, and tilted more towards having mass contact with the voters in your respective constituencies. The most successful politicians here are those who reached out to the citizens at the micro level, like your friendly neighbourhood Spiderman, and he is there when someone in your family dies or makes his presence felt at a wedding party. Unlike other states, politics in Kerala is rooted in how much you can give back to your constituency and that is the reason why leaders like K Babu keep winning despite getting mired in scams. Unfortunately, the average voter rejected the collective leadership of Ramesh Chennithala and Mullappally Ramachandran, who were seen more as disruptors trying to overthrow the incumbent regime so that they can grab power. Rahul Gandhi, too, was seen as an outsider, who was elected MP from Wayanad just to stall the BJP juggernaut. In fact, grassroot leaders like P J Joseph and Oommen Chandy have more mass connect in Kerala than the Congress president, a fact that Rahul needs to learn from the local leaders if Congress wants to give a serious challenge to LDF. Deep sea diving can make you go viral, but not win elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/how-pinarayi-scored-with-mass-contact/articleshow/82360927.cms||---

A village pradhan in her last tenure, Aasiya is the third generation of the family, whose members have never lost a rural election since their patriarch, Mohammad Ali, won the first pradhan’s election seven decades ago. Daringapur is a hamlet in Risauli Gauspur subdivision of Barabanki. Talking to TOI, Aasiya said, “I am the daughter-in-law of the family and I am taking the legacy forward. My husband's grandfather Haji Mohammad Ali was elected unopposed in the first gram pradhan election in 1952. And he remained village head till his death in 1965. The mantle was passed on to my father-in-law, Faqeer Baksh, who was elected and continued in the post till 1995. After the seat was reserved for women, my mother-in-law, Hajira Khatoon, was elected and she held sway till 2005.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/aasiya-wins-retains-clans-70-yr-control-on-barabanki-village/articleshow/82361572.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

Counting took place at 829 centres across the state. Voting for the four-phased rural elections – considered a bellwether of the high-stakes UP assembly elections due next year – ended on Thursday with an average turnout of 73%. Till reports came in, BJP-supported candidates were leading in most zila panchayat ward seats, followed by SP and BSP-backed candidates. Many districts, including Azamgarh, Siddharthnagar, Jaunpur, Sultanpur, Amethi, Jalaun, Fatehpur, Gonda and Sitapur witnessed overcrowding at counting venues in open violation of social distancing norms. State election commission had asked district administrations to make a public announcement, warning people against flouting Corona protocols. It also instructed officials on the ground to sanitise venues, ensure no crowds gathered outside counting centres and polling agents maintain social distancing. The poll panel directions were, however, flouted even as supporters of candidates assembled at the venue gates. In Kannauj, there were reports of nine counting agents testing Covid positive and in Firozabad, police resorted to lathicharge to control overcrowding. At many centres, people outside the venues did not wear masks. Corona protocol violations forced chief minister Yogi Adityanath to step in and he issued stern directives to district magistrates and district police chiefs to restrict crowding at counting centres. On Saturday, Supreme Court had asked state election commission to ensure strict adherence to Covid-19 protocols and preserve CCTV footage of counting venues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/covid-19-protocols-go-for-toss-at-panchayat-poll-counting-venues/articleshow/82361563.cms||Pankaj Shah

But the most high-profile defector, Suvendu Adhikari, defeated Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee in Nandigram. Former state irrigation minister Rajib Banerjee, whose join of BJP was considered one of the most high- profile defections after Adhikari, lost from Howrah’s Domjur to Trinamool’s Kalyan Ghosh by 42,512 votes. The scene was similar at Bally and Shibpur, where former Trinamool leader Vaishali Dalmiya and former Howrah mayor Rathin Chakraborty were defeated. Former Bidhannagar mayor Sabyasachi Dutta, who had changed over to the BJP in 2019, when he was the sitting MLA of Rajarhat-Newtown, was also defeated by 7,000 votes at the Bidhannagar seat by fire minister Sujit Bose. The people of Singur, a place which had paved the way for Mamata Banerjee’s journey to the CM’s post, stayed with her and defeated Rabindranath Bhattacharya, one of the main architects of the farmers’ movement who switched to BJP two days after Trinamool replaced the four-time MLA with Becharam Manna as a candidate. “I accept my defeat. People perhaps could not take my defection well. I will continue my tirade against corruption,” he said. Prabir Ghoshal, who rebelled against TMC and contested on a BJP ticket, lost the Uttarpara seat to newcomer Kanchan Mullick. At Champdali, TMC’s former trade union leader Dilip Singh lost, too. The story was reverse for Tanmoy Ghosh, who joined BJP before the elections and won the Bishnupur seat by defeating Trinamool’s Archita Bid. Trinamool’s Partha Sarathi Chatterjee, who changed over to BJP, defeated his former “guru” Shankar Singh in the Ranaghat North West seat. But former Malda zilla parishad sabhadhipati Gour Mondal lost the Manikchowk seat, indicating Trinamool was the top choice in Malda. Three Congress MLAs, Sabina Yasmin, Samar Mukherjee and Nihar Ghosh, who joined Trinamool, had a resounding win. Goutam Roy, who had contested the Kandi (Murshidabad) by-poll in 2019 on a Trinamool ticket and lost, defected to BJP before polls but lost to Trinamool’s Apurbo Sarkar, who had joined from the Congress In east and west Burdwan, all three outgoing Trinamool MLAs who had switched to BJP—Jitendra Kumar Tiwari from Pandabeshwar, Saikat Panja from Monteshwar who lost to heavyweight Siddiqullah Chowdhury and Biswajit Kundu from East Burdwan—also lost. The story was repeated in Bijpur, Noapara and Khardah. BJP’s Mukul Roy’s son Subhrangshu Roy joined the BJP in 2019. He lost to Trinamool’s Subodh Adhikari in Bijpur. Sunil Singh, TMC’s sitting MLA from Noapara, was defeated by TMC’s Manju Basu. In December 2020, Barrackpore TMC MLA Silbhadhra Dutta switched to BJP but was defeated by Kajol Sinha, a posthumous winner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tmc-rebels-get-bjp-tickets-lose-to-ex-party/articleshow/82360942.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

Saturday had seen 412 people succumbing to the disease, the highest single-day toll till date in Delhi. Sunday, however, saw the positivity rate dip below 30% for the first time in two weeks. Delhi recorded 20,394 new Covid-19 cases on Sunday, from 71,997 tests carried out in last 24 hours, out of which 54,487 were RT-PCR tests and 17,510 were rapid antigen tests, with a positivity rate of 28.33%. The last time the figure was lower than this and below 30% was on April 19, when 23,686 fresh Covid-19 cases were reported from 90,696 tests, with a positivity rate of 26.12%. It was also the day when a lockdown was imposed in Delhi, which is still in place with the exponential rise in Covid-19 cases. The next day (April 20), Delhi recorded 28,395 Covid-19 cases with a positivity rate of 32.82% and the positivity rate remained above 30% after that, till Sunday. With 24,444 people recovering from the disease in the past 24 hours, which is more than the number of new cases reported, the total number of active cases came down to 92,290 from the figure that stood at 96,747 on Saturday. However, the availability of oxygen and ICU beds remain scarce. Data shared by the state health department shows that 50,742 or nearly 55% of the patients are recuperating under home isolation. Out of the total 21,483 Covid-19 hospital beds, 20,136 beds are occupied and 1,347 are vacant. Of the 5,525 beds in dedicated Covid care centres, 896 are occupied and of the 206 beds in dedicated Covid health centres, 122 are occupied. Out of the total 5,154 Covid-19 ICU beds, only 20 are vacant and 5,134 are occupied. The 412 Covid-19 fatalities reported on Saturday was the highest number of deaths recorded in 24 hours in the city till date. Earlier, on April 29, Delhi had recorded 395 deaths due to the viral illness. The total number of deaths due to Covid-19 in the national capital has reached 16,966, which is the second-highest in the country after Maharashtra, where around 70,000 people have succumbed to the disease since the beginning of the pandemic. From April 1 to May 1, Delhi had recorded 6,262 deaths, averaging 202 fatalities daily. In March, the average death reported daily was around four. While the number of tests being conducted in Delhi has come down in the last few weeks, the positivity rate remains high, even though it witnessed a slight dip on Sunday. In April second week, the city conducted over one lakh tests, of which nearly 70,000 tests were done using RT-PCR, which is considered the gold standard for testing. According to Delhi government, the imposition of lockdown is the primary reason the footfalls are low. Delhi reported 36.2% positivity rate, the highest so far, on April 22 and it has been coming down slowly since then.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/deaths-still-high-but-positivity-rate-lt30/articleshow/82360192.cms||Sidharatha Roy

It seems the keenness of the womenfolk faded gradually down south with Thiruvananthapuram registering the least turnout of 61%. The question is how women voted this year — how their views differed across age groups or urban or rural areas? Kochi-based think tank Centre for Public Policy Research (CPPR) conducted a post-poll survey in 14 constituencies spread across the state, giving insights into the way the women voted this time. While 41% women voted for LDF in 2016, it grew to 46% in 2021, shows the survey. On the other hand, 40% women had voted for the UDF in 2016, which came down to 37% this time. But, NDA improved the women’s votes from 6% to 11%. However, looking at various income levels, we get a different picture. About 75% women with more than Rs 10 lakh annual income voted in favour of UDF, while only 25% voted for LDF. In the Rs 5-10 lakh annual income group, only 20% voted for UDF, while 60% voted for LDF. In the age group 18-30 years, 31% women voted for UDF in 2016, and 34% for LDF. These figures changed to 36% and 49%, respectively in 2021, CPPR survey shows. In 2016, among women aged 31-40 years, 41% voted for UDF and 45% voted for LDF. However, these figures changed to 37% and 45%, respectively in 2021. For women aged 41-50, UDF was the preferred party for 50% and LDF for 36% in 2016. However, these changed to 43% and 39% respectively in 2021. Similarly, women aged 51-60 years, 40% had chosen UDF and 44% had opted LDF in 2016, which moved to 34% and 47% respectively in 2021. For women aged above 60 years, 26% were in favour of UDF and 64% in favour of LDF in 2016. These figures changed to 21% and 67% in 2021. For 48% of women voters surveyed, it was the political party that mattered the most in their decision of voting. About 26% of them said that they looked at the candidate to decide whether to vote for that person or not. And another 11% were impressed by the performance of the LDF government in taking their decisions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ldfs-women-voters-grow/articleshow/82360948.cms||Shenoy Karun
---||Delhi||Delhi to get 5 oxygen tankers from IOC, special team to fight O2 crisis||NEW DELHI: The Delhi government has put in place measures to tackle the oxygen crisis that the capital is facing. A team has been formed to monitor the Covid-19 situation and plans are in place on how the government is going to deal with the oxygen shortage being faced in the city, it said in a statement. The government said that to meet the challenges thrown by the emergency situation and to ensure steady supply of oxygen to all hospitals and other healthcare facilities, a dedicated team of seven IAS officials has been planned. Delhi is going to receive five additional oxygen tankers from Indian Oil Corporation Ltd, the government said in the statement. On Sunday, the city received 120 metric tonnes of liquid oxygen through the second ‘Oxygen Express’ that arrived from Eastern Railway. The government also said that as per directions of Delhi High Court, an official of the Delhi government had been deployed in an oxygen plant in Faridabad, Haryana to ensure timely oxygen supply from there to Delhi. The Delhi government said that an important meeting was held with the Indian Air Force, rail ministry and senior central government officials to solve the problems related to the oxygen crisis in the capital. In the statement, the state government said that the Centre had taken additional steps and the Union ministry of commerce & industry had appointed an official of additional secretary rank as nodal officer for oxygen supply in Delhi. “This will help in keeping an eye on the oxygen situation in Delhi in real time. The Ministry of Home Affairs is also in touch with our officials to ensure that Delhi’s requirement for oxygen is adequately met.” The Delhi government said that bringing oxygen tankers from different parts of the country to Delhi had brought up some logistical issues as Delhi didn’t have oxygen production facilities of its own and officials were working hard to ensure that supply chain was maintained. To ensure that there are no obstacles in oxygen supply, a team of officials has been deployed and a team is looking into all oxygen-related SOS messages. All the 11 district magistrates of Delhi have been asked to ensure proper oxygen cylinder distribution. This is an unprecedented situation and there is a need to deal with the dynamic situation with emerging developments, the government said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-to-get-5-oxygen-tankers-from-ioc-special-team-to-fight-o2-crisis/articleshow/82360947.cms||---

The state government has increased the time restrictions for operation of shops by three hours. Traders will now be allowed to operate only from 7am to 7pm, instead of earlier 6am to 9pm. Sawant said that “bar, casinos, sports complexes, swimming pools, weekly markets, cinema halls, schools, colleges, educational institutes etc. will continue to remain closed”. Restrictions under Section 144 of the IPC will continue in the state. The chief minister warned violators of strict action. Activities under shops and establishments will remain open from 7am to 7pm, including essential services like grocery shops, pharmacies, health facilities, agriculture and construction related activities, ATMs, LPG dealerships, etc, he said. Sawant said that marriages can take place with 50 or less people with the permission of the district magistrate or sub-divisional magistrate. At cremation grounds, less than 20 people will be allowed, he said.

Chief minister said that restaurants with 50% sitting capacity would be allowed to remain open between 7am to 7pm, however, restaurant kitchens will be allowed to provide home delivery and takeaway anytime. Earlier the timing for restaurant operation was between 6am and 9 pm. TOI first reported that Sawant will not continue lockdown in the state. The four-day lockdown ends on Monday morning. “There will be no lockdown. Considering the rise in Covid cases and deaths, the state government has decided to follow strict restrictions. We have to impose these restrictions because people move out unnecessarily from their houses even after telling them repeatedly,” Sawant said. “I hope that people will support the government to reduce the mortality rate due to Covid,” he said. He also said that if people of the state cooperate with the government, then the state can win the battle against Covid. Sawant said that industries will continue to function at their respective premises by following Covid norms. The chief minister said that government offices will function with 50% staff. Sawant said that for violation of Covid restriction, the state will act against the persons under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 51 to 60 of the Disaster Management Act 2005.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-imposes-more-restrictions-biz-time-for-traders-cut-by-3-hours/articleshow/82361580.cms||---
---||Delhi||Centre waives IGST on Covid materials||NEW DELHI: For the city that is battling an acute shortage of medical oxygen amid an unprecedented rise in Covid-19 cases, the Centre’s decision to do away with integrated GST (IGST) on Covid-related relief material comes as a respite. The move came the same day that deputy CM Manish Sisodia, who also holds the finance portfolio, wrote to the Union finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, urging her to waive GST on oxygen concentrators for six months. While Delhi government has asked for an allocation of 976 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen per day to meet the current requirement, it has been allocated 590MT a day so far. However, sources in Delhi government said the actual oxygen supply the capital was receiving was much less. According to a source, when the allocation was 490MT a day, Delhi received around 430MT last Wednesday, approximately 410 MT on Thursday and as low as 312MT on Friday. The allocation was then increased to 590 MT, but even then, Delhi received around 440MT on Saturday and Sunday. “As of yesterday (Sunday), we received 440MT of oxygen, which is lesser than the allocated quota of 590MT, and much lesser than Delhi’s requirement of 976MT to cater to the demand of the citizens. It is imperative that we receive adequate oxygen and increase our capacity of beds,” Sisodia said. In the letter to Sitharaman, Sisodia said, at present, Delhi has 16,272 oxygen beds and 4,866 ICU beds. He claimed that the government was creating an additional 15,000 oxygenated non-ICU beds and 1,200 ICU beds, which were likely to get operationalised in the next 10 days. “On average, there has been 25,000 new Covid cases daily and about 10% of them require some form of hospitalisation, including oxygen support. More than 50,000 patients currently are in home isolation and about a quarter of them need some form of oxygen support due to difficulty in availability of oxygen beds,” Sisodia wrote. He added that oxygen concentrators were in short supply, and even if one manages to arrange a cylinder, there was an unprecedented shortfall in the availability of medical oxygen creating uncertainty and panic among patients under home isolation. “There is no availability of oxygen concentrators in the market," he said. Sisodia said that during this unprecedented health crisis, oxygen concentrators had become essential life-support machines, and it would be appropriate if the Centre and the GST Council exempt GST on oxygen concentrators for six months to make them more affordable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/centre-waives-igst-on-covid-materials/articleshow/82378079.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Kozhikode||Muslim, Christian voters keep Left||Ever since the cobbling together of United Democratic Front (UDF) in Kerala almost five decades ago (formed during a byelection in Nilambur in 1970 in the lone Christian pocket in Muslim-majority Malappuram), the front has become the political platform for minority communities that amount to 45% of the electorate. The political experiment helped shape UDF’s rainbow political base, bringing together the bulk of Muslims mostly concentrated in Malabar (26.6% as per 2011 census) and Christians based in central Kerala (18.4%) and aligning them with the Congress’ traditional anti-Marxist vote base spread across various communities. This political experiment was key to Kerala’s four-decade-old alternating LDF and UDF regimes. The historic mandate secured by LDF for a second term was possible by the inroads the front was able to make into the minority communities- both Muslim and Christian- which UDF had considered as its electoral, fixed deposits. Among the 66 assembly constituencies where Muslim votes play a decisive role in determining the winner, LDF was able to win over 40 seats. Even IUML took a beating with its tally coming down to 15 from the 18 seats it won in 2016. Of the 23 seats won by UDF where Muslim votes are decisive, 19 are in Malabar; reflecting the fact that Muslims have rallied behind LDF especially in central and south Kerala, where they had to choose between Congress and LDF. LDF seems to have sensed minorities warming up to it and was enthusiastic in supporting the mass agitations against CAA/NRC. LDF had put out separate full-page advertisements exclusively in Muslim-management run newspapers on the polling day on April 6 which loudly proclaimed that LDF will not implement CAA/NRC and that there won’t be any detention camps in state. The messaging given by Pinarayi Vijayan was consistent all through the election campaign: LDF alone had the political will and courage to take on right-wing communal forces and it alone can protect minorities from the onslaught of Sangh Parivar forces. It is reflected in the strategic voting carried out by the community for LDF in constituencies like Nemom and Kazhakkoottam to stop BJP wins. Going by the results, LDF seems to have bettered its share of 34% Muslim vote in 2016 as per surveys conducted by CSDS. Among major Muslim organizations, AP Sunni faction – headed by Kanthapuram AP Aboobacker Musaliyar – had publically indicated its support for LDF and Welfare Party of India had supported UDF in most constituencies except the 19 seats in which it contested. But, despite its support UDF was unable to win constituencies like Thiruvambady and Kuttiady where Welfare Party had clout. Also, Vijayan was able to create an appeal transcending party or politics through clever perception management on the strength of welfare schemes and free kits. He was able to provide a sense of reassurance for steering the state through numerous crises, including the pandemic. Reflecting this, the survey conducted by Centre for Public Policy Research had found that 53% Muslims said that welfare measures like food kits, free Covid treatment, welfare pensions will impact polls. Also LDF’s big win cannot be possible without the support of the church, especially in central Kerala. The consolidation of Christian votes in favour of LDF did not shape up overnight. The church was agitated for some time with UDF for the prominence it gave to IUML. According to a senior clergy of KCBC, UDF was supporting and fulfilling the needs of just one minority community. “They have been doing this for a long time. This distanced the traditional Christian community from UDF,” he said, adding that the proof of this can be seen in the election results in places like Idukki. The speech made by Oommen Chandy’s son, regarding conversion of Hagia Sophia into a mosque in Turkey, did not go well with the church and its bishops. The stand of Jacobite Church made Chandy sweat though he won Puthuppally. His lead dropped drastically in Pampady and Manarcad panchayats that are Jacobite strongholds. This was due to the support extended by Jacobite church to LDF candidates as an acknowledgment of the support given by LDF government on the dispute with Orthodox Church. This trend was visible in Jacobite-dominated areas in Ernakulam. Though Jacobite church leaders met BJP ahead of the elections, they went back to LDF at the last minute as they realized that BJP won’t be able to deliver what they want in the Church dispute. In Pala strong undercurrents against Jose K Mani, within LDF ranks, resulted in his defeat despite the support extended by the church. The failure of Congress and the UDF in promoting new and young leaders as mediators to talks with new church heads is also seen as a failure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/muslim-christian-voters-keep-left/articleshow/82360936.cms||Jaikrishnan Nair
---||Lucknow||Mamata win reply to BJP’s ‘Didi O Didi’ jibe: Akhilesh||Lucknow: Describing the West Bengal election results as an outcome of grit and determination of Mamata Banerjee and people of the state to defeat ‘politics of hate’, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav congratulated Didi and TMC over the election results. “Congratulations to Mamata Banerjee, people of West Bengal and Trinamool Congress leaders who have worked hard to defeat the politics of hate in the state. The West Bengal election results are a hard hitting reply to BJP’s ‘Didi o didi’ jibe which was nothing less than an attack on a woman and her dignity,” Akhilesh said. On the social media, Akhilesh posted his message and hashtagged it “Didi jio didi” (Long live Didi). Samajwadi Party had extended support to Mamata Banerjee in April, ahead of the assembly elections. SP chief had also offered to campaign for Didi and her party in West Bengal and left it to Mamata to take a final call in this regard. Sources in SP said finally Didi decided to not give any chance to the BJP to claim that all parties have ‘ganged-up’ against the BJP, a narrative that the saffron brigade had used to its advantage in the Lok Sabha polls. “Congratulations MK Stalin on this remarkable victory,” Akhilesh tweeted after Satlin-led DMK crossed the half-way mark in the Tamil Nadu elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/mamata-win-reply-to-bjps-didi-o-didi-jibe-akhilesh/articleshow/82361578.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

Along with Mahankali police, Task Force South Zone team arrested Pathan Yasin Khan, 43, an attention diversion offender, who reportedly committed multiple offences in Telangana and Maharashtra, at Secunderabad on Sunday. According to Task Force inspector S Raghavendra, the modus operandi of Pathan Yasin was to visit market areas in towns and target innocent women wearing gold jewellery with an offer of free sari. “Pathan Yasin introduces himself to the victims as an employee of a rich man. He convinces the women saying that his employer is offering free saris to people of limited means. When the victim shows interest in collecting the free sari, he convinces her to remove the gold jewellery and wrap them in a piece of paper so that his employer believes that she is from a poor family and gives away a free sari,” the inspector said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/attention-diversion-offender-held-gold-worth-rs-6-5l-seized/articleshow/82360965.cms||---
---||Kozhikode||Muslim League’s strike-rate takes a hit||The Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), the second-largest constituent of the UDF, which has prided itself on consistently maintaining the highest electoral strike rate in the state has taken a beating in the Left wave. The party, which had won 18 seats out of 24 seats contested in 2016, saw its tally drop to 15 this time despite contesting in three additional seats. As a relief, it has managed to keep its strongholds in Malappuram district. IUML lost four sitting seats including Azhikode and Kalamassery where the party had come under a cloud following allegations against sitting MLAs KM Shaji and Ibrahim Kunju respectively. The party also lost Kuttiyadi which Parakkal Abdulla had wrested from the CPM in 2016 and Kozhikode South where it fielded a woman candidate, Adv. Noorbeena Rasheed, after a gap of 25 years. However, as a saving grace, party senior leader Dr M K Muneer who had moved from Kozhikode South to Koduvally was able to wrest the seat from LDF-backed independent Karat Rasak. While the party has been able to retain the 11 seats in Malappuram, many League strongholds witnessed tough fights. The victory margins dropped in seats like Perinthalmanna where party candidate Najeeb Kanthapuram managed to scrape through with a slender margin of just 38 votes. The victory margins in stronghold seats like Manjeri and Vengara , where IUML national general secretary contested, witnessed a drop. Also, the party was not able to wrest back its stronghold seat of Tanur which it had lost in 2016 despite fielding MYL state general secretary PK Firos. The League lost the three additional seats it got this time including Kongad and Perambra. It also lost in Punalur and Koothuparamba and Guruvayoor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/muslim-leagues-strike-rate-takes-a-hit/articleshow/82360966.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kerala: More women now in assembly||KOCHI: Poor women representation in main political parties was a much-discussed issue in this . The new assembly will have 11 women MLAs led by health minister K K Shailaja. For the first time since 1996 when there were 13 women MLAs, Kerala’s legislature will have a double-digit woman representation in the state in the assembly. This time there will be 10 ruling-party MLAs and one lone woman in the opposition, UDF-backed RMP’s K K Rema. The winners include O S Ambika - Attingal, Veena George - Aranmula, CK Asha - Vaikom, J Chinchurani - Chadayamangalam, Daleema Jojo - Aroor, U Prathibha - Kayamkulam, R Bindu - Irinjalakuda, K Shantakumari - Kongad and Jameela Kanathil - Koyilandy. Interestingly, of the 103 women who contested, 17 women candidates came as runner-up, indicating that the LDF wave led to their losses and they were closely-fought wins in many constituencies. Among the big losers are Shanimol Usman, Bindu Krishna, Shoba Surendran, P K Jayalakshmi and Padmaja Venugopal who kept the fight close. It is expected that there would be 2-3 women ministers. Shailaja has already proved her mettle. C K Asha and Veena George could be the other two candidates. While there is not likely to be a sea change in women-centric policies of the LDF government, it is expected that Pinarayi Vijayan will give adequate importance to this voter segment who have voted for the front in large numbers. “More than other parties, Left has groomed its women leaders from grassroot level. Since the present government has already announced much of its welfare programmes which is expected to continue, one can expect something for the women voters from the new government,” opined D Dhanuraj, chairman-CPPR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/more-women-now-in-assembly/articleshow/82360967.cms||Sudha Nambudiri
---||Lucknow||Covid test-&-quarantine campaign to kickstart in rural heartland of Uttar Pradesh||LUCKNOW: Amidst a pandemic surge in the rural heartland, chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday directed the launch of an exhaustive Covid testing campaign in all 97,000 revenue villages of the state between May 4 and 8. At a crucial review meet with his core Covid management team, the chief minister ordered immediate suspension of inter-state bus services to break the infection chain and made negative RTPCR reports mandatory for flyers at airports. The move to launch a Covid testing drive in rural areas comes in the backdrop of four-phase panchayat elections and reverse migration into the state since April, when the second pandemic wave picked up pace. The chief minister directed the state health department to draft a formal blueprint before launching the campaign that seeks to track Covid positive people, get them quarantined and provide requisite medical facilities. For this, he said, the state health department should take help of district monitoring committees in which lekhpals should be roped in. He said, migrants reaching rural areas, especially by trains and buses, should undergo tests and be quarantined if found test positive. The CM also ordered immediate scrapping of inter-state services of UP State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC) buses. Also, flyers would have to produce a negative Covid report at airports, he said. Yogi said, special teams modelled around Team-9 should be in place in districts. “District officials will be made responsible for monitoring the Covid situation at the micro level and they should coordinate with public representatives for effective implementation of pandemic protocols,” he said. Yogi also said, district magistrates and CMOs will be required to provide data on use of lifesaving Remdesivir injections. “The Centre has made a daily allocation of 50,000 vials of Remdesivir to the state. He directed health minister Jai Pratap Singh to keep vigil on supply and demand of the injection and ensure transparency. He cautioned the minister and officials against black-marketing of the drug. The chief minister maintained his government was taking every possible step to address the oxygen demand. On Sunday, another Oxygen Express was scheduled to reach Bareilly. The state has been receiving oxygen from Jamnagar, Durgapur, Barjora, Bokaro, Jamshedpur, Kashipur, Modinagar and Roorkee. He said, the state government was receiving information of ventilators lying idle in the absence of adequate manpower. Yogi asked the health department to immediately provide technicians and other staff in such hospitals. He also reiterated that doubling of beds in Covid care hospitals be expedited. He specified that in hospitals like RML and KGMU, number of beds be increased by 100 and 150 respectively. This comes close on heels of the setting up a Covid hospitals by DRDO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/covid-test-quarantine-campaign-to-kickstart-in-rural-heartland-of-up/articleshow/82361586.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Delhi||Delhi: After bed & meds, families wait for update on patients||NEW DELHI: It took 24-year-old Gunjan Kukreja almost three days to find a bed for her father who had tested positive for Covid-19. However, her struggle was far from over. While her father is admitted to Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital now, she claims that she has not been getting any update on his health. It is adding to my stress and anxiety, she says. Her mother had recently lost the battle to Covid-19 and she has a younger brother to take care of. Many people who have been lucky to get their family members admitted are now having a difficult time due to lack of communication. They claim to be not getting regular updates from hospitals, and have no other way of finding out their relatives’ health status either. “My father is diabetic. As there was a delay in getting a bed, he has also developed gangrene. First, just his one finger had turned blue and now, his whole hand has been affected. I have been consulting some surgeons who told me that it is gangrene. The hospital doesn’t tell me if his medicines are being given. I don’t even know if he is getting food. My father is weak so he cannot hold his phone for long. I have seen he is in the same clothes since he got admitted to the hospital,” said Kukreja. During the first wave of Covid-19, video call facility had been provided by the Delhi government at Lok Nayak Hospital. “I was taking my father to the hospital even as my mother’s last rites were being performed. It is only when we call them, they inform us about the oxygen level. I have no clue which doctor is looking after my father,” she said. Sameer Sahini, whose both parents are admitted in a private hospital, said, “They say it is a Covid ward so I cannot go in. I understand their concerns, but there should be some information so that I know what all drugs are being given to them and how have their progress been? We have been waiting outside the hospital clueless.” Sahini’s parents are in the ICU so he does not even have an option to video call them. Meeta Das has been receiving details about her husband’s health only through the calls he makes. “A patient will only be able to say how he is feeling, but will not know if there has been any progress. Hospitals not sharing information with patients’ relatives is shocking. We are not allowed to stay on the hospital premises and it is difficult to explain how anxious I feel all the time,” said Das.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/after-bed-meds-families-wait-for-update-on-patients/articleshow/82360204.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Kolkata||Suvendu’s agri grip that helped TMC win in 2011 still holds sway||Kolkata: Suvendu Adhikari, who defeated Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee in Nandigram, was by far the most important TMC leader to jump ship ahead of the polls. When the Nandigram MLA walked into the embrace of Union home minister Amit Shah at a Midnapore rally on December 19, he also decoyed Banerjee into changing course. A month later, on January 18, Banerjee declared she would take on Adhikari in Nandigram, which had been the epicentre of Trinamool’s anti-land acquisition struggle in 2007. Along with Singur, it was instrumental in the Left’s rout in 2011. But Adhikari’s connection with this belt goes further back. Among the 19 Lok Sabha seats Trinamool won in 2009, he clinched the Tamluk seat, which includes Nandigram. His grip over the agricultural cooperative banks, which extend seasonal credit to farmers, helped Trinamool win big there in 2011, and brought Banerjee to power. Even now, his hold on Midnapore East and West and on Purulia and Bankura, is undeniable. Yet, Adhikari, son of former Union minister Sishir Adhikari, got off to a choppy start in the party. After the 2011 win, Mukul Roy was tasked to manage the party in the districts, where Adhikari held sway. Leaders loyal to him were either replaced or not given party roles. As Kolkata-based leaders (including Roy) got meaty roles, Adhikari felt sidelined. Adhikari’s responsibilities grew after Roy’s name figured in some ponzi schemes around 2013. He was first made the president of the Trinamool youth wing, and then a member of the party core committee. Ahead of the 2016 assembly polls, Banerjee declared she wanted him in her cabinet. In his second innings as MLA, Adhikari held three cabinet berths, and was the head of Haldia Development Authority and HRBC. But Trinamool’s reverses in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls—BJP won 18 seats and gained a lead in 121 assembly segments—fettered him again. The party suffered some of its worst poll reverses in the belt Adhikari helmed. Religious polarisation became strong in both Midnapore districts, besides Bankura, Purulia and the three north Bengal districts —Malda, Murshidabad and North Dinajpur —under him. In East Midnapore, BJP’s vote share crossed 40% and came within a whisker of Trinamool’s. A trust deficit with the CM set in, especially after her nephew Abhishek Banerjee started eclipsing the party’s tier-2 leaders. For Adhikari, staying in Trinamool was also a liability as growth and employment in East Midnapore hinged mainly on the Centre. People close to him say ‘Dada’ had made up his mind about moving on months before the December 19 rally with Shah.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/suvendus-agri-grip-that-helped-tmc-win-in-2011-still-holds-sway/articleshow/82360998.cms||---
---||Nagpur||A 2,000km 4-day journey for Covid treatment||April 9: “When I left for Jodhpur from Nagpur on company work, I had a running nose and no other health issues. I even travelled to Nokha (Bikaner district) twice.” April 19: “By now I was continuously sneezing and had developed mild fever”. The wife of a colleague and another colleague passed away due to Covid in Jodhpur. “I was in close contact with both these colleagues. Yet, I didn’t panic as the temperature was not rising.” April 20: For the third time, he had to travel to Nokha on work. “It was an unpleasant 4-hour journey in a private bus as the fever had gone up.” On reaching Nokha, he got admitted at a hospital and continued working for the 3 days while undergoing treatment. “As the fever receded, I moved to a hotel and even completed the office assignment.” April 23: He returned to the Jodhpur hotel in Basni Phase-II. “The fever returned, so I went to a hospital. The doctor did not advice a Covid test, instead suggested an HR-CT. I feared being quarantined if test was positive.” April 24: The fever was now 102 degrees C. He handed over all work to colleagues. “I was panicking after reading about shortage of beds and oxygen in Jodhpur and Delhi. Should I remain in Jodhpur, go to Delhi, Nagpur or Mancherial? I was confused.” Colleagues and friends told him that the condition was no different in Nagpur as well as in Chandrapur. “My mother and and elder brother suggested I come to Mancherial where beds are available and there is no shortage of oxygen and medicines.” Plus, there was family to take care of him, which would have been difficult at any of the other three places. The decision was made. “Go to Mancherial, test for Covid and then begin treatment if needed.” Mancherial had no rail connectivity with Jodhpur and he left for Delhi by train. “I was still running high fever”. April 25: In Delhi, he tried to book a hotel room. “I was now coughing too and fever showed no signs of subsiding.” Under the circumstances, no hotel was willing to take him in. After struggling for a couple of hours, he managed to get a room at premium cost. “I needed to be in a hotel only for a few hours as I had reserved a First AC ticket in GT Express.” Next, he planned to eat something to gain strength for the journey. “Food was not available at the hotel. I made an online order. For the exorbitant price I paid, the taste was awful.” At Delhi railway station, where he reached an hour before train departure, he was checked for fever. “The coughing was terrible and I was not allowed to enter the station.” The reservation was wasted and Mancherial seemed far away. “I returned to the hotel, again paid extra charges for a room. Praying that the fever and cough would subside so that I would be permitted to board the train, I took double doses of medicines.” Now, there was a new health issue — loose motions. The medicines for this made him feel weak. With fresh determination, he booked a ticket for Mancherial on GT Express for the next day. April 26: At Delhi station, his temperature was checked. The officials saw him coughing. “Not only was I stopped from boarding, they also wanted to quarantine me. The media reports of lack of oxygen and beds flashed before my eyes and I somehow managed to escape from the station.” He returned to the hotel and requested them to arrange a vehicle to Mancherial. “A driver was willing to come only up to Nagpur and demanded Rs45,000 as fare. I chose to pay.” April 27: The journey began and now he had started vomiting too; health was deteriorating. The air-condition in the car had to be switched off as it was affecting his cough. “The driver was very helpful and patient. We had to halt intermittently as I had to vomit and pass stools. Till the time I reached Nagpur, I had used over 50 packed drinking water bottles.” Travel time also took longer than expected as he had to negotiate 28 border check points. At around 10am, he called his mother. “We expected him to reach Nagpur in the evening. He felt it would be difficult for him to hire another vehicle from Nagpur to Mancherial. We then made another plan.” His mother found an ambulance for hire and it had 30% oxygen in the cylinder. “The Mancherial-Nagpur-Mancherial ambulance trip was to cost us Rs22,000. I requested my relative Dilip Pittalwar (activist-politician) who resides in Ghugus to accompany me.” Being Hanuman Jayanti, Dilip was fasting. “But he promised to come and I felt reassured.” Dilip called up this reporter at Nagpur, and sought primary treatment and some food for the travelling patient. Four private hospitals were contacted and told about the patient’s condition. Eliciting no response, the next call went to infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde at Alexis Hospital in Mankapur. The hospital was the closest for the patient after entering Nagpur city and Dr Shinde promised assistance. Due to continuous coughing, the patient was unable to talk on the phone. Through the helpful driver, the car’s location could be pinpointed to know the expected time of arrival. 4pm: The patient arrived at Alexis hospital. Due to weakness, he was unable to even get out of the car. The doctor at the emergency ward, who did not know the background of the case, refused to admit the patient. Finally, Dr Shinde intervened. “The vehicle had parked in front of the hospital and I was really worried.” 5pm: The patient’s oxygen saturation level was 86 as against normal range of 95. A rapid antigen test confirmed that he was Covid positive. His chest CT score was 13 and Dr Shinde advised immediate hospitalization and primary treatment started. 6pm: The mother and Dilip reached Alexis. “I was stopped from meeting my son but I was keen to see him. We decided to take him to Mancherial but the ambulance did not have sufficient oxygen.” This reporter then facilitated the refill. “The driver demanded another Rs20,000 and refused to budge. We decided to hire another ambulance. With help from hospital staff, we hired one for Rs17,000. Around 11pm, he started feeling better so we left for Mancherial. I was seated next to him and did not fear contracting the disease. We reached Mancherial early in the morning and got him admitted to a hospital. The primary treatment at Alexis hospital had given him a new lease of life.” May 2: Now, he is on oxygen support at a hospital in Mancherial||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/a-2000km-4-day-journey-for-covid-treatment/articleshow/82361004.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Lucknow||BJP-backed candidates leading in Uttar Pradesh rural polls||LUCKNOW: BJP-backed candidates were leading in initial phases of counting for zila panchayat wards in the four-phased rural local bodies elections held last month, followed by Samajwadi Party and Mayawati-led BSP-supported candidates. Independents were leading or had registered victories in many seats. More than 3,19,300 candidates were elected unopposed, the state election commission said on Sunday. “This includes seven members of zila panchayat, 2,005 members of kshetra panchayat and over 3.17 lakh members of gram panchayats,” the poll body said. As many as 178 candidates for the post of pradhan of gram panchayats were also elected unopposed. Though panchayat elections are not contested on party symbols, political parties threw their weight behind contestants. Apart from major players like BJP, SP, BSP and Congress, parties like Asaduddin Owaisi’s AIMIM and Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) too made their debut to test waters for next year’s assembly election. Polling was done through paper ballots and counting could stretch over two days, said officials of state election commission. The mammoth exercise began, a day after Supreme Court refused to defer counting with a rider that Covid protocols should be followed. However, disturbing visuals surfaced, showing norms being flouted at various counting centres in Uttar Pradesh. Eight polling agents were turned away from the counting centre in Kannauj’s Chhibramau tehsil after they tested positive in Rapid Antigen Tests. In Etah, there were reports of police detaining five people after supporters of rival candidates clashed. Candidates from all parties were locked in a contest for over 7.32 lakh seats in gram panchayat wards, 58,176 in gram panchayats, 75,852 in kshetra panchayats and 3,050 in zila panchayats. The first phase of polls was held on April 15, the second on April 19, the third phase on April 26, and the fourth and final phase on April 29. Notably, all the phases registered a voter turnout of more than 70 per cent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-backed-candidates-leading-in-up-rural-polls/articleshow/82361593.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Delhi||Lack of flow meters delays Covid facility at Balak Ram||New Delhi: Delay in procuring flow meters for supplying oxygen to beds has deferred the plan to make a 100-bedded Covid facility operational at Balak Ram Hospital. North Delhi Municipal Corporation had managed to buy only 30 flow meters till Sunday as against the requirement for 100. “While all other arrangements are in place at the hospital, including oxygen cylinders, our staff is facing problems in procuring flow meters. We need one flow meter to supply oxygen to each of 100 beds through cylinders. The demand was placed with the supplier listed by the Delhi government recently, but it seems there is shortage of the equipment in the market,” said mayor Jai Prakash. The civic body has decided to make 40-50 Covid beds initially available for the general public after it gets sufficient number of flow meters and approval from Delhi Disaster Management Authority for running the facility. “We were earlier planning to open the facility by Sunday evening, but now, we will open it on Tuesday. Though people have started inquiring about the facility, there is no point starting it unless everything is in place,” said Jai Prakash. The north corporation has previously converted its two hospitals—Hindu Rao and Rajan Babu Hospital—into Covid facilities with provision for 250 and 100 beds, respectively. “We had initially 60 beds at Rajan Babu Hospital, but the number was increased to 100 after lines for supplying oxygen were laid. All of them are fully occupied now,” said the mayor. At Tilak Nagar Multi-Specialty Hospital in west Delhi, 25 heavy duty oxygen concentrators were provided by MP Pravesh Verma. Each concentrator is of 10-litre capacity, said Verma. A 60-bedded Covid-facility is running here and the south corporation supplies oxygen through 65 cylinders and 29 concentrators to the patients. There is no ICU facility here. “We have urged private institutions to provide ICU and ventilator facilities to the hospital under their CSR fund,” said the MP. “With 25 more oxygen concentrators added in the list of equipment, we will be able to boost our health facilities. Our emphasis is to strengthen medical facilities at all 100 beds,” said Radha Krishan, nodal officer for the south corporation’s hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lack-of-flow-meters-delays-covid-facility-at-balak-ram/articleshow/82360994.cms||Vibha Sharma

But the scenario changed in the last couple of hours as UDF's sitting MLA Shafi Parambil closed the gap over time before retaining the seat, somewhat comfortably with a margin of 3859 votes. The day began with Sreedharan taking an early lead when the postal votes were counted. His lead began to swell as the counting moved to booths in Palakkad municipality. The 88-year-old technocrat seemed to have wooed the voters in Kalpathy, Olavakkod and agraharam areas, where a lot of railways and other government employees reside. Once the counting began at panchayat booths, Sreedharan's lead started to shrink. Shafi went ahead during counting for Pirayiri panchayat, which has a strong Congress vote bank. Same was the case with Mathur and Kannadi panchayats where UDF and LDF have strongholds while BJP has a few wards in the other panchayats. Even while Sreedharan maintained his lead through the day, both fronts were confident of a change in result, more so Shafi. Meanwhile, the BJP accused the CPI (M) and Congress of trading votes in Palakkad to beat Sreedharan. In a statement issued after the results were declared, the BJP district president E Krishnadas said that “in Palakkad assembly constituency, the CPM vote share came down to such a low for the first time. Their vote share came down to 8000 votes this time compared to the last local body election. So, the CPI (M) should explain this loss of LDF votes. This happened when there was an LDF wave in Palakkad district and the State as a whole,” he said||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/shafis-late-surge-puts-sreedharan-off-track/articleshow/82360996.cms||---

Two more tankers carrying 30 tonnes of medical oxygen will reach Faridabad on early Monday morning. Last week, five tankers carrying medical oxygen were transported by railways from Rourkela and Angul to Faridabad. The railway ministry has said it will schedule operation of Oxygen Express trains as soon as state governments make requests after arranging the empty tankers. Some states including Haryana have gone for airlifting of empty tankers to the plants for filling them and the railways has been transporting the filled tankers quickly. Oxygen Express has been successful so far, since the trains keep running 24x7 unlike trucks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/capital-gets-second-train-with-120mt-medical-o2/articleshow/82361028.cms||---

Earlier, Covaxin was found to fight the UK variant, B.1.1.7, and the so-called double mutant of Maharashtra, B.1.617. With this the vaccine, developed by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in collaboration with Bharat Biotech, is capable of fighting some of the major variants of concern (VoC), currently in circulation in the country. Covishield, another Covid-19 vaccine currently available in India, was also found to neutralise the double mutant.  Researchers from the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, and the ICMR, New Delhi, studied the neutralisation efficacy of the Brazilian variant, B.1.1.28.2, with the convalescent sera of individuals with natural infection and those, who received two doses of Covaxin. They found that individuals after receiving two doses of Covaxin had their immunity boosted against the Brazilian variant. The Brazilian variant, which was earlier assigned the technical name, B.1.1.248, is now reclassified as B.1.128.2. Also, the variant was thought to belong to two lineages – P1 and P2. But now, scientists recognise it as one variant with a single lineage. It has been causing trouble in Brazil and some parts of the world. However, in India the Brazilian variant is not as widely present as the double mutant, B.1.617, which is found in about 70 per cent of Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra, or the UK strain, B.1.1.7, which is present largely in Punjab. Both double mutant and UK variant have been found in several parts of the country, including Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. The double mutant makes up about five to 10 per cent of cases in the two Telugu states. The presence of the UK variant in AP and Telangana is nominal, while that of the Brazilian variant is yet to be established.  “The two-dose vaccine regimen significantly boosted the IgG (immunoglobulin G, a type of antibody) titre and neutralizing efficacy against both B.1.1.28.2 (Brazilian variant) and D614G variants (which replaced the original Wuhan strain last year and became a dominant variant world over) compared to that seen with natural infection. The study demonstrated 1.92 and 1.09 fold reductions in the neutralizing titre against B.1.1.28.2 variant in comparison with prototype D614G variant with sera of vaccine recipients and natural infection respectively,” the research said. They said the two-dose Covaxin regimen significantly boosted the antibodies and neutralising efficacy against both the variants compared to that seen with natural infection. The result of the study was published in preprint server BioRxiv.  Researchers say although some of the vaccines seem to be effective against the UK variant, the efficacy of them against the South African variant has been demonstrated to be less efficacious. A vaccine that uses an inactivation platform has been reported to be 50.7% efficacious from Brazil, where the B.1.1.28.2 variant is more prevalent.

---||Delhi||Vax drive for 18+ at 77 schools from today||New Delhi: After a ‘symbolic start’ on Saturday, Delhi will see vaccination of those in the 18-44 years age group on a larger scale from Monday. Total 77 government schools across the capital have been selected for the free vaccination of eligible beneficiaries, which would be conducted only through appointment as no walk-ins are being allowed at the moment. The schools have been identified across the 11 revenue districts of the capital, including three in East district to 17 in West. Each school will have around five session sites and the number of schools will be scaled up to 274 by May 7, said an official. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had on Saturday said that vaccination for Delhiites in the age group of 18-44 would begin on a larger scale from May 3 in the capital. The Delhi government has said that it has already received 4.5 lakh doses of Covid-19 vaccines. Kejriwal had visited a polyclinic at Saraswati Vihar for the symbolic start of the vaccination drive, which saw 873 people in the age group of 18-44 getting inoculated till 9 pm on Saturday. “In one way, today is symbolic as the vaccination drive has started only at one centre from today onwards, for those between 18-44 years. We have already received 4.5 lakh vaccines and now, we are distributing them in all the districts,” Kejriwal had said. The CM has requested Delhiites to not queue up at vaccination centres and assured that everyone in Delhi would be inoculated within the next three months. While the West district would start the drive from 17 government schools on Monday, South East district would see the inoculation drive being carried out from nine schools, while Shahdara with eight schools is third in the number of most centres for this group. Both North and South West have seven schools each that have been designated as centres. Central, North East and North West districts have identified six schools each. New Delhi and South districts will start the drive from four schools and three schools have been identified in the East district for the purpose. The Delhi government targets to operationalise at least one school in every municipal ward for the vaccination of those in the 18-44 age group. With around five sites per school and a total capacity of 150 doses a day, initially around 60,000 beneficiaries would get the jab per day. The numbers, however, would increase as the number of schools to be used as vaccination centres would go up to 274.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/vax-drive-for-18-at-77-schools-from-today/articleshow/82360236.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Kochi||Kerala: A move away from bipolar politics?||KOCHI: The Kerala election result signals a major change in the political climate of the state. The bipolar politics, which the state was used to, seems to be coming to an end. Though BJP drew blank, it doesn’t mean that it played a less significant role in this election. Secular votes found it hard to find an appropriate choice to keep BJP at bay. It is also an indication of things to come. It will be very difficult for the UDF and Congress to hold their house together. There is a feeling that UDF cannot play the role of the opposition and BJP might try to capitalize on that. The opposition, especially the organizational weakness of Congress has contributed immensely to this LDF victory. Even in issues unearthed by the opposition leader, there was no organizational support or follow-up. Strike against CAA was taking the country by storm before coronavirus pushed the protesters home. The debates soon subsided. Farmers defied the pandemic and were out on the street protesting. The farmer issue is debated throughout the nation. These incidents underline how issues are brought to public perspective and their subsequent response. The opposition miserably failed here. The people were asked to choose between this opposition and the present regime. They landed in a situation where `there is no alternative`. The political perspective and polarization as one representing the left politics and those against it are gone. A middle-class perspective has overtaken the priorities of all parties. For the first time, the LDF workers shied away from political issues and were talking only about development and welfare schemes. Party work was also being reduced to welfare brokerage. But as they rightly thought, people have also embraced this shift. Opinion polls among sample groups when asked, clearly said they are dissatisfied with the gold-smuggling scandal and about the chief minister's handling of his office but the same group opted for LDF. Meanwhile, the central agencies investigating the scandals seem to be groping in the dark. This is after even the courts expressed shock over the names figured in the case diary. This anti-climax has also contributed to the victory. Kerala had voted back a government only once. That was after the emergency, in 1977, when the whole country voted otherwise. Even now we regard the then chief minister as the best ever. It is as if Kerala likes to be submissive and relishes censorship of news. This time also, amid the pandemic, we were in a state of self-censorship. The present chief minister has the image of a man-god during a crisis. It is when people are desperate, especially about their own lives, that they look for saviours. With slogans like `we will not desert you' and with the distribution of food kits, the chief minister has done that job. He appeared through visual media every evening advising caution and asking people to ensure even stray dogs are fed. The women turnaround during the LDF campaign is an indication of how households responded to this. It was a change from the usual phrase 'whoever wins we have to fight for a living'. We are shifting to a leader -oriented regime. This victory belongs to one leader. There is no collective leadership in the party, nor would there be one within the executive. Like at the Centre, there is no other leader of that stature, either in the party or in the opposition. LDF also carefully nurtured vote banks. The declaration that CAA would not be implemented in the state, reservation for economically backward upper-caste and for converted Christians have helped them. The dip in the majority of Muslim League in their strongholds, the Christian-dominated panchayats deserting Oommen Chandy are indications of how minority votes polled this time. But Kerala has voted in unison for the continuation of the present rule. They have again said a big no to the politics of BJP. The worsening financial situation which aggravated in the last five years and the weakening of the party as a cross-checking force could be major challenges to the new government.

---||Goa||Covid-19: 52 die, Goa’s highest single-day toll||PANAJI: Covid deaths soared to 52 over the past 24 hours. Half of these took place on Sunday. Close to 30 of the deaths occurred at Goa Medical College, 17 at South Goa district hospital, five at North Goa district hospital and one at ESI hospital, Margao. Three patients were declared brought dead to the North Goa district hospital, while 10 died within 24 hours of admission, all at GMC. GMC doctors attributed the deaths to increased prevalence of Covid, late presentation, people presenting with lot of comorbidities and the healthcare system stretched to its capacity. “In a pandemic when the healthcare is stretched, the mortality is known to increase,” the Goa Association of Resident Doctors (GARD) president said. Meanwhile, chief minister Pramod Sawant on Sunday visited all oxygen manufacturing plants, godowns and units and reviewed measures to enhance oxygen supply. The GARD had written to the government about shortage of oxygen supply and beds. GARD general secretary Dr Ajey Jha appealed to people to take all precautions. “Don’t step out of your home unless urgent. Don’t attend parties or gather in one place. Please don’t have functions. You can postpone these for a month or two. It’s not going to make much of a difference, but if someone tests positive at the function what we have seen is all who attended can eventually turn out to be positive. Some may be old and have comorbidities and may eventually end up with severe form of the disease in hospital and some can also die which is why we need to take proper precautions,” he said. Those stepping out of their homes should wear two masks, a surgical mask and a cloth mask and carry a sanitiser, he also said. He advised the public not to enter shops that that are crowded and maintain social distancing at all times. The state’s positivity rate rose to 41% with 2,030 new Covid-19 infections detected. This has taken the active cases to 24,606 with 236 new hospitalisations over the past 24 hours and more than 2,000 isolating at home. Although the lockdown is over, a GMC doctor said that each one impose a lockdown on themselves to protect themselves. Margao’s active cases continue to be the highest at 2,150 followed by Candolim at 1,611, Panaji at 1,561, Ponda at 1,409, Porvorim at 1,375, Cortalim at 1,346 and Mapusa at 1,314. Other health centres have under 1,000 active cases each. A doctor said that the true picture will emerge after the ‘lockdown’ and weekend when most testing centres were shut.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/52-die-goas-highest-single-day-toll/articleshow/82361717.cms||---

The bypoll in the constituency was necessitated following the Covid-related death of sitting NCP MLA Bharat Bhalke. This was the first general election held after the MVA — with three constituent parties of Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress — formed the government in Maharashtra. NCP had given the ticket to Bhagirath, the son of the deceased MLA. BJP chose Autade, who had garnered significant vote shares in earlier assembly elections. Autade got 1,09,450 votes against Bhagirath’s 1,05,717. As many as 2.24 lakh voters had exercised their franchise. Autade had got help from BJP’s former MLA Prashant Paricharak, who has a significant following in Pandharpur tehsil. In the 2019 election, both Autade and Paricharak had contested the election, which had resulted in a division of votes. That had helped Bhalke manage a comfortable win. Leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis, who held several public meetings as part of the bypoll campaign, said, “The voters of Pandharpur-Mangalwedha have shown the mirror to the MVA government that has been ignoring the people for the past one-and-a-half years. Since coming to power, the MVA has indulged in corruption, it has neglected the citizens during the Covid pandemic and has also ignored the farmers. This win is due to the efforts of our local party functionaries who backed the chosen candidate.” Shocked by the unexpected defeat, Jayant Patil, the NCP state president, said in a video message: “We lost because there was lack of communication between the local leaders of Pandharpur and Mangalwedha tehsils. Despite all these shortcomings, our candidate gave a tough fight and lost only by a slender margin.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/jolt-for-mva-as-bjp-victorious-in-assembly-bypoll/articleshow/82359118.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: TV actor poorer by Rs 86k after e-search for a phone number||Mumbai: A television actor has lodged a police complaint of being duped of Rs 86,000 by a cyber fraudster who posed as executive of a financial firm from which the actor had taken a loan. Since the caller had exact details of his loan account, the police are not ruling out an inside job. The 33-year-old actor-choreographer, who appears in mythological shows, had taken five loans from the company. The total outstanding was Rs 1.5 lakh, part of which he said he he wanted to repay. Last Tuesday, he searched the company’s phone number online and dialled it, but got no response. A day later, he got a call from a man who identified himself as Rajgopal Kundu and claimed to be an employee of the company. He asked the actor if he wanted a loan. “I told him I wanted to repay myoutstanding dues. He asked for my loan account ID, and I gave it. Within minutes, I got details on my phone about loans taken,” the actor said in his statement. The caller informed him that his outstanding dues were Rs 1.25 lakh. He shared a account number of a bank’s Malad branch besides other deatils for repayment. The actor remitted Rs 86,000 through a digital wallet. As he got no acknowledgement, he dialled Rajgopal back. “He said the office had shut for the day and I would get an acknowledgement the next day. But I had my doubts and asked him for a copy of his ID card which he sent on phone,” the actor has said. He then contacted the company and asked if they had an employee named Rajgopal Kundu. The officials denied it. Realising that he had been conned, the actor approached the police to lodge a case.

---||Kochi||Kerala: Camps swapped but (M). Kappen still towers over Jose K Mani in Pala||KOCHI: Mani C Kappen of the UDF was not shaken by the Left wave that swept across the state. He held Pala close to his chest to give a huge setback to Jose K Mani of Kerala Congress (M). Kappen registered one of the biggest victory in this elections by defeating the LDF candidate by a margin of 15,378 votes. This majority is more than what Kappen had predicted. During the campaign as well as on Sunday morning he had expressed total confidence in winning by a margin of 15,000 votes. Kappen’s electoral history is a good subject for a student of politics to study. He had created history as a LDF candidate by wresting the seat from the UDF for the first time in the bypolls held in 2019. Kappen overcame even the sympathy factor for the KC (M) candidate following the demise of K M Mani. Now, after 16 months, Kappen returned to fight as a UDF candidate and succeeded in overcoming a Left wave to defeat K M Mani’s son. Reacting to the victory, Kappen said that he will be always indebted to the people of Pala for this win. “This has been the victory of democracy over money power. The UDF workers in the constituency worked unitedly for my win. I am indebted to all of them also,” he said. Meanwhile, Jose K Mani alleged that a comparative study of the voting pattern in the past few elections in Pala shows that BJP and the UDF entered into horse trade in Pala to defeat him. Kappen never had the habit of giving up. He was successful in bringing down the victory margin of K M Mani each time in the three elections before winning the bypolls in 2019. A successful film producer, director of a box office hit, an actor in over 25 films, a state-level volleyball player, who had played with the legendary Jimmy George in a foreign league and successful farmer are the roles played by Kappen. Jose group proves stronger than Joseph faction Jose group succeeded in proving they are stronger than their rival Joseph group in this elections despite its chairman Jose K Mani ending up as a loser in Pala. Kerala Congress (M) won from five out of the 12 constituencies they contested while Joseph group could win only two from the 10 seats it contested. However, either groups had a relief that in the four constituencies where they fought against each other, each ended up sharing two seats each. When both groups were united, they could only win six from the 15 seats they contested in 2016. After they split and contested from 22 seats altogether, they could win only seven seats reducing their bargaining power in the frontal politics. The loss of Jose K Mani during a Left wave has come as a big blow to the Kerala Congress (M). Jose and his party had no doubt that Jose K Mani would become a minister if the LDF government retained power. Reacting to the landslide victory of the LDF, Jose K Mani said that the election result shows that the decision taken by his party to join the LDF was right. He also said that the party played a decisive role in the great win of the LDF. “The KC (M) candidates contested from traditional UDF strongholds. Our candidates fought really hard to win,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/camps-swapped-but-kappen-still-towers-over-jose-k-mani-in-pala/articleshow/82361079.cms||Jaikrishnan Nair
---||Delhi||SOS sent, but two die as Gurugram hospital runs out of oxygen||GURUGRAM: After six people died at a city hospital on Friday, two more patients lost their lives at Aryan Hospital on Sunday as it ran out of oxygen. The hospital management said they had informed the district administration about the crisis. “We had informed the nodal officer and the deputy commissioner. But we failed to save the patients,” said Dr Vikram Aryan, the owner of Aryan Hospital, Old Railway Road. The facility needs 100 D-type cylinders (each can be used for 12-14 hours) daily. “I have 62 Covid patients. Of them, 17 are in ICU and four are on ventilator support. We have been requesting for refilling 100 D-type cylinders daily. We got a few on Sunday but for the past two days, we did not get any supply,” Aryan said. Officials said around 7 am on Sunday, they requested for oxygen and around 11 am, six cylinders were sent. But one patient died soon after. The second died around 3.30 pm. “I am working to install a plant at the hospital but that will take at least a month. It will be able to refill 53 cylinders daily. Currently, I have 25 oxygen concentrators,” Aryan added. The district administration confirmed the deaths on Sunday. “We had given them cylinders. We will provide more soon. Those who died on Sunday were very ill,” said Yash Garg, deputy commissioner, Gurugram. On Friday night, six people at Kriti Hospital in Sector 56 died. Their relatives had alleged the facility did not have enough oxygen. Earlier on April 25, four patients had died at Kathuria Hospital after it ran out of supply. Meanwhile, on Saturday evening, 70 metric tonnes of supply meant for Haryana was routed to Delhi. “Yes, oxygen allotted for Haryana was diverted to Delhi. We are trying to procure oxygen from our existing plants,” said Garg, adding that all city hospitals are getting oxygen supply on a rotational basis. Gurugram has been struggling to match its oxygen demand for about two weeks now with several private hospitals sending out SOSs messages. PN Kakar, CEO of Park Hospital, tweeted around 10.30 am on Sunday saying: “Liquid oxygen allocated quota for Park Hospital Gurugram, hijacked to some other Hospital. More than 140 patients’ lives in danger (sic).” Signature Hospital tweeted at 10.55 am. “We at Signature Hospital, Sector 37 D, Gurugram are in dire need of Oxygen supply as our existing stock would last 4-5 hour more. With rising patients, our daily need is skyrocketing and rising. We need at least 1.5 Ton of Oxygen Supply (sic),” said the message. “AarvyHospital Gurugram is struggling for #Oxygen for last 3 days. Kindly restore adequate Oxygen supply so that hospital can take more patients to treat (sic),” hospital officials tweeted on Sunday. On Sunday, Fortis hospital in Gurugram stopped admitting fresh patients. “No ventilators are available. Due to depleting oxygen stock, we are not admitting any new patients,” said Rahul Bhargava, director, bone marrow transplant programme, Fortis, Gurugram. A total of 71 facilities are treating Covid patients in the district, of which 16 are dependent on liquid oxygen supply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sos-sent-but-two-die-as-ggn-hosp-runs-out-of-o2/articleshow/82361073.cms||Ipsita Pati
---||Mumbai||Mumbai will be ‘safer’ by June 1 if no hitch in vaccination, no new variant||MUMBAI: A mathematical model analysing the reasons for the second Covid wave in the city and the future trends suggests that the rising graph of Covid fatalities will peak in the first week of May. Covid cases peaked a few weeks before May 1 in Mumbai. Analysing the vaccination trends, a paper presented by a team of scientists from Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Mumbai, stated that in scenarios matching Mumbai’s inoculation drive (age-based vaccinations of 15 to 20 lakh new people a month; 75% efficacy), Covid fatalities will reduce to near January- and February-levels by June 1. If the vaccination continues without a hitch, and there is no threat from a new variant, Mumbai may be in a position to open schools by July 1 or soon thereafter, it added. “Of course, as in any forecasting exercise, further off the horizon, more error prone are the projections. So closer to July would be the right time to make this evaluation,” said TIFR dean Dr Sandeep Juneja, who led the team. Coronavirus: Live updatesThe ongoing second Covid wave affected 2.3 lakh Mumbaikars and claimed 1,479 lives in April alone. On May 1, the city registered 90 deaths, the highest single-day toll this year so far—the highest-ever in the pandemic was 120 on June 24, 2020. The mathematical model hints that a variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus led to the second wave and local train services played a role in its spread. The TIFR team said that the variant was possibly in circulation in Mumbai and other larger districts in Maharashtra in February when the city reopened and local trains started plying at near-normal frequency. As the crowds on roads and trains increased, the variant found a conducive environment to spread and create a ferocious second wave. The paper said, “Opening up of the economy at any time before or after February would have led to growth in variants (since it’s unlikely that a large proportion of population would have been vaccinated any time soon), and that is the suggested key reason for the severe second wave as per our computational experiments.” Local trains certainly played an important role in expediting their spread, it added. The scientists said that most factors blamed for the second wave, such as poor Covid-appropriate behavior, increased reinfections, and increased lethality in the virus, or combinations, by themselves do a poor job of matching the second wave pattern. “We find that the most likely explanation is the presence of a small amount of extremely infective variant on February 1 that grew rapidly thereafter and became a dominant strain by mid-March. The scenario where the variant is 2 to 2.5 times more infectious than the dominant strain last year, and accounts for 2.5% of the infected population on February 1, appears to match the data well,” said the paper. Given the large uncertainty in model parameters, the above numbers may be far off from the truth. However, the observation that Mumbai had highly infective variants that grew to have substantial presence in March is likely to be true. As the second wave patterns in other districts like Pune, Thane, Nashik and Nagpur followed Mumbai’s pattern closely, the doctor said a similar lag may be evident for Maharashtra soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-will-be-safer-by-june-1-if-no-hitch-in-vax-drive-no-new-variant/articleshow/82361193.cms||Malathy Iyer

The concern, however, remains that the active cases in the city have been increasing consistently as new cases have consistently surpassed number of discharges. Against the 884 new cases, 621 persons were discharged in the city and district from home isolation or hospitals. According to data released by the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) on Saturday, 872 persons tested positive out of 10,142 samples and on Friday, 854 out of 9,927 persons had tested positive. A steady stream of patients coming to Vadodara from other districts has also led to a consistent rise in the number of admissions. While officials have been adding treatment facilities, even they are sceptical about the situation in the near future. An official said that the next two weeks would be crucial and people should stick to Covid norms to stay safe. The tally of cases in city and district went up to 45,821. The deaths of eight more persons were confirmed by death audit committee reports. The total number of deaths due to Covid-19 being the primary cause of death went up to 392.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/new-cases-higher-than-recovery-rate/articleshow/82359166.cms||---

The court also warned if anyone found either involved in selling the same above MRP or malpractices like hoarding will face contempt action. In a special hearing on Sunday, Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli, ordered, “We direct the state to ensure that none of the equipment, or medicines used in the treatment of Covid-19 disease are sold at prices above the MRP. Any person found indulging in malpractice of either hoarding the equipment or medicines, or selling the same at prices above the MRP, shall be booked and brought to the notice of this court for initiating independent contempt action against all such people,” ordered the court. Senior advocate Mehra, representing Delhi government, informed the court that Delhi Police had created a helpline number 23469900 where complaints regarding malpractice — such as overcharging by ambulances, fake Covid-19 medicines, black marketing/ hoarding of medicines, oxygen cylinders/ concentrators or other medical equipment, harassment at cremation grounds, etc., can be reported. “We direct the GNCTD, and the commissioner of police to widely publicise the said helpline number in daily newspapers, and through other media channels,” the court directed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ensure-covid-meds-not-sold-above-mrp/articleshow/82361130.cms||Aamir Khan
---||Thiruvananthapuram||11 out of 12 ministers who contested clear the hurdle||All LDF ministers, who contested assembly polls and won, were assured of a second-term. But J Mercykutty Amma, who was elected from Kundara with 30,460 votes in 2016, lost to P C Vishnunath by 6,348 votes. This time, she saw a major erosion in her vote share which reflected the ire of the fishing community over the controversial deep-sea fishing deal. The loopholes in the fishing deal had become a major election topic during campaign and she failed to come up with a convincing explanation on the issue which blighted her poll prospects. In spite of relief packages offered for fishermen post Ockhi cyclone, the results showed that the community was not enthused with the minister. Minister for devaswom and tourism Kadakampally Surendran asserted his authority over Kazhakkoottam for yet another term. Though his words of remorse pertaining to Sabarimala backfired in the initial round of campaign, he managed to glide over an aggressive campaign launched by Sobha Surendran. UDF’s experiment with Dr SS Lal could do little to pose a threat to Surendran won by 23,497 votes. Power minister MM Mani, who exuded confidence, lived up to his word and won by 38,305 votes at Udumbanchola. Labour minister TP Ramakrishnan also did not break a sweat at Perambra as he breezed to a victory by a margin of 22,478 votes. KT Jaleel, who described his victory as historic, battled his way to a second term in the final rounds of counting. Jaleel – who had a stormy tenure as minister after being embroiled in a host of issues which even led to his resignation – was nearly defeated at Thavanur as UDF candidate Firoz Kunnamparambil seemed headed for an upset here. But, Jaleel fought back in the final hours of counting and won by 2,564 votes. Addressing the media, he said that his win was historic and his opponents had tried every single trick to defeat him. Health minister KK Shailaja, who went into elections riding on the plaudits she earned during the outbreak of Nipah and first wave of Covid-19, won with a whopping majority of 61,035 at Mattannur. Her sterling majority is most likely to grant her a second term as the health minister. Transport minister AK Saseendran won by 37,000 votes at Elathur and water resources minister K Krishnankutty was re-elected from Chittur by 35,146 votes. Another minister Kadannappally Ramachandran faced a stiff fight from Congress candidate Satheesan Pacheni but eventually emerged victorious in Kannur by a margin of 1,660 votes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/11-out-of-12-ministers-who-contested-clear-the-hurdle/articleshow/82361121.cms||---

They each sell at least four to nine tonne of vegetables per week. The farmers said they have identified some big housing societies where they sell their vegetables. They inform the chairpersons of the societies through social media. Then the residents come there and procure vegetables. Some FPCs are using e-commerce and social media platforms to sell vegetables directly to the residents.“We are a group of around 18 farmers from Mohadi village in Dindori taluka of Nashik. We supply vegetables directly to two big housing societies in Airoli twice a week. We share the list of vegetables with prices to the chairpersons of the housing societies a few hours before visiting there,” Santosh Bankar, adding that all the vegetables are sold within few hours. Amol Gorhe, who leads a group of 20 farmers from Nashik, said they have developed an app and gets vegetable orders from the residents particularly in Mulund, Colaba and Thane.Sahyadri Farms, a Nashik-based farmers producer company with over 6,000 farmers as its members, is also supplying vegetables and fruits in baskets to residents in Mumbai, Pune and Thane. “The demand for vegetables in Mumbai, Pune and Thane has increased three times after the implementation of strict restrictions. Mumbai shares 50% of our total daily sale of vegetables and fruits,” said Vilas Shinde, chairman of Sahyadri Farms.  According to officials of Agricultural Technology Management Agencies (ATMA), which works under the state agriculture department, said these 18 groups of farmers are selling over 80 to 90 tonne of vegetables per week in Mumbai and suburbs.“We have facilitated spaces in the premises of some housing societies in Mumbai, where groups of farmers and FPCs sell their vegetables twice or thrice a week,” said Sagar Khairnar, an official from ATMA Nashik.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-farmers-sell-vegetables-to-mumbai-thane-residents/articleshow/82359132.cms||Tushar Pawar

In at least 10 constituencies, the winning margin of the candidate was less than 2,000 votes. One of the victories with lowest margin was registered in Kuttiady in Kozhikode, traditionally a strong CPM constituency. In Kuttiady, K P Kunhammed Kutty of CPM defeated sitting MLA and IUML candidate Parakkal Abdulla by a margin of 333 votes. Interestingly, in the 2016 election, Abdulla had won the constituency by a slender margin of 1,157 votes. Manjeshwaram constituency in Kasaragod is another one that presented some anxious moments for the candidates, where A K M Ashraf of IUML defeated V V Rameshan of CPM by 745 votes. The constituency had witnessed a tight triangular competition involving BJP state president K Surendran as well. In the 2016 assembly election, the then IUML candidate had defeated Surendran by a slender 89 votes. In Thrissur, which witnessed yet another triangular contest between the three fronts, P Balachandran of CPI defeated Padmaja Venugopal of Congress by 946 votes. The constituency was noted as the BJP candidate was actor Suresh Gopi, who had earlier contested as BJP candidate from Thrissur in the last Lok Sabha elections. A tight fight was witnessed in Kannur too, where sitting MLA and ports minister Kadannappally Ramachandran of LDF toppled UDF candidate Satheesan Pacheni by 1,745 votes. Similar is the case in Chavara, where former minister and RSP leader Shibu Baby John tried to take on Sujith Vijayan Pillai, son of deceased LDF MLA Vijayan Pialli. The contest which maintained its nail-biting excitement till the last moment as the leads kept changing between both sides, finally ended in Vijayan winning by a margin of just 1,096 votes. In Tanur, that was noted by the candidature of Youth League leader P K Firos who had led the fight against minority affairs minister K T Jaleel raising charges of nepotism, LDF candidate V Abdurahiman defeated Firos by a thin margin of 985 votes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/its-wafer-thin-majority-for-ldf-in-at-least-10-seats/articleshow/82361157.cms||---

Municipal commissioner Shankar Gore said the civic body took this decision to prevent large gatherings and curb the spread of the infection in the city.i was “We have observed that people tend to violate Covid safety protocol by crowding at grocery shops and vegetable mandis. The civic body had earlier requested the vegetable vendors to either sell their goods at various chowks by ensuring appropriate physical distance between customers, or sell the vegetables directly at the buyers’ doorsteps. But the response was not encouraging,” said Gore. Ahmednagar district has been recording around 3,500-4,000 new Covid cases every day in recent times. At least 18% of these cases are from the Ahmednagar city, which has a population of about 3.5 lakh. The district currently has more than 22,000 active cases and an overall mortality rate of 1.16%. “The new measure will prevent overcrowding, which is extremely dangerous given the prevailing Covid situation,” said Ahmednagar Municipal Corporation’s chief medical officer Anil Borge. Borge added that the Covid positivity rate in Ahmednagar city has significantly reduced in the past 15 days from around 35% to 18%. “The civic body has been working overtime to pull the positivity rate down to less than 5% in Ahmednagar city. And the new restrictions that we have imposed will help lower the positivity rate further,” added Borge. Meanwhile, Ahmednagar district collector Rajendra Bhosale has issued a ‘no pillion riding’ order in the district with immediate effect. The administration has warned of legal action against those violating the orders. The order is aimed at reducing the movement of people on roads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/ahmednagar-grocery-shops-mandis-to-be-shut-till-may-10/articleshow/82359139.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

---||Delhi||Hearse reality: Couple provides Covid funeral services 24x7||NEW DELHI: The phones of Namrata Mamak Singh and Daljit Sean Singh ring at all hours these days, even as late at 3am. The Singhs run a funeral company and the recent weeks have been stressful. Every day, their Antim Yatra hearse makes 8-10 rounds from the hospitals to the cremation grounds, sometimes even from spots where patients have died on the way to hospitals. Uniquely, before any body is taken to the cremation ground, the hearse carries it to the residence of the deceased and halts for a while there. Daljit explained, “It is believed that a person’s soul remains where he has lived. So a lot of people request us to go to the house for a while.” Since Covid norms frequently prevent families from meeting their loved ones for the last time, this rite provides some consolation. Namrata juggles to coordinate transport with the grieving families, the ambulance drivers, the priests at funeral grounds and her Antim Yatra team members. “Our hearses, each with some helpers, are constantly taking bodies and kin for the last rites. At the crematoriums, there is often a long wait, so our team waits with the families,” she said. The Singhs also serve non-Covid bereavements, but for those who have died due to the coronavirus, the Antim Yatra team members mandatorily dress up in PPE suits. Faith of the deceased is not a criterion, but 98% of the funerals Antim Yatra has assisted in has been of Hindus. “We have seen in the past one week how bad our infrastructure is,” said Daljit. “We have just three electric crematoria. The wood-burning ones are overwhelmed. With the cremation facilities divided for Covid and non-Covid bodies, there are additional problems.” Namrata added, “Families of patients who die at home or are suspected of Covid and die on the way to hospital suffer the most. They call us to find out what to do. We are actually as clueless. Without a death certificate, cremation grounds do not allow entry. We, therefore, often ask them to call a doctor who can certify the death or dial the police 100 line. The cops can help if the entire family is Covid-positive.” The couple say the priests have the worst of the situation, often because they don’t wear masks or PPE suits. “When we last spoke to the panditji at Lodhi crematorium, he told us he was at the mercy of god. Then he contracted Covid and went back home in Sitapur with his health worsening,” said Namrata. Asked how they themselves remained safe, the Singh couple both shrugged. “These are testing times for everyone, so one has to put one’s best foot forward to help them,” smiled Daljit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hearse-reality-couple-provides-covid-funeral-services-24x7/articleshow/82361186.cms||Shradha Chettri

And these queries are coming not just from large corporates but SMEs and MSMEs as well. In fact, many of their existing enterprise customers too are looking at fortifying their cyber security covers by adding more clauses or opting for higher sum insured policies, multiple insurers confirmed. TA Ramalingam, chief technical officer, Bajaj Allianz General Insurance, pointed out that IT/ITeS and banking were the first movers for this policy but in the last few years the company has also seen an increase in demand from manufacturing, pharmaceutical, hospitality and automotive sectors. He attributes this renewed interest from all these sectors to an increased work from home (WFH) activity and a slew of recent cyber-attacks which has prompted clients to buy increased sum insured cover. “The recent targeting of pharmaceutical industries by cyber attackers has definitely been a major driver for increased sales of cyber insurance policies in this sector,” he said. Even Sanjay Datta, chief-underwriting, claims and reinsurance, ICICI Lombard General Insurance, pointed out that enquiries from players in manufacturing as well as service sectors, including MSMEs and SMEs, have started pouring in. He explained that cyber liability insurance for enterprises covers first party costs like forensics, business interruption loss, privacy notification, data restoration, credit monitoring and third-party liability covering damages and legal cost. The sum insured varies according to sector and region of operation, size of organization, size and type of data they store and the extent of their cyber exposure. Rakesh Jain, ED & CEO, Reliance General Insurance, pointed out that companies are showing interest in add-on covers such as coverage of forensic investigation fees as well as regulatory penalties and fines. “While everything else in this area is in a discovery mode, we do anticipate demand of new covers basis the new risks and losses that businesses may experience as the world progresses with higher adoption of AI, ML and IOT,” he said, adding that fixing even ‘sum insured’ in liability products is more complex than in motor or fire insurance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/spike-in-data-breaches-sends-firms-scrambling-for-cybersecurity-cover/articleshow/82361212.cms||Swati Rathor
---||Ahmedabad||Covid-19 in Ahmedabad: Fewer doctors infected in current virus surge||AHMEDABAD: Dr Yatin Darji, a staff member at Civil Hospital, was infected with Covid in the third week of April. On May 1, he was discharged from the 1,200-bed hospital. He was among the 50-odd doctors and staff members of Civil Hospital who were infected in the current wave. “I had taken my first shot of the vaccine on February 12 and the second on March 13,” said Dr Darji, who appealed to all to get vaccinated. Dr Darji added: “I was constantly associated with the Covid hospital. Thus, I got infected, but my lung infection was only 20-25%. So I was admitted with moderate symptoms and relatively lesser oxygen dependency.” Dr Kartikeya Parmar, the nodal officer of the 1,200-bed Covid hospital at Civil Hospital, said that doctors maintain the record of vaccinations of those admitted to the hospital. “The share of those vaccinated even with the first shot is very small compared to the overall number,” he said. “It also applies to doctors and healthcare workers (HCWs). Their number is relatively very less compared to the last surge.” Close to 4 lakh persons have taken vaccinations in the first phase. The Civil Hospital data reveals that from March 2020 to February 2021, a total of 70 faculty members, 202 resident doctors, 56 interns, and 189 nursing staff had been infected. Over the past two months, the total number has not exceeded 70, said officials. Dr Bharat Gadhvi, president of Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (AHNA), said that the move of vaccinating HCWs first paid off as this time there are fewer infections and staff quarantines, which is giving the hospitals much-needed workforce at this crucial juncture. “We also have better defined protocols now for both treating the public and healthcare workers,” he said. “That could be one reason for the infection spread being less.” In a study authored by Dr Parmar and other senior faculty members at Civil Hospital, the doctors had focused on 161 colleagues who were infected with Covid in 2020. Of the total, only 21% had required hospitalization as 52% had opted for home isolation to recuperate. The average recuperation period was 11 days, and nine had required oxygen support. Sources, however, pointed out that the numbers — both in this wave and the last — must be considered with the understanding that healthcare workers are often encouraged not to test if they show only mild symptoms and work with proper medication. “Major hospitals have a severe staff crunch, and thus, if a doctor or a staff member has mild symptoms, they are often not reported,” said a doctor on the condition of anonymity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/fewer-doctors-infected-in-current-virus-surge/articleshow/82360241.cms||Parth Shastri

This is mainly due to the stringent lockdown-like curbs amid the second wave of Covid-19, with no standees and 50% occupancy in the red buses, sources in the transport body said. “The BEST is incurring huge losses in operations. It has to pay the lease rent for over 1,000 buses, besides maintaining its own fleet of nearly 3,000 buses daily,” said a BEST panel member. “The BMC should sanction more financial aid for the red buses so that we can operate them despite losses and offer affordable fares to commuters.” In pre-Covid times, the BEST undertaking would earn Rs 60 crore every month from ticket sales, which reduced to around Rs 40 crore in March, and now further to around Rs 20 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bests-ticket-earnings-dip-to-rs-20-crore-in-one-month/articleshow/82361866.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Resident doctors write to govt over lack of oxygen, health minister agrees||PANAJI: Doctors at the Goa Medical College (GMC) have highlighted the issue of poor oxygen supply to Covid patients. In a letter to the government, the Goa Association of Resident Doctors (GARD) has stated that the oxygen supply to Covid wards “is not even close to sufficient”. Health minister Vishwajit Rane after the meeting with the resident doctors told reporters that he is “trying his best to resolve all the issues” as GARD is the backbone of GMC. “We have oxygen for now. The shortage is not only in Goa, but all over the country. Whatever has been rationed by the government of India, we are asking for more supply. We’re trying to manage with whatever we are given. It’s not such a situation where we are heading towards a crisis. It’s tough the way we have to deal with it,” he said. The central oxygen flow delivers “very low flow oxygen at times and that is inadequate to keep NICs and ventilators working effectively,” the association stated. The oxygen cylinders being used for patients “get over in the middle of the night and it takes at least 2-3 hours for replacement cylinders to come and for this time period, the patients are kept without oxygen saturation dropping to less than 60%,” the association stated. A similar situation is faced even at the South Goa district hospital, it stated. The young doctors said that the bed situation is “even worse” and added that critical patients have to be managed on trolleys and floors and are kept on ventilators in critical Covid wards. Wards with a capacity of 30 beds are being occupied by more than 50 patients on an average, the letter stated. “In the middle of the night when oxygen gets over and patient’s condition worsens and dies, it’s the junior doctors on duty who have to face angry relatives,” the association president Dr Pratik Sawant stated in the letter. “We are confident of the CM’s intervention and I’m pursuing it at my level and the CM at his level to ensure what best can be done to smoothen this whole availability of oxygen (issue) in Goa,” the health minister said. The association has demanded enhanced security and CCTV cameras inside all Covid wards and signs stating that violence against healthcare workers will be firmly dealt with by law. “There is a need for placing armed guards/police personnel outside Covid wards and casualty,” the letter stated. The doctors highlighted the VIP culture where doctors in Covid casualty who are managing more than 30 new patients at a time are told to check on certain patients and give them preference for admission, while other critical patients waiting for three hours, leading to relatives fighting with the doctors on duty. Rane said the doctors are justified in asking for security and stated that police security as well as human resources security will be posted at the hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/resident-docs-write-to-govt-over-lack-of-o2-health-min-agrees/articleshow/82361824.cms||---
---||Kozhikode||Pinarayi won Malabari women’s hearts||In the Kerala assembly election, with its otherwise expected outcome, one element is curious: the excellent performance of the Left Democratic Front (LDF) in the north Kerala region. The LDF bagged 37 of 60 seats (61%) in the Malabar area. In an election with very little anti-incumbency, remarkable consistency by the winning front in election messaging while keeping winnable community arithmetic in place, why should this be surprising? The consensus among the commentators on social and mass media was that Malabar Muslims, constituting more than 70% of the state’s total 27% Muslim population, would help the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) do well in the region due to their mass allegiance to the communitarian party, Indian Union Muslim League (IUML). Buoyed by last assembly election and local body election performances, IUML had also got more seats to contest this time. They ended up winning only 15 of their 27 seats, while losing majority substantially even in the seats the party won. What could explain this phenomenon? First, from my personal interactions, I found a lot of women, largely homemakers and aged ones, cherishing the Pinarayi Vijayan government for the coherence and confidence it brought to their lives through kits and ration distribution during lockdown and after. Rather than seeing it as freebies, there was a certain cherishing of it as care and concern even in women who didn’t financially need it. Pinarayi government’s pronounced position against the CAA-NRC and the handling of the Covid crisis were seen as relatable house management by some of the Muslim women I talked to. This category of voters might not be visible in political discussions and hence their exercising of their electoral rights might have gone unaccounted for. In the national electoral history, this might rhyme well with the communication Nitish Kumar established with the women of Bihar. The theoretical bankruptcy of the IUML, its inability to claim its own legacy of social development and communal harmony and the leader P K Kunhalikutty’s arbitrary and self-serving steps have brought the party to some kind of a theoretical dead end. Some leaders of the Muslim organizations have also been disappointed with the IUML’s positions on electoral arrangements with political outfits such as the Welfare Party, always regarded as opposing IUML’s fundamental views. Though IUML leadership managed to contain the crisis and ended the alliance after local body elections, this did cause unhappiness and confusion. To all such, the Left front looked like a viable alternative. The IUML’s first woman candidate after 25 years, Noorbina Rasheed, losing her seat in a sitting seat is an unwelcome outcome of this election. The potential reasons, be that the Left wave with a powerful regional face at its helm or intra-organizational issues at the local level, point to the state’s inability to understand the necessity of women representatives. In short, the surprise Malabari asks us to acknowledge demographic categories, points to issues of political narratives and helps in the identification of the society’s blind-spots.

---||India||Bengal lost, pressure on BJP to retain Uttar Pradesh||NEW DELHI: BJP registered a significant success in retaining office in Assam, demonstrating that its win in the state with a sizeable population of Muslims was not a one-off, bagged a couple of seats in Tamil Nadu, consolidated its steadily increasing vote share in Kerala and ended on the winning side in Puducherry. Yet, the trophy that it seemed to covet the most—a win in Bengal—eluded it. BJP, which managed just 10% votes and three seats five years ago in Bengal, was hopeful of pulling off a repeat of the upset it achieved in Tripura. The party’s performance in the Lok Sabha polls, when it won 18 of the 42 seats, had whetted its appetite and led it to believe that a victory over Mamata Banerjee was a realistic objective. With a campaign which sought to tap into resentment over Banerjee’s appeasement, and corruption and excesses by local Trinamool functionaries, besides seeking to target specific caste groups and women, BJP thought it was on the right track. The response to PM Narendra Modi from the throngs he drew only boosted the confidence. Only that the outcome on Sunday panned out differently. Read AlsoAssembly elections 2021 results: 5 key takeawaysNEW DELHI: May 2 was a triumphant day for regional stalwarts as Mamata Banerjee, MK Stalin and Pinarayi Vijayan reigned supreme in their respective states despite a stiff opposition challenge. The TMC proved all exit polls wrong and won 213 seats in Bengal, two more than its 2016 tally. In TamilBJP functionaries are looking at the possibility whether outreach to certain sections did not go as planned even as solid turnout of Trinamool voters, including Muslims, helped Banerjee’s cause. It is also being felt that the campaign was let down by weak organisation. A BJP source also said that the 18 Lok Sabha seats the party won had to be seen in the context of Modi being given a second term. The motivation levels in the state polls were not so high, and it was also the case that Banerjee had been taken by surprise in 2019 and this was not so in the assembly polls. The results in Assam and West Bengal are important in terms of the party’s hunt for new areas of influence and reduce its dependence on north and west India to deliver parliamentary majorities. While Assam will help BJP grow in the northeast, the setback in West Bengal is more serious. The pressure on BJP to win the forthcoming state polls in Uttar Pradesh will grow with elections due next year. The hill state of Uttarakhand is also due for polls and the party is not in good shape there. The UP polls will be important in setting the tone, as it has been the backbone of BJP’s parliamentary majorities in 2014 and 2019.  Bengal has been an adverse political and ideological battleground and it would have projected a win as a major triumph for its Hindutva and development model. However, winning Assam is the solace the party needed to continue its expansion in the eastern region, as it was pitted against a strong Congress-AIUDF alliance with possibility of anti-incumbency feelings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bengal-lost-pressure-on-bjp-to-retain-uttar-pradesh/articleshow/82362722.cms||Akhilesh Singh

Mayor Jai Prakash said that the service would be of great help to Covid patients in home isolation and their family members who were facing mental stress. “The existing Covid situation is affecting people mentally, which is adding further to their problems. This helpline will help people deal with stress and trauma and guide them to the right line of treatment. Users will need to dial the number and then opt for the third option for the counselling,” said Jai Prakash. North corporation commissioner Sanjay Goel said that the telecounselling would be done by senior faculty members of Hindu Rao Medical College. “Their rich experience and knowledge will ensure that Covid patients and their family members get the right guidance and support to deal with the situation. Through this helpline number, citizens can get information related to Covid testing centre, vaccination centre, hospitals, Covid Care Centres, isolation centres, lifting of biomedical waste, crematoria/burial grounds, etc. The helpline will provide updated and authentic information regarding the line of treatment,” said Goel. East Delhi Municipal Corporation had recently released a list of 29 doctors and their phone numbers who agreed to give counselling to people in home quarantine. They can be contacted from 9 am to 9 pm on all days of the week. The east corporation, meanwhile, on Sunday revisited the arrangements at some of their schools, which are part of the list approved by district magistrates for inoculation of Covid-19 vaccine for persons above 18 years of age. “We received the orders late, but preparations are up to the mark from our side at selected schools approved for the vaccination drive,” said EDMC mayor Nirmal Jain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/north-corpn-starts-telecounselling-for-patients-at-home/articleshow/82360251.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ahmedabad||Man held with five vials of remdesivir in Ahmedabad||AHMEDABAD: A man was arrested with 58 vials of remdesivir worth Rs 2.90 lakh, police said on Sunday. He was trying to sell the medicine at exorbitant rates in Ahmedabad given the high demand of the drug for Covid-19 treatment. The accused, Rahul Patel, 31, a resident of Ashray Serene flats in Chandkheda, had procured these injections from a resident of Paldi named Rahul Zaveri, who is on the run, an officer of Chandkheda police said. According to the FIR of the case, cops of surveillance squad of DCP (deputy commissioner of police) Zone-2 got an input that Patel had remdesivir which he was trying to sell at around Rs 5,000 per vial. On basis of the input, a team of the DCP squad rushed to Tapovan Circle where Patel was waiting for the relative of a Covid patient to give him five vials of remedesivir. The police team held him with the 5 vials in his possession. Cops also found Rs 66,560 in cash on Patel who told police those vials were manufactured in a pharmaceutical firm in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Patel said the injections were procured by Zaveri who was the mastermind behind the illegal sales of remdesivir. After arresting Patel on Saturday, a case was registered under sections 420 for cheating and 120-B for criminal conspiracy of the Indian Penal Code and under the Essential Commodities Act and the Disaster Management Act, police said. State home minister Pradipsinh Jadeja on Saturday told reporters that police are keeping a close watch on black marketing of remdesivir and other medicines being used in COVID-19 treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/man-held-with-5-vials-of-remdesivir/articleshow/82360247.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Closer watch ordered on lions for corona signs||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat forest department has told its field staff to scan every part of the lion territory, including social forestry areas, to determine if any big cat has Covid-like symptoms. Moreover, the department will launch a special drive to vaccinate all the field staff. The Gujarat forest department on Saturday had ordered the shutdown of the Gir lion sanctuary and other wildlife tourist attractions across the state till further notice. This followed the issuance of an advisory by the Union forest ministry. Senior state forest department officials said that a camp will be organized to get rapid antigen as well as RT-PCR tests done on the field staff. D T Vasavada, the chief conservator of forests, Junagadh, said: “We have already carried out a surveillance operation and have ensured that the staff was checked for Covid.” Vasavada added: “In the past too, when corona was at its peak, similar drives were taken up. We are regularly monitoring the health of the lions and other animals in the sanctuary.” Vasavada said that so far not a single animal has shown the signs of Covid. He said that the Sasan hospital where rescued lions are brought for treatment is regularly sanitized, as are the cages at zoos. A senior officer said that an isolation area will be created at the Sasan hospital, and at other rescue centres, to house animals if they ever display Covid symptoms. The officer said that 20% of the staff have been vaccinated and the others will be soon. The officer said that a detailed roadmap has been prepared for surveillance in greater Gir and other areas so that if any animal is sick, the department is informed. The officer said that the forest department is planning to rope in its informers and the sarpanches in the greater Gir area to get information of any sick or weak animal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/closer-watch-ordered-on-lions-for-corona-signs/articleshow/82360252.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

Students have said the department must issue the documents to those who have applied for in the last year. They said without these important documents they may lose out on the scholarships. The Cops Association, a non-government organisation in education, has said in its demand that the date for submission of documents must be extended and also the procedure to fill the online forms on the portal needed explanation. Amar Ekad of the association said, “The various departments that offer the higher education scholarships have not even let out information regarding the schemes for 2020. Many students are unaware about it. Students do not know how to fill the form and the colleges need to be given instructions to train students to fill forms and take advantage of it. A lot of students lack the necessary documents as the application process was delayed due to the lockdown.” The social welfare department, tribal, medical education, and higher and technical education departments of Maharashtra offer these scholarships to students. Ekad said, “Many students are eligible yet they have not been able to fill the form because they don’t have the documents. Students cannot move out of the house and the telephone number of the tehsil offices do not work.” Many colleges were delaying the process and the state government should take action against them. Officials at the department of higher and technical education said, “The students will be given time to submit the documents and the deadline will be reconsidered. No eligible student will lose out on scholarships. The process of filling the forms has also been listed on the portal and students can refer to it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/lack-of-documents-may-leave-scholarships-out-of-grasp/articleshow/82360256.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Impact of pandemic curbs: 40% transport vehicles off roads in Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: It’s akin to the last year’s lockdown for transporters. Movement restrictions and curbs have been imposed to tackle the massive surge in cases of Covid-19 and Gujarat transporters are feeling the heat. Estimates of Akhil Gujarat Truck Transporters’ Association (AGTTA) suggest that at least 40% of the transport vehicles have now gone off the roads. “The lockdown measures in various states have sparked a fear among drivers who often refuse to report for work,” said Mukesh Dave, president, AGTTA. “Some drivers or their family members have been affected by Covid. Many have left for their home towns fearing getting stranded.” Transporters said that even demand has taken a hit as industrial production has been impacted by Covid. “The demand for raw materials as well as for finished products has dropped as there are different levels of restrictions across different states,” Dave said. As territorial lockdowns and curbs on movement are extended, transporters have warned that supplies of essential commodities, including medicines, may take a hit. “We anticipate that if the availability of vehicles reduces, it may adversely hit the supply of medicines, essentials, and raw materials,” he said. “The fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) segment has already begun feeling the pinch.” Restrictions and the reduction in demand have come as a double whammy for transporters, especially because fuel prices have remained on the higher side and unchanged over a month. The petrol price stands at Rs 87.57 per litre and the diesel price is at Rs 86.96 per litre. “Our contracts with suppliers are pre-negotiated. Currently we’re short of staff and the demand has gone down, which directly impacts our revenues,” said an Ahmedabad-based transporter. “However, our cost of operations remains unchanged and such a high price of diesel certainly hits the effective income.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/impact-of-pandemic-curbs-40-transport-vehicles-off-roads/articleshow/82360257.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Pune||Enthusiasts, musicians recall Derek Julian as an iconoclast & perfectionist||Pune: Two weeks ago, city-based guitarist Derek Julien’s long-time friends and jamming partners posted an urgent appeal on social media to help continue his treatment for Covid-19 as he was seriously ill. Unfortunately, the 70 year-old passed away at a city hospital last week, leaving behind his wife and daughter. The appeal included the performance of a song he had helped compose. Hundreds from all over the world chipped in, even those who had never met Derek or may have only fleetingly heard his mastery on the strings during a tribute concert to Eric Clapton. What then cropped up was a YouTube page full of well-wishers and a WhatsApp group to direct the donations to his family. But even now, his listeners and bandmates remember him as a man full of vitality, as an iconoclast and a tech geek, who often had his guitar hooked onto many gadgets — all to generate the exact tune that he had in mind. “I used to see him perform at Shisha in Koregaon Park. Blues is a lot about how you feel the song, much like Indian classical music. Derek relished the songs he played and he always managed to communicate to the audience his feelings about that song,” said Ashwin Panemangalore, a blues enthusiast in the city. For some of his collaborators, who saw Derek, knew him as a shy and quiet man who deployed all his creative energy and the tricks up his sleeve. He was an icon unto himself, with Derek himself being deeply influenced by the Beatles in his youth. “I met him for the first time in 2001. What struck me about him was how free-flowing he was. He was always practising his riffs and melodies on his guitar. I was simply awestruck by his style of playing,” reminisced Albert Dennis, a city-based musician, and a frequent collaborator.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/enthusiasts-musicians-recall-derek-julian-as-an-iconoclast-perfectionist/articleshow/82360261.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

An investigation into a local case led the cops to the accused. They were handed over to the Dahisar police. The accused may have had a contact at a financial services company, said the police. The source would help them procure Aadhaar and PAN copies of people with good credit scores. They would scan the documents online and replace the individual’s photo with one of the their own to seek bank loans. One of them would then go to a showroom to buy a two-wheeler on EMI. With a down payment of just Rs 15,000-Rs 20,000, the gang would collect a new bike and leave. When no more EMIs were paid, the bank would check only to find that individual named in the papers was not the applicant. The gang stole at least two dozen vehicles in this manner and sold them off elsewhere. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-4-use-forged-papers-to-buy-bikes-across-state-booked/articleshow/82361940.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Delhi: Two nurses held for Remdesivir ‘theft’||NEW DELHI: In a crackdown on unscrupulous elements taking advantage of the Covid-19 crisis, Delhi Police has made several arrests regarding black marketing of Remdesivir, oxygen concentrators and other medical equipment. Two ambulance drivers overcharging people have also been held. In Punjabi Bagh, two nursing staff of Maharaja Agrasen Hospital were arrested for allegedly stealing Remdesivir vials from their dead patients’ quota and selling them at an exorbitant price to kin of needy patients. The accused have been identified as Domatothi Yashwanth Rao and Deepak Singh. Five injections have been seized from them. The duo worked in the ICU ward. During interrogation, the two men disclosed that they used to steal Remdesivir injections of patients, who died during treatment at their hospital, and would sell them for Rs 30,000 each. In Ashok Vihar, two men were arrested for selling a non-functional oxygen concentrator to a man for over Rs 1.6 lakh. A man from Kalkaji extension had purchased a concentrator as his mother and wife had tested positive and were in critical condition. After he complained that it was not working, the seller, later identified as Anuj Minda, refused to fix or replace it. The victim then approached police. The cops enquired and arrested Minda along with his associate Gurmeet Singh. In southeast Delhi’s Jaitpur, cops helped a man with the last rites of his mother. In Lajpat Nagar, policemen helped IBS Hospital with 22 oxygen cylinders after arranging them from different locations in Delhi thereby saving the lives of 40 Covid patients on oxygen support. The hospital had barely two hours of oxygen left. Oxygen supply to Vimhans and Moolchand hospitals was also ensured through a green corridor. In Mukherjee Nagar, an ambulance driver was arrested for charging the kin of a deceased Rs 14,000 for a distance of six kilometres. In Okhla too, an ambulance driver was arrested for charging Rs 9,000 from a family for a distance of 10 kilometres. A medical store owner was arrested in Jamia Nagar for selling Covid- related medical equipment at exorbitant prices. Two water nozzles, 18 oxygen pumps and three oxygen flowmeters were seized.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/two-nurses-held-for-remdesivir-theft/articleshow/82360265.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||When furniture tells stories||Ahmedabad: What can a piece of furniture tell? A lot, if you have ears to listen to them. And that’s exactly what a team of researchers did when they embarked on the six-year long journey traversing Gujarat, Rajasthan, Haryana and Punjab to document ‘vernacular’ furniture of north-west India. The project recently took shape of books, a virtual exhibition ‘Itiha,’ and also became part of Google Arts and Culture. The project is an international collaboration of Design Innovation and Craft Resource Centre (DICRC) at CEPT University and UK-based South Asian Decorative Arts and Craft Collection Trust (SADACC). “Vernacular furniture in context of this project is something which is part of everyday life of people, designed locally and made by craftspeople using locally-available material,” said Prof Jay Thakkar, executive director of DICRC. “While we found broad categories such as seating furniture, storage furniture, etc. in each of the four states, its internal variety was mind-boggling. It also gave a peek into the region’s history, climatic conditions, gender politics, community living and lifestyle.” Mansi S Rao, senior research associate at DICRC, said that it was a painstaking documentation for the team that worked in pair of two. “They not only took pictures but also measured dimensions, prepared scaled drawings, identified material, geo-tagged it and categorized them. We were lucky to find many pieces which are no more produced by traditional artisans,” she said. About every state is documented through 400-500 pieces, said researchers, ranging from hinchko (swing) of Gujarat to manch (seat)of Haryana and sandook (cupboard) of Punjab to kothlio (larder) of Rajasthan. Takhat | Haryana A takhat is a wooden bench found in residential, public, religious or commercial spaces. It comprises a horizontal frame which is fixed to the legs. Wooden planks are fixed on the frame either by nails or rivets to form a seat. In the community spaces like chaupal, takhat are used by men to sit on for leisure activities, council meetings and community gatherings. Takhat used to be an important ceremonial gift earlier, today it’s still exchanged between the bride and the groom’s families, as a part of the wedding rituals. It’s an example of a ‘gendered’ furniture, said experts. Dholiyo | Gujarat Found mostly in Saurashtra region of Gujarat, Dholiyo is distinct from khatlo (khaat) due to heavily-turned legs finished with characteristic red lacquer. Its surface is made of tightly-woven cotton straps, often covered with fabric sleeve or cover which is also decorated with embroidery or applique. In some communities, the charpoy is associated with a single male member of the family who uses it throughout his life. Its association is so deep that it’s cremated along with the person or is dismantled forever. In some communities, it used to form bride-wealth. The modern examples have brass fittings to accommodate mosquito net. Basni and Tarvaiyya | Rajasthan Basni is a unique low stool used by women of Godwad region to carry out everyday chores like grinding grains or cooking. Ergonomically, the jutting wooden members of the frame provide support to the thighs when the women sit on it. Tarvaiyya is another type of low stool found in Dungarpur district, which is specifically used while milking the cattle. It is made from locally available wood by joining four inclined legs to a small wooden plank. Kothlio | Rajasthan Kothlio is a larder specifically found in the rural desert parts of Barmer and Jaisalmer. It is made using mud and works as refrigerators to store perishable food items. The form and ornamentation of a kothlio is decided by the women of the family who made them. The women decorate the kothlio with mud-relief and mirror work, similar to the patterns used on the walls of the house. A newly married woman is expected to craft her own kitchen space along with the kothlio when she moves in with the husband’s family. Sandook | Punjab Sandook is a type of storage furniture used to store clothes, mattresses, bedding and pillows. Valuable items like jewellery, gold and money are also stored in hidden compartments or between the mattresses. Itis often ornamented with carvings, mouldings, and paintings. A sandook formed an important part of marriage rituals in Punjab as it’s part of the bride-wealth. A sandook would be commissioned specifically for such occasions. The sense of memory associated with vernacular furniture is most evident in the case of sandook. In Punjab, some families choose to hold on to it along with all the belongings of the owner intact in their memories after the owner passes away. Sarpoz | Punjab A sarpoz is a container with a lid used to store food items, in particular, roti. It is made using dried wheat stalks and is decorated with woollen threads of different colours. Motifs of animals and birds are made using dyed cotton threads. The lid is similarly made. Sometimes, an additional knitted cover is put over the lid. Majju | Rajasthan, Haryana Like Sandook, it’s also a storage furniture. But like patara of Gujarat, these wooden pieces are unique in its construct and usage. Experts said that no two majju are the same as the artisan/ craftsman made small changes in design and functioning. It was said that only the maker and the head of the family would know how to open it. The secret would pass on from one head to another as majju often came with false locks and openings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/when-furniture-tells-stories/articleshow/82360303.cms||Parth Shastri

In fact, when the central government had asked ex-armymen and retired Army Medical Corps (AMC) to come forward and render their services during the pandemic last year, over 1,000 ex-armymen registered their names with Sainik Welfare Office, Telangana . It is learnt that the Sainik Welfare Office also developed a mobile app, exclusively for the ex-armymen as well. “Addresses, service and contact numbers of 1,000 ex-armymen have been collected and kept ready. Once the state government gives its nod and when their services are required, we can roll into action as volunteers,” Colonel Ramesh Kumar, director, Sainik Welfare told TOI. Recently, Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat had recalled retired army medicos to come forward to render their services. “We have nearly 200 retired AMC peronnel in Telangana ready to take part in dealing with Covid, provided government comes forward to utilise their services,” a retired army official and UFERWAS executive committee member, Major G Shiva Kiran (Retd) said. “Though many measures have been taken to prevent Covid, it is spreading rapidly. The families of these retired AMC and ex-armymen are in panic due to the current second wave and may probably discourage them from taking part in the services,” the major added. Meanwhile, based on the ministry of defence’s (MoD) instructions, the Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) has kept the Bolarum General Hospital, which has 30 beds, ready and SCB officials assured that they would ready another 20 beds. Dedicated sanitation teams are regularly sanitising public places in the Cantonment. “Residents are being encouraged to use online services through e-Chhawani portal,” a senior SCB official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/state-yet-to-utilise-services-of-1k-former-armymen-in-covid-fight/articleshow/82361256.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Let’s Pick up the Pieces and Put them Back Together||We are in a national crisis. Covid has cast it’s grey shadow all over the country — from villages in the hinterland to penthouses in the plush, from aged and infirm to the robust and young, this mutant has spared no one. During such times, it’s no use crying over spilt milk and starting a blame game. It is what it is and we have to join hands, pick up the pieces and start afresh. If the ‘caged’ virus mutates and strikes with deadly venom, remember, we are the chosen ones. We fought the first wave with valour, science, innovation and discipline and used all the available remedies (indigenous, official and home-made) to good effect. We have to quickly go back to the drawing board and rejuvenate, strategise and come up with a plan from the lessons of the past. No country can have readymade hospitals and drugs for more than a few percent of the population, for what would these hospitals and ICUs be doing in peace times. For over a century, no country has had to put together beds, equipment, medicines and allied healthcare facilities for so many in so short a time. Let’s look at corrective measures. Like schools are used as polling booths, already the government is making makeshift hospitals in colleges, exhibition centres etc. Manufacturing of medical and paramedical supplies is on a war footing and pharmaceuticals are working overtime to meet the huge demands. But just like a running home can feed some unexpected guests but not a crowd, medical supplies are obviously strained. Even the fatigued doctors and weary nurses who have had no time to rest between PPEs and duties, are feeling the burden. Medical exams and admission rules and subsequent bonds have become so stringent and entangled by the endless entrance exams, that the number of kids opting for medical colleges is dwindling. First, restrict the use of Remdesivir which is the go-to drug for every patient. Let’s outlaw the wrongful purchase, unindicated use and hoarding of this drug. While the world is rushing oxygen and generators to us, our industries have diverted oxygen for medical use. The authorities have galvanised all strata of society to bury their differences and rise to the occasion. Let’s not indiscriminately store cylinders and concentrators but pass them all to the deserving. Look at the gross social indiscipline. In the new year, citizens were holidaying, merry making in hordes and attending functions. Masks and distancing had taken a back seat. Even now, the conglomeration of people at vaccination centres with masks hanging by the side, cheek by jowl, celebrating after the shot of hope, is a common sight. It is these very folks who test positive subsequently and blame the vaccine. First there was a clamour for vaccines, then a dither to take or not and now a run on them. Unfortunately, Dr WhatsApp and social media has led them astray. We would have had more vaccinated, had all the eligibles taken it. There is a method in the madness. We have had quite a few vaccinated coming to us with symptoms and positive reports. None of them had a serious infection and no one succumbed. The pendulum favouring one vaccine over the other swings every week from favourite to avoided, but the fact remains that any and every vaccine provides the desired protection enunciated above. Don’t wait, get your shot when your turn is due. History has taught us that the second wave is always more devastating than the first. Lets salvage our resources, gather our strength, follow the rules and win the game as we did last time. From quarantine to treatment rules, from essential supplies to optional ones and from the haves to the have nots, one size should fit all, with no exceptions. In the words of Kennedy, “Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your countr”. A mass of 1.3 billion is not a joke and the calamity cannot be just wished away or whisked away. Only patient, unquestioned cooperation and a positive attitude can unite the whole country against this common enemy of mankind. Jai Hind.

He has increased patrolling to ensure nobody ventures inside the reserve and to also keep an eye on the health of the wild animals.The staff in the tiger reserve, which is home to over 100 tigers, have been directed to get themselves tested for Covid and stop local villagers from going inside the forest. Already, nearly two dozen employees of the reserve have tested positive and two have died during treatment in the past two weeks.Pathak told TOI that the staff is patrolling on foot to cover deeper areas of the reserve. “These are testing times and fortunately we have dynamic officers who are always there on the field to encourage the other staff. In March, we completed 11,600-kilometre patrolling as per MStripes software and it increased to 12,800km in the month of April despite the surge in Covid. The emphasis is on foot patrolling to ensure the deeper areas are covered. We are requesting people to not enter the forest, especially the buffer area, as the infection can spread from humans to wild animals.” said Pathak.Patrolling is being done by various teams, and each team consists of a forest guard, 2-3 watchers and the forester of the area.“Our patrolling teams are also keeping a close eye on the activities of wild animals. They have been asked to report any incidents of an animal sneezing or having discharge from the nose. The staff have also been advised to stay away from the forest if they are experiencing any symptoms of Covid and to get themselves tested right away,” added Pathak.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/patrolling-increased-in-dudhwa-to-minimise-human-animal-interaction/articleshow/82359757.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

India reported 3,70,188 fresh cases on Sunday, the second consecutive day of falling numbers following a tally of 3.92 lakh on Saturday. There was a slight drop in the death toll from the virus as well, with 3,375 fatalities reported on Sunday, a day after casualties had climbed to an all-time high of close to 3,700. Overall, however, the daily numbers remain very high. The April 26-May 2 week ended with India posting the highest number of new cases recorded in any country over a seven-day period for the second week running. Last week, India had logged 22.5 lakh cases. During its worst week of the pandemic (January 4-10), the US had reported 17.7 lakh new cases. While weekly numbers were still on the rise, there was a discernible slowdown in the growth. The current week’s numbers were 16% higher than the April 19-25 case tally, down from a growth rate of 47% in that week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covids-deadliest-week-26-lakh-cases-23800-deaths/articleshow/82362812.cms||Amit Bhattacharya
---||Bareilly||Young lawyer, 9 friends catering to the oxygen needs of over 100 people daily||Bareilly: As the day breaks, Shanu Warsi, 30, and his nine friends pack their food, fill the water bottles, load empty oxygen cylinders into two SUVs and set out for Ghaziabad and Muradnagar cities from their homes in Sambhal. Once at the oxygen plants, they line up and wait for their turns -- at times for the entire day. After filling the oxygen cylinders, they come back to their city and start distributing them to the needy, for free. At times they make several rounds. Warsi, a lawyer, and his pack of friends have been following this grilling routine for the last one week. They claim that they are fulfilling the oxygen needs of over 100 people daily. “People from Sambhal, Ghaziabad, Hasanpur, Ballia and several other UP districts come to get oxygen here. We even provide home delivery service in case people cannot reach out to us at my residence in Sambhal,” said Warsi, who lost his father a few years ago due to lack of oxygen. He said that the service is primarily being provided to those patients who are suffering from Covid-19 and are in home isolation. Warsi lives in the Jarai Gate area of Chandausi in Sambhal. Speaking to TOI, Warsi said, “Ever since the second wave of Covid-19 struck, I had been thinking of ways to help people who were struggling to make it to hospitals. I decided to rope in a few of my friends. And they agreed. There are two oxygen plants each in Muradnagar and Ghaziabad. And one is in Modinagar. We go there with empty cylinders and bring back the oxygen in it. We wait there for several hours. At times we stay overnight and return in the morning.” “Back home, we have a token system for patients. But for the critical patients having O2 level 70 or below, a token is not needed. They are given the cylinders right away. Though we do not see Covid reports, but to ensure that the case is genuine, we do check the oxygen saturation of patients,” Warsi said. Warsi added that the service is available free of cost to people at his residence round the clock. The local lawyer said that his father, who was also a social worker, had died 10 years ago due to lack of oxygen. “My father was ill and referred to Moradabad by doctors. I could not arrange an ambulance in time. The ambulance that I got had no oxygen available. He had died on the way,” Warsi told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/young-lawyer-9-friends-catering-to-the-oxygen-needs-of-over-100-people-daily/articleshow/82359764.cms||Maria Khan

---||Pune||Cops intensify vigil on farmhouses to check parties, gatherings||Pune: The Pune police have enhanced their vigil in and around villages bordering the city areas to curb parties or gatherings hosted in violation of the prevailing Covid-19 restrictions. The move comes after the Uttamnagar police raided a farmhouse at Kudaje village near the Khadakwasla dam on the night of April 28 and arrested nine persons for indulging in a party with hired women dancers. The police then seized the music equipment, a large number of liquor bottles, some cash and other valuables from the farmhouse. “There are many farmhouses and other such establishments on Sinhagad Road, in the vicinity of Warje, Chandani Chowk and Uttamnagar. They are pretty close to Pune,” said deputy commissioner of police (Zone III) Pournima Gaikwad. “The Wednesday night’s party was raided based on a tip-off. We have intensified our vigil in these villages to avert such illegal parties and gatherings,” she added. Police have intensified patrolling in these far flung areas and told villagers to report any suspicious movements or if hear loud music from such farmhouses. “The local police stations have tapped the majority of the farmhouses located in these areas and have asked them to not allow any parties there,” said Gaikwad. “Such illegal parties defy the lockdown orders issued by the government and can spread Covid among the people who attend it,” she said. A local resident from Shivane village near NDA told TOI, “There are farmhouses along with the Mutha river as well as near the hill. Affluent people from the city visit these farm houses, even during lockdowns, to party.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cops-intensify-vigil-on-farmhouses-to-check-parties-gatherings/articleshow/82360312.cms||---

Chehak Bansal, a student of Bachelors in Business administration from Simon Fraser University, British Columbia, Canada who had planned to go in May said, “I enrolled myself last year in September, but due to lockdown, it was deferred to January, even my visa formalities got delayed, as the Canadian embassy was slow in processing and I received my visa in March. I planned to travel in May, due to the cancellation of flights, I have rescheduled my flight in June.” A resident of Model Town, Chehak said, “My first semester began in January. The second semester will be starting next week with online classes.” Rishav, a student of public relationship course at Canadore College Scarborough, Ontario, said, “I was about to book my flight but after this news, I will be attending my classes online. My classes will begin on May 6. Now, I will go in June. I was excited to go and attend classes from there, but now with the rising of cases, we have to wait.” Ritish, another student who will continue Computer and Mobile electronics course from Lambton College in Mississauga, said, “I had my flight booked for April 29 with Air India, but now they have extended it with no extra cost. The rescheduled flights will be updated.

---||Chandigarh||Class XII students demand CBSE to at least announce exam dates, expedite results||LUDHIANA: Had it not been postponed, Class XII Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) students would have SAT for examinations from May 4 to June 10. Instead, worried students are writing to CBSE, urging it to conduct exams at the earliest to avoid delayed entry into colleges. Nipun Sharma, a student of Class XII of Bhartiya Vidya Mandir School in Kitchlu Nagar said, “Since board exams have now been pushed to June, there will be a domino effect — entrance exams will be pushed back too, and thus a delay in admission processes as well. This has affected my preparations. It will also be difficult for students who had their career plans in place and were hoping to start their journeys at some of the best universities in India or abroad.” For Nipun the biggest problem though is the fact that he will be short-changed when it comes to a number of attempts, as in the case of JEE, for instance, one can appear till the age of 19. Pranav Mehra student of Class XII of BCM Arya School in Shastri Nagar, said, “Once the situation gets stable, CBSE should conduct the exams. It should at least announce the dates and expedite results.” Prabhnoor Kaur Dhaliwal, a student of Class XII from DPS Khanna, said, “We have been taking online classes the entire year and it has affected not only our physical health but also mental health. All our grades have gone down this year due to online learning. I had already started my preparations thinking that the exams will be held in March. Now, I have slowed down my fast-paced preparation. However, there still is no time to lose. With more time to practice, the competition is likely to increase too. I want to get at least 90% marks, as I am aiming for Panjab University in Chandigarh.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/class-xii-students-demand-cbse-to-at-least-announce-exam-dates-expedite-results/articleshow/82364042.cms||Mehak Jain
---||Chandigarh||Bengal result vindicates stand of farmers: Kisan Morcha||Bathinda: The West Bengal assembly poll results have vindicated the stand of farmers in a clear rejection of the divisive communal politics of the -BJP, according to Sanyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), which is spearheading the protests against the Narendra Modi-led government’s three farm laws. The umbrella body of agitating farmer unions said at a time when the country was facing a crisis in terms of its crumbling healthcare infrastructure “due to lack of planning and innocent citizens falling prey to the callous attitude of this government”, the BJP had tried to spin its communal polarisation agenda as the main issue confronting voters. “The protesting farmers have proven convincingly that BJP’s communal polarisation agenda is unacceptable; this is a unified struggle of citizens to not only protect their livelihood but also the secular fabric of the country. Our campaign with state assembly voters asking them to punish BJP stands vindicated. BJP’s efforts not to make the anti-farmer agri-marketing laws and the anti-worker labour codes as election issues have failed. We congratulate the citizens of West Bengal for responding in our support,” the Morcha said in a statement on Sunday evening. “We now appeal to farmers from all over the country to strengthen their resistance and join the movement in greater numbers. This movement will continue to spread the democratic values that our Constitution espouses and will further strengthen itself till our demands are fulfilled,” the Kisan Morcha said. The BJP should listen to the mandate of people in different states, which includes the sentiment of farmers, and immediately repeal the three agricultural laws and give a legal guarantee to the minimum support price (MSP), the SKM said. “We are again clarifying that this agitation will not end until our demands are met. At the same time, the social boycott of the BJP leaders and their allies will continue. The government, instead of making peasants and workers their enemies, should fight against the coronavirus pandemic and the livelihood and economic crises engulfing the country.” The nine-member core committee of the Kisan Morcha on Sunday mourned the sudden death of young activist Momita Basu, who had come to the farmers’ dharna from West Bengal. Basu, who was active at the protest sites, was the first Covid casualty at the farmers’ protests. The leaders said at a kisan conference held at Noorpur-Bedi in Ropar, Punjab students’ union state president Ranveer Singh Randhawa, state senior vice-president Hardeep Kaur Kotla, Kirti Kisan Morcha leaders Bir Singh, Jagmandeep Singh Padhi and Rupinder Sandoya, Mistry Mazdoor Union leader Tarsem Singh Jatpur and singer Pamma Dumewal had been booked by the Punjab Police. A few days ago, the Moga Police had also registered a case against Sukhjinder Maheshri and Vicky Maheshri, both farmer leaders. Punjab government should stop disturbing the struggles of the people and cancel all cases lodged against the peasant leaders, otherwise, farmers will take this fight ahead, the Kisan Morcha said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bengal-result-vindicates-stand-of-farmers-kisan-morcha/articleshow/82360315.cms||---

The young men not only carried the Hindu woman's bier to the crematorium but also performed the last rites. The woman - in her 30s - had died of "fever and stomach ache" and her family was too scared to participate in the funeral, fearing she succumbed to "Covid-like symptoms".The incident took place in Indira colony of Gulab Baadi area under Katghar police limits in Moradabad district on Friday. The noble act was caught on camera and a purported video has gone viral on social media platforms.The woman’s husband, a daily labourer, said, “My wife complained of stomach ache. So, I rushed her to a nearby health facility. Doctors gave her medicine and an injection."" But, there was no improvement. Her condition then worsened and she died. They did not conduct any Covid test. We are poor people. We don't understand these things much.”The husband further said, “When I informed about her death to my family, relatives and a few neighbours, no one came forward to help me. They ostracised us fearing it to be a case of Covid-19 death. I was feeling miserable.""Seeing my helpless situation, my Muslim neigbours came forward and carried my wife’s bier to the cremation ground. They even helped me perform the last rites.”The woman was cremated at a ground located adjacent to Ramganga.One of the Muslim men said, "We saw our neighbour struggling. He was alone.

---||Kolkata||Star candidates steal the show for TMC, but fail to shine for BJP in poll battle||Kolkata: Non-career politicians in the Assembly elections have fared exceedingly well in TMC. The same, however, can’t be said about those in BJP. Excepting Tollywood actors Saayoni Ghosh, Sayantika Banerjee and Koushani Mukherjee — who lost against designer-turned-Bengal BJP Mohila Morcha president Agnimitra Paul in Asansol South, BJP’s Niladri Sekhar Dana in Bankura and heavyweight competitor Mukul Roy in Krishnanagar North respectively — all celebs from sports and films fielded by TMC emerged victorious. TMC’s winning Tollywood brigade includes director Raj Chakrabarty, singer Aditi Munshi, actors Kanchan Mallick and June Malliah. Pitted against another star contestant – BJP’s Anjana Basu – actress Lovely Maitra of TMC won in Sonarpur Dakshin. “My priority will be to look into Covid management. Acting in serials will be a second priority for me now,” Lovely said. Even actor Soham Chakraborty, who had lost the Barjora seat in 2016, won the Chandipur seat against BJP’s Pulak Kanti Guria. Director Raj Chakrabarty, who contested from the tough Barrackpore seat, won against BJP’s Chandramani Shukla. Singer Aditi Munshi won against BJP’s Samik Bhattacharya from the Rajarhat-Gopalpur constituency. If June won against BJP’s Shamit Dash in Medinipore, Kanchan got the better of BJP’s Prabir Kumar Ghosal in Uttarpara. In 2016, Ghosal was in TMC. “Now is the time for me to work in my constituency to fight the second wave of Covid,” said Kanchan, who has finished dubbing for two web series after polling of his constituency was over. “Currently, shooting is very restricted. If we can maintain health protocol, we will be able to tide over the Covid crisis and get life back to normalcy,” he added. Except Hiran Chatterjee, all actors who joined BJP this year, put up a poor show. Hiran was earlier with the TMC’s youth wing before joining the BJP on February 18. The actor won in Kharagpur Sadar against TMC’s Pradip Sarkar. In the 2019 bye-polls, Sarkar had won from this seat. “I want to work for the people,” Hiran told reporters. The nominations of many first-time celeb candidates had caused some degree of heart burn inside the BJP. On January 30, actor Rudranil Ghosh, along with five rebel leaders of TMC, had flown off to Delhi in a chartered flight to meet Union home minister Amit Shah in Delhi to join the party. But his electoral flight didn’t take off from the Bhowanipore seat. On February 17, Yash Dasgupta and Papiya Adhikari had joined BJP. Yash was defeated by TMC’s Swati Khandoker in Chandipur. Papiya lost against TMC’s Pulak Roy in Uluberia South. In March, three Tollywood heroines — Srabanti Chatterjee, Paayel Sarkar and Tanushree Chakrabarty — had joined the saffron brigade. But they all lost to TMC rivals — Kalipada Mondal in Shyampur, Partha Chatterjee in Behala West and Ratna Chatterjee, estranged wife of ex-mayor Sovan Chatterjee, in Behala East. In 2019, 11 actors, including Parno Mittra, had joined the BJP in Delhi. Parno lost to TMC’s Tapas Roy who had won from Baranagar twice. “Tollywood’s BJP brigade comprising Papiya Adhikari, Rudranil, Parno, Srabanti, Paayel, Yash and Anjana has lost. I wonder if people voted against the party symbol or the celeb candidates who were nominated. It’s time to introspect,” said a celeb BJP leader who was denied a ticket. Cricketer Manoj Tiwary and footballer Bidesh Bose have won from Shibpur and Uluberia East constituencies respectively. However, former cricketer Ashok Dinda of BJP lost to TMC’S Sangram Kumar Dolai from Moyna.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/star-candidates-steal-the-show-for-tmc-but-fail-to-shine-for-bjp-in-poll-battle/articleshow/82361276.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

There 14 to 16 crematoriums in and around areas of Bowenpally, Karkhana, Trimulgherry and Marredpally.  “Crematorium managements are collecting Rs 20,000 to Rs 25,000 per Covid-19-related cremation towards expenditure for firewood and other purposes,” according to a SCB former vice-president, Jampana Pratap. SCB senior superintendent (SWM), M Devender, said there have been no issues related to cremation in Secunderabad Cantonment. Though Covid-19 cases have risen, the death rate in Secunderabad Cantonment has been low compared to Greater Hyderabad. “The implementation of safety guidelines has been strict in Cantonment areas and people found positive are immediately either admitted to hospitals or are strictly following home quarantine norm. This could be the reason for low death rate here,” said SCB official. Replying to a query, an SCB official said that the death certificates related to the Covid deaths related are, based on the death certificates, issued by the hospitals managements concerned and collecting charges as we are collecting for normal death certificates. An average, three to five requisitions either per week or two weeks, used to receive from the applicants, urging for death certificates, added a staffer in SCB health and sanitation wing, who is processing requisitions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/citizens-complain-of-high-cremation-charges/articleshow/82361278.cms||Sunil Mungara

Some of them have already decided to close their factories. Several video clips of businessmen urging others also to close their factories for a few days are doing rounds on social media. According to Darshan Dawar, president of Knitwear Club, “Several of our friends and prominent industrialists of Ludhiana have lost their lives due to Covid-19. There is no other alternative other than to impose lockdown. So we have decided that we will keep our factories closed for a week at least from Monday till May 10. We have already given a call to our association members and garment and textile industry to support this lockdown and protect themselves, their family members and workers.” According to Tarun Jain Bawa, president of Bahadurke Textile and Knitwear Association, “Covid-19 is truly turning deadly, the risk for everyone has increased manifold. Therefore, I appeal to all to voluntarily impose a lockdown on ourselves — close factories for a minimum of five days at least. This will help in breaking the chain and make a huge difference.” According to Abhinav Sehgal, joint secretary of Ludhiana Business Forums, “In the last few days, several known businessmen and traders of Ludhiana have lost their lives due to coronavirus. In wake of such high number of cases and deaths on daily basis, despite safety measures being taken by us, we have decided to close our factory for a week at least. We will now open for business only next week, that too if the situation improves.

A team of local police had questioned him at his residence on Friday afternoon. Police have now booked the woman who had alleged that her daughter was being harassed by the boy under abetment of suicide charges. Amroha’s Bachhrawan station house officer Pankaj Verma said, “During the investigation it came to the fore that the woman had filed several similar complaints against other persons to extort money from them. Therefore, police did not register any case against the boy.” Police also learnt that the woman had threatened to approach higher authorities and get the boy’s family members behind bars. The family alleged that the boy was so frightened and stressed out that he was driven to hang himself. On the basis of their complaint, the woman has been booked under IPC section 306 (abetment of suicide). “The woman is yet to be arrested. A probe is on,” said Verma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/woman-booked-for-abetment-of-suicide-after-13-yr-old-boy-is-found-hanging/articleshow/82359778.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Hyderabad||Group of 60 feeds Covid-affected within society||HYDERABAD: With several gated communities becoming clusters for Covid-19, a group of 60 women at Meenakshi’s Sky Lounge in Hitech City have developed an in-house food delivery system for families affected by Covid-19. In August last year, the group from the gated community with 400 flats started this initiative to cook and deliver home-cooked food for those in home quarantine within their society. The initiative is run on the lines of Sanjha Chula, a concept from the northern part of the country, in which women share a common tandoor to bake flatbread and take turns to share their home-cooked meals with families within the community. Under this initiative, as soon as a Covid-19 case is reported, a list of lunch and dinner slots is prepared on a common online platform which is filled by group members. “A basic meal plan for lunch and dinner is crafted for two weeks and food is delivered at the doorstep of those who are in need, at their specified timings,” said Dhanashree Murugkar, one of the group’s members. So far, the group who call themselves Helping Hands, have helped nearly 50 families within the housing society. “Under the initiative, we communicate with families to understand their food preferences, spice levels and according to that, slots for cooking and delivery are divided among group members. We make an additional portion with our meals for the families when our slot is due,” said Harleen Multani Gajria, the brains behind the initiative. The group’s service came as a boon during the peak of Covid-19 and continues to support affected families even during the second wave. “In March-end when my husband tested positive, we reached out to them and they served all three meals to our family for two weeks,” said Ponmani Guhan, a resident of the community. She too joined the initiative after her home was free of infection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/group-of-60-feeds-covid-affected-within-society/articleshow/82361101.cms||Preeti Biswas

The state received its first Oxygen Express, at Sanathnagar Goods Complex in Hyderabad, which brought 124.26 tonnes of liquid medical oxygen. This oxygen will be distributed among hospitals across the state in order to treat critical Covid-19 patients. The oxygen was received in five filled tankers, which were sent for filling to Angul, Odisha from Secunderabad on April 28. As part of the initiative to supply oxygen to various states in need, owing to the ongoing Covid-19 crisis, Oxygen Express covered a distance of 1,334 km in 32 hours, in a green corridor identified by the railways for the uninterrupted movement of these trains. The train travelled at an average speed of 42 km/h, considering the safety aspects regarding carrying liquid oxygen – a cryogenic cargo. Additionally, route mapping was done to ensure the movement was smooth with regards to curves and adequate height clearance. “By operating Oxygen Express trains on the request of various state governments all over the country, Indian Railways is providing a safe, secure, hassle-free and fast transportation to various parts pan-India. I also appreciate the Secunderabad Division for the prompt operation of these trains without any detention,” said Gajanan Mallya, general manager, SCR. He also advised all divisions to be proactive to meet the needs of any state government for these trains. The second Oxygen Express from Telangana, carrying empty tankers, has already reached the loading station and will arrive soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/oxygen-express-reaches-hyd-with-124-tonnes-of-o2/articleshow/82361061.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Lack of equipment in hospitals hinders Covid-19 treatment||HYDERABAD: With doctors increasingly relying on HRCT tests, Gandhi Hospital and Osmania General Hospital (OGH) are the only two hospitals in the government sector in the state with the equipment to run these tests. As a result, other designated Covid-19 centres are relying largely on X-rays and oximeters to assess patients’ conditions. This, as HRCT is now being considered an important diagnosis tool to understand the extent of damage to a patient’s lungs. At King Koti Hospital, which currently has 360 patients, sources informed pulse oximeters were malfunctioning most of the time. “There is no HRCT machine here and since so many patients are coming in with severe symptoms but have negative Covid-19 reports, it is very difficult to treat them. For this, medicines and equipment are required in emergency. The situation is such that two intensive care units are being managed with a single pulse oximeter and there are BP monitors and ECG machines that don’t work,” a senior resident from the hospital said. At TIMS, no availability of HRCT is a hindrance to treatment. “We are getting patients who come with HRCT report which they have got from outside but with a negative Covid-19 report. In such cases, an HRCT is considered essential, but we are managing with an X-ray. X-ray, however, has less sensitivity,” admitted a resident doctor from TIMS. Also, an official complaint submitted to health authorities by resident doctors from King Koti Hospital discussed the non sharing-of workload by senior doctors which is affecting the treatment. “The permanent doctors have been absenting themselves from duties in wards and ICUs for the last 9 months. They have never done bedside rounds regardless of census in ICU and regardless of seriousness of patient’s condition. If insisted and asked to come, they just come ask the number of patients & senior residents and leave without informing anybody. They do not even take responsibility to change patient’s treatment or counsel the relatives about the patient’s prognosis,” the letter further read.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/lack-of-equipment-in-hosps-hinders-covid-19-treatment/articleshow/82360853.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Hyderabad||Cases in bordering states a concern for Telangana officials||HYDERABAD: Telangana, with over 80,000 active Covid-19 cases, is now among the top 15 states in terms of active infection. It is also among the top 15 in the country for cumulative infections as the second wave of the pandemic has hit the state hard. The positivity rate in neighbouring states is also a concern for authorities who are battling to contain infections. Among neighbouring states, Maharashtra currently reporting a positivity rate of around 20 per cent, Chhattisgarh reporting around 25 per cent and Karnataka reporting a 24 per cent positivity rate has become a concern for Telangana authorities. The state currently had a positivity rate of around nine per cent in July last year but this number has jumped to around 10 per cent during the second wave. Neighbours Andhra Pradesh too have a positivity rate of 10 per cent, further highlighting the need to closely monitor states around Telangana. Nizamabad, which is on the border with Maharashtra, had become a hotspot but infections seemed to be plateauing. “A lot depends on the behaviour of people, especially in the absence of serious restrictions barring a night curfew,” a top state official said. The official said that while many were observed to have dropped their guard before the second wave, the government’s appeal to remain cautious, especially during festivities around the time of the second wave led to more disciplined behaviour among people. He said that this was observed during Holi celebrations. Going by data in the health department’s bulletins, at least 22 districts, including Hyderabad, are reporting a higher number of cases during the second wave as compared to the numbers recorded during the first wave. Along with Hyderabad (GHMC), many districts are reporting positivity rates between eight and ten per cent. However, experts said that if the active case load remains stable and not rise at an alarming rate, the situation can be brought under control with strict discipline measures. “The recovery rate is still doing well. If the recovery rate rate drops and positivity rate also rises higher, then the situation will become worrisome. People need to restrict their habits and stay safe,” said ASCI centre for health director, Dr Subodha Kandamuthan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cases-in-bordering-states-a-concern-for-t-officials/articleshow/82360842.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Journalist Shashi Baliga loses mth-long battle to Covid||Mumbai: Covid claimed yet another victim from the ranks of journalism in Mumbai on Sunday. Veteran journalist Shashi Baliga, formerly of the TOI (Features Editor, The Metropolis on Saturday and Editor, Femina), lost a month-long battle in hospital with the disease. She was 68 and is survived by her husband, Anand, daughter Shreya, and son-in-law Rajiv. In a career that spanned more than 35 years, Shashi Baliga began with the Magna Group and ended with The Hindustan Times, where too she was the Features Editor. A fine writer who continued as an independent journalist after leaving the organisation, she had columns in several newspapers, both in India and abroad. She was particularly in demand for her meticulous editing skills, and her sharp insights into Bollywood made her an invaluable and serious contributor to the arts and entertainment segment. A great believer in giving back to the profession, Baliga was a valued member of the faculty in several city journalism schools, including the Xavier Institute of Communication and St. Pauls Institute of Communication Education. The outpouring of grief on social media on Sunday is testament to the impact she had on journalism students, with her calm, firm, wry style. But it was her work as Executive Director of Literature Live, the city’s premier literature festival, that displayed the full sweep of her abilities as writer, organiser, co-ordinator and conduit to some of the biggest names in the literary world, globally. In fact, in her death, the organisation has received a double blow, just recovering as it is from the passing away of its founder in March. Her passing away has been received with great shock by members of the fraternity because she was, though reluctant to draw attention to herself, an unfailingly mature voice of reason in these fractious and polarised times. She leaves behind a raft of friends, admirers and students to mourn her loss.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-journalist-shashi-baliga-loses-mth-long-battle-to-covid/articleshow/82362083.cms||---

There was a strangulation mark on his neck. The body had partially decomposed and swelled, indicating that the murder had taken place at least two days back,” Krityanand Nagar police station SHO Mithilesh Kumar said. Anil, who was the former state president of LJP’s scheduled tribe (ST) cell, had been kidnapped from the residence of a woman named Dilara Khatoon near the district circuit house at OC Colony under Khajanchi Hat police station area in Purnia around 7pm on April 29 for Rs10 lakh ransom. Police said his family members had already paid the ransom amount to the kidnappers. They said at least four ransom calls were made from Anil’s cellphone to his family. His family informed the police on April 30 alleging that he had been kidnapped. The spot where the body was found is around 15km away from the place from where he was kidnapped. Kumar said it was around 5am when the body was recovered. Purnia SP Daya Shankar told TOI over phone that three persons, including Dilara, have been arrested in the case. “It was on their confessional statements that police came to know that Anil had been murdered. Later, they told the police about the location where the body was buried,” he said. Shankar said at least four calls were made to Anil’s family for Rs 10 lakh ransom after his kidnapping. “The family members clandestinely paid Rs10 lakh ransom to the kidnappers without informing the police. It has surfaced that Anil was murdered much before the ransom was paid as kidnappers had fear of getting caught,” the SP said. “The xxact reasons behind his kidnapping and murder would be clear soon after a few more persons are arrested. At present, contradictory statements are coming up. However, prima facie police strongly suspect a love affair might be the prime reason behind the incident,” he said. Khajanchi Hat police station SHO Sunil Kumar Mandal said besides Dilara, Chunmun Kumar of Majlispur under Palasi police station area and Mohammad Sakib alias Rahul of Korathbari village of Madhubani outpost under Khajanchi Hat police station area in Purnia were arrested. “Anil had left home on a bike around 2pm on April 29. After he didn’t return till late night, his family members started searching for him. It was around 5pm on April 30 that his family informed the police about kidnapping and lodged an FIR with Khajanchi Hat police station,” he said. Meanwhile, LJP spokesperson Ashraf Ansari said besides being the former state party president of ST cell, Anil had contested assembly elections on the party's symbol from Manihari in 2015 and 2020. "Anil had contested the last year's assembly election too. All party cells are at present dissolved," he added. “LJP head Chirag Paswan had twice spoken to Purnia SP, who said they had tracked Anil’s location and will recover him soon,” he said, adding his murder is the police and state government’ failure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ljp-state-st-cells-former-chief-killed/articleshow/82359807.cms||Debashish Karmakar

While replying to a petition seeking deferment of counting of votes cast during four phases of panchayat elections in UP, senior advocate Aishwarya Bhati, appearing on behalf of the SEC, had on Saturday assured the court that all pandemic norms will be strictly followed. The petition had claimed that over 700 teachers lost their lives to Covid-19 soon after returning from election duties. The apex court had refused to put a stay on the counting after the SEC promised all the measures to check the further spread of the deadly virus. But, the scenes outside most of the 829 counting centers were nothing short of chaotic the next morning. Hundreds of curious supporters of panchayat poll candidates thronged the booths at the daybreak. Some of them were without masks, while the others had ‘ganchas’ which doubled up as masks. At several districts, including Firozabad, police had to use force to control the crowd. In Baghpat and Muzaffarnagar too, policemen chased people from near the counting booths. “It is practically not possible to keep the crowd away. Passes were issued to at least 2,000 candidates and agents at each counting centre. Out of them, over 500 were allowed to enter the counting centre,” a senior police official on the condition of anonymity said. The teachers unions, which had announced to boycott the counting of votes, retreated after the apex court refused to put a stay. Earlier, spokesperson of Akhil Bharatiya Rashtriya Shaikshik Mahasangh, Virendra Mishra, had said, “This decision (to boycott) was taken on the call of teachers as we were flooded with requests to save their lives. They are very scared. Experts have said that Covid’s peak will arrive in May. All of us will boycott election duty if it is not postponed.” But on Saturday evening, the union’s organizational secretary Shiv Shankar Singh said, “Those involved in the vote-counting exercise have been asked to report two hours in advance at counting centres for taking an antigen test. We have been assured Covid protocols will be in place for our safety and security.” Voting for the four-phased rural elections ended Thursday with an average turnout of 73%. Till the last reports came in, BJP-supported candidates were leading in most zila panchayat ward seats, followed by SP and BSP-backed candidates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/up-panchayat-elections-pandemic-rules-go-out-of-the-window-during-counting-too-cops-use-force-at-several-booths/articleshow/82359791.cms||---

---||Kolkata||PK Sarkar: Kishor’s poli-tricks work magic again||While Mamata Banerjee has been the indisputable star of the Bengal polls, there’s one man who is in the spotlight for steering the ‘khela’ her way — poll strategist Prashant Kishor. Amid the pre-results buzz about BJP’s surge, Kishor had cheekily declared that the saffron party would struggle to get a triple digit score. On Sunday, that ‘audacity’ became reality. It only added to Kishor’s halo, which has only grown after he stage-managed not just Mamata’s win but also helped build Brand Stalin in Tamil Nadu. However Kishor, who first acquired the reputation of poll Midas after playing a role in the campaigns of Modi in 2014 and Nitish Kumar in 2015, dashed the hopes of other politicians who might have hoped to rope him in, by declaring: “I am quitting and I don’t want to do this anymore.” So what, exactly, did Kishor do? The Bengal tally may suggest that the Trinamool scored an easy victory, but the situation had not looked favourable in 2019 when Mamata turned to the former UN consultant for help. The BJP’s odds-defying success in winning 18 Lok Sabha seats — it lost another 3 by narrow margins — had given the Trinamool boss evidence of her vulnerability in the face of corruption allegations and resentment against the high-handedness of local Trinamool functionaries as well a growing perception that she was “appeasing “ minorities. PK, as he is called, took the repair job earnestly by launching the “Didi Ke Bolo” (talk to Didi) hotline for people to convey their grievances to the chief minister, which would otherwise have been smothered at the local level. Simultaneously, a 60 day-long outreach , “Duare Sarkar” (government at your doorstep), was launched to ensure that the benefits of government schemes were delivered at the panchayat and municipal level, with members of Kishor’s team monitoring efforts of government departments. These twin efforts helped Mamata change her image of being aloof and project herself as someone ready to make amends. He also attempted to counter the charge that she was appeasing minorities while her attempt to whip up “nativist” sentiments against “outsiders” by flaunting her “daughter of Bengal” credentials reminded people of the strategy that Nitish used against the BJP in 2015 by turning it into a Bihari versus Bahari (outsider) contest. After the successful Bihar campaign, PK, who rechristened his CAG into the more American-sounding I-Political Action Committee, was engaged by the Congress for the UP elections. The effort bombed, with the BJP sweeping the state. He was also involved with the Congress’s Punjab campaign and his contribution in the form of “halke vich Captain (Captain in your locality) has been acknowledged by Punjab CM Amarinder Singh, who hired him as an advisor with the rank of a Cabinet minister. He also spearheaded Jagan Mohan Reddy’s landslide in Andhra Pradesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pk-sarkar-kishors-poli-tricks-work-magic-again/articleshow/82361279.cms||---

With the help of the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), the Gujarat government will fund over Rs 1,072 crore to control the damage to the state’s natural ecosystem. Under the ‘Gujarat ecosystem restoration programme’, the JBIC will provide Rs 905 crore as soft loan at a mere 0.4% interest rate while the Gujarat government will fund Rs 177 crore from the state resources. The state forest and environment department has launched the project in 21 of the 33 districts, based on various assessments. Rajiv Gupta, additional chief secretary, forest and environment department, said: “Despite the impact of Covid-19 on various activities, we have initiated the ecosystem restoration programme with the reputed agency.” Gupta added: “We have initiated various ecosystem restoration activities in 21 affected districts. For instance, there will be the redevelopment of mangroves in coastal districts. Mangroves control salinity ingress and the damage to local agriculture.” The official went on to say, “In the first phase, we have identified 11 key wetlands and started ecosystem restoration work at eight major wetland sites.” He further said: “We are focusing on active local community participation to restore wetlands as we have to ensure that locals don’t damage the ecosystem and become part of conservation.” According to an assessment of the department, 9,179 sq km area of forest land has been affected. Under the ecosystem restoration project, using scientific methods, forest restoration work has started and significant improvement is expected in the ecosystem in the next few months. “We have learnt that instances of man-animal clashes have increased due to various reasons,” Gupta said. “In this new programme, we are focusing on various activities to prevent man-animal conflicts. Due to the damage to the local ecosystem, animals venture into human populated areas.” He said that restoration activities in the designated forest areas will reduce the conflicts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/with-japan-aid-guj-to-heal-ecosystem/articleshow/82360324.cms||Kapil Dave

Srinivas went home from the hospital and at around 1 pm but left the house, informing his wife he was going out for a while. “Srinivas went to the signal at Ramagundam municipal corporation and threw himself under an RTC bus travelling from Dharmaram to Godavarikhani. Srinivas died on the spot and we have registered a case under section 174 of CrPC,” the CI said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/32-yr-old-ends-life-after-doc-confirms-covid/articleshow/82360926.cms||---

The current vaccine stock data shows that the state has around 90,000 doses in hand and has halted supply to private hospitals. Administering first doses to people will be a tough call for the government till vaccine supplies from Centre improves. The state government had written to the Union government to increase the supply of vaccines to Telangana, especially after it opened the vaccination drive to 18-44-year-olds. So far, close to 48 lakh persons have been administered the vaccine in the state. Of them, just over six lakh have been administered both doses while over 41 lakh are due for their second dose. As per the state’s records, close to 42 lakh have been administered the Covidshield vaccine while just over six lakh have received Covaxin. The highest number of doses have been administered in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), with 6.3 lakh doses administered. Of these. 1.3 lakh persons were administered Covaxin doses. Verification by TOI revealed that barring one or two major groups, most private hospitals have no clarity as to how they should go about to procure vaccines directly from the companies. “We have to wait and see. Until then (till vaccines are procured), the vaccination drive for any age group will be difficult at private centres across the state,” a top officials from a leading private hospital said. Providing clarification on the administration of vaccine doses, public health director Dr Srinivas Rao said that while the same vaccine has to be taken for the second dose, it can be taken at any centre. “There is no need for a person taking the first dose at a particular centre, either government or private, to take the second dose too at the same centre. They can go to any centre where vaccines are available,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/first-doses-likely-to-be-on-hold-till-state-receives-more-vaccines/articleshow/82360813.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Amid rapidly rising daily new cases of infection and a highly strained health infrastructure, many states are contemplating stringent restrictions in movement. Nearly 10 states and UTs have imposed some form of restrictions.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); The health ministry has already suggested a strict lockdown in at least around 150 districts with high positivity rate beyond 15%. Officials in the ministry and the Covid-19 taskforce are also concerned about high positivity among returnees from Kumbh and in the absence of lockdown, they can be potential super-spreaders in Tier 2 and 3 cities. On Sunday, 3.62 lakh new cases were registered from across the country with 10 states accounting for over 70% of the cases. These include Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Karnataka, Kerala, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan. With more than 3 lakh daily cases of Covid-19 for over last ten days, hospitals, morgues and crematoriums in many states and UTs, including those in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Karnataka are overwhelming as patients and their families are scrambling to find hospital beds, oxygen support and essential medicines.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); However, the Centre is concerned that a nationwide lockdown will have a devastating impact on the economy as it will lead to job losses and particularly impact migrant labour. While giving a free hand to states to decide parameters of restrictions, the Centre has stressed on the urgent need to ramp up health infrastructure by roping in small nursing homes and hospitals for augmenting the medical infrastructure. Besides, it suggested that Covid Care Centres to be opened in hotels, stadiums etc, as per the protocol. Amid some reports suggesting that scientists working on the SUTRA model cautioned in March about the second wave but attention was not paid to it, the scientists said the reports are “incorrect”. “A meeting was called on 2nd April to seek our inputs by one of the very senior officers of the government coordinating the national pandemic response. We indicated that the SUTRA model predicted the second wave to peak by the third week of April and to stay most likely around 1 lakh daily cases. Clearly the model predictions in this instance were incorrect…,” the team of scientists said in a statement. They also said that a mathematical model can only predict future with some certainty so long as virus dynamics and its transmissibility don’t change substantially over time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-centre-unlikely-to-impose-nationwide-lockdown/articleshow/82362817.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||Amritsar||Chandigarh: Shed ego, farm leaders tell BJP after party’s loss in Bengal||BATHINDA/KURUKSHETRA: The mood was upbeat at farmer protest sites on Sunday over BJP losing the West Bengal assembly polls. Protesters said they could not have hoped for a better result than the saffron party failing to grab power in the state and that the election result was no less than “sanjivani” (panacea) for the protesters. They said the poll outcome should make the saffron party shed its “egoistic approach”. One of the protester's justified the loss by saying: “As you sow, so shall you reap.” The farmers protesting against the three farm laws had campaigned against the BJP in the run-up to the assembly polls. They had visited West Bengal, Assam and Kerala to campaign against the BJP, but it is West Bengal where they put a lot of energy into making fervent appeals to the electorate. “It is a big blow not only for the party, but for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who spent a lot of time campaigning in West Bengal and behaved like an irresponsible leader with his body language. Now his government should come back to ground and resume dialogue process with farmers and listen to them by shedding its ego,” said farm leader Rakesh Tikait while speaking to TOI over telephone. Farm leader Balbir Singh Rajewal said farmers deserved a pat on the back for contributing to the BJP’s defeat in Bengal. “BJP leaders were making claims on what difference farmers will make in West Bengal. If the BJP has lost, it is because of the farmers who went to Bengal and made people aware of farm laws and how these laws will affect every section of society,” said Rajewa. BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) president Joginder Singh Ugrahan said the poll outcome would have a direct bearing on the farmers’ struggle. “As the BJP has lost ground in West Bengal, we feel the central government may shed its ego which we are waiting for long. Poll results have made it clear that farm struggle is for legitimate demands and BJP must pay heed to it,” said Ugrahan. BKU (Charuni) president Gurnam Singh Charuni said the countdown to the BJP government’s end had begun with the loss in West Bengal. “Next year, we have elections in UP and farmers of the entire nation will campaign in UP and remove the BJP government from there as well,” said Charuni. “This (Modi) is (a) Rajhatthi Raja (intransigent ruler)... Today, we want to tell RSS that there is still time to remove this raja and avoid deaths of innocent farmers on the roads. Be cautious, else there would be no name of BJP in the country,” said Charuni.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/shed-ego-farm-leaders-tell-bjp-after-partys-loss-in-bengal/articleshow/82368466.cms||---

According to an FIR filed with Sector 21 police, the accused Yogesh Patel, resident of Swaminarayanpark society in Naroda, had married Divya Dabhi, resident of Kolvada village in Gandhinagar two years ago after they fell in love with each other. Around one and a half months ago, Dabhi had left Patil’s home following a domestic dispute and began staying with her widow mother and a 14-year-old sister and started working at a mall in Sector 25. On Sunday afternoon, Dabhi’s colleague Pratikhsa Chavda saw Patil standing outside the mall. After a while, he called up Dabhi and told her that he wanted to meet her. When Dabhi went out, he picked a fight with her and began abusing her. He suddenly took out a knife from his pocket with which he stabbed Dabhi on her stomach and neck. This was spotted by Chavda who rushed out but Patil fled from there on his motorcycle. Chavda then called up cops who rushed there and took Dabhi to Gandhinagar Civil hospital where she was declared brought dead by doctors. Sector 21 police of Gandhinagar registered a complaint of murder against Patil and began an investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/man-kills-wife-on-road-in-gnagar/articleshow/82360331.cms||---

The woman sustained burn injuries on her forehead, the Kondhwa police said. The injured woman (37) lodged a complaint with the Kondhwa police later in the day. The woman was taken to a hospital and was discharged in the evening, police said. Sub-inspector Chaitali Gapat of the Kondhwa police told TOI, “The woman works as a domestic help at a society in Pisoli and Dhamukh works as a painter at construction sites. The couple has two children.” “The husband and the wife were having domestic issues over some trivial reasons. Her husband, suspecting infidelity, kept asking her where she worked. However, the woman refused to divulge any information about her workplace,” Gapat said. On Saturday morning, according to the police, Dhamukh took a bottle of acid-like substance, asked his wife to sit pillion on his motorcycle and took her to the Bopdev Ghat. He asked his wife to remove her mask on reaching Bopdev Ghat. As soon as she removed the mask, he threw the liquid on her face. Gapat said, “We have seized the bottle and it will be sent to the forensic laboratory for chemical analysis. The test will ascertain what type of acid it was.” Police registered a case against Dhamukh under sections 326 A (voluntarily causing grievous hurt by use of acid, etc) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/man-suspects-infidelity-throws-acid-like-substance-on-wifes-face/articleshow/82360328.cms||---

Devendra’s condition deteriorated in the morning. He was on oxygen support in the ambulance when he breathed his last. Heart-wrenching visuals of Devendra lying dead in the ambulance and family members trying to calm down his inconsolable wife, who lost consciousness, have surfaced on social media. “We had been waiting here for over an hour but there was no one to attend. We got the registration done and spoke to doctors, who said there is neither any bed nor oxygen available. They (doctors) asked us to take our patient somewhere else,” alleged a relative who had accompanied Singh to the hospital. When contacted, Gyanendra Kumar, principal of the LLRM College claimed the hospital has been swamped with patients but no one has been turned away. “Our emergency has a capacity of 55-50 beds but we have been taking 123-150 patients. We have been administering treatment to patients on the floor. Arrangements may take some time but we have not been denying admission,” Kumar insisted. Hospital officials claimed there is a huge rush of patients since the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic not only from Meerut but neighbouring districts like Muzaffarnagar, Shamli, Saharanpur and NCR and they have been accommodated in the hospital despite limited resources. The LLRM hospital was recently in news following a brawl between junior doctors and sanitation staff over packing of bodies. A mob of sanitation staff had allegedly vandalized hospital property and roughed up some junior doctors during the brawl.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/awaiting-medical-attention-man-dies-in-ambulance-outside-emergency-ward-of-meeruts-hosp/articleshow/82359801.cms||---

TRS candidate Bhagat polled 89,804 while his nearest Congress rival K Jana Reddy secured 70,932 votes. Bharatiya Janata Party, which got 7,676 votes, lost its deposit. The assembly seat fell vacant following the death of TRS MLA Nomula Narasimhaiah and the ruling party fielded his son Nomula Bhagat in the bypoll. TRS delpoyed a large contingent of its leaders, including several ministers and MLAs, at mandal and village level to ensure Bhagat’s victory. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao himself addressed two public meetings in the constituency. Bhagat maintained lead in every round of the counting and was declared winner in the 26th round. The TRS secured of 47.1% of the total votes polled, while Congress got 37.2% and BJP a measly 4%. Over 0.2% voters preferred NOTA. While in 2018 polls, Bhagat's father Narasimhaiah won over Congress candidate Jana Reddy by 7,726 votes, the ruling party improved its victory margin hugely in the byelection. The Telugu Desam Party, which once had a sizeable voter base in the constituency, has been relegated to the fourth place with just 1,714 votes. A total of 41 candidates were in the fray and none of the independents made any mark. Bhagat has attributed his victory to CM K Chandrasekhar Rao's good governance and welfare schemes of the TRS government. Chandrasekhar Rao thanked the people of Nagarjunasagar assembly constituency for electing Bhagat with a big majority. He said the promises made during the electioneering would be fulfilled and he would soon undertake a tour of the constituency along with Bhagat. “Counting has been done as per the Covid-19 safety protocols. Polling personnel and counting agents were allowed into counting halls only after they showed negative RT-PCR test result reports. ECI had directed that no victory rallies should be allowed,” Telangana chief electoral officer Shashank Goel told TOI. Ministers Talasani Srinivas Yadav, Srinivas Goud and other TRS leaders celebrated the Nagarjunasagar victory at the party headquarters in Banjara Hills.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-retains-nagarjunasagar-seat-with-18k-votes-mojo-back-in-ruling-party/articleshow/82362118.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Mumbai||No vaccination in Mumbai for 45+ age grp 4th day in row||Mumbai: For the fourth consecutive day on Monday, the city will not conduct a vaccination drive for the priority population, which comprises those over the age of 45 years and health and frontline workers. A statement issued by the BMC late on Sunday said the drive—which has remained suspended since Friday—was at a standstill as a result of a stockout of both the vaccines provided by the Centre for the priority population. The vaccination drive that began in a limited way for the 18-45 age group will not be affected as it is being accomplished with Covishield shots bought by the state with its own money. The Centre had said on Saturday it would give the state over 23 lakh doses in the first fortnight of May. On Sunday, additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said the BMC had not received any fresh stock in four days. “However, we have got an assurance that fresh stocks are likely to reach us sometime on Monday,’’ he said. “We are preparing to restart the drive for the elderly and others on Tuesday.” At the state level, too, the stocks are depleted, said a senior public health department official. “The state has not received any fresh stock from the Centre since April 26,” the official said. The vaccination drive in the state had gathered momentum in the second fortnight of April, with an average of three lakh people being vaccinated in a day. The figure had almost reached four lakh on one day. State immunisation officer Dr D Patil said the state would be unable to conduct a full-fledged drive on Monday due to lack of stocks. “We are expecting stocks and should be able to restart the drive in a couple of days,” he said. Officials said that using previously received stock, the state had managed to vaccinate 95,535 people on Saturday. Of these, 81,380 were from the 45-plus category while the rest were either healthcare or frontline workers. The state has so far given out 1.63 crore vaccination doses since the drive started on January 16.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/no-vaccination-in-mumbai-for-45-age-grp-4th-day-in-row/articleshow/82362128.cms||---

On Friday afternoon, P Ravi, 50, a TRS corporator of VI ward in Jawahar Nagar Municipal Corporation, raped the woman at her under-construction building when she came to give him the balance amount for construction work, Jawahar Nagar inspector K Panduranga Reddy said. Three years ago, the victim and her husband had purchased 115 square yards of land from Ravi for a little over Rs 7 lakh. “The couple built a room in the plot, but they had to stop the construction of the house abruptly due to some problems caused by locals. Recently, they sought Ravi’s help to complete the house construction for Rs 2 lakh,” the inspector said. The couple paid most of the promised amount as the house construction was almost complete. On Friday, Ravi called the victim to the under-construction house asking her to pay the balance of Rs 10,000 as the work had reached final stages. “The victim alleged that when she reached the house, Ravi also arrived there and he took her inside the house and raped her by closing her mouth with his hand,” the inspector said. Based on the complaint lodged by the victim, police registered a case against the accused under Section 376 of the IPC , SC&ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. “We have arrested P Ravi on Sunday and he will be sent in judicial remand,” the inspector added. (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-corporator-arrested-for-rape/articleshow/82361299.cms||---

Despite a stockout of the free and highly subsidised vaccines given to the 45-plus age group through a central government programme, the youngsters will get the jabs through the state government’s specially purchased stock of three lakh doses of the Covishield vaccine. “We will continue with the drive for this age group on Tuesday,” additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said. The city received 20,000 of the state-procured three lakh doses from Serum Institute of India in Pune. With roughly 2,500 doses to be given out every day, the stock should be sufficient for another five to six days in the city, said BMC officials. The drive for this group started with a tokenism, with fewer than 1,000 shots administered on Saturday, May 1, to mark Maharashtra Day. The total number of vaccinated people in this age group climbed to 3,419 in the city. The Apollo group of hospitals will begin offering Covishield vaccine at Rs 850 for those in the 18-45 age group at its Navi Mumbai hospital on Monday. While the Fortis group of hospitals has started offering vaccines to the 18-45 age group, its three hospitals in the city have not yet made a similar announcement. On Sunday, a BMC update said that 11 people in the 45-plus age group got vaccinated at the BKC Jumbo Centre. The BMC release said vaccination for 93 people in the 45-plus age group was also carried out at the H N Reliance Hospital in Girgaum on Saturday. The BMC has so far given 24 lakh vaccine doses, and 4.9 lakh people have been completely vaccinated with two doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-day-2-for-18-45-age-group-sees-over-2400-get-shots/articleshow/82361313.cms||---
---||Ludhiana||Supporters silent, CM Captain Amarinder Singh and Navjot Singh Sidhu spat grows louder in Jalandhar||JALANDHAR: It has been five days since chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh lashed out at MLA Navjot Singh Sidhu and challenged him to contest from Patiala. Sidhu retorted but till now, only two ministers and one MP have come out openly in support of the chief minister and against Sidhu. Others have remained silent for the most part. The only MLA who tweeted in the CM’s support did not attack Sidhu. This is in stark contrast to the earlier position, when ministers and MLAs would rush to defend Amarinder whenever the opposition attacked him. This silence appears more ominous in view of the fact that the Congress wove its campaign around Amarinder. Despite leading a contingent of MLAs in Punjab, Captain Amarinder Singh appears to be fighting this battle with Sidhu on his own. Silence prevailed even when Sidhu was mounting pressure, seeking to put the CM in the dock on the outcome of the Kotkapura firing case. During a cabinet meeting on April 26, the CM asked ministers why they were not putting up a defence in the face of attacks from the opposition, yet barring two, others maintained a stoic silence. In the wake of ministers’ and MLAs’ silence, Amarinder had to take up cudgels himself and challenge Sidhu to contest from Patiala. Even then, only two ministers - Sadhu Singh Dharamsot and Sunder Sham Arora - questioned Sidhu. Although the Congress has eight Lok Sabha members, only Ravneet Bittu has attacked Sidhu and supported Amarinder. Sultanpur Lodhi MLA Navtej Singh Cheema has been the only MLA to tweet in support of Amarinder but he too refrained from attacking Sidhu. When MLA Pargat Singh openly questioned the CM and divulged details of what he spoke of in the meeting of MLAs with the CM, no minister or MLA tried to counter him or defend the CM on the questions he raised. The Kishor question Although poll strategist Prashant Kishor announced to quit despite the victory of his client, Trinamool Congress, in West Bengal, it remains unclear if he would do the same in Punjab. Only a few weeks back, Punjab CM appointed him his principal advisor. He also held meetings with MLAs in the thick of elections in Bengal and was the not visible in the state. However, he said there were capable people in I-PAC, who would continue doing the job. A few senior Punjab Congress leaders TOI spoke to said Kishor’s appointment was between the CM and the poll strategist and no one in the Punjab Congress was in the loop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/supporters-silent-cms-sidhu-spat-grows-louder/articleshow/82360607.cms||IP Singh
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Welfare powers Left front to victory||Led by Pinarayi Vijayan, LDF has created history by securing a stunning consecutive victory, winning a whopping 99 seats, and more significantly, breaking the state’s over 40-year-old tradition of alternate governments. The front’s success can be largely attributed to the chief minister and the politics of welfare that helped it defuse a series of allegations and controversies raked up by the opposition. Large sections of the society, including women, youths, and communities, including minorities, have contributed strongly to LDF’s victory. “A vast majority of people in the lower strata of the society stood by LDF and Pinarayi Vijayan. The issues raised by the opposition found resonance only among the elite groups,” said N M Pearson, political observer. Controversies centred around the gold smuggling case, EMCC deep sea fishing deal and that involving Sprinklr failed to cast any shadow on LDF's prospects. “In fact, it all started when Kerala was ravaged by the floods in 2018. Vijayan started appearing in daily press conferences assuming the role of a saviour and reached out to our drawing rooms. In 2020, when the pandemic broke out, the LDF government made its presence felt by offering free food kits. It helped him assume a cult status in a crisis-hit society, especially among women and youths,” Pearson said. “Though the LDF, under Pinarayi’s leadership, deviated from core values upheld by Left and embraced neoliberalism, delivering welfare and development at doorsteps and challenging communalism helped the front to cover up such deviations. In the long run, such an experiment in Kerala may help create an alternative model to the Modi-led BJP government,” Pearson said. The stand taken by the LDF government on issues like Citizenship Amendment Act made Vijayan the champion of democracy among Muslims. “He became his own brand ambassador in fighting communalism and taking on Modi. As a result, minorities rallied behind LDF in large numbers,” said Jacob George, a political analyst. On the other hand, the front’s mass base has been growing. Kerala Congress (M), which was a UDF constituent for the past four decades, joined LDF. “The LJD, which had switched over to UDF a few years ago too returned to the LDF fold. This helped the front gain victory in a few constituencies in central Kerala besides sweeping districts like Kozhikode,” George said. “The central agencies, which probed the corruption charges against Pinarayi government failed to gain the confidence of the masses as they appeared like succumbing to the whims of their political masters. The opposition, with the support of a section in the media, even dropped the “Sabarimala bomb” on the voting day, but Vijayan managed to defuse it by just stating that “all Gods are with LDF,” George added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/welfare-powers-left-front-to-victory/articleshow/82361300.cms||---
---||Mumbai||22 Maharashtra ‘prisons’ turn fortresses after escape bid by three inmates||MUMBAI: Security has been beefed up at all the 22 temporary prisons (and five Covid centres for prisoners) in the state after three prisoners, who were arrested for theft and assault, attempted to cut window grill and flee from a temporary prison in Byculla where they were being treated for Covid. The jail administration has stopped admitting new inmates directly into the jail because of the surge in Covid cases during this second wave. When an accused is sent by the court to jail, he/she is first taken to a temporary prison and tested. Once the result is negative, the prisoner is sent to regular jail. However, if a prisoner tests positive, he/she is treated at the temporary prison before being shifted to regular jail. Initially, the three prisoners — Ankush Jadhav, Maaz Khan and Manoj Gujar — were lodged at the Arthur Road jail. In the third week of April, the trio tested Covid positive and were sent to E S Patanwala Urdu School at Byculla (a temporary prison/Covid care centre for prisoners). A jail constable found a chit which gave him lead about the prisoners’ escape plan. The jail staff began inquiring and learnt about an inmate who was planning to escape. Sustained questioning resulted into two more names coming to the fore. The trio was immediately shifted to another room where more security was deployed. After they tested negative for Covid, they were again sent to Arthur Road jail. A case for resistance or obstruction by a person to his lawful apprehension and punishment for attempting to commit an offence has been registered against the trio at the Byculla police station. They will be taken into police custody later. It might be noted that the E S Patanwala Urdu School at Byculla (where the incident took place) is the same quarantine centre where Sheena Bora murder accused Indrani Mukherjea and 38 other women inmates, who tested positive, were brought for treatment last week. “After this incident, we have beefed up security at all these places and are reviewing the security as well,” said a senior jail official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-22-state-prisons-turn-fortresses-after-escape-bid-by-three-inmates/articleshow/82362131.cms||Mateen Hafeez
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: KCR sacks Eatala from Cabinet||HYDERABAD: A day after Medak district collector S Harish submitted an inquiry report to the state government confirming that Jamuna Hatcheries, owned by Eatala Rajender had encroached 66 acres of assigned land in Medak district, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Sunday dropped him from the state cabinet. Based on the recommendation of the chief minister, governor Tamilisai Soundararajan has issued orders dropping Eatala Rajender from the state cabinet with immediate effect. The decision comes in the wake of a preliminary report submitted by the Medak district collector confirming the allegations against Eatala that 66 acres of assigned and ceiling lands in Achampet and Hakimpet villages of Masaipet mandal in Medak district were encroached upon for expansion of Eatala owned-Jamuna Hatcheries. Officials said the government has started the process to take back the encroached land from Jamuna Hatcheries and impose penalties for violation of several rules by the poultry farm. While the political circles are rife with speculations over the next move of Eatala, a senior official said: “The ball is now in the court of CM KCR to decide what kind of further action is to be taken against Rajender.” On his part, Eatala has not revealed his future plans. There are strict instructions from the CM to TRS leaders to not speak about Eatala’s issue in public. Eatala was continuing in the state cabinet as a minister without a portfolio after he was stripped of the health and family welfare portfolio. This is probably the first time that a senior minister has been dropped from the cabinet pending a detailed investigation into the allegations. The Medak district collector and the ACB vigilance teams have conducted a swift probe into the land grabbing allegations against Eatala. Toopran RDO H Prakash has led a team of six members and conducted the digital survey of the said land and examined all the records. The report submitted by the Medak district collector has details of land encroachment by Jamuna Hatcheries. The report also says that some patta lands are converted into non-agricultural lands and buildings have also come up on the land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kcr-sacks-eatala-from-cabinet/articleshow/82362129.cms||Roushan Ali

Also, the residents are fed up with making multiple complaints to concerned authorities in order to draw their attention towards the worsening situation in the Old City. Residents said they had no help in dealing with medical emergencies such as absence of oxygen cylinders or lack of timely medical care.Touching upon the poor medical facilities being provided in the Charminar Hospital, residents sought the state government take immediate note of the conditions and come forward with effective initiatives by making sure oxygen supply and bed facilities are provided at Charminar Hospital, which was earlier used as an isolation centre. Mohammed Haji Mastan, a resident of Old City, told TOI that most deaths were occuring owing to lack of timely medical aid and lack of oxygen supply. He demanded chief minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao ensured medicine supply and proper medical facilities. “The people here are dying everyday due to lack of oxygen supply and medical needs. We don’t have any government hospital to help out poor people. Though there is Charminar Hospital, where oxygen and beds facility should be provided for the patients. Unfortunately, no such facilities are available in this hospital. Thus, the government has failed to heed the needs of Old City people,” said Haji Mastan. United Muslim Forum (UMF) made an appeal to residents to help needy and poor by supplying oxygen and medicine at this juncture. “The deadly virus has taken root in the country and one should take all possible safety measures We want the people to come forward to help each other in case of oxygen and medical needs,” said Syed Muneeruddin Ahmed Muqtar, general secretary of UMF.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/old-city-residents-raise-plaints-over-health-facilities/articleshow/82361310.cms||---

A senior IMD officer said, “The rainfall on Sunday was mainly due to local convective activity and we expect similar activity to continue till May 5. Overcast conditions followed by thunder, lightning and light rain will mark these conditions.” Pune has already recorded 33mm of seasonal rainfall before the arrival of the southwest monsoon by June 1 in India. The monsoon normally hits Pune around June 7. Anupam Kashyapi, head of IMD Pune’s weather forecast division, said, “The weather condition in the state is influenced by two trough lines — one between North East Madhya Pradesh to Vidarbha and another between Vidarbha to South of Tamil Nadu. Also, there is upper air circulation over Marathwada region.” “Because of these conditions, moisture incursion is taking place over the state including Madhya Maharashtra region, which includes Pune. As a result, we are getting light to very light rainfall. As the day temperature of the city is hovering between 37-39 degree Celsius, the local instability in the atmosphere is taking place over some pockets of the city and district, resulting in thunderstorms and lightning,” he said. “This weather is expected to remain so till May 5. Thereafter, the sky would mainly remain clear over the city,” Kashyapi added. The met department has appealed to people not to stand in open areas and below trees during the lightning. On Sunday, the Shivajinagar and Lohegaon observatories recorded 36.2 degree Celsius and 37.9 degree Celsius day temperature which were below normal by 1.8 degree Celsius and 0.1 degree Celsius respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/27mm-rain-in-shivajinagar-more-showers-till-may-5/articleshow/82360352.cms||Sandip Dighe

She claimed that Congress volunteers have been filling up the role of a failed and non-existent government. “Why is this government trying to show inadequate beds and trying to do these adjustments when the top two floors of South Goa District Hospital are still not being put to any use?

---||Nagpur||127% increase in use of NH-7 underpasses by tigers||Nagpur: Even as wildlife lovers raised an outcry over curtailed wildlife mitigation structures after a tiger got injured in a road hit on NH-44 (NH-7) on April 17, the latest report by the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), which suggested these mitigation steps, reveal that there is a 127% increase in the use of these underpasses by tigers as compared to 2019. Dehradun-based WII scientist Bilal Habib said in 2019, 5,675 crossings by wild animals were recorded. However, in 2020, the crossings have increased to 16,608, a 193% increase. Besides, there is an increase in 127% use by tigers compared to 2019. A short report on monitoring of underpass usage by wildlife on NH-7 cutting Pench Tiger Reserve (PTR), Maharashtra, is based on a camera trap survey from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020. Released on Sunday, it states that 21 wild mammal species are now using the underpasses. Four new species that were recorded using the underpasses in 2020 include Indian wolf, barking deer, chausinga, and pangolin. Habib said, “There is a 127% increase in the use of underpasses by tigers. Most species were found using these structures 50% more than the previous year. Hare, chitals, and wild dogs were the most frequent users of these structures like last year.” The NH-7 is the longest highway in India and is part of the north-south corridor connecting Srinagar and Kanyakumari. Along its course, it connects several important urban and rural centres of economic importance. It also cuts across important animal corridors along its route. Tigers have been regularly using six of the nine underpasses constructed by the NHAI that range from 80 metres to 750 metres in width. The survey revealed 352 crossings by tigers in 2020, as compared to 155 in 2019. Similarly, 167 crossings of leopards were recorded as compared to 37 in 2019. Besides, 10,170 crossings of chitals were recorded, which is nearly three times (3,450) more than in 2019. “At least 24 wild animal species are using these underpasses and there is an increase in movement of all the species,” said Habib. Habib added, “Natural revegetation under the structures has prompted many wild species like the wild dog and chitals to ‘use’ these spaces, in addition to merely crossing. On a few occasions, a pack of wild dogs was seen driving out a stag below the wildlife structures to open space.” The survey found that individuals across the age-sex spectrum of multiple species have been using the underpasses — from juvenile wild dogs and wild pigs, and sub-adult tigers with mothers. Breeding spotted deer and nilgai males have also been found to spar under the structures on many occasions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/127-increase-in-use-of-nh-7-underpasses-by-tigers/articleshow/82360345.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

GFP president Vijai Sardesai said that the victory of the regional parties, particularly TMC and DMK proved that voters prefer regional parties which are in tune with local aspirations. Sardesai also tried to allude to the coming state assembly elections, saying that Goa will get a chance soon to deny the BJP another chance to head the state government. “The emphatic victories of TMC, DMK and LDF is proof that the people will not tolerate their regionalistic aspirations being snuffed out by hegemonic pseudo-nationalists. Congratulations to Mamata Banerjee, M K Stalin and Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan for upholding the true spirit of India,” said Sardesai. Posing with fresh catch from the sea, Sardesai said that Banerjee and Stalin have netted a “big catch” by sweeping the elections to be in a position to form governments in their respective states. “BJP is small fry and gasping for breath in West Bengal and Tamil Nadu. Don’t worry, Goemkars, our time will also come soon,” said Sardesai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vijai-poll-results-prove-voters-want-regional-parties/articleshow/82361311.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Dehradun||BJP’s Mahesh Chandra Jeena wins Salt by-election in U’khand with over 4.6k votes||Almora: BJP candidate Mahesh Chandra Jeena won the Salt by-election in Uttarakhand with 4,697 votes on Sunday. Jeena bagged 21,874 votes while Congress candidate Ganga Pancholi finished behind him, securing 17,177 votes. Congratulating Jeena for his win, chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat, in a tweet, said that he was confident that Jeena will carry forward the unfinished works of late Surendra Singh Jeena (former Salt MLA and Mahesh Jeena’s brother whose death last year had necessitated the bypoll). Besides the BJP and Congress candidates, no other candidate in the fray could even secure 1,000 votes. In fact, the third-highest count went for NOTA (721 votes), according to the election commission data. The vote count, which started at 8 am, remained peaceful except during the fifth round of counting when Congress functionaries accused BJP of EVM tampering. Political observers say that BJP secured a lot of sympathy votes by fielding Mahesh Jeena, since his brother Surendra Singh Jeena, who represented the constituency in 2012 and 2017, had passed away while battling Covid-19 in November last year. Additionally, factionalism in Congress also worked well in favour of BJP, say experts. According to sources, a faction among the Congress wanted to field Vikram Singh Rawat, the son of former Salt MLA Ranjit Singh Rawat, from the seat. However, former chief minister Harish Rawat favoured Ganga Pancholi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/bjps-mahesh-chandra-jeena-wins-salt-by-election-in-ukhand-with-over-4-6k-votes/articleshow/82359844.cms||---
---||Dehradun||At crematoriums, waiting of 3-4 hours, rampant overcharging, no basic facilities for kin of the deceased||Dehradun: The wait seems never-ending for people coming to cremate their loved ones at the city’s main crematorium in Lakhibagh and the dedicated Covid-19 crematorium in Raipur. Relatives of the deceased have to wait nearly 3- 4 hours without basic facilities of drinking water or space to sit before they can finally cremate the body. “We used to get around 3-4 bodies daily in pre-Covid times but right now, at least 20 bodies are coming daily,” said Aryaman Sharma, head priest at the Lakhibagh crematorium where 10 bodies can be cremated at a time. “Given the increasing caseload, our committee has started a token system. These tokens are mandatory to use the services at the crematorium. We are giving out around 20 tokens each day and people start queuing up for them as early as 7 am. However, it is becoming increasingly difficult for us to carry on as well as many of our staff members have tested positive for Covid-19,” added Sharma. Meanwhile, due to excessive pressure at each crematorium, some people are even forced to burn bodies in the open space outside the main cremation area. Additionally, people have been complaining of over-charging by hearse van services, saying that they are forced to pay up to Rs 4,000 to Rs 4,500 for ferrying the body of their kin from within the city to Raipur crematorium. Sunil Kumar, who had come to the crematorium on SSunday for cremating his elder brother, said, “ I ended up paying Rs 4,000 for ferrying the body from Doon Hospital to the crematorium, a distance of eight kilometres. Families who are already in mourning are being exploited.” Besides, there are complaints of overcharging at the crematoriums as well. However, employees at the Raipur crematorium deny the charge. “We have put a rate card at the entrance of the crematorium and people are being charged accordingly. We ask for Rs 3,500 for the wood,” said an employee at the Raipur crematorium. When asked about the issue of overcharging at crematoriums, Dehradun district magistrate Ashish Kumar Srivastava told TOI, "We have fixed the price for cremation-related services and have asked crematorium managements to put the rate chart for transparency. Strict action will be taken against those found overcharging people."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/at-crematoriums-waiting-of-3-4-hours-rampant-overcharging-no-basic-facilities-for-kin-of-the-deceased/articleshow/82359838.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||India||Act against cops for allowing poll celebrations, says Election Commission||NEW DELHI: As trends and results trickled in, throwing up potential winners, some party workers could not hold back from gathering outside counting centres or party offices to exchange congratulatory greetings and indulge in public celebrations. However, this invited immediate disapproval from the EC in view of its recent ban on victory rallies, with the poll panel writing to chief secretaries of the concerned states/UT to act against the local station house officers for allowing the gatherings and to take penal action against the violators. Stating that it had taken a serious view of the public celebrations in contravention of its directions issued on April 28 and May 1, EC ordered that the responsible station house officers (SHOs) and other officers be placed under immediate suspension and criminal/disciplinary actions initiated against them. The chief secretaries and DGPs were further directed to take penal action including filing FIR against violators under the Disaster Management Act, 2005 and other relevant laws. In a separate letter to the heads of recognised national and state political parties, the EC expressed its displeasure at the failure of certain parties to abide by the extant instructions/guidelines on Covid safety. “It is utmost necessary that you direct/guide your party representatives/followers with strictness to stop them to celebrate and show restraint in these challenging times and ask them to behave strictly in accordance with the ECI’s instructions on Covid issues by NDMA/SDMA,” EC said. Meanwhile, after real-time updates dried up on the ECI results website midway through the counting, senior officials explained that it were the ECI servers that had slowed down due to the heavy load and that there was no let-up in counting. They added that the RO had been told to declare the results and feed the updates later.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/act-against-cops-for-allowing-poll-celebrations-says-election-commission/articleshow/82362821.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||RWAs raise concern over weekly markets turning Covid hotspots||HYDERABAD: At a time when there is a rapid surge in Covid-19 cases, residential welfare associations raised concerns about weekly street markets that are turning into hotspots of Covid in the city. Many said that this is happening despite the Telangana high court directeing the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) to take steps to ensure street shandies, which come up in residential localities of Hyderabad on different days of a week, do not turn into super-spreaders. “We are seeing huge gatherings at the weekly market near Czech colony at Sanathnagar every Sunday. Most of the items sold in this market fall under the non-essential category and I don’t see why the government is still not taking any measures to ban these huge gatherings despite the surge in Covid-19 cases,” said Swarnesh Vikram Singh, a resident of Czech colony. Several areas across the twin cities are famous for weekly markets, including Borabanda, Kachiguda, Shah Ali Banda, Rajeev Nagar, Moti Nagar, Moula Ali, Falaknuma, Errakunta, Nagole and many other places. “I see people thronging these markets every week to buy vegetables, clothes and other household items. With no one monitoring compliance of rules relating to face masks and maintaining social distances, these street markets are likely to trigger more positive cases,” said Harpreet Kaur, a resident of Ameerpet. While hearing a PIL filed by a law student, M Bhuvana, who stated that no Covid-19 protocols were being observed at these weekly shandies, the Telangana high court had directed GHMC to explain steps taken by it to ensure these weekly street markets do not turn into super-spreaders of Covid. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy instructed the GHMC to file an affidavit with details of weekly shandies held in different parts of the city and measures initiated to check spread of coronavirus from those street markets. While agreeing that these markets can turn into Covid-19 hotspots, Dr Rambabu, chief entomologist of GHMC said, “We have deployed our staff to sanitise all the market yards and weekly street markets by spraying sodium hypochlorite solution. We also have plans to intensify these measures and take more precautions to control the spread of Covid-19.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rwas-raise-concern-over-weekly-markets-turning-covid-hotspots/articleshow/82361318.cms||---

A senior police officer said this will help Goa police to strengthen the unit to act against any terror threat in the state. The senior officer said that they have asked personnel attached to different police stations and other units to join the ATS. Around 95 police personnel showed interest in joining the ATS, based on the willingness, physical tests were conducted and 45 were selected. The senior officer said that all the 45 police personnel have undergone pre-commando training at the Police Training School at Valpoi. Presently, the ATS has 90 commandos. A senior police officer said that 35 commandos were supposed to join ATS after the completion of basic training, but it has been delayed as they have been posted at various police stations due to the Covid situation. Pointing out that Goa receives frequent terror alerts as it is an international tourist destination, the senior officer said that increasing the squad’s strength will help cover the entire state in the event of any terror threat. Over the years, many anti-social elements and even terrorists have been arrested in Goa, so the ATS needs to be vigilant. Meanwhile, Goa police also conducted the physical proficiency test for ATS commandos to check their physical fitness. The ATS conducted the 5km running test for the commandos, followed by physical exercises. All the commandos completed their running test in the scheduled time. No untoward incident was reported and no weapon was damaged. In all, 70 commandos were present for the physical proficiency test which was conducted in the presence of the ATS DySP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/45-ats-men-from-goa-set-to-train-at-haryana-campus/articleshow/82361314.cms||---

The Goa Waste Management Corporation (GWMC) will now invite new bids to set up the plant. Managing director of GWMC, Levinson Martins told TOI, “All three bidders have been disqualified from the bidding process as they have not submitted all the documents. We will float new tender documents with modified criteria.” When asked when the new tender will be floated, Martins said that, due to the pandemic and the corporation resultantly working at half strength, it will take some time. “We will float a new tender as soon as possible,” he said. The companies that had expressed interest were Hindustan Waste Treatment Pvt Ltd, Maaviya Engineering Consultants Pvt Ltd and Three R Management Pvt Ltd. Their bids had been placed before the technical advisory committee for scrutiny. Due to inadequate offers, the state government had extended the time limit for accepting bids four times, the last being on January 31. In 2008, the Corporation of the City of Panaji had acquired land at Bainguinim to set up the plant, and in 2017 it was handed over to GWMC. A public hearing was also held by GWMC and the environment clearance was also obtained. The plant will include recycling and sorting lines, segregation, bio-methanation and composting systems.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/all-3-bidders-for-bainguinim-waste-plant-disqualified/articleshow/82361316.cms||---

At the state level, too, the stocks are depleted, said a senior official of the public health department. “The state has not received any fresh stock from the Centre since April 26,” the official said. The vaccination drive in the state had gathered momentum in the second fortnight of April, with an average of three lakh people being vaccinated in a day. The figure had almost reached four lakh on one day. State immunisation officer Dr D Patil said the state would be unable to conduct a full-fledged drive on Monday due to lack of stocks. “We are expecting stocks and should be able to restart the drive in a couple of days,” he said. Officials said that using previously received stock, the state had managed to vaccinate 95,535 people on Saturday. Of these, 81,380 were from the 45-plus category while the rest were either healthcare or frontline workers. The state has so far given out 1.63 crore vaccination doses since the drive started on January 16. On Sunday, additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said the BMC had not received any fresh stock in four days. “However, we have got an assurance that fresh stocks are likely to reach us sometime on Monday,’’ he said. “We are preparing to restart the drive for the elderly and others on Tuesday.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-hasnt-got-vaccines-from-centre-after-april-26/articleshow/82361326.cms||---

This, Sawant said, will take care of the oxygen requirements of the Covid hospital. Sawant said that the oxygen plant was being set up through the PM Cares Fund and would be the first such plant set up by the government in the state. Stating that a compressor for the plant was expected to arrive by May 8, Sawant said that the plant would be made functional once the component is installed. Earlier, Sawant visited various oxygen plants across the state and took stock of the production and distribution of the gas. The chief minister’s visit comes against the backdrop of a letter written by Goa Association of Resident Doctors (GARD) to the dean of the Goa Medical College highlighting the problems faced by them in managing Covid patients owing to inadequate oxygen supply to the hospital. Sawant was accompanied by the disaster management team headed by chief secretary Parimal Rai, health secretary Ravi Dhawan and other senior officials. Sawant first visited the oxygen plant at Corlim in North Goa, the major oxygen supplying unit to GMC and later visited other units across Goa, where he took stock of the manufacturing capacity, storage facilities and its transportation. Later he visited other plants at Nuvem, Verna and Cuncolim. Sawant directed the owner of the oxygen plant at Cuncolim to start operations of the plant round-the-clock that would enhance its capacity to refill 500 cylinders per day. “Measures will be been taken to overcome all shortcomings observed during the visit, taking into consideration the futuristic view of the requirement of oxygen,” Sawant told reporters at the South Goa district hospital. Replying to a query, Sawant said that recruitment of manpower under contract basis at the South Goa district hospital would be made soon. He also visited the ESI Hospital, Margao, and took stock of the facilities and medical infrastructure. He also interacted with the doctors at the hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sawant-o2-plant-at-s-goa-district-hospital-by-may-15/articleshow/82361324.cms||---

An 80-year-old man Hermie Caldeira, partially blind in one eye, with vertigo, was almost shunted out of the Sanjay School, the new vaccination site of the Porvorim health centre when he went to get his second dose on Friday. “It was around 11.30 in the morning and the attendant rudely told me that unless I waited in the long queue vaccination would not be possible. When I asked to see a doctor or nurse who could consider my case, she said neither were available. She was very rude. I felt terrible, disappointed, and didn’t know what to do,” he said. Caldeira returned home without getting his second dose. “They should have a separate queue for super seniors. If the attendant had told me to return in the evening, I would have gladly gone there, but she just wouldn’t listen,” he added. The vaccination was moved out of the Porvorim health centre which has space constraints and where Covid testing was also taking place, to Sanjay School. Another senior citizen and resident of Porvorim, Juino de Souza told TOI he was stopped at the gate of the school when he went for his second dose at around 3pm on Thursday. “The attendant told me to come another day as there was huge crowd. When I peeked in, I found dozens of people made to wait in a narrow corridor, with no ventilation whatsoever,” De Souza said. He said he was left with no option but to go all the way to Panaji to take his second dose. De Souza suggests that the government start door to door vaccination for the benefit of senior citizens who cannot get out and for persons with disabilities. “There are many who are living alone. it’s difficult for them to come to the vaccination centre and stand in queues,” he said. State immunisation officer Dr Rajendra Borkar said that staff on vaccination duty have been working right through the month, with many staff and/or their families having tested positive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/elderly-complain-of-unfair-treatment-at-jab-centres/articleshow/82361330.cms||---

---||Goa||Volunteers raise Rs 11L for 7 oxygen concentrators via crowdfunding||Panaji: A Covid-19 volunteer group has raised money through crowdfunding to order oxygen concentrators for the state’s government hospitals. With some costing about Rs 90,000 to Rs 1.2 lakh per unit, the group has managed to raise money for seven oxygen concentrators, by raising money on the citizen-led initiative covidcaregoa.in “We have raised about Rs 11 lakh through crowdfunding. Our target is to raise Rs 15 lakh to purchase at least 10 oxygen concentrators for Goa. The seven we’ve ordered from Israel will be arriving soon and will be given away free of cost,” said Shruti Chaturvedi, who recently put together a toolkit for citizens to source information related to Covid care. In an extension of the initiative, she and her team of volunteers set up a fundraiser for the purchase of oxygen concentrators for Goa. These devices will be handed over to the Goa Medical College (GMC) and the North Goa district hospital. “We will also procure a few oxygen concentrators to be borrowed by people in home quarantine whose families may find it difficult to locate a bed at these government hospitals. Since they are being purchased with the help of public donations, we will lend them free of cost,” Chaturvedi said. She attributed the success of the initiative to people’s willingness to donate and help the community, adding that they are only accepting donations through the website to maintain transparency. In addition to this and the website covidcaregoa.in, the toolkit features information such as volunteer contacts, home-cooked meal services and suppliers of oxygen cylinders. More importantly, it gives a break-up of updates on hospital bed availability based on oxygen bed, Covid care bed and ICU bed, so that patients and their family members can visit the hospital based on their requirements. “It’s been only a week since we released the toolkit and the website gets nearly 7,000 visits per day by people in need,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/volunteers-raise-rs-11l-for-7-oxygen-concentrators-via-crowdfunding/articleshow/82361339.cms||Nida Sayed

The incident happened at the house of Dr Mohammed Abdul Hadi, 50, located on Road Number 9, Banjara Hills. On March 15, Abdul Hadi, who runs a clinic at Mallepally brought Rs 1.9 crore cash home. Abdul obtained the cash from the sale of a property in the city, Banjara Hills police said. Subsequently, Abdul fell ill and while undergoing treatment, he succumbed at home on March 23, Banjara Hills inspector (detective) Md Hafeezuddin said. On March 29, Abdul’s widow, Arifa Hadi, along with their son, Adnan Hadi, picked up the cash from the house and went to her parents’ house on Road Number 5, Banjara Hills. Subsequently, when Arifa counted the cash, she realised that it was less by Rs 25 lakh. The family lodged a complaint with Banjara Hills police on Saturday. “Abdul’s wife and children stay at his in-law’s house mostly. As the family expressed doubts about the possible involvement of servants, we have registered a case under Section 381 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). No arrests have been made yet,” the DI said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rs-25l-stolen-from-doctors-house/articleshow/82361346.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Even as Covid rages across U’khand, locals in rural areas grapple with poor health infrastructure||Nainital: Even as coronavirus cases continue to surge across Uttarakhand, locals in the rural areas of the state say that they continue to grapple with the lack of medical facilities. “People in rural areas, especially in the hills, are struggling to get beds in hospitals. Securing medical oxygen or plasma is an arduous task in the hills. The health infrastructure is non-existent in several villages and people in several villages are forced to walk several kilometres to just get tested for Covid-19,” said Anil Pandey, a resident of Garur town in Bageshwar district. He added, “The state health department is sending its teams to villages to collect samples but they have limited manpower. Residents of Garur town have to go all the way to the testing facility near Baijnath to get tested for Covid-19.” Locals of areas like Gopeshwar in Chamoli, Munsiyari in Pithoragarh, and Okhalkanda in Nainital complain of similar issues. “The situation is not very alarming yet but in serious cases, patients are referred to medical facilities in Gopeshwar or Joshimath. Several district hospitals in hill towns don’t have ICU beds. Thus, people are forced to travel to Srinagar just to get access to an ICU bed,” says Manoj Pal, a resident of Chamoli district. Villagers say that primary and community health centres in the hills offer little medical assistance. “In most of these centres, there are no isolation facilities or even oxygen cylinders. These facilities are only equipped to carry out vaccination drives and administer treatment to moderately ill patients. Anyone who contracts Covid-19 and needs to be admitted to a medical facility has to be taken to Haldwani which is 50 kilometres away from Okhalkanda,” said Ramesh Singh, a resident of Okhalkanda town. Meanwhile, the health department officials say that they are ramping up Covid-19 testing capacities, especially in the hills. “We realise that roads have not reached several villages yet. Therefore, we are arranging for mobile testing facilities. These vans will reach the remote areas and the medical teams can trek to these villages to collect samples. As far as the hospitalisation and treatment of critical patients is concerned, we have not had many serious cases. However, we are procuring beds and other medical equipment to meet the demand,” said a senior district official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/even-as-covid-rages-across-ukhand-locals-in-rural-areas-grapple-with-poor-health-infrastructure/articleshow/82359904.cms||Prashant Jha

---||Pune||Labs not reporting cases in time: Gram panchayats in rural Pune||PUNE: The heads of many villages in rural Pune have complained about private labs not reporting Covid-19 positive cases in time to them. They said this was not only posing an impediment in contact tracing and further testing, but was also raising fears of asymptomatic patients moving around in villages and risking the lives of others. The issue was raised on Saturday during a video conference meeting organized by the Pune Zilla Parishad (ZP). “Some sarpanch had raised this issue in the meeting. We have already appraised our health department about it,” Sandeep Kohinkar, head of the ZP’s gram panchayat section, told TOI on Sunday. Ganesh Kolekar, the sarpanch of Koyali village in Khed tehsil, said, “There were couple of instances in our village, where we found out about positive patients after a gap of one to two weeks. They were asymptomatic and were roaming around in the village for their work. This is very risky as many people can get infected. Also, we couldn’t stop them from mingling with the general public. We are now focusing on spreading awareness and urging people to inform us if they test positive.” Usually, the reports of those who have given their throat swab samples in sub-district hospitals, rural hospitals and primary health centres, go to the respective gram panchayats from the tehsil’s health department. “However, maximum people are getting tested in private labs, who aren’t sharing the patients’ reports with the tehsil administration at many places. As a result, gram panchayats are totally oblivious about positive patients in their areas,” former sarpanch D Ganjale of Manchar village in Ambegaon tehsil, said. The Covid positive cases have been increasing in the last two months. Rural Pune records over 2,000 Covid positive cases daily, a ZP official said. Rural Pune has recorded a total of 1,57,805 Covid-19 positive cases since outbreak of the virus. Of them, 1,30,806 have been discharged after recovery, 2,216 succumbed to the virus and 24,783 were active cases till May 1. District health officer Bhagwan Pawar, said, “Private labs are supposed to send reports of positive patients to the tehsil health officer (THO). It then goes to the respective gram panchayat for necessary action to be taken. We will soon direct all 13 THOs to discuss the issues with private labs in their limits and address them. If needed, we will take action against the labs as well.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/labs-not-reporting-cases-in-time-gram-panchayats/articleshow/82360537.cms||Sandip Dighe

---||Nagpur||Man who saved 10,000 trees last year!||Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has made ‘cremation of Covid-body free by using wood’, thus saving the agony of the relatives of the deceased by an ounce.But, here is a man who has brought an epic turnaround in the ‘cremation process’ in Nagpur by not using woods, but briquettes. And, what’s more striking is that the singular and dedicated effort of engineer-turned-environmentalist Vijay Limaye has helped save 10,000 trees in the 2020-21 financial year.Limaye, who runs the NGO ‘Eco-friendly Living Foundation’ is credited with starting the eco-friendly cremation in Nagpur by first using govari (cow dung cakes) and then briquettes (compressed and combustible saw dust or hay), drawing praise from none other than Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his ‘Mann ki Baat’. Over last three-four years Nagpurians have accepted the drive which means more and more people opted to ditch the conventional wood-cremation and adopted the newer methods.Limaye, with the help of NMC, has successfully implemented the drive at six crematoriums in Nagpur city viz Ambazari, Mokshadham, Manewada, Gangabai, Mankapur and Sahakar Nagar. As per Limaye, NMC cremated 5,040 bodies in Nagpur city in 2020-21 financial year at the six ghats.Almost 1,125 tons of agricultural waste was consumed, thereby giving direct benefits to farmers to the tune of Rs 20 lakh. This action has saved almost 10,000 trees (minimum 18-year-olds) in the financial year, besides reducing the air pollution by 50% at the ghats and nearby places.“One ton of wood generates 3.7 ton carbon dioxide. If all 5,040 bodies would have been cremated using wood, 1,350 tons of wood would have been needed, which means 4,995 tons of carbon dioxide would have gone into atmosphere, thus massively adding to the air pollution,” he says.“The money spent on planting a seed and seeing it grow up to 18 years is Rs 2,000. Hence by saving 10,000 full-grown trees our drive saved Rs 2 crore,” says Limaye.“Besides, in the Rs 20 lakh turnover briquette-manufacturing business, we have given direct employment to more than 50 unskilled labourers in the villages,” he adds.Hence, briquette cremation is a win-win option available at the moment.Burning issues* In 2020-21, NMC used briquettes to cremate 5,040 bodies in six ghats — Ambazari, Mokshadham, Manewada, Gangabai, Mankapur and Sahakar Nagar — of Nagpur* Almost 1,125 tons of agricultural waste was consumed* In one year, the action saved 10,000 trees (minimum 18-year-olds)* Reduced air pollution by 50% at the ghats and nearby areas* Gave direct employment to over 50 unskilled labourers||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/man-who-saved-10000-trees-last-year/articleshow/82360327.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||KCR’s devpt mantra helped TRS win Sagar bypoll: Analysts||HYDERABAD: Nomula Bhagat of the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi has won the Nagarjuna Sagar Assembly constituency with over 18,000 votes. It is a majority which is higher than what his father Nomula Narsimhaiah got in 2018 and K Jana Reddy of the Congress polled in 2014 elections. Political analysts attributed the victory to several factors important among them being the charisma and credibility enjoyed by TRS president and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao among the voters, the ongoing welfare schemes of the TRS government, the development mantra chanted by KCR, his council of ministers and party leaders in the two public meetings of the CM and during campaigning. Also, KCR in his two public meetings sanctioned hundreds of crores of irrigation and other projects to Nagarjuna Sagar constituency and Nalgonda district and went to the extent of promising that he would not seek votes in 2023 assembly elections if TRS government fails to complete Nellikal lift irrigation project. And that the TRS, if voted to power again, would show what real development is. Despite K Jana Reddy of the Congress being a formidable candidate and tipped to win the bypoll initially, the wave turned in favour of the TRS as the polling day approached. KCR’s strategic move in fielding Bhagat, son of deceased MLA Nomula Narsimhaiah, whose death necessitated the bypoll, and he being a Yadav candidate from BC community which comprises largest percentage of voters in the constituency, too worked in favour of the TRS candidate. Another main factor is that the BJP lacked its aggressive campaign in Nagarjuna Sagar which it displayed in Dubbak and GHMC elections. The BJP candidate failed to cut into the vote bank of the TRS. Political analyst professor K Nageshwar said that though there was discontent against the ruling TRS, it was only among some sections of the people. This discontent was manageable and TRS managed it. “It was the BJP which failed to cash in on this discontent. There were doubts in the minds of people about BJP and TRS having soft corner for each other with KCR going silent on farm laws. The suspicion strengthened when BJP leaders urged TRS not to field its candidate from Lingojiguda and TRS working president readily agreed,” Nageshwar said. All the TRS ministers including G Jagadish Reddy, Errabelli Dayakar Rao, Vemula Prashant reddy, Koppula Eshwar, V Srinivas Goud and Nomula Bhagat credited the victory to the voters’ trust in KCR and welfare schemes. Bhagat dedicated his victory to KCR. The BJP and Congress leaders alleged that the TRS not only spent huge money and liquor but also threatened voters that the welfare schemes would be discontinued if TRS loses. Jana Reddy’s challenge to KCR not to campaign also had a negative impact on his poll prospects. “In Dubbak, people wanted to give a pinch to KCR who was not giving time to his ministers to meet him, and they did. After the dismal performance in graduate MLC polls and now in Nagarjuna Sagar, both BJP and Congress need to pick a new narrative to connect with the voters,” said political observers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kcrs-devpt-mantra-helped-trs-win-sagar-bypoll-analysts/articleshow/82360534.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Kolkata||Backstage boy Abhishek Banerjee delivers when party needed him most||KOLKATA: It was a trial by fire for Abhishek Banerjee and he delivered when the party needed him the most. From behind the scenes to his public campaigns, Abhishek played a key role behind Trinamool’s win this time. From a late evening in June 2019, when he took Prashant Kishore to meet chief minister Mamata Banerjee at her Nabanna chambers to accompanying Banerjee on Sunday evening to offer pujas at the Kalighat temple after the party’s win, Abhishek has played a key role in the party’s success.  The Diamond Harbour MP, who criss-crossed Bengal, holding public rallies and road shows, has been drawing large crowds with his matter-of-fact speeches, nuanced with an emotional appeal which struck a chord among people. Abhishek was singled out for the sharpest attack by senior BJP leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah. The Pishi-Bhaipo barbs by BJP leaders turned into personal attacks against Abhishek when Suvendu Adhikari attacked him — and his kin — prompting Abhishek to initiate legal action against the friend-turned-foe. But the pressure on Abhishek began much before the polls were declared in Bengal. Late February, his wife was served a notice by CBI and grilled for hours. It wasn’t only his wife, but his sister-in-law and her family were also questioned by central agencies.  Even Banerjee, while speaking in a television interview, claimed these were done to pile pressure on Abhishek. But Abhishek never backed off from a fight. He took the battle to Suvendu’s turf, leading a road show that passed through his locality. For party leaders, Abhishek was a critical clog in the wheel that kept the party moving despite all odds to finally pull off the victory. In his public rallies, Abhishek had always maintained a quiet confidence that “Didi will return with two-thirds majority”. Abhishek had to take over a larger role after a spate of high-level defections hit the party ranks and most of the senior leaders were occupied in the poll fray in which most were candidates.  From speaking to senior leaders who had aired their grievances in public to reaching out to party workers, Abhishek has been in the thick of action along with his poll campaign. Abhishek was also coordinating with the I-Pac team daily. “He also introduced technology and data analysis in a big way to the party. The strategies and the policy measures were an outcome of detailed field studies, multiple outreach programmes and a constant back-end team of tele callers who were taking and providing feedback. This is something which he did in tandem with the I-Pac team and PK. While policy rollouts were part of it, it was also used extensively to identify candidates and plan campaigns in a more centralised approach,” a senior leader said. Along with this, 2021 also saw a more combative Abhishek. Believed to be slightly reticent in his public media engagements, Abhishek shed his reticence in his public meetings, donning a more aggressive approach, questioning the “dynasty” barbs with the Adhikari clan in BJP fold and the corruption charges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/backstage-boy-abhishek-delivers-when-party-needed-him-most/articleshow/82360539.cms||---

The three-day lockdown was largely successful in Mapusa with most shops and establishment keeping shutters down. A few supermarkets and grocery shops were open, but not many people seen at these shops. Shirodkar said that after deputy collector Kapil Phadte said that shops could be kept open provided SOPs are followed, they in turn asked their members to take a decision on the same, but that keeping in mind the rising cases and rate of infection, the merchants took a decision to keep their shops shut. “The lives of the people are more important than business and merchants have co-operated and shut their shops in the market,” Shirodkar said. “Now the government should pay due attention to ensure that the chain of the infection is broken.” Siolim MLA Vinod Palyekar too called for an extension of the lockdown as a precautionary measure before the state slips into the red zone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/lockdown-proves-successful-in-mapusa/articleshow/82361396.cms||---

He is survived by three wives and seven children. Shaikh, whom the police described as a diesel smuggler, also dabbled in politics by unsuccessfully contesting the 2009 Lok Sabha elections on a BSP ticket from South Mumbai. He was also involved in cases of red sanders smuggling, besides the 2010 murder of his former aide Sayyed Madar alias Chand. Shaikh was under the scanner in the 26/11 terror probe for carrying out a recce for David Headley, one of the conspirators. He started his career in Mumbai in the late ’80s with a cycle tyre puncture shop and moved to oil smuggling. He and his gang would venture into the high seas and purchase oil/diesel from foreign vessels at throwaway prices. This would be adulterated with naphtha and sold to petrol pumps and small industries. Shaikh had also started a few companies and set up offices in Dubai and Singapore. Joint commissioner of police, late Himanshu Roy, who investigated the Chand murder case had then said Shaikh’s annual turnover was around Rs 100 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-diesel-mafia-don-in-hosp-for-covid-dies-of-heart-attack/articleshow/82361416.cms||Ahmed Ali

Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi-led AIMIM party failed to win a single seat in West Bengal and Tamil Nadu assembly elections, the results of which were declared on Sunday. The AIMIM had contested from seven assembly segments in West Bengal and three in Tamil Nadu. The party went alone to the hustings after its attempts to form an alliance with Indian Secular Front (ISF) failed. Owaisi fielded candidates from Itahar, Jalangi, Sagardighi, Bharatpur, Malatipur, Ratua and Asansol North where Muslim voters are in majority and none of them managed to win. In Tamil Nadu, AIMIM had joined Dhinakaran-led Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) and contested from Vaniyambadi, Krishnagiri and Sankarapuram assembly constituencies. The party failed to open its account in this state assembly too. The AIMIM had contested from 20 seats in Bihar assembly elections held in 2020 and emerged victorious in five assembly constituencies. The party surprised everyone by winning two assembly seats even in Maharashtra where it had contested from 44 assembly segments in 2019 polls. Asaduddin Owaisi led the campaign for the party and held public meetings in West Bengal and Tamil Nadu. Though people in huge numbers attended his public meetings, it failed to convert into a vote bank that could give it victory. MIM leaders said they would continue to work towards solving the problems being faced by the people particularly those from the minorities, SC, ST and BC communities. Despite its loss in West Bengal and Tamil Nadu, the party is preparing the ground to contest in the ensuing elections in Uttar Pradesh assembly in February/March 2022, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/mim-fails-to-win-single-seat-in-bengal-tn-polls/articleshow/82360538.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Pune||Auto cluster facility doc among 3 medicos held on charges of extortion, cheating||Pimpri Chinchwad: The Pimpri Chinchwad police on Sunday arrested three doctors on the charge of accepting Rs1 lakh from a woman patient on April 23 to admit her to the 200-bedded dedicated Covid hospital at the auto cluster in Chinchwad. The facility has been set up for providing free Covid-19 treatment and a private hospital had referred the woman patient for further treatment. “One of these doctors is working at the auto cluster facility and the other two are from the private hospital and are accused of having taken a commission of Rs20,000 from the auto cluster doctor for patient transfer,” ACP Sagar Kawde of the Pimpri Chinchwad police told TOI. “They were arrested on the basis of the FIR lodged by Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation’s (PCMC) additional municipal commissioner Ulhas Jagtap. We have evidence against the trio,” Pimpri Chinchwad’s deputy commissioner of police Manchak Ipper told TOI. “There are no charges for admission to the facility and yet the doctor forced her relatives to give Rs1 lakh to arrange the bed for here. The woman succumbed to the virus during treatment. Her relatives had raised this issue,” an officer from the Pimpri Chinchwad police said. Kawde told TOI, “We have applied charges under sections 384 (extortion), 420 (cheating) and 406 (criminal breach of trust) of the Indian Penal Code against the three doctors.” The FIR stated, “The auto cluster facility was started for free treatment of Covid-19 patients. The contract of the facility has been given to Fortune Sparsh healthcare private limited. In the PCMC general body meeting on Apirl 30, the corporators made some allegations against Fortune Sparsh healthcare private limited, stating that the three doctors--one from the auto cluster and two from private hospitals allegedly took Rs1 lakh to admit the patient at the facility.” PCMC commissioner Rajesh Patil told TOI that the complaint was first raised by two corporators and assuming the gravity of the situation, they proceeded with the FIR. Patil added that henceforth admissions at the Auto Cluster facility will be made only through recommendations from the Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial Hospital’s triage area doctors where the initial inspection of patients is done and mode of treatment is suggested. “Direct admissions will not be allowed,” he said. Amol Holkunde, CEO of Sparsh hospital refuted the allegations made against their doctor saying that the private hospital doctors could be involved in charging money from needy patients, but not those from their facility. “This is a free facility available to citizens, the allegations made against us are baseless,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/auto-cluster-facility-doc-among-3-medicos-held-on-charges-of-extortion-cheating/articleshow/82360544.cms||Piyush Bhusari

Be it Hooghly’s sitting MP Locket Chatterjee, Asansol MP Babul Supriyo or BJP’s Rajya Sabha member Swapan Dasgupta, all failed to deliver on Sunday. While Chatterjee lost to Trinamool’s Asit Mazumdar in Chinsurah, Aroop Biswas defeated Supriyo by close to 50,000 votes. Dasgupta lost to Ramendu Sinha Roy of the ruling party . The only silver linings were Nisith Pramanik from Dinhata, who won by a slim margin of 69 votes against Trinamool’s Udayan Guha, and Ranaghat MP Jagannath Sarkar, who won against Ajoy Dey. “It does not matter if I have won by a slim margin. The only fact is that we have managed to win from Dinhata. I shall now stay in my constituency and serve the people,” Pramanik said. "I am a soldier of the BJP. I followed the instructions of my party and hence, despite being an MP, when my name was fielded, I contested for the MLA seat,” added Sarkar. Chatterjee claimed that she would continue to work and serve the voters as an MP. “I am yet to analyse the results and see how our party could not manage to replicate the same performance of 2019,” she said. Supriyo claimed to have asked home minister Amit Shah to field him from a “difficult seat” and did not want to choose to contest from Asansol. “I fought against the poster boy of corruption. I am rather thankful to my party that I was given an opportunity to fight along with thousands of party workers who are regularly beaten up by Didi’s goons,” he said.

---||Delhi||2 expresses to reach today with 205T O2||New Delhi/Gurgaon: Two Oxygen Express trains will deliver the biggest single-day load of nearly 205 tonnes of liquid medical oxygen to Delhi on Tuesday. One of these trains carrying 120 tonnes from Durgapur in West Bengal will reach Tughlaqabad railway station and another with 85 tonnes from Hapa in Gujarat will arrive in Gurgaon, which is meant for Delhi. One train reached Delhi Cantonment station carrying tankers with 30 tonnes of medical oxygen from Angul in Odisha on Monday, but it was meant for Faridabad. Till Monday afternoon, the liquid medical oxygen transported by the railways had touched 395 tonnes, officials said. Till Monday evening, 42 Oxygen Express trains had completed their journey and eight more were running. Some 20 loaded Oxygen Express trains had delivered approximately 1,125 tonnes of oxygen in 76 tankers. Seven others were enroute to Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, UP, Telangana and Delhi, carrying 422 tonnes in 27 tankers. Indian Railways flagged off the first Oxygen Express train after receiving a request from the Maharashtra government last month. These trains are being run in response to the shortage of the medical oxygen across the country that followed the second wave of the Covid-19. Delhi High Court had ordered the central government on Saturday to ensure that the national capital received its quota of oxygen by Monday night. The government has set up an empowered group comprising officials from railways, petroleum and transport ministries; representatives from state governments and experts from private sector, including from Indian Oil Corporation, for mapping the sources of medical oxygen and their production capacity to match the requirement of 12 high-burden states. Supply to hospitals improves in Gurgaon For the first time in two tense weeks for hospitals in Gurgaon, which have also reported 12 deaths in the past 10 days of Covid-19 patients that have been linked to oxygen shortage, Monday soothed nerves a bit. The city received 43 tonnes of medical oxygen on Monday, up seven tonnes from the daily supply of 35 it had been getting so far, after the state government increased its allotment by 5 metric tonnes to 40. An oxygen train from Hapa in Gujarat is expected to arrive at Gurgaon station in the early hours of Tuesday with another 30 metric tonnes which, officials said, will help considerably ease nerves and oxygen supply worries of designated Covid hospitals in the city. Deputy commissioner Yash Garg said the city would receive more medical oxygen from Gujarat soon. “Our oxygen allotment has been increased to 40 metric tonnes. On Monday, we managed to get 43 metric tonnes. Today, there have been no SOS calls. Things are under control,” said Garg.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2-expresses-to-reach-today-with-205t-o2/articleshow/82377731.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Vanathi dashes Kamal’s hopes of maiden electoral win; gloom looms MNM camp||Coimbatore: There were high hopes of Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) leader Kamal Haasan registering his maiden electoral victory as he maintained a lead over both his main opponents right from the beginning of the counting. But the victory eluded him the last moment, when BJP candidate Vanathi Srinivasan defeated him by a slender margin of less than 1,800 votes from the Coimbatore South assembly segment.At the end of a tight race, Vanathi emerged victorious by polling 53,209 votes, while Kamal came second with 5,1481 votes. Congress candidate Mayura Jayakumar, who contested with the backing of the DMK, was placed third with 41,426 votes.While Kamal was ahead of Vanathi and Jayakumar right from the morning, the tide turned in favour of the BJP candidate when the counting commenced for the 23rd round. Vanathi gained lead over Kamal and maintained the same for the remaining two rounds. Finally, it turned out to be Vanathis’s day.Kamal’s gamble of choosing the cosmopolitan Coimbatore South constituency, away from Paramakudi, where he was born, and Chennai, where he lived, has failed to pay off. Kamal seemed to have chosen the seat banking on the support extended by the urban voters of the segment to the party vice-president R Mahendran in last Lok Sabha election.It was a triangular fight with Vanathi and Jayakumar posing tough challenge to the star. Vanathi had nurtured the constituency for a long time, making the BJP a strong force. Besides, it has been a stronghold of the BJP’s key ally AIADMK. So, AIADMK cadres and Vanathi’s own support base offered a formidable challenge to Kamal.On the other hand, the DMK-Congress alliance was hoping to ride on the anti-incumbency wave as well as frictions within the BJP-AIADMK alliance.Kamal’s narrative to offer a corruption-free alternative did appear to work well with the voters of the segment. There was a good traction for his speeches among the youth right from the beginning of the election campaign. That was perhaps the reason for his good show, despite the defeat.Kamal, who came down to Coimbatore on Sunday morning, went straight to the counting centre at the Government College of Technology, and stayed there the whole day. Tension was palpable in the counting centre in the evening, when Vanathi surged ahead of Kamal in the 23rd round. In the next few of rounds, the fortunes shifted between the two and around 6pm both the party cadres claimed their candidate had won. It was around 8.30pm when the final results came, declaring Vanathi as the winner.With the Kamal’s defeat, the MNM has lost its only hope of making an entry to the state assembly. Elsewhere in the state, some of the other hopefuls of the party like Mahendran had lost. In most of the places, the MNM trailed behind the Naam Tamizhar Katchi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/vanathi-dashes-kamals-hopes-of-maiden-electoral-win-gloom-looms-mnm-camp/articleshow/82361426.cms||Mayilvaganan

The Gujarat Medical Teachers Association (GMTA) has been raising these demands since quite some time now, but the demands have remained unresolved. The demands include implementation of career advancement scheme, time-bound promotions and emolument issues including the rise in non-practising allowance in line with the seventh pay commission. GMTA’s Vadodara unit will hold a meeting on Monday and decide on the future course of action regarding the demands. The doctors are particularly peeved at the government’s decision to increase emoluments of interns and resident doctors and ignore GMTA’s pending issues. Sources said that the situation now is that a senior resident’s salary is higher than some assistant professors. The GMTA had earlier planned the agitation in March, but postponed it as Covid cases started rising. But with residents and interns having their way despite the pandemic, the teachers seem to have decided to go ahead with their agitation too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/medical-teachers-on-agitation-path-over-pending-demands/articleshow/82359178.cms||---

When there was still a shortage, Dange brought Dura oxygen cylinder to the hospital with the help of a Pune Metro crane. “The cylinder reached the hospital when there was only 15 minutes of supply left,” Dange told TOI. There are seven hospitals in his jurisdiction where Covid patients are being treated. “We have formed a WhatsApp group to help them,” Dange said. The hospital’s alert to them was about 22 patients on oxygen support of whom nine were critical with just an hour’s supply, he added. He told the hospital to start shifting the patients to other hospitals, but none was available. “One hospital agreed to accommodate some patients when I spoke to them and another offered to oxygen cylinders. We got five cylinders, but the requirement was high, so we fetched the Dura oxygen cylinder in Shivajinagar,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/kothrud-cops-save-22-lives-with-o2-supply/articleshow/82360563.cms||---

The 27-year-old accused Sujit Saket told police that he committed the crime as he had a rift with her father over a petty fight that took place in 2019. Police said that when the girl had gone to answer nature’s call in the open near her house, Saket bumped into her. He lured the girl by offering money to buy chocolate and took her to an uninhabited room behind their housing colony. Saket admitted to police that he raped and sodomized the girl too. When she started shouting, Saket hit her with a brick on her head and later strangulated her. Saket then dumped her body in bushes behind the room. The girl’s body was found on April 30 while searching for her when her mother realized that she was missing. The girl’s mother had gone for a bath when she left the house. While investigating, police questioned several people living in the colony. A few of them pointed out that it could be Saket who was involved in the crime as around 10 days back too he had molested a 12-year-old girl from the colony. Saket was picked up on the same day for questioning during which he broke down and admitted to committing the crime. On Saturday, after his Covid-19 test turned out to be negative, he was arrested and produced before a special POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act) court on Sunday. Additional public prosecutor Kishore Revaliya said that Saket was remanded to police custody till May 5.

Hours after the election result to Nagarjuna Sagar constituency was announced wherein he was defeated by Nomula Bhagat of the TRS, Jana Reddy said: “I want to take rest and study the changing political scenario, strategies being adopted by various political parties, to promote social justice and what should be done to revive Congress. Accordingly, I will make suggestions to the party leadership,” he said. The 75-year-old veteran politician and former minister made it clear that it was his personal decision to temporarily quit from active politics due to various factors including age, ongoing pandemic and his health condition. “Neither am I tired of politics nor calling it quits permanently. I am not keen on contesting elections in future and want to play an advisory role in the party. However, if circumstances demand and party high command requests me, I will consider contesting elections in future,” he said. Jana Reddy called upon the party leaders and cadre not to lose heart because Congress lost the bypoll in Nagarjuna Sagar. “Congress lost a bypoll to TRS by just 10% vote difference. TRS got 47% vote share compared to 37% votes polled to me,” he said. Political analysts said the Congress was expecting to revive its electoral fortunes with a win in Nagarjuna Sagar bypoll. All is not lost for the Congress in Telangana as BJP does not have a vote base in rural areas. Jana polled over 70,000 votes in a bypoll against TRS and this performance must be seen as an inspiration to bounce back, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/jana-reddy-takes-a-break-from-active-politics/articleshow/82360562.cms||---

Congress retained the two seats — Sujangarh (Churu) and Sahara (Bhilwara) — that it held before the bypolls were necessitated and BJP kept Rajsamand. This, however, is in terms of the number of seats. As per voting percentage, the Congress has emerged the winner. From around 41% votes in the 2018 assembly election, it has now secured around 51% votes in the bypolls from these three seats. It has not only won Sahara and Sujangarh with huge margins but also consolidated its position in Rajsamand by reducing BJP’s victory margin of over 24,600 votes in 2018 to barely 5,300 votes in the bypoll. Since the bypolls were necessitated due to the deaths of sitting legislators on all three seats, both the political parties fielded kin of the deceased leaders. The ‘sympathy’ factor played a role in the victory of the candidates. Manoj Meghwal, the Congress candidate who won from Sujangarh and secured over 49% votes, is the son of former cabinet minister Bhanwar Lal Meghwal, who died of prolonged illness. Gayatri Devi, who won from Sahara with 58% votes, is the wife of former Congress MLA Kailash Trivedi, who died of post-corona complications. Similarly, Deepti Maheshwari, who won from Rajsamand with almost 50% votes, is the daughter of former BJP MLA Kiran Maheshwari, who too died of post-corona complications. Since 1965, this is the first time the sympathy factor has worked in Rajasthan assembly bypolls. Much before the results were officially declared, CM Ashok Gehlot tweeted congratulations to Congress candidates. “Rajsamand bypoll too was fought unitedly and BJP's margin of victory there is quite normal. People have strengthened our government with their support to Congress candidates. I express my gratitude to the voters,” Gehlot wrote. The better performance of Congress in the bypolls is being attributed to Gehlot’s Covid management too. Also, prior to the bypolls, the Congress was able to bring the warring factions of Gehlot and his former deputy Sachin Pilot together. The BJP, on the other hand, remained a divided party. Former chief minister Vasundhara Raje kept herself largely away from the bypolls, citing ill health of her daughter-in-law. Local factors too helped Congress significantly taking a march over BJP. The ‘Pitaliya factor’ backfired for the BJP in Sahara. BJP allegedly threatening and forcing its rebel leader Laduram Pitaliya to withdraw his nomination as an independent candidate did not go down well with the voters in Sahara. Congress recorded the biggest victory margin of over 42,200 votes here in the bypolls. In Rajsamand, the Leader of Opposition Gulab Chand Kataria irked the Rajput community with his crass remarks on Maharana Pratap during the bypoll campaign. Kataria later apologised but the damage was nearly done as the BJP barely managed to win with the sobbing appeals of its candidate to voters. In Sujangarh, a seat reserved for SC candidates, BJP appeared to be competing with the Rashtriya Loktantirk Party to finish second, while the Congress comfortably pocketed the seat with a margin of over 35,600 votes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-bypolls-status-quo-in-three-seats-but-congress-vote-share-up-since-18/articleshow/82361428.cms||Bhanupratap Singh

---||Hyderabad||BJP to recast strategy before assembly poll||HYDERABAD: Though the BJP Telangana unit gained a winning momentum after Dubbak and GHMC elections, Nagarjuanasagar by-poll slammed brakes on its forward march. The party did not hope to win the seat with only 7,676 votes, but would make party think-tank worry about their future plan of action. “The party nominee even losing deposit is certainly a big let down. We hoped to garner at least 30,000 votes,” a top BJP leader said. Party sources claim announcing the party candidate late and not many taking the  seriously were the major reasons for the poor performance in the by-poll. “Only a few leaders took the election seriously. Many were disappointed after the MLC poll result,” another source said. The situation makes imperative for BJP to show results to keep up the momentum it got as main opposition, surpassing Congress in the state. “Though Congress lost the seat, they displayed good voting pattern. We would like to change this situation before the assembly election,” another leader said. BJP has secured only 1% of votes in the last election and tried to tap the tribal vote base in the assembly segment by voicing the land parcel issues. “It seems even the tribals did not vote for our party. We really have to work hard in the future,” another leader said. Leaders analysed that not having a strong rank and file in the segment was also a setback, forcing activists from other districts to campaign there. Stung by the disappointment, none of the top leaders issued any statement about the result on Sunday. “This will also have a bearing on the three-member committee inquiring into the Lingojiguda ward issue,” another source said .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bjp-to-recast-strategy-before-assembly-poll/articleshow/82360577.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Pune||No respite from oxygen, medicine crunch for Pune hospitals||PUNE: Severe shortage of oxygen and essential medicines continued to compel hospitals to shift and stop admitting new Covid-19 patients in Pune on Sunday. However, a handful of hospitals also reported a slight improvement in the supply of medical oxygen in the last 48 hours. “Most hospitals continue to face severe shortage of medical grade oxygen and essential medicines such as remdesivir (for moderately-ill Covid patients) and tocilizumab (for severely-ill Covid patients) in Pune. It has been almost 20 days now and there has not been much respite in terms of improvements in these key medical resources,” said Sanjay Patil, the chairman of the Indian Medical Association’s (IMA), Hospital Board of India (HBI), Pune branch — an association of small and medium-sized hospitals in Pune. On Sunday, the Pune district received 4,200 vials of remdesivir, when the district’s daily demand has gone up to 16,000 vials, an FDA official said. Hospitals dependent on regular supplies of jumbo oxygen cylinders were compelled to search for oxygen or shift their admitted hypoxic patients needing oxygen support to big hospitals. “Shifting of such critical patients is difficult and risky. The condition of few patients is worsening after shifting in such distress. There is an urgent need to create more oxygen banks at strategic locations across the PMR. The oxygen cylinders in this bank can be used for hospitals, which have given out a distress call when they are rapidly running out of oxygen supply,” Patil said. Physician Aniket Joshi, who is attached with 10 small and medium hospitals treating Covid patients in Pune, underlined that supply of medical grade oxygen had started reporting a slight improvement in the last 48 hours. “However, this improvement has to be sustainable. I have seen almost 10% to 20% improvement in the supply of oxygen cylinders at the hospitals I am working with, since Saturday. But, I also know of hospitals that have put up boards outside their premises stating that they do not have oxygen, remdesivir and beds,” Joshi said. The continuous drop in the daily tally of positive cases in the PMR has also eased the stress on the stretched-out healthcare system. Smita Zagade, the deputy commissioner of Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC), said, “The supply of oxygen is still on a day-to-day basis, but has been streamlined across the civic and the private medical facilities.” “With the oxygen audit, we have managed to reduce the consumption of oxygen in bigger facilities such as Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial Hospital (YCMH) and the Annasaheb Magar stadium jumbo unit. We have reduced these two facilities’ oxygen consumption from around 40 tonne to now 37 tonne,” she said. Cylinder banks were being created in the Pune Municipal Corporation and the PCMC areas for emergencies. “We have reserved around 100 liquid medical oxygen cylinders for private hospitals. They can collect these cylinders in case of emergency. Around 40 to 50 cylinders are being used every day,” she said. “These are testing times and oxygen and other medical requirements need to be used judiciously,” said medical expert Dilip Kamat, the managing director of Kamat Hospital in Chinchwad.

---||India||Resolve Delhi’s oxygen crisis in 2 days, Supreme Court tells Centre||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has asked the Centre to rectify the oxygen issue of Delhi hospitals within two days, on or before the midnight of May 3. In an order, released late on Sunday night, the apex court ordered the Centre, in collaboration with other states, prepare a buffer stock of oxygen for emergency purposes and decentralise the location of emergency stocks. “Emergency stocks shall be created within next four days and is to be replenished on a day to day basis, in addition to existing allocation of oxygen supply to States,” the SC said in its order passed on suo motu case initiated by it on issues related to oxygen supply etc in relation to Covid. The apex court also ordered that the Centre shall, within two weeks, formulate a national policy on admissions to hospitals which shall be followed by all state governments. It said that central and state governments shall notify all chief secretaries/DGP/CP that any clampdown on information on social media or harassment caused to individuals seeking/delivering help on any platform will attract a coercive exercise of jurisdiction by this court. Till the formulation of such a national policy by the central government, no patient shall be denied hospitalisation or essential drugs in any state/UT for lack of local residential proof of that state/UT or even in the absence of identity proof, the court ordered. It also directed the Centre shall revisit its initiatives and protocols, including on availability of oxygen, availability and pricing of vaccines, availability of essential drugs at affordable prices and respond on all other issues highlighted in this order before the next date of hearing. “We would seriously urge the central and state governments to consider imposing a ban on mass gatherings and super spreader events. They may also consider imposing a lockdown to curb the virus in the second wave in the interest of public welfare,” the apex court said. “Having said that, we are cognisant of socio-economic impact of a lockdown, specifically, on the marginalised communities. Thus, in case the measure of a lockdown is imposed, arrangements must be made beforehand to cater to the needs of these communities,” said the court in its order. It said that in light of the continuing surge of infections in the second wave of the pandemic, the court directed the Centre and state governments to put on record the efforts taken to curb the spread of the virus and the measures that they plan on taking in the near future. The court said the Centre should also consider using healthcare workforce available with the armed forces and paramilitary forces for the purpose of vaccination. It took notice of the fact that several critical drugs, used to treat Covid-19, such as Remdesivir and Tocilizumab, are being sold at inflated prices or in fake forms and said that this is a “condemnable attempt to exploit people’s misery and profit from their helplessness”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/resolve-delhis-oxygen-crisis-in-2-days-supreme-court-tells-centre/articleshow/82362837.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi hospitals gasp for oxygen, send SOS||NEW DELHI: There was no respite from the erratic oxygen supply for the capital’s hospitals on Sunday with several of them sending out SOS messages and virtually begging on social media, saying their stocks would last only for a few minutes or hours. The Delhi government continued to do crisis management by rushing emergency supplies but the panic kept on mounting in the city. Around 2:45 pm, Hamdard Institute of Medical Science and Research (HAHC) at Hamdard Nagar began asking its patients to make alternative arrangements as its oxygen supply would get exhausted by 5 pm. Dr. Ajaz Mustafa, medical superintendent, told TOI that they had approached all officials concerned, including additional secretary (health), SDM, nodal officer for private hospitals in Delhi and transport commissioner, since the lives of over a hundred Covid patients was hanging in the balance. “We sent our staff members with empty cylinders to Palwal and then Mohan Estate but were turned away,” said Dr. Mustafa. At 4.44 pm, one of the hospital’s doctors, Dr Aqsa Shaikh, sent out an SOS on twitter saying, “HAHC hospital, liquid medical oxygen (LMO) available for ½ hour. Supplier Seth Trader not responding to calls, refused supply of LMO or cylinders till May 3. Last LMO was received at 7 am on May 2. Cylinders will last for 30 mins.” The doctor added that if no help reached them, the Batra tragedy could be repeated here. At 5:49 pm, Shaikh tweeted they had received the supply which will last for 12 hours. Batra Hospital — a day after 12 people lost their lives here because of shortage of oxygen — managed to get 2,500 litres from Inox at 11:30 am. However, there are still 317 patients in the Covid ward and the total oxygen available with the hospital is 4,500 litres which it said would last till 12 pm. “We are playing with fire and don’t know whom to appeal to every day, every hour to get uninterrupted supply of oxygen,” said an exasperated Dr SCL Gupta, medical director. “We have stopped admitting new patients and even promised the administration that we will reduce the number of Covid beds but we can’t ask people to leave immediately. We have sent an appeal to the nodal officer and DM to arrange for supply of 8,000 litres of oxygen which will last for 24 hours, and after that we will relieve some people.” Meanwhile, a crisis was brewing at a children’s hospital in Malviya Nagar. At 10:27 am, Rainbow Children’s Hospital tweeted, “We have oxygen supply till 12 noon at hospital. We request consistent supply of liquid oxygen.” Hospital head Dr. Dinesh Vashisht said, “We raised an alarm after the supplier refused to help. There are 80-90 patients in the hospital and 50 are children. These include 15 newborns, at the most two days old and on oxygen support. In fact, two of them are on ventilators. We need 100-120 cylinders every day but there is no assurance from the authorities. Three-four days back, we had faced a similar crisis which is why doctors are under severe stress.” Reacting to the SOS, AAP MLA Raghav Chadha tweeted at 11:57 am, “We have arranged for five D type oxygen cylinders from Rajghat response point. The government oxygen reserves are extremely limited due to reduced supply to Delhi but we are doing everything possible to avert any untoward accident.” The hospital later managed to get the cylinders but the administration said the supply will last only for five hours. Vimhans Hospital in south Delhi also issued an SOS in the evening saying they had oxygen for only three-and-a-half hours. “Linde is refusing to supply and doesn’t have stocks for the next seven days to meet our requirement which was earlier being met by Inox and has been assigned to Linde as per a GOI order dated May 1. There are ninety four ICU patients (40 on ventilators) and 41 on oxygenated beds. We need urgent support to save these precious lives,” said hospital CEO Yateesh Wahaal. After strenuous efforts, a 3,000-litre oxygen tanker was mobilised by the Delhi government at 8:45 pm when the hospital said it would run out of oxygen in an hour. “But our worries didn’t end as there was a mismatch between the plug of the tanker and our requirement. So, we needed alternative arrangements,” Wahaal told TOI in the evening. Across the town in Dwarka, the situation was grim at Aakash Healthcare in Dwarka which appealed to the authorities to shift patients to other facilities “so that they can be saved”. “CRY FOR HELP: Received only 5 #oxygen cylinders after running around the entire day, not more than 60 mins left to save the lives of more than 250 patients,” a tweet posted from the hospital's handle at 4:32 pm read. The hospital managed to get sufficient supply in the evening. “For god’s sake please help us to save 100s of patients admitted in our hospital. We are struggling to get oxygen supply to keep them alive,” mentioned Holy Family Hospital in its tweet at 1:08 pm and tagged the Prime Minister’s Office and union health minister among others. The Delhi government has been demanding 976 metric tonnes of oxygen from the Centre against the existing allotted quota of 590 MT. On Friday, the city administration received just 312 MT, an official said. At Sitaram Bhartia Hospital, provision for oxygen cylinders was made to provide relief for two-three hours at 6:10 pm but soon the hospital took to twitter once again. “We have still not received liquid oxygen and are in an extremely tight situation,” tweeted the hospital at 8:19 pm. There are around 45 Covid patients admitted here. The hospital was getting ready for another long night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hospitals-gasp-for-oxygen-send-sos/articleshow/82360650.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Chandigarh||As Covid-19 drags on, patients under home isolation in Panchkula are a harried lot||PANCHKULA: With the spike in the number of Covid-19 cases, the positive patients in Panchkula, who are under home isolation, are a harried lot. Unaware of the next immediate steps to be taken after turning infected, they are only dependent on their friends, who have recovered from the deadly virus. “After developing symptoms, I got myself tested after two days at the Panchkula civil hospital. When I enquired about my report, I was asked to come and collect it from the hospital. There is no system in place. There too, I had to wait for at least an hour for my report. After a week, on Sunday, a few health workers visited me and gave me medicines,” said one of the Covid-19 patients, who did not wish to be named. Another patient said, “We are confused. We don’t know whom to contact and which doctor to approach for tele-consultation. The authorities should at least circulate a list of doctors who are treating patients via video calls or tele-consultation.” The system of sanitising the houses of positive patients is missing. Garbage lifting vans are not picking up waste from the houses of Covid-19 patients. A patient complained that his house was not sanitised after he tested positive and there is no system of picking up garbage from houses of patients. MC commissioner R K Singh said, “We have a helpline (18001802013) which is functional on all working days from 9am to 5pm. We have a system wherein dedicated workers pick-up garbage from the houses of Covid-19 patients and their houses are sanitised. If there are lapses in the same, I will get it checked.” Regarding teams getting in touch with patients under home isolation, deputy commissioner Mukesh Ahuja said, “Teams do get in touch with patients under home isolation. We provide medicines too. Due to large number of cases being reported not only from the district, but from other states too, there is a panic and confusion among patients.” About lapses in some cases where patients have not been contacted in time, he said he would get it checked. The city has many Covid-19 positive young couples, who have small kids. Some do not have a third helping hand to take care of their children. City-based paediatrician Dr Rajiv Arya says, “Rules are similar for such parents who have tested positive and do not have a helping hand at home. For precaution, children of positive parents are also tested and if they are negative, parents must stay masked at all times. It is also very important for them to change their masks every six to eight hours. The used masks should be disposed of after disinfecting the same.” “I have been giving tele-consultation to as many as 50 patients under home isolation. They need regular monitoring. It is essential to check their vitals regularly,” says city-based Dr Naresh Gupta. “I am available for patients under home isolation. They can contact me for tele-consultation or any of their attendants can visit my hospital and I can then help them with video-call facility,” says city-based Dr Manoj Gupta. There is no list of doctors issued by the administration, who offer tele-consultation to patients under home isolation. The chief medical officer (CMO) could not be contacted despite repeated calls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/as-covid-19-drags-on-patients-under-home-isolation-in-pkl-are-a-harried-lot/articleshow/82359989.cms||---

Thanks to swift action of the administration a similar tragedy was averted at a Jamnagar hospital. On Saturday evening Samir Sarda, deputy superintendent of Police of Khambhalia in Devbhoomi Dwarka district, received an SOS call from Jamnagar’s Swaminarayan Covid-19 hospital. Officials of the hospital informed Sarda, who is also the nodal officer for supply at the Padana oxygen plant, that they have oxygen stock to last for just 30 minutes. Total 28 patients were undergoing treatment at the Swaminarayan Covid-19 Hospital and they urgently needed the oxygen. The administration acted swiftly and the police created a ‘green corridor’ for quick movement of the oxygen tanker from the Padana plant to Swaminarayan Hospital. The oxygen tanker reached the hospital just at the nick of time. “This was a really emergency situation and we immediately filled an oxygen tanker from Padana’s plant and provided police piloting to the oxygen tanker so that it did not face traffic hurdle. The tanker reached hospital in time, covering around 25kms in just 25 minutes,” Sarda told TOI.The oxygen plant based in Padana village near Reliance’s refinery, supplies oxygen to home quarantine people and hospitals in Devbhoomi Dwarka and Jamnagar districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/timely-oxygen-supply-saves-lives-of-28-covid-19-patients/articleshow/82360005.cms||---

Anil Arora, who is part of a volunteer group in Haridwar, told TOI, “We receive 100 to 150 requests for plasma on a daily basis but have been able to provide it to only a few patients so far. It is not easy to trace people who have recovered from the infection and developed antibodies. However, we are trying to spread awareness so that more recovered patients come forward to donate plasma. We are also doing coordination work to find leads on ventilators, ICU and oxygen beds with the help of Uttaranchal Punjabi Mahasabha. We have arranged for oxygen cylinders and flowmeters for those in need.” Aman and Ekta Hans, a city-based couple who own a beauty salon, have been providing home-cooked meals for free to families which have tested positive for the virus. “We receive 100 calls on a daily basis and are arranging for home-cooked meals at their doorsteps. We have also hired two ambulances and offer these for free for those who need it urgently,” Aman Hans told TOI. Meanwhile, a city-based property dealer Bhupendra Kumar is helping bodies get a dignified cremation. “Often, relatives and neighbours of those who die of Covid-19 are not ready to conduct the last rites for fear of contracting the virus. Even when it’s a normal death, people are suspicious and back out of the cremation. Only recently, a young dietician died at her home in Kankhal area and no one came to help the family cremate her. We brought the body to Kankhal crematorium and performed last rites. We are also offering wood for cremation for free,” Kumar told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/from-sourcing-oxygen-icu-beds-to-providing-aid-in-cremations-haridwar-residents-chip-in-to-help/articleshow/82359995.cms||MS Nawaz
---||Chennai||Team DMK wins 158 seats as TN votes for change, Muthuvel Karunanidhi Stalin to become CM||CHENNAI: On a sunny day when people kept indoors for the fear of the pandemic, a 68-year-old man, a prince long in waiting, stepped out of the shadows of his late father and marched towards Fort St George. It was time for the coronation of Muthuvel Karunanidhi Stalin. DMK chief M K Stalin emerged as a leader in his own right by leading his alliance to a 158-seat victory in the 234-member Tamil Nadu assembly on Sunday (As of 9.30pm Sunday, DMK alone had won 131 seats). The party, too, made history as it had not won more than 100 seats in assembly polls in nearly 25 years. For the DMK satrap, who joined the party as a student, his first assembly poll victory after taking over the reins comes after an impressive performance by the DMK and its allies, including the Congress and the Left, in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. He will be the third chief minister of the DMK, after party-founder C N Annadurai and his father M Karunanidhi. The 158-seat victory was fought on several planks and in the absence of Karunanidhi and former AIADMK leader J Jayalalithaa. While the AIADMK won in 66 constituencies, its allies BJP and PMK won four and five seats respectively. In the DMK alliance, the Congress too performed well, winning 17 of the 25 seats it fought. The AIADMK’s quota politics seem to have hit several constituencies with an anti-vanniyar (north) and mukkulathor (south) consolidation helping DMK’s victory. In the evening, Stalin, in a statement, thanked the people of Tamil Nadu for helping his party win. “I thank Tamil people for its mandate for the DMK for the sixth time to govern the state,” he said. “I will be true to you. I will work for you. My thoughts and actions would always be for the people of Tamil Nadu,” he said. The poll victory was a validation of the good work done by the DMK as a ruling party as well as a social movement for more than 50 years, he said. Later in the day, Stalin accepted his victory certificate from the returning officer of Kolathur seat which he won by 70,230 votes. He then went to his father’s memorial to pay his respects... It was an intensely fought election with rival AIADMK, which had governed Tamil Nadu for a decade, putting up a hard fight. But anti-incumbency, anti-caste consolidation and alliance arithmetic appear to have tilted the balance in DMK’s favour, demolishing the ‘dynasty politics’ and ‘unruly party” campaigns spearheaded by AIADMK’s CM candidate Edappadi K Palaniswami and allies BJP and PMK. Competitive populism dominated this election too with both the AIADMK and the DMK offering sops to various sections, particularly farmers, women and young voters. Both the parties promised delta farmers crop loan waiver. The AIADMK government went ahead and began the process of issuing waiver certificates. But the DMK has reaped the benefit with the party and allies winning the most number of seats in central Tamil Nadu. The AIADMK notched impressive wins in the western region, dominated by the Vellalar Gounders (BC), a community from which EPS hails. Keeping with TN’s traditional voting practice, this time too, a good number of AIADMK wins were from rural areas and a significant number of DMK’s gains were in urban and semi-urban segments. As for seats with minorities, DMK has surprisingly not done too well. AIADMK despite the BJP alliance has won eight of the 27 seats with more than 20% minority population. The remaining seats went to the DMK bloc. Stalin can be largely credited with the victory of the DMK-led alliance, having almost single-handedly lead the campaign of his party and allies Congress, MDMK, VCK, CPI and CPM besides some minor partners. A united DMK, some meticulous strategizing by poll strategist Prashant Kishor’s I-PAC team and sustained campaigns like ‘Ondrinaivom Vaa’ (April 2020) in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic and the final ‘Stalin thaan varaaru, vidiyalai thara poraru’ (Stalin will win; he will give a new dawn) helped steer the party to victory. Stalin’s promise to resolve public grievances within the first 100 days of his assuming office and going around the state with a grievance box seem to have struck a chord. The low winning margins in many constituencies, however, indicate that Palaniswmi’s performance as chief minister may have won him good support. Besides, the AIADMK’s campaign theme that described the DMK as a “corporate firm where only the family can become a CM” and harped on the alleged reputation of DMK as “a rowdy party” may have hit a raw nerve. But it appears that CM Palaniswami’s decision to give in to ally PMK’s demand for 10.5% internal quota for vanniyar community within the 20% reservation for the MBC (Most Backward Classes) may have triggered a caste backlash in the north and central regions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/team-dmk-wins-158-seats-as-tn-votes-for-change-stalin-to-become-cm/articleshow/82361435.cms||---

The event was a Kisan-Mazdoor Mahapanchayat and Tikait claimed no one had been infected during the farmers’ agitation. He alleged: "The government is trying to end our agitation in the name of Covid-19 but we are building concrete houses on the site. We’ll dig in till November and December." The rally at Dhurali had no social distancing or the participants in masks, so the Ambala police booked the organisers. Tikait, his farmer union’s Haryana state president Rattan Maan, division president Baldev Singh, district president Jasmer Saini, Lavneet Behgal, Kapil Sharma, nephew Sanjeev Chaudhary, youth state president Ravi Azad, national general secretary Yudhvir Singh, and members Harpreet Singh, Inderpal Singh, and Mihan Singh were booked on the complaint of assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Chandi Ram under Section 51 of the Disaster Management Act, and sections 188 (defying public servant), 269 (negligent act), and 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at Ambala Sadar police station. ASI Chandi Ram stated in his complaint, "Tikait gathered 250-odd people at Dhurali, who refused to go home. They put lives in danger." Tikait told the media on Saturday: "Healthcare is the central government’s responsibility. Looking at the oxygen crisis, the Prime Minister should resign."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/tikait-booked-for-rally-amid-curbs/articleshow/82360671.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘There is no need for antibody test post-Covid vaccination’||While it is a new national past-time to get an antibody test after taking the Covid-19 vaccine, experts are divided about its merits. Dr Jayanthi Shastri, who heads BMC’s molecular diagnostics laboratory in Kasturba Hospital believes antibody tests are best as a research tool. Dr Shastri, whose lab was the first to conduct the Covid-19 test in Mumbai and is the author of many Covid-19 research papers, said that many labs offer tests that give a false sense of security to patients. In an interview with TOI, Dr Shastri said a new study done in Nair hospital (where she heads the microbiology department) shows that vaccine recipients invariably develop the most important antibody—the neutralizing one. Q: Please tell us about the antibodies found in response to a Covid-19 infection or to the vaccination. A: In response to Covid-19, two types of antibodies are produced—nucleocapsid antibodies that wane within 3-4 months, and the spike antibodies that develop in 4-5 weeks after the infection. In response to vaccination, only spike antibodies are generated. There are commercially available kits that measure total spike antibodies (S1 and S2) and some other tests that measure the spike receptor binding antibodies (RBD) antibodies. The neutralizing antibody is a part of the RBD of the spike protein. Q: What is the role of neutralizing antibodies? A: Neutralizing antibodies develop post vaccination and protect against severe infection. At present, we kn-ow that their presence is effective against most variants of SARS-CoV-2, but what is not established is the quantity of neutralizing antibodies required to confer protection. Q: Your team in Nair hospital has done studies in this regard. Can you share your findings? A: In the third week of April, we started a study to check the antibodies generated in response to the Covid vaccine. We enrolled 60 healthcare workers and tested their samples three weeks after they had received the second dose of Covishield vaccine. We looked for S1 RBD antibodies by using a test kit approved only for research use. All 60 had developed neutralizing antibodies in varying proportions. While five of them did not have the RBD antibodies, they still had neutralizing antibodies. This is very reassuring. We’ll continue this study and also enrol healthcare workers who have taken the Covaxin vaccine. Q: It has become the norm for vaccine recipients to get their antibodies tested. Is it scientifically recommended? A: There are two tests—one looks at the total binding antibodies (S1 and S2), the second looks for RBD. The total antibodies test is done by private labs, but it doesn’t correspond to neutralizing antibodies. There is no recommendation that we should test. The total S1&S2 IgG antibodies are given out as neutralizing antibodies, which is erroneous. Q: What is your advice to people about vaccination and antibody tests? A: The total antibody test has no value. It doesn’t translate into the definite presence of neutralizing antibodies. There is no need for antibody test post-vaccination as our studies have shown that the vaccines are mounting an adequate amount of neutralizing antibody response.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-there-is-no-need-for-antibody-test-post-covid-vaccination/articleshow/82361446.cms||---

In his nine-minute-long address on Sunday, CM Rawat said that the state government is working round the clock to tackle the Covid-19 crisis in the state. He said that the state government is working with full vigor to ensure an uninterrupted supply of oxygen, medicines, equipment and other facilities required for the treatment and prevention of Covid-19. “We have recently added 132 more ambulances — including 36 with advanced life support and 96 with basic life support — in the fleet of 108 emergency services,” said CM Rawat. The CM urged people to follow all Covid-19 precautions and get themselves tested if they develop symptoms. He said that the state government has provided toll-free numbers and WhatsApp numbers to provide people with information on Covid-19. One can consult doctors directly by contacting these numbers, said CM Rawat. “The state government received 7,500 Remedesivir injections from Ahmedabad on April 27. Just two days ago, we again received a consignment of 2,000 more Remedesivir vials,” the CM said. He also pointed out that the state government has given the go-ahead to all MLAs to sanction Rs 1 crore from their MLALAD fund for undertaking Covid-related works in their constituencies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/in-his-first-virtual-address-cm-says-ukhand-govt-doing-its-best-to-address-the-covid-19-crisis/articleshow/82360024.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Shiromani Akali Dal factions may announce party||CHANDIGARH: Breakaway Akali leaders Sukhdev Singh Dhinda and Ranjit Singh Brahmpura, who have dissolved their political outfits, are likely to set up a new political outfit on May 3. Karnail Singh Peermohammad, a functionary of the Brahmpura-headed SAD (Taksali), confirmed the development. He said some other senior leaders like Navjot Singh Sidhu, Sukhpal Singh Khaira, MLA brothers Simrajit Singh Bains and Balwinder Singh Bains, Pargat Singh and Dharamvira Gandhi may also be approached to join the new political outfit.  Peermohammad said there was excitement around the new party. “They (people) want to get rid of the Badals and the Congress, and it would be in the larger interest of the state that leaders from like-minded parties like Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), AAP and others came on a common platform,” Peermohammad said. “Though the government has put up many restrictions due to Covid-19, it cannot be an excuse for us to sit idle and waste time. It is the appropriate time to do something for the betterment of Punjab. Our leaders are serious about providing all like-minded parties a common platform to fight against the traditional political parties,” Peermohammad said. Dhindsa and Brahmpura also congratulated all TMC workers and leaders, including Mamata Banerjee, for winning the elections in West Bengal. They said those who practice politics under the guise of religion and communalism had suffered a humiliating defeat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sad-factions-may-announce-party/articleshow/82360748.cms||---

Gaul is entirely occupied by the Romans. Well, not entirely...” Cut to the chase, the lines can be used for a quaint little hamlet in our home state, nestled amid the pandemic ravaged Rajkot district, that is still holding its fort against the dreaded invader, Covid-19.While the the little group of dauntless Gauls in Asterix’s village succeeded in stalling the mighty Ceaser with their druid’s ‘magic potion’, villagers of this nondescript Jasvantpara village in Lodhika taluka have made themselves invincible with self-discipline and strict enforcement of Covid guidelines.“Not a single case of Covid-19 has been reported from our village till now let alone about the death. There are 300 people living in 50 houses. Thanks to strict collective enforcement of the guidelines,” says Babubhai Hirani, deputy Sarpanch of the village.He further said that the villages have shunned celebrations for safety besides banning entry of vendors and hawkers into the village. “All shops are closed. No woman is allowed to leave the village to even visit their maternal home,” Hirani added.“We fetch vegetables from the village and sell these from a school campus,” explained the leader about the special arrangement of vegetable purchase made in the village. People don't need to go outside the village to purchase any essential items. “Moreover, half of the villagers have taken vaccination too. All these steps helped us keep the virus from entering our village,” Hirani claimed. Every villagers has been sensitized about sanitation and good hygiene practices. Face masks and hand sanitisers have been made available at every house, ensuring self protection begins at individual homes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/village-with-healthy-habits-in-rajkot-frustrates-covids-designs/articleshow/82360038.cms||---

Despite Sivasenapathy posing a tough challenge, Velumani secured 1,23,538 votes, which was 41,709 votes more than the runner-up. Sivasenapathy polled 81,829 votes.In Valparai, one of the first constituencies where results were declared, AIADMK candidate T K Amul Kandasami defeated his rival DMK candidate by scoring 70,957 votes. Valparai, along with constituencies like Kavundampalayam, were surprise wins for AIADMK as several predictions had suggested that the segments were favourable for DMK. Pollachi also was a surprise win for former deputy assembly speaker Pollachi V Jayaraman, though the victory could be achieved only with a thin margin. DMK had fielded K Varadharajan against Jayaraman, who got 77,650 votes, about 2,000 less than Jayaraman. Inspite of DMK mounting a scathing attack on Jayaraman by bringing up the Pollachi sex scandal, AIADMK managed to win the seat. In 2019 Lok Sabha polls, AIADMK was defeated in the segment.For the third time, DMK failed in its effort to make inroads into Coimbatore. The last time DMK won several seats in Coimbatore was in 2006.Coimbatore North was yet another constituency where AIADMK had a tough challenge because AIADMK candidate Amman K Arjunan was from the neighbouring constituency while DMK candidate V M Shanmugasundaram was from Vadavalli locality. But Arjunan won the seat.One of the biggest disappointments for DMK was in Singanallur, where incumbent MLA N Karthik was fielded again. Though he had won the segment in 2016 despite a statewide defeat for DMK, this time, Karthik had to taste defeat. Lesser-known K R Jayaram, fielded by AIADMK, defeated Karthik as well as MNM vice-president R Mahendran.In Kavundampalayam, the odds were stacked against AIADMK. P R G Arun Kumar was considered an outsider in the segment, while Payya Gounder alias Krishnan was a native of the constituency. However, he polled about 10,000 votes more than Gounder.In Mettupalayam and Sulur also, the DMK front suffered a drubbing. Mettupalayam AIADMK candidate A K Selvaraj won the seat by securing 1,04,632 votes, while his opponent DMK candidate T R Shanmugasundaram secured 1,01,451 votes.Incumbent AIADMK MLA V P Kandasamy won the Sulur assembly seat for the second consecutive time by securing 1,17,509 votes.

The government has launched phase 3 of the drive on May 1. There were as many as 1,342 beneficiaries from the 18-44 age group across 19 vaccination sites in the district on Saturday. On Sunday, the inoculation numbers increased to 2,325 beneficiaries in the Pune Metropolitan Region. The office of the deputy director of the health services said till they get fresh stock of vaccines from the Centre, the drive for the 45 plus age group has been put on hold. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI, “We received around 20,000 Covishield doses on April 30 for the Pune district for the vaccination drive for the 18-44 age group. We distributed 10,000 doses to Pune rural and 5,000 doses each to Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal corporations.” According to Deshmukh, the vaccination drive for those above 45 years of age is on hold till they get more doses. “We will not mix and match and the drive will go on as per the vaccine distribution from either the state or the Union government,” he said. Deshmukh said they could increase the vaccination sites if the stock provided is ample. “Our vaccination preparedness is of high standards. We have the experience of running 600 such sites in the district. If we get a consistent vaccine stock, we could speed up the drive,” he said. On the availability of Covaxin for the 18-44 age group, he said they have got word from the state government that around five lakh Covaxin doses will be made available soon. “As soon as we get this stock it will be made available for the 18 to 44 age group,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/over-3k-in-phase-iii-roll-out-inoculated-across-district/articleshow/82360734.cms||Piyush Bhusari

AIADMK’s Pon Jayaseelan secured 64,496 votes and won the seat with a margin of 1,945 votes against DMK candidate S Kasilingam who polled 62,551 votes.Since 1971, DMK has won six times in the constituency. In the 2016 assembly election, DMK retained the Gudalur segment with the party’s candidate K Thiravidamani winning for the second time.“Thiravidamani was a people’s MLA. But this time, DMK nominated a new candidate and lost,” said a party cadre.DMK regained the Coonoor constituency from AIADMK this time. Former minister and DMK candidate K Ramachandran polled 61,820 votes and won with a margin of 4,105 votes against his rival D Vinoth of AIADMK who polled 57,715 votes.The AIADMK won the Coonoor constituency after 25 years in 2016. DMK had always been holding the constituency as its fort.Another reason for the DMK’s victory in the constituency could well be attributed to the selection of the right candidate. “Ramachandran always holds a good rapport with the locals and his community people Badagas,” M Kannan, a resident of Coonoor, said.In the Ooty constituency, while R Ganesh of Congress won for the second time and retained his MLA seat by polling 65,530 votes, his rival BJP candidate M Bhojarajan, a new face, secured 60,182 votes.“The Nilgiris is a Congress stronghold. Ganesh was a right candidate chosen by the party.

---||Coimbatore||Hat-trick win for EPS, pockets Edappadi seat with huge margin||Edappadi K Palaniswami has continued his winning streak in the Edappadi assembly segment marking a hat-trick victory.Palaniswami retained his seat with one of the highest victory margins that the state saw in this election, but one of the lowest for EPS compared to his winning margins in 2016 and 2011 elections.He had polled 1,63,154 votes while his opponent of DMK candidate T Sampath Kumar was polled 69,352, accounting for a margin of 93,802 votes. Right from the counting of postal votes began, EPS was way ahead of Sampath Kumar. His margin only grew with every passing round.However, EPS stay put at his house throughout the day. Palaniswami did not visit the counting centre and chose not to entertain any visitors at his house at Nedunchalai Nagar near Suramangalam in Salem city since morning.Sources said Palaniswami was upset over the defeat of AIADMK. It was his advocate and agent Thangamani who received the winning declaration on behalf of EPS.Nevertheless, his victory has come as a morale booster to the party cadres across the state. Backed by multiple factors like the CM candidate tag, infrastructure projects he brought to the region and the large vanniyar votes consolidated by the 10.5 % quota, EPS sailed through anti–incumbency wave successfully. The low-key image of his principal opponent Sambath Kumar from DMK also worked to his advantage.While many of his counterparts in Salem district as well as in the western region got trounced, EPS not only won but emerged victorious by a huge margin.In fact, it was an uphill task for the DMK right from the beginning to capture ‘the impenetrable fortress’ as EPS calls Edappadi.The last time DMK won the Edappadi segment was five decades back when AIADMK was not founded. From the very first full-fledged assembly elections AIADMK faced in 1977 after it was founded, M G Ramachandran’s writ ran large in Edappadi. Since then AIADMK won the segment six times. EPS’s track record in Edappadi is enviable, as he has won four out of the six times in the past, starting from his maiden election in 1989 when he contested on behalf of J Jayalalithaa faction.However, EPS was in no mood to take chances in this election. He was there in the constituency every weekend, holding meetings with officials, discussing with party functionaries, and receiving petitions from the public. Almost every second month he would chair a government event in Salem making announcements about new projects ranging from flyovers to Amma mini-clinics.But poll pundits say more than anything else, it was the PMK’s vanniyar vote bank that played a key role in helping EPS tide over the DMK wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/hat-trick-win-for-eps-pockets-edappadi-seat-with-huge-margin/articleshow/82361444.cms||---

While the requirement is of 7MT of oxygen per day, the allocation is of 2.55 MT. It is becoming difficult to even get that much oxygen daily. We averted a crisis on Monday, thanks to some leftover oxygen and oxygen concentrators. But it is becoming a problem to run the centre like this,” said an official. The official added that a team of ITBP officials had rushed to an oxygen plant of BHEL in Haridwar, and hopefully by Monday night, some oxygen would be arranged. Both ITBP and the South district officials couldn’t be contacted for comments. Some families TOI reached out to at the centre said that there was no oxygen supply on Monday and they managed with the concentrators.

Also, according to the sources in the health department, inoculation of people above 18 years of age is not expected to start in the hill state anytime soon as the vaccine makers are yet to give any affirmative response on allotment of vaccines to the state so far. “We had sent a proposal to the vaccine manufacturing companies within 72 hours of the Centre announcing vaccination for the 18 plus age group. They have said that they will give us the doses. But when and in what quantity is yet to be disclosed by the vaccine manufacturers,” said Dr Saroj Naithani, director, NHM, Uttarakhand. Over 50lakh population in Uttarakhand falls in the category between 18 to 45 years of age and the state government has earmarked a budget of Rs 450 crore for the vaccination exercise. According to a senior health department official, the vaccine companies are claiming to be in short supply as they are already sending huge stocks to the Centre for vaccination of people above 45 years of age and the manufacturing capacity is limited. “We are expecting to get vaccines to start inoculation of 18 plus people not before May 10,” he added. Meanwhile, with barely 25,000 vaccines left on Saturday, the health department could do the inoculation of around 6,000 people on Sunday. As a fresh lot of vaccines, approved by the Centre, are expected to arrive 1pm on Monday, vaccination will remain hampered, as it will take at least 10 hours to the vials to reach the concerned districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/vaccination-for-18-unlikely-to-start-before-may-10-in-uttarakhand/articleshow/82360043.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Pune||Pune: Three nabbed for issuing fake RT-PCR test reports||PUNE: The Pimpri Chinchwad police on Saturday arrested three employees of a pathology laboratory in Chikhali for issuing fake RT-PCR tests reports to 62 employees of a private company. The suspects used two RT-PCR test reports — one positive and one negative — carried out by a lab in Kothrud, altered those reports and issued them to the employees. “They used the altered negative report and issued it to 59 employees and three were given the positive report,” inspector Dattatreya Gulig of Mhalunge chowkey told TOI. The fraud came to the light when the officials of the company checked the bar codes and found that these reports were issued to two other persons. “When the company contacted the laboratory in Kothrud, it was found that the lab did not conduct the tests of their employees and the reports were fake,” Gulig said. Gulig added, “After receiving the complaint, the police arrested Baliram Londhe (24), Birudev Waghmode (22) and Suraj Shelke (21) all from Chikhali. The suspects were the employees of a pathology lab in Chikhali.” The trio has been remanded in police custody till Tuesday. The company again conducted the RT-PCRT test of all the employees and their results are awaited. Pimpri Chinchwad police commissioner Krishna Prakash has appealed to all the companies to verify the reports by checking bar codes while conducting RT-PCR tests for their employees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/3-nabbed-for-issuing-fake-rt-pcr-test-reports/articleshow/82360742.cms||---

He was injured after being hit by a car at a naka in Sector 20 on the night of April 10. Sector 19 police had registered an attempt to murder case against the car driver and arrested him. Victim Ramesh Chand was posted at Sector 19 police station and deployed at the naka near petrol filling station at the turn of Sector 20-C-D. He, along with other cops, was checking motorists around 8pm. Ramesh noticed a Chevrolet Cruze car coming towards the naka and he signalled the driver to stop. The driver allegedly accelerated and hit Ramesh and fled the spot. Injured Ramesh was rushed to GMCH-32 in a PCR van, but doctors referred him to PGI, where he battled for life for 21 days. On the statement of constable Parvesh, Sector 19 police booked the car driver and after verifying the registration number arrested BA student Paras Arora, 20, of Sector 20.

---||Pune||Auto cluster facility doc among 3 medicos held on charges of extortion, cheating||Pimpri Chinchwad: The Pimpri Chinchwad police on Sunday arrested three doctors on the charge of accepting Rs1 lakh from a woman patient on April 23 to admit her to the 200-bedded dedicated Covid hospital at the auto cluster in Chinchwad. The facility has been set up for providing free Covid-19 treatment and a private hospital had referred the woman patient for further treatment. “One of these doctors is working at the auto cluster facility and the other two are from the private hospital and are accused of having taken a commission of Rs20,000 from the auto cluster doctor for patient transfer,” ACP Sagar Kawde of the Pimpri Chinchwad police told TOI. “They were arrested on the basis of the FIR lodged by Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation’s (PCMC) additional municipal commissioner Ulhas Jagtap. We have evidence against the trio,” Pimpri Chinchwad’s deputy commissioner of police Manchak Ipper told TOI. “There are no charges for admission to the facility and yet the doctor forced her relatives to give Rs1 lakh to arrange the bed for here. The woman succumbed to the virus during treatment. Her relatives had raised this issue,” an officer from the Pimpri Chinchwad police said. Kawde told TOI, “We have applied charges under sections 384 (extortion), 420 (cheating) and 406 (criminal breach of trust) of the Indian Penal Code against the three doctors.” The FIR stated, “The auto cluster facility was started for free treatment of Covid-19 patients. The contract of the facility has been given to Fortune Sparsh healthcare private limited. In the PCMC general body meeting on Apirl 30, the corporators made some allegations against Fortune Sparsh healthcare private limited, stating that the three doctors--one from the auto cluster and two from private hospitals allegedly took Rs1 lakh to admit the patient at the facility.” PCMC commissioner Rajesh Patil told TOI that the complaint was first raised by two corporators and assuming the gravity of the situation, they proceeded with the FIR. Patil added that henceforth admissions at the Auto Cluster facility will be made only through recommendations from the Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial Hospital’s triage area doctors where the initial inspection of patients is done and mode of treatment is suggested. “Direct admissions will not be allowed,” he said. Amol Holkunde, CEO of Sparsh hospital refuted the allegations made against their doctor saying that the private hospital doctors could be involved in charging money from needy patients, but not those from their facility. “This is a free facility available to citizens, the allegations made against us are baseless,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/auto-cluster-facility-doc-among-3-medicos-held-on-charges-of-extortion-cheating/articleshow/82360737.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Coimbatore||Winners & losers in sombre mood||Coimbatore: Devoid of the usual crowds and celebrations, district headquarters of all political parties in the city had just a handful of cadres in sombre mood on Sunday morning.AIADMK leaders had instructed cadres not to gather in large numbers at party offices because of the Covid-19 norms and due to the complete lockdown, a member said. “Members other than the party agents, who were at the counting centre, were asked to celebrate at home.” DMK, BJP and Left party offices were also deserted. Later in the evening, when it became clear that DMK will form the government, vice-president of the district trade committee of the party C K Mohammed Ali, along with cadres, distributed sweets and burst firecrackers at Ukkadam. Police stopped them and asked them to celebrate at their houses.But within hours, the initial excitement faded at both AIADMK and DMK offices. “We are all set to form the government and our leader M K Stalin is going to become the chief minister. We are extremely happy about that. But what bothers us is that DMK candidates did not even manage to lead even from one constituency till the evening. We are really worried,” a DMK member said.Even though AIADMK managed to lead in most of the constituencies in the district, cadres were upset as the party, which had been in power for the last 10 years, had lost the election. “During the last two elections, we celebrated the party’s victory by distributing sweets and bursting crackers. This time, we have to watch DMK do it,” a party functionary said.Meanwhile, party agents kept vigil at the counting centre set up at the Government College of Technology. As many as 14 tables were arranged for each constituency, other than Kavundampalayam that had 20 tables, as there were more voters. Each party had deployed one agent per table per constituency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/winners-losers-in-sombre-mood/articleshow/82361447.cms||Nivedha Selvam

The Diamond Harbour MP was singled out for the sharpest attack by senior BJP leaders, including PM Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah. The Pishi-Bhaipo barbs by BJP turned into personal attacks against Abhishek when Suvendu Adhikari attacked him, prompting Abhishek to initiate legal action against the friend-turned-foe. But the pressure on Abhishek began much before the polls were declared. Late February, his wife was served a notice by CBI and grilled for hours. His sister-in-law and her family were also questioned by Central agencies. Mamata claimed these were done to pile pressure on Abhishek. Abhishek had to take over a larger role after a spate of high-level defections and most senior leaders got occupied in the poll fray. From speaking to senior leaders who had aired grievances in public to reaching out to party workers, Abhishek has been in the thick of action along with his poll campaign. Abhishek also co-ordinated with the I-Pac team daily. “He introduced technology and data analysis in a big way to the party. The strategies and policy measures were an outcome of detailed field studies, multiple outreach programmes and a constant back-end team of tele callers who were taking and providing feedback. This is something which he did in tandem with the I-Pac team and PK. It was also used to identify candidates and plan campaigns,” a senior leader said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pishi-bhaipo-slur-couldnt-put-abhishek-in-the-dock/articleshow/82362839.cms||Saibal Sen
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh administration to decide on lockdown, stricter restrictions today||CHANDIGARH: As the Haryana government imposed a seven-day lockdown in the state and the Punjab government announced curfew-like restrictions on Sunday, the Chandigarh administration will discuss the ongoing scenario to take a final call in a meeting on Monday. UT administrator VP Singh Badnore had recently admitted that similar curbs in Tricity would have a significant impact, so there are chances that Chandigarh would follow its neighbours. Sources in the UT said soon after the decisions of both Haryana and Punjab governments on Sunday, the Chandigarh administration started studying restrictions of both the states, so that UT could take an appropriate and effective decision. Besides, the UT is already in touch with both of the states regarding management of Covid-19. As the situation is deteriorating by the day and the number of positive cases and deaths are increasing, complete lockdown or curfew-like restrictions will be the major issue of discussion in the meeting. Sources said experts have suggested strict restrictions to break the chain of infection. “The officials concerned and doctors will meet under the chairmanship of the administrator to discuss the issue, after which a final decision will be taken,” an official said. The situation in the hospitals and medical institutes is grim. “All our beds are full and other infrastructure has also reached its capacity. If strict restrictions are not imposed, things will go out of control,” a senior doctor said. RLA, EO closed The Chandigarh administration on Sunday decided to close both the Registering and Licensing Authority (RLA) and Estate Office (EO) for another one week. These will open on May 9. These public dealing offices are closed for the past one week due to many cases of Covid-19 positive employees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ut-to-decide-on-lockdown-stricter-restrictions-today/articleshow/82360754.cms||Deepak Yadav
---||Pune||US ticket prices soar to Rs 4.5 lakh ahead of flight ban||PUNE: Flyers have been finding it difficult to reschedule their tickets to the United States, in view of the US suspending flights from India from May 4 and the rising airfares. Tanushree Dhan (name changed on request), who has a student visa of the United States and is presently in Pune, wants to go back as soon as possible and has been trying to reschedule her May 12 ticket to the JFK airport in New York. “I have an Air India ticket, but with the United States set to suspend all flights from India from May 4, I have to leave early. However, I am unable to reschedule as there are few seats left apparently. I had purchased the ticket for Rs70,000 and cancelling the same and booking a fresh ticket will cost me Rs1.5 lakh easily. The airfares have shot up and I am really in a fix,” Tanushree told TOI. Many Pune-based travel agents are getting continuous calls from people, who have visas and want to leave for the United States urgently. Travel agents said that the airfares for travel to the US from Pune have gone up by over 100% with very few seats left. “Since Saturday, I have received around 30 to 40 calls from people, who are desperate to travel back to the US. They either hold student visas or work visas and had come back to their homes here for a trip. The calls aren’t stopping and the airfares have shot up rapidly. An Air India ticket from Pune to JFK via Delhi is presently costing almost Rs1.45 lakh. A ticket from Pune to Washington is costing almost Rs2 lakh. Many are so desperate to travel that they are also inquiring about private chartered flight services,” a city-based travel agent told TOI. He added that before the pandemic, the average cost of an economy class ticket from Pune to the US was around Rs60,000 to70,000. “The same increased to almost Rs90,000 to Rs1 lakh after the pandemic hit. And now with the upcoming flight suspensions, the fares have almost doubled, and in some cases tripled. The price of a ticket from Pune to New York for instance, presently rests up to Rs4.5 lakh. With seats almost filled up, we are now unable to book any further,” he added. Koregaon Park resident Ankit Raisinghani, who studies in a college in New York, had come to Pune a month back. “I had to go back by May-end. However, with the US now deciding to suspend flights, I am worried as it might be indefinite. Spending around Rs5 lakh for a new ticket is unaffordable for me and I am unable to reschedule,” Ankit, who had booked his ticket with Air India, said. Travel agents said that most of those calling wouldn’t be able to travel. “There are many restrictions with many countries not allowing transit of passengers, who have stayed in India for a fortnight. All flight from Pune to the US are either two-stop of three-stop flights,” another travel agent told TOI. National carrier Air India, via its social media handles on Sunday said it would be operating two flights to the US — Flight AI-101 from Delhi to JFK departing from Delhi at 1.45am hours on May 3 and AI-173 from Delhi to San Francisco departing from Delhi at 10am on May 3. The bookings for the flights had been opened from Sunday morning, the airline said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/us-ticket-prices-soar-to-rs-4-5l-ahead-of-flight-ban/articleshow/82360751.cms||Joy Sengupta

A total of 139 individuals among the age group of 18 to 44 took vaccination on day one of the drive on Saturday. “Three health centres of the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) gave the first dose of vaccine to a group of individuals from the newly-added age group. The civic administration appealed to all those who are between 18 and 44 to register themselves online for the immunization programme and get the vaccine as early as possible,” public relations officer of AMC Sanjeev Sonar said. The local civic body, in fact, had planned vaccination of 300 individuals among the newly-added age group. Certain technical issues, however, resulted in inoculation of only 139 people. Earlier, Aurangabad district collector Sunil Chavan had visited the vaccination centre at the district civil hospital at Chikalthana coinciding with the implementation of expanded immunization drive. “As per a section of experts, the third-wave of Covid-19 may occur in our part of the world. Early mass vaccination of all target age groups is, therefore, must considering such worrisome prediction,” he said. Meanwhile, a few citizens aged between 18 and 44 complained of difficulties in online registration for vaccination using the official portal. “I tried to enrol myself using PAN card, but the portal continued to show technical errors. I gave up after trying twice,” said Arati Kute.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/over-130-get-inoculated-as-vaccination-for-above-18-begins/articleshow/82359015.cms||---

We can also participate in vaccination camps which the civic and state health officials hold in schools and colleges either as vaccinators or part of the stand-by medical team. This way, we can expedite the inoculation of a maximum population above 18 years in Pune,” Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association's Hospital Board of India, Pune chapter, a body of the small and medium-sized hospitals in Pune, said. “We can finish vaccination of most of Pune's population in record time. We can provide vaccine storage/administration services without any charges if the government or local bodies gives us the doses for free. It will prevent overcrowding at government and civic body-run hospitals and check the virus spread,” senior surgeon Shailesh Puntambekar of Galaxy Care Hospital, added. Private hospitals in Pune are in a fix after the civic body, following the state government's decision, told them to source the doses directly from the vaccine manufacturers. The move may halt the sessions for the next two months. Serum Institute of India has said it will not be able to supply doses to private hospitals for two months. Officials cited prior commitments to the Union and the state governments. PMC oficials said the sessions would continue in government and municipal corporation hospitals according to the availability of doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hospitals-docs-step-up-to-challenge-with-free-services-offer-for-vax-drive/articleshow/82360758.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Kaiserbagh police on Sunday arrested the accused, Ram Milan alias Neelu, from Basti district. His aide, Durgesh, is still at large.

There are 54 such vehicles available in the civic areas and most are operated by private operators. Health practitioners said patients suffering from respiratory diseases due to Covid-19 need these ambulances. But, many Covid-19 patients in the city have had to wait for hours in critical conditions for the want of these ambulances. Their demand is high not only locally, but also for intra-district travel where relatives prefer to transport patients to their native places or nearby cities where they can get a ventilator and treatment. “Patients and their relatives, who need a cardiac ambulance wait for hours to get one. Timely availability of this ambulance is a must for saving lives. Their non-availability is a concern,” Gopal Jhambhe, secretary of the ambulance association of Pune, told TOI. On an average, there are 15 to 20 calls per day for intra-district travel via a cardiac ambulance, he said. PMC officials said they have started a war room with a helpline for better coordination of the ambulance service. “The civic administration is taking efforts to increase all types of ambulances. More are available in civic areas now compared to last year,” Shrinivas Kandul, a senior PMC official, said. According to PMC data, there are 45,000 active patients in PMC areas with nearly 70% in home quarantine and the rest are being treated in hospitals or at Covid care centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/just-54-cardiac-ambulances-for-covid-patients-when-need-is-for-many-more/articleshow/82360779.cms||---

After the first wave of Covid-19, JDA had made seven public related works online. The residents can apply for the works online on citizen care centre’s website. The monitoring of these works zone-wise occurs weekly. A senior JDA official said, "There is a time-frame of maximum one month to dispose of the works of the residents. After witnessing pendency, notices have been issued to the officers concerned".JDA had started online application facility for major services last year to provide benefit to residents during the lockdown. However, the callousness of officials proved a hindrance. "The officials whose names are included in the list online are working in JDA’s electric wing and zones of PRN," said the official. JDA online system is not helping many people in difficult times, residents whose plots fall under Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) also cannot do any such work sitting at home.Last year, the urban development and housing (UDH) department minister inaugurated the online service for building layout plan at JMC.Both online and offline services were made available in urban bodies. The online system was to automatically check building approval application. The process meant to complete the applications in a short time. However, JMC sources said that online applications are not being accepted at present. "The project is not fully operational. It was claimed in the corporation, municipal councils and municipalities that it will begin by October 31, 2020. However, applications are not being accepted," said an official source. The project was first launched on June 8, 2016. However, many local bodies including those in Jaipur highlighted practical problems in implementing the online system. Thereafter, it was again launched on October 1, 2017 following the directions of then state government.

He urged the public to call the Covid helpline #01123469900 or send an email to acp-cybercell1@delhipolice.gov.in to report such incidents. Many crooks from Jharkhand’s Jamtara and other areas of Delhi have become active in duping people in lieu of selling them oxygen cylinders or Remdesivir injections. They are using details from distress posts on social media to contact the victims. On Monday, Delhi Police brass held a virtual meeting comprising officials from main and district cyber crime cells, Crime Branch, Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Center (I4C) of MHA and National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI)” “NPCI and I4C agreed to intensify cooperation and get the bank accounts used by cyber criminals frozen and the SIM cards being used by them be escalated to DOT for mandatory KYC to curb their menace,” PRO Chinmoy Biswal said. Police informed that they arrested Shiv Kumar in Adarsh Nagar after a man, Hemant, filed a cheating complaint.

The letter said there are 200 forest personnel in every district and their total strength is approximately 5,000 across the state. A senior official said, “Directions were also issued to the divisional forest officers (DFO) to provide a list of staff to the chief medical officers.” It stated as summers have approached, many a times the staff have to combat wildfires with the assistance of local villagers. As forest staff have an interface with villagers, it exposes them to the virus. Also, to roll out Ghar Ghar Aushadi scheme, the staff across the state will work in close association with labourers at forest nurseries to develop saplings. An offical said, “The scheme will be implemented in collaboration with public representatives, Panchayati Raj Institutions and industrial houses. The nodal department for the scheme will be the forest department. The forest workers going out in the field should be considered as frontline,” said the official The frontline forest personnel working in various districts were vulnerable to Covid infection as they were coming in contact with villagers, tourists, and contractors while carrying out their official responsibility. These forest staff were not included in the priority list for vaccination till date in the region. But the decision has provided a sigh of relief to many now. A forest guard, who wished not to be named, said, “In the past two years, more than 25 guards tested positive. Recently, on April 28, forester Jawan Singh passed away due to Covid . A continuous request was made earlier too. Vaccination would help us carry out our duty with confidence.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/forest-field-staff-finally-on-priority-list-of-covid-vaccination-drive/articleshow/82360799.cms||---

The allocation includes 100 metric tonnes from Bhiwadi’s INOX Air Products oxygen plant, 40 MT from Jamnagar (Gujarat), 15 MT from Panipat (Haryana), 40 MT from Steel Authority of India (Burnpur, West Bengal) and 60 MT from Tata Steel (Kalinganagar, Odisha). “The allocation for the state was increased to 255 metric tonnes by the central government yesterday (on Saturday),” said an official. The rest 142 metric tonnes of oxygen is being manufactured by the state’s MSME oxygen producers (24 air separation units or ASUs). “Currently, around 14,200 oxygen cylinders are being produced and used per day. There has been an increase in the production of oxygen by local manufacturers from 125 MT(rated capacity) to 142 MT,” said an official. Hence, with the government of India increasing the allocation for Rajasthan, the total availability of oxygen would add up to 397 MT per day. “The requirement of oxygen per day keeps changing. The formula is active Covid cases x .12 x 2.5/100. One metric tonne of oxygen is equal to 100 cylinders,” the official added. “We have demanded to the central government that oxygen should be provided to the state as per the formula.” The state government had constituted an Oxygen Management Group at Udyog Bhawan for management of oxygen supply in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/centre-increases-allocation-of-oxygen-for-raj-to-255-mt/articleshow/82360808.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Lucknow||Ex-mayor Dauji Gupta dies of post-Covid complications||LUCKNOW: Veteran politician and former Lucknow mayor, Dauji Gupta, passed away in the city on Sunday following post-Covid complications. He was 84. Dauji had been recuperating at his home in Naka Hindola after testing Covid positive on April 18. He had tested negative for the virus three days ago, his family said. He had also taken both the doses of vaccination against Covid. “He had recovered from the infection and had tested negative like the rest of us at home. But he was experiencing extreme weakness and was unable to eat anything for the past few days. He was being fed nutrition through drip. We took him to a hospital when his condition deteriorated on Sunday but he could not be saved,” his grandson Satvik Gupta told TOI. Dauji was three-time mayor of Lucknow from 1971 to1992. He also served as six-time MLC from 1997 to 2003. Regarded as a father figure and a reservoir of knowledge on Lucknow’s history and culture, Dauji headed several organisations associated with the promotion of Hindi literature and language. Politician and Dauji’s close aide Amir Haider said, “Dauji Gupta was a living example of Lucknow’s culture and poise. He and Lucknow were intertwined. The city has lost one of its diamonds. I had spoken to him over phone two days ago and his condition seemed fragile, but I never knew it was my last conversation with him. He was a treasure trove of knowledge and a staunch opponent of communal forces.” CPI leader Atul Anjaan also paid tribute to his dear friend. “He was fluent in at least 12 languages. Hindi caught his heart in his youth and he tirelessly worked towards giving Hindi its due. He was a flag bearer of the rights of Dalits and OBCs and was responsible for organising the group as one.” “Along with former Delhi CM Chaudhary Brahm Prakash, he fought for the economic, social and political rights of Dalits and OBCs which ultimately led to the birth of Mandal Commission. We will be indebted to him for the work he did for Lucknow and its people,” he added. Mayor Sanyukta Bhatia said, “Dauji played a pivotal role in establishing Lucknow as a developed city. We have lost a good person. May God give strength to his family in this time of crisis.” Tributes also poured in for him on social media. Covid-19 had also claimed the life of former deputy mayor of Lucknow, Abhay Seth (66), in July last year. Lucknow West MLA Suresh Srivastava, too, succumbed to the virus last month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ex-mayor-dauji-gupta-dies-of-post-covid-complications/articleshow/82361468.cms||Yusra Husain

---||Ahmedabad||Covid-19 in Gujarat: Double masking key to beating double mutant||AHMEDABAD: Wearing double masks, ensuring social distancing, putting precautions in place at home in case visitors drop by, and avoiding crowded areas are the key to navigating this pandemic, according to experts. In Gujarat, three Covid virus versions have been in circulation over the past few months, according to the information published on the website of the GISAID, a worldwide Covid information collaboration platform. The information on Covid variants found in Gujarat has been reported to the GISAID by a team of scientists of the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Consortium on Genomics (INSACOG). It is a grouping of 10 national laboratories established by the Union ministry of health. A cursory glance at the information available on the public platform suggests that there are 34 variants of the double mutant Indian SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617; one variant of the B.1.525 SARS-CoV-2 which was first detected in Nigeria and the UK in December 2020; and four variants of the B.1.351 which was mainly found in South Africa. “One key question that bothers us today is whether these mutations if present in the same state together can overcome the natural immunity from past infections,” says a public health expert, speaking on the condition of anonymity. “It is a crucial area of study and Covid samples need to be genetically sequenced here to detect their infection rate and epidemiology so that we can plan ahead.” Last week, INSACOG had updated GISAID about 529 variants of the double mutant B.1.617+ Covid virus in Maharashtra, 62 variants in Karnataka, and 133 variants in West Bengal. The Gujarat virological data was submitted to the GISAID in February. According to the GISAID, the first report of the B.1.617’s presence in Gujarat was reported on February 2 this year with three samples testing positive for the double mutant. On February 3, two samples showed the mutant’s presence; and then on February 6, three more samples showed the double mutant virus. The GISAID platform is maintained by the governments of Germany, the official host; Singapore; and the US. It provides open access to genomic data of influenza viruses and the coronavirus responsible for Covid-19 pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/double-masking-key-to-beating-double-mutant/articleshow/82360821.cms||Paul John
---||Rajkot||‘Manufacturing idea came from calls’||Rajkot: Preliminary investigation into the duplicate remdesivir manufacturing racket which was busted in Pinjrat of Surat district on Saturday revealed that the racket started after one of the accused started receiving large number of calls inquiring about remdesivir injections.According to Morbi police, kingpin Kaushal Vora, a resident of Adajan of Surat, took this short-cut to mint moolah along with the five others who are in police custody.“Vora is engaged in medical equipment trading in Surat and he started getting large number of inquiries related to remdesivir when the coronavirus cases started increasing again. THis spurred him to grab the opportunity to make some quick bucks by manufacturing duplicate injections and supplying these in the market,” said a police official.“Vora then googled and found one manufacturer in Mumbai who was making the bottles and placed an order with him. He sourced remdesivir label from Vapi and purchased a packaging machine before starting the factory in a rented farmhouse near Surat.“Each bottle contained 33 gm glucose mixed with salt and was being sold at Rs 2,500 to Ahmedabad-based Ramiz Kadri, who sold it further to Asif Patni at Rs 3,500 per vial. Patani used to sell each vial at Rs 4,000 or more depending upon the requirement of the patients. These vials reached Morbi where local agents were selling it between Rs 5,000 and Rs 8000,” police probe revealed. In fact, according to police, Patani had purchased a cash counting machine which police seized from his house in Ahmedabad. Cops have also detained four labourers who were hired by the accused for packaging, but are yet to make a formal arrest.Morbi police and Detection of Crime Branch of Ahmedabad and Surat city carried out a joint operation on Saturday and busted the manufacturing unit. They recovered 3,371 vials of duplicate injections, Rs 90.27 lakh in cash and 63,168 empty vials from the spot.Cops arrested six people from the unit including Rahul Kotecha and Raviraj alias Raj Hirani who are residents of Morbi, Mohammad Asim alais Asif Patni and Ramiz Kadri from Ahmedabad, Kaushal Vora from Adajan in Surat and Punit Shah from Thane near Mumbai in Maharashtra. “Two accused — Kalpesh Prajapati and Siraz Khan Pathan — are at large.

---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Gritty siblings convert car into ‘Covid ward’ for mother, she defeats virus||LUCKNOW: This brother-sister duo had never imagined that they would spend four nights in a car, bundled up in the front two seats, with their Covid-19 positive mother, requiring dialysis, in the back seat and her oxygen cylinder lying in the trunk of the car – and all this, 240 kilometres away from home. Sounds unbelievable, but this is how the human triumphs against all odds. Their mother got a bed on the fifth day and took five more days to stabilise. The family took her home thereafter, but the siblings spent 10 days in their vehicle in the hospital’s parking lot. During which period, one of them also contracted infection. On April 20, Payal Singh (25) and her brother Akash (23) drove to Lucknow from Lakhimpur Kheri for their mother’s dialysis. They were supposed to return the same day, the practice they had been following for several years. However, their mother, Parul Singh (45) developed fever that day and the hospital where they used to take her for dialysis regularly asked for an RT-PCR Covid test report. “We gave her samples for the test but since she was a suspected case of Covid-19, we had no other option but to spend the night in our car in the hospital’s parking lot and bought food from local joints. Going to any relative’s place or hotel would have exposed them to infection,” said Payal, while narrating how the hope to get some assistance in the next hour kept them in Lucknow all through. The next day, Parul’s test report came positive, leaving the family in a precarious situation. As the regular hospital refused to conduct dialysis, the siblings with the help of friends, found a private hospital that agreed to perform the procedure but cancelled it later when Parul’s oxygen level started dropping. “There was no oxygen-supported bed in the hospital. Going back to Lakhimpur or any adjoining district was not an option. We frantically called helplines but nothing worked. However, through a contact, we got five small oxygen cans for Rs 1,300 that lasted for only a few minutes,” Payal recalled. However, the family stay back in Lucknow on April 22, hoping for a better situation. The hospital agreed to conduct dialysis as Parul’s oxygen level improved a bit. Though the dialysis was done, the issue of hospitalisation for Covid-19 treatment remained unsolved. “To maintain her oxygen levels, we made mother her lie in prone position on the backseat and spent another night in the car, simultaneously searching for oxygen cylinder. Help came on April 23 when my father brought a cylinder from Lakhimpur in a hired car. We put her on oxygen support in the car itself and sent our father home to protect him from infection,” she said. However, the oxygen cylinder brought temporary relief. The siblings continued to hunt for an oxygen-supported bed in hospitals but nothing materialised and April 23 was also spent in the car. “We made hundreds of distressed calls during this period – one brought hope, another ended in disappointment. Since all well-wishers kept trying for bed and motivated us all along, we pushed on. My mother also showed exemplary determination. Finally, on April 24, my mother got a bed in RMLIMS. After her condition stabilised, she was discharged on April 30,” she said. With mom & bro infected, girl fights back: The siblings had just masks and gloves to protect themselves all through the ordeal. On April 22, Akash developed mild systems and tested Covid-19 positive. While the brother remained isolated in the car, Payal had to arrange everything from medicines to food and finances. She also took medication as a precautionary measure. “We had only Rs 12,000 when we reached Lucknow and had to ask our father to transfer more money. All this while, we used public toilets and sanitised seats with sanitiser spray after usage,” said Payal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/gritty-siblings-convert-car-into-covid-ward-for-mom-she-defeats-virus/articleshow/82361490.cms||Yusra Husain

---||Ahmedabad||Foreign-trained medicos plead for corona duty in Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: Dr Preksha Bhatt, 25, who had to leave her medical internship midway in China following the Covid-19 outbreak in Wuhan last year, says she feels miserable for not being able to put her studies to use in treating the flood of corona patients. Bhatt, an MBBS intern from Southern Medical University, China, says that she is taking the Foreign Medical Graduate Exam (FMGE) mandated for foreign-trained medicos to practise or intern in hospitals in India. “If the government relaxes the norms and allows us, like the local MBBS students, to intern at Covid hospitals, we can help the suffering citizens of Gujarat,” Bhatt said. “We understand there is a scarcity of staff in the makeshift Covid-19 hospitals. We do not even want any remuneration. We are ready to serve free in rural areas where the pandemic is tightening its grip in the current surge.” In fact, members of the Indian Foreign Medical Students (IFMS) Welfare MCI Gurukul Trust have been actively lobbying the central and state governments to lower the qualifying percentage of the FMGE from the current 50% to 30% to make 1 lakh doctors available in the pandemic in one stroke. “The qualifying percentile of NEET-PG has been lowered over the years to 30,” says Neel Bhatt, a student of Guangxi University of Chinese Medicine and a local representative of FMGs. Bhatt added: “If the government wishes, it can make a large number of medical graduates and interns available for Covid duties in rural areas.” Bhatt went on to say: “If the Gujarat government lowers the FMGE pass percentage requirement to 30% or waives the prerequisite of clearing the Indian exam for registration, some 2,500-3,000 interns and doctors can be instantly available for posting in Covid hospitals.” FMG representatives had met health minister Nitin Patel and education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama last year to raise the issue. Vama Patel, a medico from Southern Medical University, China, who could not clear the FMGE last year due to Covid in the family, says she is willing to do her internship in a Covid hospital gratis. “Gujarat needs doctors and we need permission to treat patients,” Patel said. “We were trained by US professors in China in the English language. We are ready for work, we just need permission.” The FMGs said both the government and doctors will benefit in relaxing the rules at a time when governments are actively roping in students not just from medicine but also from allied fields such as ayurveda, physiotherapy, and dentistry to work in Covid facilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/foreign-trained-medicos-plead-for-corona-duty/articleshow/82360822.cms||Radha Sharma

Since the quota of oxygen for each district is fixed, the quota must be followed. If Mumbai’s oxygen is taken away by neighbouring districts, then it will lead to a major crisis. It's a good decision by the BMC to set up its own bottling plants so that this tussle over oxygen can be resolved. But till that is done, all agencies must ensure that all districts get oxygen as per the fixed quota. “We are going to set up two oxygen bottling plants at Mahalaxmi Race Course and at Mulund’s Richardson and Cruddas jumbo centre. Once they are ready in a few days, jumbo and dura cylinders won’t have to be sent to bottling plants in Navi Mumbai,” said P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner (projects). Officials said due to shortage of oxygen at hospitals, the state government had fixed a quota for each district. According to the fixed quota, liquid medical oxygen (LMO) is taken in tankers to bottling or refilling plants where jumbo and dura cylinders are filled and then resent to hospitals. BMC officials explained that of the 240 metric tonnes that Mumbai requires each day, oxygen tanks at major hospitals provide 180MT. The remaining 60 MT is supplied through jumbo and dura cylinders refilled by two suppliers—Satramdas Gases and Phoenix Gases in Navi Mumbai. On Friday, after it came to light that 50% of this 60MT was being diverted by the suppliers to other cities such as Navi Mumbai and Thane, the BMC wrote to newly appointed Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) commissioner Parimal Singh and Konkan divisional commissioner Annasaheb Misal asking them to depute officials to ensure Mumbai gets its full quota of cylinders. “We have issued a show cause notice to one of the suppliers and will take action if oxygen supplies are not restored,” Velrasu said. “Once we set up our own bottling plants, cylinders from Mumbai won’t have to go to Navi Mumbai and they will be refilled here instead. This will end our dependence on private refillers,” Velrasu said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-to-set-up-2-oxygen-refilling-plants-to-plug-supply-diversion/articleshow/82361521.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Billed as a big fight between Trinamool and BJP in her absence, the battle for Bhowanipore turned out to be a cakewalk for Chattopadhyay, who lives there but used to represent Rashbehari constituency. Actor-turned-BJP candidate Rudranil Ghosh, who had been banking on the sizeable non-Bengali population in parts of the constituency to give the outgoing power minister a tough contest, was possibly left surprised by the support Trinamool appeared to get from all sections of the electorate, including Sikhs, Biharis, Marwaris and Gujaratis. “People have entrusted their faith in Mamata Banerjee and me. This has been a vote against BJP and their filthy politics,” said Chattopadhyay. Though Trinamool had trailed BJP in six of the eight corporation wards that comprise the assembly constituency in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, its candidate Mala Roy just about managed a lead of 3,300 votes, thanks largely to big margins in ward 70 near Ekbalpore-Mominpur, where Muslim voters comprise the majority. Ward 82 in Chetla, where minister Firhad Hakim lives, also played a role in TMC's slender victory. BJP had hoped to further polarise the vote in this election to offset Trinamool's Muslim support base, comprising nearly 35% of the electorate there. It also aimed to attract a sizeable chunk of the 60% non-Bengali votes. Aware that slums vote in large numbers, Union home minister Amit Shah had visited one in Bakul Bagan Row in a bid to win them over. While Covid kept many urban voters away, the emphatic Trinamool victory was most likely made possible by not just Muslims and voters from slums, but also ward 70 — dominated by Gujaratis and Marwaris. This ward had been Trinamool’s Achilles heel in past elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/local-boy-cruises-home-in-kolkata-seat-didi-left-for-nandigram/articleshow/82362843.cms||Subhro Niyogi

Hassan, the elder son of former Madhupur MLA and state minister, late Haji Hussain Ansari, defeated BJP candidate Ganga Narayan Singh by 5,247 votes. While Hassan bagged 1, 10,812 votes, Singh received 1, 05,565 votes. After an initial lead, Hassan trailed as Singh took lead in the 15th round, which he maintained till the 22nd. The counting was completed in 24 rounds. Soon after his win, chief minister Hemant Soren congratulated Hassan on his victory from Ranchi. “I thank the electorate of Madhupur for reposing faith in our candidate,” Soren told reporters at his residence in the evening. Speaking to journalists outside the counting centre, Hassan said: “The voters of Madhupur rejected BJP’s communal politics and voted for the development which is being done by our government.” In February, three months after his father’s death, Hassan was sworn into the state cabinet and given the portfolios of sports, youth affairs and minority affairs’ ministries. Earlier in November last year, JMM had also retained the assembly while Congress retained Bermo. Bermo had fallen vacant in May after the death of its incumbent lawmaker Rajendra Prasad Singh while Dumka was vacated by Soren, who won from two seats, as he took oath as MLA from the Barhait assembly seat. In its response, state BJP claimed that JMM’s victory was the victory of power “misuse”. “However, the party was able to narrow its margin this time in comparison to the 2019 assembly polls. JMM managed to win by a whisker,” state BJP president Deepak Prakash said. Meanwhile, BJP functionaries in Deoghar attributed Singh’s defeat to the party’s infighting. Singh, an Ajsu-Party turncoat, was fielded by BJP considering his 2019 assembly poll performance. Singh secured 45,000 votes and defeated BJP candidate Raj Paliwar. Paliwar was benched by the saffron party for the bypoll. Singh said, “I respect the mandate of Madhupur’s people and I will keep working for the development of the constituency despite my defeat.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jmms-hassan-retains-madhupur-bjp-loses-by-over-5000-votes/articleshow/82360332.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey

But two of the victims who died in the fire tragedy at Welfare Hospital had little idea that the place that saved their life would take it away too. Ibrahim Randeria, 60, a resident of Mangrol, was admitted to the hospital about 10 days ago. He was on ventilator for few days but after showing a remarkable recovery, it was removed. “His condition improved so he was to be discharged on Saturday. But the fire took away his life,” said his son, Faizal and added that Ibrahim was a director in SUMUL. Like Ibrahim, Adam Sarigat, 75, too was waiting eagerly to be discharged on Saturday. His son Zakaria, who had met him just hours before the fire incident, said that Adam, a resident of Ankleshwar, was on oxygen for few days. “But he had recovered and was to be discharged the next day. We are all in shock,” Adam said. Among the 18, who got charred in the fire late on Friday night, was also Syed Abdul Patel, a resident of Bharuch. The 48-year-old taxi driver was admitted to the hospital 10 days ago and kept on BiPAP. Survived by two daughters and a boy, Patel was the only breadwinner in his family. His family members were eagerly waiting for him to be home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/two-victims-were-to-be-discharged-soon/articleshow/82359185.cms||Tushar Tere

So far, 12 prisoners were found infected and have recovered. Jail superintendent Hamid Akhtar said, “Our administration has taken a host of measures, including testing of all prisoners, at regular intervals. Our staff have been trained for drive by the district administration.” Akhtar all prisoners in the jail campus have undergone testing at least thrice since the outbreak of the infection in the state. Despite the precautionary measures, 12 prisoners were found positive but all of them have recovered. One of them was a person weighing 130kg with several co-morbid diseases but he recovered during treatment inside the jail. The jail administration also said it is mandatory for all accused persons coming from outside to have a Covid-negative report. After entering the jail, they were kept in isolation for 15 days in special cells before allowing them to mix with other prisoners. Besides, the movement of prisoners outside the jail premises for court proceedings has been stopped. The physical meeting of prisoners with relatives has also been restricted and the only way remaining means for them to talk to their kin is through the telephone. The administration is also vigilant against the spread of infection among the prisoners from the jail staff. The personnel posted inside are not deployed outside and vice versa. Moreover, the jail staff have been asked not to venture out of the premises and remain in their barracks. Special arrangement for supplies of essential items, including food, are being made for the staff. Meanwhile, the vaccination drive is also continuing on the jail campus with the help of its trained paramedical staff. All prisoners above the age of 60 have been covered under the programme. The vaccination of 45 and above prisoners will begin soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/mass-testing-drive-at-birsa-jail-begins-vax-drive-for-45-soon/articleshow/82360355.cms||Sanjay Sahay
---||Ranchi||Vaccine drive for 18-45 years in Jharkhand postponed indefinitely||RANCHI: The vaccination drive for 18-45 years of age in Jharkhand, which was originally scheduled from May 1, has been shelved indefinitely owing to the non-availability of vaccines. The registration for the drive has, however, started. “As the institutions designated by the Indian government did not supply the requisite vaccines, the vaccination program for people aged between 18-45 years is being shelved. The program will begin immediately soon after the doses are available,” the state government said in a statement on Saturday evening. There are 1.57 crore people within the age group who are eligible for the vaccines. Last month, chief minister Hemant Soren had pledged that the beneficiaries will be provided with the jabs for free. However, the government has not yet released a detailed plan to provide free inoculation. As per the Centre’s April 21 mandate, state governments will have to place orders with the vaccine manufacturers and pay for the doses. The state government will then provide the doses for jabs in its hospitals, health centres and private healthcare facilities. Health minister Banna Gupta had last week said the government has placed orders for 25 lakh doses of Covaxin from Bharat Biotech and 25 lakh doses of Covishield from the Serum Institute of India, but both companies have expressed their inability to supply the vaccines before May 15. “We have already made 2,229 vaccination centres ready for the drive. But we did not get the vaccines. We are in talks with the companies and trying to procure our consignments by May 10 to begin the drive at the earliest,” a senior official in the state health department said. Despite the unavailability of vaccines, registrations are already underway. Beneficiaries, who signed up for the jabs, were a disappointed lot after they were not allocated slot and vaccination centres to take the jabs. “Hoping that I will be able to get the jabs at the sites, I drove to the Ranchi sadar hospital on Saturday morning but there was no vaccine and I returned,” Hinoo resident Ravi Kumar said. Ruling Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) criticized the Union government over the delay. “In her budget speech, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman pledged Rs 35,000 crore for vaccines. If the government cared to inoculate the country’s 90 crore adult population who are in 18 to 45 years, it will have spent Rs 27,000 crore,” JMM general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya said. Bhattacharya also called the PM Cares fund a scam. “Why is it that the fund is not being audited or being made public? Where is the money going?” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/vax-drive-for-18-45-years-in-jharkhand-postponed-indefinitely/articleshow/82360339.cms||Dhritiman Ray

Police said that the group of six comprising ragpickers and beggars including the four arrested started harassing relatives of Covid patients in the open space outside the Covid building on April 30 midnight. Two lok rakshak dal (LRD) jawaans who were deployed inside the hospital went to check after receiving a complaint from a family member of the patient. When they tried to chase them away, accused Anju Adwani, Mangla Sirsath, Sunil Jaiswal and Sonu Waghela got into a brawl and allegedly slapped one of the cops. As the fight ensued, a couple of onlookers came in support of the cops. A few minutes later a PCR van arrived at the spot during routine patrolling. Seeing the van, Waghela and two others identified as Lalo and Vishal fled the scene. Adwani, Sirsath and Jaiswal were detained and after their Covid-19 tests, they were arrested. On Saturday, Waghela was also nabbed. “They are ragpickers and beggars who roam around the hospital and go to the hospital to have their meals from the canteen,” said a police official. The six accused were booked for rioting, deterring public servant from performing duty and Epidemic Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/four-scuffle-with-cops-at-smimer-arrested/articleshow/82359618.cms||---
---||Nagpur||5k in 18-44 grp take jab in 1st two days in div; no doses for 45+ in city today||Nagpur: In first two days, 5,070 people from 18-44 years age group were administered Covid-19 vaccine in six districts of Nagpur division. The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has announced Covishield doses will not be administered to 45+ age group in the city on Monday due to lack of doses. The state government has started inoculation of 18-44 years age group at five centres in each of the six districts of the division on May 1 to mark Maharashtra Day. Vaccination for this age group was held in four districts; Nagpur, Bhandara, Gondia and Gadchiroli on Day 1. Of the 1,065 people who took the jab, 252 were in Nagpur district, 485 in Bhandara, 83 in Gadchiroli and 245 in Gondia. Inoculation was not started in Chandrapur and Wardha districts. On Sunday, 4,005 were administered vaccine in six districts of the division; 1,073 in Nagpur district, 615 in Bhandara, 1,193 in Chandrapur, 259 in Gadchiroli, 437 in Gondia and 16 in Wardha. In city, NM) has started inoculation at three Covid-19 Vaccination Centres (CVC); Indira Gandhi Rugnalaya, Isolation and Pachpaoli hospitals. NMC chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar told TOI, “Vaccination for this age group will continue at these three CVCs. State government had allotted 6,000 doses of Covishield separately for inoculation of this age group,” he said. Despite vaccination for this group available at only three CVCs in the city, people were able to fix appointment at all 148 CVCs in the city on Co-Win website causing serious inconvenience to people. S Vaidya, a resident of Dhantoli, said, “I registered and also got appointment in morning on May 1 at a private hospital. Shockingly, the hospital said the government has not permitted vaccination of 18-44 years age group in any private hospital. I had to return without getting the jab for which I was waiting for last four months.” NMC officials said, “Government directed NMC to take back doses allotted before May 1 from private CVCs. Now, private CVCs are required to directly purchase doses from manufacturers. Unfortunately, Co-Win website allowed appointment for 18-44 years age group at all 148 centres in the city including 45 CVCs. On Sunday, we asked private CVCs not to create sessions so that their list will not be displayed on website.” Activist Narayan Ahuja said, “Many from 18-44 years kept on trying for two days to get appointment at NMC’s three centres but failed. They had no option but to go and check at centres though government made online registration and appointment mandatory. These problems were result of lack of doses. Government should have announced and started vaccination of this age group only after providing sufficient doses.” Vaccination programme was affected to a great extent in the city on Sunday. Of total 148 CVCs, inoculation happened only at 29 centres, including three for 18-44 years, four of Covaxin for 45+ and 22 of Covishield for 45+. Only 2,408 were administered the jab as against average of 10,000 in the city. Dr Chilkar said, “Remaining CVCs were not started due to lack of doses of Covishield. We requested and obtained 3,000 doses of Covaxin from Bhandara which helped continue vaccination at four centres.” The NMC said in a press release, “On May 3, vaccination will not be held at all CVCs for 45+ due to lack of doses.” There will be no inoculation at 141 CVCs and will continue only for 18-44 years age group at three CVCs and for 45+ at four CVCs of Covaxin. This is the fifth time vaccination has been affected in the city due to shortage of doses in last 15 days. Pratap Nagar resident Sameer Tabhane said, “My mother and I are facing serious problems due to improper management at CVC. I booked an appointment for my mother who is 45+ at NMC’s Gayatri Nagar centre. But staffers did not give jab. People in queue said they were given token a day ago and also that morning. All of them were walk-in registrations. On May 2 also there were no doses. We were unnecessarily put at risk as disease. Now, we have no idea where we will get vaccine,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/5k-in-18-44-grp-take-jab-in-1st-two-days-in-div-no-doses-for-45-in-city-today/articleshow/82360904.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Visakhapatnam||Set your AC to 26°C to save on power bills, suggests APSECM||VISAKHAPATNAM: The Andhra Pradesh State Energy Conservation Mission (APSECM) has advised electricity consumers to set their air conditioners to 26°C in a bid to save energy. As per estimates, the present annual electricity demand of ACs is 2,800 million units. Even if five units of electricity are saved per AC per night by running them at 26°C, it is likely to save five million units of electricity across 10 lakh households in the state. APSECM officials say that use of five-star rated ACs can save around 4.5 units of electricity per day compared to zero-star ACs. A five-star AC can cut power bills by Rs 2,500 compared to a zero-star AC. In course of an online meeting with APSECM officials on star-rated appliances and domestic electricity bills, state energy secretary Srikant Nagulapalli said that a one-degree higher temperature will result in a 6% reduction in electricity consumption. In an earlier communication to APSECM, the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) also emphasised on the need to set ACs to 26°C. The current total installed air conditioner capacity of around 80 million TR (ton of refrigerator), 74,234 MW, may increase to nearly 250 million TR, 2.31 lakh MW, in the next ten years. This may take the total connected load in India due to air conditioning to about 200GW by 2030 which could become a major climate challenge as an air conditioner releases nearly 10 kilograms of carbon dioxide if it runs for 8–10 hours. Energy secretary Srikant said that many people are in the habit of running their ACs at 20–22°C and then taking cover under blankets. “This leads to a double loss — of both energy and health. The temperature of our body is 35°C. It can easily tolerate temperatures in the range of 23–39°C. This is called human body temperature tolerance. When the room temperature is lower or higher, the body reacts by sneezing, shivering, etc,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/set-your-ac-to-26c-to-save-on-power-bills-suggests-apsecm/articleshow/82360167.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Unconscious and appearing famished, the cops could not wait for gloves, face-shields or PPE kits for lifting the senior citizen as per Covid protocol as availing him medical attention had become priority by then. A delay could have proved fatal. The man was not able to speak or recollect anything when the cops tried to offer help. Alerted by a scribe, the police were rushed to the spot by Zonal DCP Noorul Hasan to help the man who was lying under the scorching sun on the footpath. Constable Kishor Ingle offered the senior citizen water while his colleagues Vishal Gudhe and Gajanan Pawar provided assistance. Senior PI Dinkar Thosare of Ranapratap nagar police said the man was revived at the GMCH hospital. “We had alerted 108 ambulance but it refused to come citing Covid duties. Then we decided to take him to hospital in the police jeep after offering him glucose water,” said the PI. A photograph of the man was circulated on a local social media group. A constable got a call from his informer that the senior citizen’s family was looking for him,” said Thosare. “The family has now managed to take him back home from the hospital,” said Thosare. In yet another case, a senior citizen was rescued by the Mankapur police who later ensured she was reunited with the family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cops-rescue-85-year-old-from-footpath-ensure-medical-aid/articleshow/82360934.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Nagpur||Lakhs await SSC evaluation & Std XI admission policy||Nagpur: Lakhs of Maharashtra state board students await the decision on how their SSC (Std X) marks will be calculated, now that the theory exam has been cancelled. The state education department has been taking inputs from various stakeholders on what would be the best way to tabulate marks for SSC, but nothing concrete has been decided yet. The CBSE on Saturday declared its policy for awarding marks to Std X students based on previously held internal exams, something which the state board is very likely to follow. The last online meeting which state education minister Varsha Gaikwad held with academics focussed on how Std XI admissions will be done considering that for SSC internal marks will be given. A principal who attended the meet told TOI that there were concerns on how SSC marks now will affect Std XI admission. “If schools are given the option to assess their students, it’s obvious that everyone will get more than they deserve. While overall it will just mean an almost 100% passing rate, at the very top level there are bound to be controversies regarding scores,” he said. The academic explained that students who would have anyway scored 97%-98% plus in the normal board exam, will now get higher marks. “But when school indulge in this inflation of marks by even one percentage points, it inches closer to the 100% barrier. Then, there will be many people vying for bifocal slots in colleges and allegation of marks manipulations will rise,” said the principal. Another academic did not agree with the internal assessment formula. “I think it’s unfair for students to get judged on tests whose importance they were not even aware of. A student may be brilliant but suppose she missed the internal exam due to being sick, then do we give her zero?” the academic said. One of the education officials present during last week’s meet suggested that an entrance test can be taken for junior college admissions. “The official said this way there will be no conflict between the marks awarded to a student at SSC level and the criterion on which junior college admissions are done,” the principal said. School education minister, who lost her father, former MP Eknath Gaikwad, a few days ago could not be reached for a comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/lakhs-await-ssc-evaluation-std-xi-admission-policy/articleshow/82361032.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

No one was injured in the incident as firemen and locals doused the fire within a few minutes. According to the locals, White Pearl Complex houses four hospitals, two of which are Covid facilities. Dr Viren Jethva of Jeevan Jyot Hospital located near the meter room said, “At about 3 pm, smoke started billowing from the meter room of the complex. Our staff rushed out with fire extinguishers and tried to douse the flames. But fire brigade men too came in within a few minutes and was able to put out the fire soon.” Jethva said that even the patients admitted in his hospital didn’t face any problem because of the fire. After thick smoke enveloped the ground floor of the complex, patients from all the hospitals were brought out for some time as a safety measure. “There are about 45 patients in our hospital and all are safe,” he added. A short circuit may have caused the fire but investigations are on to ascertain the exact reason. The complex also houses two laboratories and an x-ray centre. A large crowd gathered outside the complex after the news of fire spread but the police managed to disperse the onlookers. Eighteen persons including two intern nurses and 16 patients lost their lives after fire broke out in Welfare Hospital in Bharuch late on Friday night. The fire started from a ventilator in the ICU ward and soon engulfed the hospital premises.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/fire-scare-in-covid-hospitals-at-padra-none-injured/articleshow/82359197.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||May begins with more recoveries, fewer cases||Nagpur: First two days of May have brought some hope for Vidarbha, as new Covid-19 cases were fewer than the number of patients recovering every day on both May 1 and 2. Overall, 27,599 new cases were reported in first two days of May while 28,936 patients recovered. As more patients are recovering, the recovery rate of Vidarbha has increased to 81.3%. Number of under-treatment patients, which was heading toward 1.60 lakh is now just over 1.50 lakh. The number of ‘active cases’ (under-treatment patients) is now 17% of the total cases reported till date. This number was about 20% of total cases in last week of April. The development indicates that fewer patients are now in hospitals. If this trend continues, load on health facilities will reduce in coming days. With 272 deaths a day on Saturday and Sunday both – total death toll of Vidarbha passed 15,000 mark. Last 1,000 deaths were reported in mere 4 days, which indicates that deaths due to Covid-19 remain a major cause of concern for the region. In last two days, 544 deaths were reported in Vidarbha region, with 211 of them from Nagpur district alone. Nagpur division is reporting more cases and deaths as compared to Amravati division now. On May 2, out of 272 deaths in a day, 200 came from Nagpur division, with 112 from Nagpur district alone. Five districts in Amravati division reported 72 deaths on Sunday. On May 1, total 224 out of 272 deaths were reported from Nagpur division. This indicates that the death toll has reduced in Amravati division, from where the second surge originated. But, the same has now increased even in rural parts of Nagpur division, where the second wave started in March-end. The 11 districts of Vidarbha region conducted 63,046 tests on April 30, and 51,975 tests on May 1. Bhandara: With 685 new cases on May 1 and 615 on May 2; Bhandara’s total case load has reached 52,004. More than 2,000 patients recovered in last two days taking total recovery count to 40,756.

While most hospitals were forced to start preparation to set up PSA oxygen plant after the NMC chief’s letter, some already had the plan rolling.District collector Ravindra Thakare too said he was in the process of issuing similar instructions to Covid hospitals and facilities in the rural areas.Though a handful hospitals in the city, like Kingsway and Centre Point Hospital, already have oxygen production and distribution systems, some like Orange City Hospital’s project is underway. Many hospitals are also engaged in augmenting their oxygen production capacity. New Era Hospital, though a non-Covid one, too has just set up one for themselves as they were not getting supplies as preference was given to Covid treatment. Dr Anup Marar of the Orange City Hospital said their under construction oxygen unit of 200 litres per minute, costing around Rs50 lakh, will help them get as much oxygen as 60 jumbo cylinders can hold. “If effective, then we may also think of increasing our capacity in future,” he said.Dr Shantanu Sengupta of Sengupta Hospital said they are already negotiating with companies from Tamil Nadu and Ahmedabad for setting up a plant at their premises. “The concept can help the hospitals meet their own oxygen needs instead of having to rely on external sources. It’s doable,” he said.Dr Shishir Shrivastava of Kunal Hospital said hospitals have been assigned one month time, but no company is ready to give service of setting up a plant at such a short notice, which has become a major problem now. Dr Prashant Jagtap of Viveka Hospital also welcomed the concept but said there is a cost liability factor involved too. It’s also learnt there had been a meeting of hospital managements with officials of micro, small and medium enterprise (MSME) department at the office of the divisional commissioner. The hospitals have been asked to form clusters of 10 to jointly set up PSA oxygen plants. Earlier, the high court had already asked WCL and MOIL to help government hospitals with CSR funds to set up oxygen plants. Gadkari’s efforts bear fruitUnion minister Nitin Gadkari’s efforts ensured that 167 metric tonnes of liquid oxygen was brought to Nagpur through 19 tankers. Another 38 tonnes were produced in the city through Gadkari’s initiatives. In yet another initiative, energy minister Nitin Raut too had announced a slews of effective generation and production plans through Mahagenco in his newly launched ‘Mission Oxygen’ scheme. Mahagenco, through ozonization plants at Khaparkheda, Koradi, Paras and Parli, would help supplement the oxygen supplies to Covid hospitals and facilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-chief-asks-private-covid-hospitals-to-set-up-oxygen-plants/articleshow/82361133.cms||Soumitra Bose

Many aspirants said that even those who had cleared UPSC’s civil services (mains) could not cross the Group-I hurdle. Many candidates who have failed to clear the examinations urged the APPSC to come with a transparent system of evaluation during discussions held on various social media platforms. APPSC, however, rubbished the campaign as an attempt to malign the institution. “The aggrieved candidates can come to the commission’s office on Monday at 3 pm and submit evidence. We are ready to examine if the complaints are evidence based,” said the PSC secretary PSR Anjaneyulu in a statement. “We are not alleging corruption or irregularities in the commission. We worry that some technical error might have taken place in readying the list of candidates qualified for interviews. We are only requesting the commission to do a recheck,” said a candidate on social media. Their apprehensions gained strength when several candidates who have cleared the UPSC mains on several occasions have reportedly not cleared Group 1 mains. Many candidates say that chances are very high for technical errors due to the digital evaluation mode followed by APPSC. The candidates have questioned the commission’s decision to involve a third party to conduct the examination as well as evaluation. They say the rationale behind several candidates, who qualified for the mains in the second merit list, have cleared the mains though they had only one month for preparation. Many from the first merit list, who have been preparing for the mains for over one-year, could not clear the hurdle. “Many candidates who got good scores in prelims and had ample time for preparation could not clear the mains while the candidates with low scores in prelims and little time for preparation qualified for interviews. This is a puzzle,” said another candidate. APPSC brought in several reforms in the last two years and the mains syllabus was brought on par with the UPSC syllabus. This was expected to be advantageous to UPSC aspirants. “There was an interval of 15 days between the UPSC (mains) and Group 1 (mains). I have cleared the UPSC mains and got an interview call from UPSC but could not clear Group 1 (mains),” said a candidate. The candidates urged the commission to publish the names and marks of all candidates who cleared Group 1 (mains) including their prelims scores, the criteria for according mains marks, scaling parameters implemented between Telugu medium and English medium candidates, rational for selection of a huge number of candidates in sports quota and other facts regarding the examination. The candidates are planning to file a PIL in the Andhra Pradesh high court. Asking candidates for proof is absurd as all data is with the commission, said a candidate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/psc-gr-1-results-section-of-aspirants-seek-revaluation/articleshow/82359709.cms||Samdani MN

Experts in the field of paediatrics and infectious diseases told TOI that government must expedite paediatric vaccination roll out otherwise the anticipated third wave of Covid-19 will catch young population under 18 years of age and it would be a ‘very very serious’ form of Covid-19. “Paediatric vaccine roll out is important. Otherwise the third wave will affect unvaccinated people below 18 years of age,” said Dr Nitin Shinde, infectious disease specialist. “Vaccination for citizens between 18 and 44 years of age group has already started. Many people above this age-group have already got the vaccine protection. So now, the virus will target those who don’t have this protection,” said Dr Shinde. Though, Covid-19 hardly creates serious complications in children at present, the number of infected kids is growing in the second wave. “Cities like Mumbai and Pune have seen more children infected with Covid-19 in the present wave as compared to the first one,” said Dr Deepti Jain, HoD of paediatric department at GMCH. “Though children don’t suffer severe illnesses, but they are carriers of the infection. They can infect the elderly. To avoid this, we need vaccine for kids,” she said, anticipating third wave by September. Paediatrician and vice-president of Maharashtra Medical Council (MMC) Dr Vinky Rughwani said children between 6 and 12 years will be vulnerable. “Third wave could be more serious for children from 0 to 18 years of age. The 0-18 age group consists of 30% of total population of India and herd immunity is impossible without vaccinating such a major part,” said Dr Rughwani. Dr Ashish Tajne, who has been coordinator of several human trials of Covid-19 vaccine in Central India, said paediatric trials won’t take much time. “Once we get green signal from the government, it will take 90 days to bring vaccine for kids. After blood tests and RT-PCR, eligible kids will be administered vaccine on zero day. Antibody test will be done on 28th, 56th and 90th day and result will be out quickly,” he said. Sources in Bharat Biotech, makers of Covaxin, informed that their application is pending with the Drug Controller General of India and it is most likely to get the final nod in a week. Nagpur will also be one of the trial sites for paediatric trial of Covaxin. BRING VACCINES FOR KIDS As vaccine is now open for all 18+ citizens, the only deprived age group is 0-18 years This group accounts for 30% of the total population of country Herd immunity cannot be achieved without their vaccination Children are carriers of infection and they can continue to infect people in third wave School reopening, a big step towards normalcy, will be possible only after paediatric vaccination||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/3rd-wave-will-hit-kids-badly-jab-them-too-say-experts/articleshow/82361191.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The murder was the result of a long-standing rivalry and disputes between two families. The deceased was identified as R Ram Durga Prasad and the accused is 45-year-old Kondapalli Govind. Locals said that Govind developed a grudge against Durga Prasad’s father RS Naidu, suspecting that Naidu had an affair with Govind’s wife. There were also disputes between the two families over some petty issues. When Ram Durga Prasad and his friends were sitting around and chatting near a tree on Saturday night, Govind arrived at the spot and hacked Durga Prasad to death with a knife and fled the scene. Locals said that around six years ago, Govind had tried to kill his wife and had later attempted suicide, suspecting his wife’s fidelity. A case has been registered and an investigation is underway to arrest the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/14-year-old-boy-hacked-to-death-in-srikakulam/articleshow/82359716.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Secondly, as they required ambulance services, they were at least moderately ill, which indicates that youngsters suffered moderate to severe complications during the second wave.Gender wise, 65% men and 35% women patients called the 108 ambulance, which once again established the well-known phenomenon that men are more affected by Covid-19 as compared to women.Covid patients transported with oxygen are the highest among the age group of 45 to 60 years, with 48% of total requiring oxygen transport.Dr Deepak Kumar Ukey, operations head of East Maharashtra Emergency Medical Services, the agency that operates 108 ambulances in state, said they played an important role in second wave. “With specialized equipment, trained manpower and constant supply of PPE material to every staff, our ambulances served more than 75,000 patients in Nagpur division alone,” he said. Nagpur division has reported more than 2.5 lakh new cases of Covid-19 during the second wave that started in February and is about to reach its peak now.Similar data during the first wave of Covid-19 pandemic in September 2020 shows a significant difference. At that time, 108 ambulances had served 64,283 patients and about 40% of them were senior citizens, aged above 60 years.Experts said the vaccination drive that started from January ensured vaccination of a good number of patients from the 60+ age group as well some patients in above-45 age group too. Vaccinated people in these two age groups, despite getting infected, hardly turn serious enough to need ambulance with O2.“It has been well-established by now that vaccine gives protection from severe disease. Even many of those who get just the first dose of vaccine get effective protection. Many of them can skip hospitalization, they don’t require oxygen supply, and recover at home with their own immunity,” said physician Dr Pravin Kamble. “Vaccine may not provide 100% protection from infection, but it provides near 100% protection from severe disease and death,” he said.AMBULANCE DATATotal patients transported | 76,137Chandrapur 34,432,Nagpur 15,373Gondia 10,548Wardha 8,695Bhandara 5,214Gadchiroli 1,875* In second wave, Feb 28 to April 30….O2 PATIENTS TRANSPORTAge group | Percentage0-17 | 0%18-44 | 25%45-60 | 48%60+ | 27%….PATIENTS WHO REQUIRED AMBULANCE:Age group | Percentage of patientsLess than 18 | 2.7%18 to 44 years| 38.5%45 to 60 years| 37.7%Above 60| 21.1%….GENDER WISE PATIENTSMen | 65%Women | 35%….||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/young-patients-more-amongst-those-who-called-108-ambulance-in-second-wave/articleshow/82361239.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Nagpur||One Covid death, 14 women prisoners +ve in central jail||Nagpur: A 77-year-old murder convict, undergoing life imprisonment, was declared dead at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) last week. Around 14 women prisoners, for the first time, tested positive among the 89 tested last week at the Central jail after the convict’s death. Four male prisoners too were found positive. The murder convict, who hailed from Ramtek tehsil, was detected Covid positive and was admitted to GMCH for a week before being declared dead. He was convicted in 2009. This is the third time a prisoner of Nagpur central jail has succumbed to Covid. Jail superintendent Anup Kumre said the murder convict was among the 14 prisoners who had earlier tested positive. “The convict had to be shifted to GMCH but he collapsed there. Immediately after the death, we decided to test 89 persons, including the women, to eliminate any chances of their getting affected without treatment,” said Kumre. “Our plan is to immediately isolate the positive patients and treat them in separate barracks. We are also taking the prisoners to the GMCH for HRCT scan and bringing them back if the doctors are not advising hospitalization,” he said. In the jail, 846 prisoners have been tested so far. Of them, 281 were found positive. Among prisoners above 45 years, 344 have been vaccinated so far. Of the 289 jail officials tested so far, 160 have tested positive. While 91 have been cured, the rest were in home isolation. Following a high power committee’s decision complying with a court order, around 800 prisoners were released around a year ago to ensure better physical distancing inside the prison.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/one-covid-death-14-women-prisoners-ve-in-central-jail/articleshow/82361254.cms||Soumitra Bose

Dr Rughwani, who is also the director of Thalassaemia and Sickle Cell Centre, said, “In the ongoing second wave of Covid-19 pandemic, a lot of people have tested Covid positive due to which blood donation camps cannot be held. This had negatively impacted the thalassaemia and sickle cell patients as they require blood transfusion quite often.” He added that many patients require blood transfusion once in a month, some in 20 days while others require blood in 15 days. “Due to paucity of blood, the blood banks are now asking the patients to bring blood donors. Government has announced the Covid vaccination of people between 18 and 45 years who are also the probable blood donors. The government has issued the instruction that once a person gets vaccinated he/she cannot donate blood for a month. As a gap of 45 to 60 days is to be maintained between two doses, the people are refrained from donating blood for two and half to three months. This situation has led to great crisis and escalated the troubles of the thalassaemia and sickle cell patients,” said Dr Rughwani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/blood-donor-shortage-will-hit-thalassaemia-sickle-cell-patients/articleshow/82373666.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

However, in the assembly bypolls held across 10 states, while most parties succeeded in retaining their respective seats, the MVA coalition in Maharashtra suffered a setback when NCP lost Pandharpur-Mangalwedha to BJP by a narrow margin. In Karnataka, Congress suffered a setback as it could retain only one of the two seats where bypolls were held. In the LS bypolls, while Congress was poised to retain the Kanyakumari seat in TN with a comfortable margin, IUML held on to Malappuram in Kerala and YSRCP retained Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh.  In Karnataka, BJP managed to scrape through in Belagavi with Mangala Angadi, the widow of ex-Union minister Suresh Angadi, defeating Congress candidate Satish Jarkiholi. In Malappuram, IUML’s M P Abdussamad Samadani defeated the CPM nominee by a margin of 1,14,615 votes. YSRCP retained Tirupati seat by 2.7 lakh votes. In Kanyakumari, Congress’s V Vijayakumar was leading against ex-Union minister and BJP veteran Pon Radhakrishnan by over 1.3 lakh votes after the 31st round of counting. In the assembly bypolls, NCP failed to retain Pandharpur-Mangalwedha in Maharashtra, losing to BJP.  In Karnataka, Congress managed to retain the Maski seat but lost Basavakalyan to BJP. In Telangana, the governing TRS won the Nagarjunasagar bypoll. In Jharkhand, JMM retained the Madhupur seat, defeating BJP. In Rajasthan, Congress retained Sujangarh and Sahara and BJP held on to Rajsamand. In Gujarat, BJP won the Morva Hadaf seat. In MP, Congress retained Damoh.

The hospital administration said that the infrastructure they had created was damaged and there is nothing much they can do now. “We have cured hundreds of patients from not only Bharuch, but from Vadodara, Surat and Narmada for free in one year. We have also lost our Covid treatment centre and all medical infrastructure so we will not be able to continue the treatment,” said Zuber Patel, trustee of Bombay Patel Welfare Society. With this, the pressure is likely to increase on other Covid-designated hospitals in the district. In Bharuch district, 85% of the total Covid beds are occupied. Beds in government facilities like Civil Hospital, ESIC Hospital and health centres too are 73% occupied. “We are thinking about the alternative after the fire. If the demand for beds increase, we will start new facilities,” said district collector Dr M D Modia. On Sunday, minister Pradipsinh Jadeja visited the hospital and conducted a series of meetings to review rising cases in Bharuch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/fire-hit-hospital-to-discontinue-treatment/articleshow/82359642.cms||---

Today’s Chanakya had predicted the maximum 195 seats for the ruling party, which was much less than the final figure that the TMC touched late on Sunday night. The Election Commission website showed the party heading to a win in 215 seats. Similarly, none of the exit polls predicted BJP’s tally going below 80 seats. Barring Today’s Chanakya, all other polls had projected BJP crossing the 100 mark in the state. In case of Tamil Nadu and Kerala, all exit polls had projected a comfortable majority for the DMK and the LDF, respectively. Times Now-CVoter and Republic CNX projections were somewhat close to the actual score that DMK clocked on Sunday. Both had projected DMK to bag a minimum of 160 seats and the Dravidian party was heading towards 153 seats. In case of Kerala, Today’s Chanakya had projected LDF to bag at least 93 seats and on Sunday, the ruling bloc had as many as 99 seats. In Assam, three exit poll projections were close to the actual result. India Today-Axis, Republic CNX and Today’s Chanakya had predicted the BJP-led alliance to win 61-85 seats.

Passenger occupancy rate has also fallen to 50% in the last couple of weeks, down from 70% in January-end. Sources said APSRTC runs 10,553 scheduled services per day, adding that the corporation may decide to suspend more services in the coming days. In terms of revenue, APSRTC has seen a fall from Rs 14 crore per day to between Rs 5 crore and Rs 6 crore. “This is nothing but a national calamity and RTC never considered the revenue aspect in the pandemic. We are focused on providing basic and essential services to the public as per the guidelines of chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy. We will continue to serve the public,” executive director (operations) Brahmananda Reddy told TOI. In RTC’s Vizianagaram region, occupancy rate fell steeply from around 70% to 35% in April for all buses in the city and district, forcing officials to reduce the number of services, RTC sources said. During the first wave of the pandemic in 2020, the RTC management had modified 52 AC buses into testing centres and shifted more than three lakh migrant workers to their hometowns in 11,802 buses. With buses in over 120 depots and 426 bus stations across the state taken out of service for several months, the RTC suffered an operation loss of 78.84 crore kilometres and over Rs 2,600 crore revenue loss. RTC has a fleet of around 11,000 buses, including 8,265 RTC-owned and 2,318 hired buses. In fact, undivided AP had created a world record for the largest bus fleet in the world two decades ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/occupancy-rate-in-rtc-buses-falls-50/articleshow/82359981.cms||Siva G

---||Goa||Goa lags in releasing info on Covid portal||PANAJI: The Goa government’s Covid-19 portal, which is supposed to act as a one stop centre for all information about the pandemic and helplines is riddled with outdated information leaving many Covid-19 patients scrambling to find help. While the state government appears to be waging an uphill battle against Covid-19 on the health front, it also appears to be behind the curve on the information front. The directorate of health services is the only department posting regular information about Covid-19 cases, but all the other information is either redundant or unavailable. Many of the Covid-19 helplines, such as those for retrenched workers, incident commanders and control rooms are defunct with nobody answering the phone lines. An exception is the toll-free helpline (1800-121-0980) where volunteers provide free counselling to those dealing with the psychological impact of the pandemic. The Goa.gov.in portal lists out various nodal officers, responsible for various roles at the district and talukar level, but most of the officers mentioned on the list have either been transferred or assigned to other Covid-19 duties. “The government has not updated the information since the first wave of Covid-19 it appears,” said a Sancoale resident, who has been searching for credible information regarding protocols for handling solid waste from home-isolation patients. The portal also says that “New SOPs” have been formulated for those arriving by road, rail and air, and that passengers will have to produce Covid-negative certificates, get tested or opt for home quarantine. In the absence of real-time data and information about protocols, many residents have been turning to social media and volunteer groups for assistance and information about availability of beds, oxygen, doctors for tele-consultation and other supplies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-lags-in-releasing-info-on-covid-portal/articleshow/82361304.cms||---
---||Goa||State cannot afford a complete lockdown: GSIA||Panaji: Goa cannot afford to go for a complete lockdown but at the same time, with the health sector struggling and cases rising, a partial lockdown or stringent restrictions may help the state cope with the pandemic and break the chain of the virus, said Goa State Industries Association president Damodar Kochkar. Kochkar said that India is not a developed and rich country to sustain lengthy or frequent lockdowns, which throw daily wage workers and MSMEs into jeopardy. He said that the government and people were equally to blame for the situation that Goa and the country finds itself in. “Many still do not have a guarantee that they will get their next meal without working for it. In this condition talking about frequent lockdowns would be a cruel thing,” said Kochkar. “Considering the present situation I feel, there can be a partial lockdown, but definitely not a total lockdown.” He said that it is important for the state to ensure that manufacturing activity continues and that essential services and grocery stores continue to operate. “MSMEs just cannot pay their employees and other overheads without working for it,” Kochkar said. He said that it is time for the state government and for people to learn to live with the virus by taking adequate precautions and creating capabilities. The industrialist said that irresponsible behaviour and the “foolishness” of a few had made the country suffer. TNN “Locals celebrated weddings, had parties, exchanged handshakes and hugs. Now when infections have increased, it is these very people who are shouting for lockdowns. The government is also responsible. It should have avoided unwarranted events. It should have visualised the coming of the second wave of the virus and created adequate infrastructure, like oxygen plants in hospitals,” said Kochkar. The top priority for the government should be getting Goa’s population vaccinated at the earliest, said Kohckar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-cannot-afford-a-complete-lockdown-gsia/articleshow/82361323.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||India||Bengal halts Sangh, lets daughter fly||KOLKATA: Mamata Banerjee won the most important match of her life as Bengal’s voters reposed their faith in their “nijer meye (own daughter)” and propelled her to office for a third straight term. Her party, Trinamool Congress, comfortably went past the two-thirds mark in the 294-seat assembly, leading in 214 constituencies till late on Sunday evening and bagging an unprecedented 48% of the popular vote. The victory, however, was rendered somewhat bittersweet by a narrow defeat for Mamata in Nandigram. The Election Commission website declared BJP candidate Suvendu Adhikari the winner by 1,956 votes around 11pm after a cliffhanger of a day. That was, however, the only spot on a resounding Trinamool victory. BJP officially became the state’s main opposition party but finished a distant second despite making significant gains. The party led in 76 seats at the time of writing this report — up sharply from 3 in 2016 — and netting 38.1% of the vote. The 2021 Bengal assembly poll result also confirmed the terminal decline of the Left Front and Congress; their combined vote share was a little more than 8% and neither led in a single constituency (as of midnight on Sunday). This would be the first time CPM would be drawing a blank since 1967 when it first fought an election in Bengal after its split from the Communist Party of India. It would also be the first time Congress would not have a seat in the state assembly. Their poll partner, the Indian Secular Front, won a seat but its share of the popular vote could not be confirmed. Ultimately, the 2021 assembly poll completed a process of churning within the opposition space, but not in Bengal. Read AlsoKhela Over: Mamata is Didi beyond BengalMamata Banerjee on Sunday appeared to be on course to win another two-thirds majority in what was billed as the mother of all state electoral battles, decisively beating back BJP’s all-out assault led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah’s leadership, on Fort Bengal.The assembly poll result may have repercussions beyond Bengal. Mamata would be looking to consolidate her gains in Bengal by getting together all anti-BJP forces and may become a rallying point for the opposition for the 2024 LS poll; she indicated as much towards the end of her campaign. Crucially for BJP, it may miss being in office in a state that sends a substantial chunk of 42 MPs to the LS. Trinamool’s 4% increase in vote share from the 2019 Lok Sabha poll (when it got 43.6% of votes) coincided with a 2% dip in the BJP’s share of votes (from its 2019 share of 40.6%). What would have also buoyed the Trinamool was a consolidation of anti-BJP and minority votes in its favour, which would explain Congress and the LF’s decimation. Read Also‘Pishi-bhaipo’ slur couldn’t put Abhishek in the dockKOLKATA: From a late evening in June 2019, when he took poll strategist Prashant Kishor to meet Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee to accompanying her on Sunday evening to the Kalighat temple to offer puja after Trinamool’s big win, Abhishek Banerjee has come a long way, playing a key role in theThe flurry of people friendly schemes, like Duare Sarkar, Khadya Sathi and Swasthya Sathi, and the schemes targeted at women like Kanyashree, also proved critical for Trinamool. The party put its best face forward — a CM in a wheelchair with an injured foot, with the catchy “Bangla nijer meyekeyi chay (Bengal wants its daughter)” slogan — as BJP struggled to get a decent local face to counter her. Trinamool made strong recoveries in pockets of North 24-Parganas, Hooghly and Howrah. It also held on to its bastions in and around Kolkata as well as those in South 24-Parganas, East Midnapore and East Burdwan, helping it lead in more than 200 seats. BJP’s attempts at polarising helped it hold on to some north Bengal districts like Coochbehar, Jalpaiguri and Alipurduar. But its failure to counter Mamata’s “anti-outsider” slogan — used against the frequent visits of PM Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah — and her portrayal of BJP as a party overly dependent on “outside support (of leaders from other state)” became a handicap. BJP might have also believed too much in defectors. Adhikari himself may be set for a narrow win but failed to deliver his own district, East Midnapore; Trinamool led in 10 of the district’s 16 seats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bengal-halts-sangh-lets-daughter-fly/articleshow/82362920.cms||---

GFP president Vijai Sardesai said that an immediate lockdown, which minimises human interaction, will also help reduce the load on Goa’s healthcare system, which is struggling to cope. GFP has started a campaign to urge people to stay indoors. Sardesai cited US immunologist and director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci as he justified the call for a 15 day lockdown. He has also appealed to people to pressurize their local MLAs to go for an immediate lockdown. He asked the state to ramp up medical and healthcare infrastructure while also recruiting doctors, nurses either on a short-term basis or on contract.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vijai-pushes-for-15-day-lockdown/articleshow/82361352.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Officers were tasked with securing the perimeter of the counting centres and monitor unauthorised movement of people. Election control room officials at the city police commissioner office took out 465 patrol bikes and 240 patrol cars to stay updated on the ground situation every five minutes. Commissioner Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal had visited Loyola College on Saturday to review the security arrangements there. The top brass of the city police visited the counting centres in the city -- Queen Mary’s College on Kamarajar Salai, Loyola College at Nungambakkam, Anna University on Sardar Patel Road, and Madras Christian College in Selaiyur. Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal said, “We have prepared a detailed plan to ensure peaceful counting on Sunday. Our subordinate officers executed our plan effectively and it worked out well.” The cops blocked vehicular movement from MGR Mausoleum on Anna Salai and Gandhi Statue on Kamarajar Salai, as election counting was being conducted at Queen Mary’s College, and also outside Madras Christian College in Selaiyur. The election control room received at least 43 distress calls on Sunday. An officer at the control room said, “Most of the callers informed about petty quarrel on the road. In the afternoon, some residents informed the cops that some miscreants were bursting crackers on the street at Royapettah. Another caller claimed that some people on bikes hurled stones at the AIADMK office on Pallappan Street.” Tamil Nadu police DGP JK Tripathy said there was no untoward incident in the state. He was monitoring the security arrangements in all the 75 counting centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/police-maintain-tight-vigil-in-chennai-on-counting-day/articleshow/82362931.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana Focus On Jabs To 45+ Amid Shortage||HYDERABAD: With about 41 lakh people across the state due for their second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, of whom around 10 lakh people will become due in the next ten days, the health department is prioritising the administration of second dose to those aged 45 and above. The current vaccine stock data shows that the state has around 90,000 doses in hand and has halted supply to private hospitals. Administering first doses to people will be a tough call for the government till vaccine supplies from Centre improves. The state government had written to the Union government to increase the supply of vaccines to Telangana, especially after it opened the vaccination drive to 18-44-yearolds. So far, close to 48 lakh persons have been administered the vaccine in the state. Of them, just over six lakh have been administered both doses while over 41 lakh are due for their second dose. As per the state’s records, close to 42 lakh have been administered the Covidshield vaccine while just over six lakh have received Covaxin. The highest number of doses have been administered in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), with 6.3 lakh doses administered. Of these. 1.3 lakh persons were administered Covaxin doses. Verification by TOI revealed that barring one or two major groups, most private hospitals have no clarity as to how they should go about to procure vaccines directly from the companies. “We have to wait and see. Until then (till vaccines are procured), the vaccination drive for any age group will be difficult at private centres across the state,” a top officials from a leading private hospital said. Providing clarification on the administration of vaccine doses, public health director Dr Srinivas Rao said that while the same vaccine has to be taken for the second dose, it can be taken at any centre. “There is no need for a person taking the first dose at a particular centre, either government or private, to take the second dose too at the same centre. They can go to any centre where vaccines are available,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/telanganas-focus-on-jabs-to-45-amid-shortage/articleshow/82362932.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

If we do this we will get around 100 doctors,” Rane said. Dean Goa Medical College Dr S Bandekar stated that the proposal will be discussed in detail with the minister and health secretary and put forward to the chief minister. “The interns are on extended internship. We can give them relaxation in bond service by one month. There are technical and financial implications so we will discuss this with the health secretary and minister and come to some conclusion because we will get additional 130 doctors,” he said. The interns are getting paid Rs 20,000 a month and Goa Association of Resident Doctors president, who put forth the suggestion, suggested that they be given their registrations and put on Covid duty as bond doctors. In a letter to the government GARD stated that currently one resident doctor is managing up to 30 patients on an average and some are doing shifts up to 24 hours. “The plan of opening up of new Covid facilities is announced everyday. However, there are no announcements on recruitment of new staff or doctors. Are we supposed to manage these additional facilities too, in addition to the South Goa district hospital, GMC, ESI? Is the further plan of the administration to make them work more?” the association asked the administration. As bond doctors the interns will be paid around Rs 60,000 a month.

Three pyres at the Pajifond crematorium, managed by Mathagramasth Hindu Sabha, have been earmarked for Covid funerals which take place between 5pm and 6pm. Cremation of unclaimed bodies which is undertaken by the Margao municipality, also takes place at the same facility. Mathagramasth Hindu Sabha president Pandurang Naik said that the district administration has now requested them to allot more pyres at the crematorium for funerals of Covid-19 deceased. “During the initial phase of the pandemic last year, we had earmarked one pyre for Covid deaths, but as deaths increased, another two pyres were made available to the authorities to conduct the funerals on humanitarian grounds. Providing more pyres is difficult as other pyres are needed for conducting general funerals. So, we have now decided to build four more pyres at the crematorium which will meet the needs of the authorities,” Naik said. He has sought donations from the public for the purpose. Moreover, scarcity of firewood for the funerals is another constraint the organisation faces in conducting funerals at the crematorium. “ I appeal to all those who have spare firewood to consider handing it over to us,” Naik said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/margao-crematorium-to-build-4-new-pyres/articleshow/82361422.cms||---

---||Kolkata||How Mamata countered BJP’s Bengal rise to score a hattrick||KOLKATA: It was an election with many firsts for Mamata Banerjee. In a career spanning almost four decades, she had never contested a seat outside south Kolkata — much less against an estranged aide who jumped ship a few months prior to the polls. A spate of further poll-eve defections posed another unfamiliar challenge. A much-discussed leg injury just when the bid for a third term appeared in need of a leg-up ensured that Mamata, known to always walk the extra mile, spent almost the entire 50-day campaign in a wheelchair. Not all of what she had to contend with was unexpected. For Mamata, who began her electoral journey with a Lok Sabha win in 1984, the 2019 general elections that saw BJP wresting 18 out of 42 Lok Sabha seats in her citadel marked the start of a new political curve. Instead of the Left Front and Congress, her primary opponent in the 2021 race for Bengal was now BJP, which was eager to build on its gains in 121 assembly segments. The vote share of Mamata's Trinamool Congress may have fallen by a mere 2% in the Lok Sabha polls, but its leads dropped from 211 to 164 in the 294-seat assembly. Going into the assembly elections with two full terms behind her, she also faced anti-incumbency. The first sign of change was when poll strategist Prasant Kishor accompanied her nephew Abhishek Banerjee into her 14th-floor Nabanna Chambers office at the end of June 2019. Kishor proposed to counter anti-incumbency with a data-driven centralised approach to identify and address people’s grievances.

Identifying the problem clusters helped Mamata launch her “Duare Sarkar” (governance at doorstep) and “Parae Samadhan” (neighbourhood solutions) campaigns and reshape the Swasthya Sathi healthcare scheme. The data also helped her reposition the party and herself. “Bangla Nijer Meye Ke Chae” (Bengal wants its daughter) was an attempt to counter BJP’s appeal to religious identity. With “Jai Bangla” slogans, she invoked a pan-Bengali nationalism. And to offset the sticky minority-appeasement charge, she declared her gotra (caste). Two of Mamata’s senior ministers, Suvendu Adhikari and Rajib Banerjee, left Trinamool but she was undaunted. “I am a street fighter. I still am a street fighter. I don’t pass instructions in a battle, I lead it on the ground,” she said of her move to Battleground Nandigram. The same aggressive streak made her camp at a Boyal booth on polling day in Nandigram, believed to be BJP turf. “Nandigram opened my eyes,” she would say later. The episode also led her to sharpen her attack against the Election Commission and central forces, which reached fever pitch after the Sitalkuchi firing that left four people dead on the day of the fourth phase of polling. Mamata believes the battle for Bengal has set the ball rolling for the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/how-mamata-countered-bjps-bengal-rise-to-score-a-hattrick/articleshow/82362944.cms||Saibal Sen

Some regular commuters said that social distancing norms are hardly maintained in crowded compartments. Moreover, crowds have increased since February, especially during peak hours, after the north Chennai line was opened. The latest numbers show footfalls in metro trains neared 80% of the pre-Covid daily average of 1.16 lakh. Though CMRL (Chennai Metro Rail Ltd) has been collecting fines from commuters for not wearing masks in the stations and trains since April 11, and conducting surprise checks, social distancing norms are not being strictly enforced. S Lakshmi, a government employee, who used metro service daily from Thirumangalam to her workplace in LIC, said she now takes a cab to her office as the metro compartments are overcrowded during peak hours, particularly in the stretch between Wimco Nagar and Airport. “I stopped using the metro a week ago because there is absolutely no space for commuters to maintain any physical distance when we are on the train. Passengers also don’t follow social distancing norms at stations. As many as eight passengers squeeze into a seat made for six people during peak hours,” she said. “Either CMRL must manage the crowd somehow or introduce special coaches for people who are willing to spend double the ticket price,” she added. A few months ago, CMRL had converted first class into ‘women’s only’ coach to provide commuters with enough space to maintain social distance. While the footfalls gradually increased since September 7 when the train services resumed after lockdown, the opening of Wimco Nagar to Washermenpet line and the slashing of ticket prices saw a significant rise in patronage since February. P Vasanth, who used to travel from Arumbakkam to DMS station daily, said he has quit using the metro in the morning and tries to leave his office early to board the train back home before the peak hour crowds come in. “Even in the station platforms, there is no social distance. When the train arrives, it looks like a suburban service where the crowd rushes to board. CMRL must do something about this,” he said. At present, CMRL operates trains at five-minute frequency during peak hours. Earlier CMRL officials had said there was no plan to re-introduce the special class coach as very few commuters use it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-peak-hour-crowd-at-metro-keeps-regulars-away-over-infection-fear/articleshow/82362951.cms||---

---||Vijayawada||Dhulipalla gets interim relief from custody||VIJAYAWADA: The Andhra Pradesh high court suspended the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) court’s order granting police custody of Dhulipalla Narendra Kumar till Monday in some respite for the former TDP legislator. Narendra Kumar and other accused moved a house motion petition late Saturday night for an urgent hearing and got interim relief from police custody. Narendra Kumar, along with Sangam Dairy managing director Gopala Krishnan and former cooperative department employee Gurunatham, was arrested by ACB over allegations of misappropriation of government land and sent to judicial remand. Later, the ACB moved a petition before the special ACB court which granted four days of custody on April 30. ACB took the accused into custody for questioning on Saturday morning from Rajahmundry central jail. Narendra Kumar challenged the ACB court order to send them to judicial remand before the high court and also filed a separate petition to quash the case. The high court had dismissed the petition challenging judicial remand and issued notices to ACB in the quash petition. On Saturday, the accused moved a house motion petition challenging police custody. They argued that the ACB arrested them after claiming that they have arrested them based on the evidence acquired in the enquiry conducted. Seeking police custody is in contradiction to the claim of ACB and the order giving custody needs to be set aside, argued the accused. Considering the arguments of the petitioners, Justice R Raghunandan Rao gave interim relief by suspending police custody and posted further hearing of the matter to Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/dhulipalla-gets-interim-relief-from-custody/articleshow/82360051.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Ethephon replaces carbide as fruit ripening agent||VIJAYAWADA: The ban on calcium carbide to ripen fruits has brought another chemical to the market — ‘Ethephon’. Used extensively to ripen fruits, experts say that the chemical is equally dangerous to public health. Ethephon is registered as an insecticide. It is sold in sachets and is widely available in the market. Ethephon sachets are sold as fruit ripening powder that produces Ethylene gas which ripens fruits. Ethylene occurs naturally in the environment, but it isn’t sufficient to uniformly ripen fruits such as mangoes. This is where Ethephon sachets come in handy as they speed up the ripening process. The use of Ethephon could cause serious health issues, say experts. According to joint collector of food safety N Purnachandar Rao, Ethephon sachets currently sold in the market contain higher than permitted levels of insecticide. The label on the sachets claims that each pack contains three grams of 20 per cent Ethephon. Three such sachets, nine grams, are used to ripen 10 kilos of mangoes. But, the permissible quantity of Ethephon for 10kg mangoes is no more than 0.5 grams. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has issued guidelines on Ethephon use as a fruit ripening agent. The guidelines clearly state that the permissible quantity is not more than 0.5 grams for 10kg fruit. Further, the sachets should be placed in perforated plastic boxes and should not come in direct contact with the fruit. However, in practical use, Ethephon sachets are placed between fruits and dipped in water to instantly produce Ethylene gas. As the chemical is being used directly and in excess of permitted amounts, residue of the insecticide remains on fruits, says Rao. If consumed, such fruits can cause serious health problems including damage to the upper respiratory tract, oesophagus burns and neurological problems as the chemical is a highly corrosive acid. The food safety joint collector further said that both awareness camps and enforcement drives are being conducted to stop the use of Ethephon for fruit ripening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ethephon-replaces-carbide-as-fruit-ripening-agent/articleshow/82360064.cms||Srikanth Aluri

Amid the pre-results buzz about BJP's surge, Kishor had cheekily declared that the saffron party would struggle to get a triple digit score. On Sunday, that ‘audacity’ became reality. It only added to Kishor’s halo, which has only grown after he stage managed not just Mamata’s win but also helped build Brand Stalin in Tamil Nadu. However Kishor, who first acquired the reputation of poll Midas after playing a role in the campaigns of Modi in 2014 and Nitish Kumar in 2015, dashed the hopes of other politicians who might have hoped to rope him in, by declaring: “I am quitting and I don’t want to do this anymore.” So what, exactly, did Kishor do? The Bengal tally may suggest that the Trinamool scored an easy victory, but the situation had not looked favourable in 2019 when Mamata turned to the former UN consultant for help. The BJP’s odds-defying success in winning 18 Lok Sabha seats — it lost another 3 by narrow margins — had given the Trinamool boss evidence of her vulnerability in the face of corruption allegations and resentment against the high-handedness of local Trinamool functionaries as well a growing perception that she was “appeasing” minorities. For all the hype AMPLIFIED by a section of supportive media, in reality BJP will struggle to CROSS DOUBLE DIGITS in… https://t.co/g6446uRAyb— Prashant Kishor (@PrashantKishor) 1608526371000PK, as he is called, took the repair job earnestly by launching the “Didi Ke Bolo” (talk to Didi) hotline for people to convey their grievances to the chief minister, which would otherwise have been smothered at the local level. Simultaneously, a 60 day-long outreach, “Duare Sarkar” (government at your doorstep), was launched to ensure that the benefits of government schemes were delivered at the panchayat and municipal level, with members of Kishor’s team monitoring efforts of government departments. These twin efforts helped Mamata change her image of being aloof, distance herself from the excesses of Trinamool members at the grassroots, and project herself as someone ready to make amends. I am glad BJP is taking my chat more seriously than words of their own leaders!😊They should show courage & share… https://t.co/L8Zc4PhVtE— Prashant Kishor (@PrashantKishor) 1618030872000He also attempted to counter the charge that she was appeasing minorities while her attempt to whip up “nativist” sentiments against “outsiders” by flaunting her “daughter of Bengal” credentials reminded people of the strategy that Nitish used against the BJP in 2015 by turning it into a Bihari versus Bahari (outsider) contest. After the successful Bihar campaign, PK, who rechristened his CAG into the more American-sounding I-Political Action Committee, was engaged by the Congress for the UP elections. The effort bombed, with the BJP sweeping the state. He was involved with the Congress’s Punjab campaign and his contribution in the form of “halke vich Captain” (Captain in your locality) has been acknowledged by Punjab CM Amarinder Singh, who hired him as an advisor with the rank of a Cabinet minister. He also spearheaded Jagan Mohan Reddy’s landslide in Andhra Pradesh. But Kishor seems to be far from finished with politics. Ever since he fell out with Nitish Kumar and was expelled from JDU, there has been speculation that he might enter the electoral arena in his home state of Bihar as a third force.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pk-sarkar-prashant-kishors-poli-tricks-work-magic-again/articleshow/82362965.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Setback for BJP as party polls only 5% votes in Tirupati||AMARAVATI: BJP’s attempts to emerge as principal opposition party by pushing TDP to the third spot in Tirupati by-election did not succeed when the party candidate Rathna Prabha lost the deposit. The party was nowhere in the contest as its candidate got just around 5 per cent of the total polled votes. YSRC retained Tirupati Lok Sabha constituency with a thumping majority of over 2.76 lakh votes when the party candidate M Gurumurthy defeated his nearest rival and TDP candidate Panabaka Lakshmi in a one-sided contest. Interestingly, YSRC polled over 57 per cent of the total polled votes against TDP’s vote share of around 32 per cent. The ruling YSRC’s margin increased by over 50,000 votes from 2019 elections when its nominee Balli Durgaprasada Rao secured a majority of over 2.25 lakh votes against TDP candidate Panabaka Lakshmi. Although TDP got reasonably good vote share of 32 per cent, it was left way behind the winner in the race who secured over 57 per cent of votes. The biggest loser in the election was BJP which got only 5 per cent vote share despite joining hands with Pawan Kalyan’s Jana Sena Party. Pawan Kalyan held a massive rally in Tirupati in support of the BJP candidate Rathna Prabha. BJP national president JP Nadda and other senior leaders also held election meetings in the constituency. BJP hoped that it would garner considerable votes of Kapu community (Balija) who are a sizeable population in Tirupati constituency thanks to the support extended by Pawan Kalyan. In addition, BJP tried to raise tempers over religious issues, including the caste of YSRC candidate Gurumurthy. BJP conducted a high-decibel campaign in the constituency by highlighting the thefts and attacks on a few temples in the last few months. The party state affairs in-charge Sunil Deodhar made a vain bid to polarise the majority community votes by making scathing attacks against chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy. However, nothing worked in BJP’s favour. The BJP leadership might revisit its plans to strengthen the party’s base in the state as it was nowhere in the near to occupy the second spot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/setback-for-bjp-as-party-polls-only-5-votes-in-tirupati/articleshow/82360070.cms||Samdani MN
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Udhayanidhi Stalin wins big, cements claim to political legacy||CHENNAI: Standing atop his campaign van, brandishing a red brick, Udhayanidhi Stalin, the swashbuckling scion of the DMK family, thundered, “I have brought the Madurai AIIMS along with me”, a battle cry that went viral. There was no doubt about it – the DMK youth wing secretary and son of party president M K Stalin had made an impressive electoral debut. A month later, on Sunday, Udhayanidhi won the Chepauk-Triplicane seat by a huge margin. His convincing win in the assembly segment represented in the past by his grandfather and former chief minister M Karunanidhi, Udhayanidhi has put to rest questions over his fast track induction into the party. His victory is also significant in the backdrop of Stalin’s own reported reluctance in nominating his son as a candidate in this election, to deflate any attempt by the opposition to target the DMK over dynastic politics. Eventually, Udhayanidhi has not only proved himself to his father but also the voters of his constituency. An actor, but not a reluctant political heir, Udhayanidhi tested electoral waters as a campaigner for his party-led alliance in the 2019 Lok Sabha election. He received a good response from people, who loved his extempore speeches. During the run-up to the 2021 assembly election, Udhayanidhi and DMK women’s wing secretary Kanimozhi, besides Stalin himself, formed the three-member core campaigning team. Udhayanidhi began travelling around the state last November campaigning for the party. All through the trail, Udhayanidhi wowed and wooed. His brickbat about Madurai AIIMS to drive home the point that the project had not progressed beyond the customary groundbreaking ceremony – became a hit with the masses. Enthused by the response, Udhayanidhi sharpened his attack on the AIADMK and the BJP. Irked by his remarks, the AIADMK and BJP brought in the big guns to retort – Prime Minister Narendra Modi mentioned Udhayanidhi at a public meeting at Dharapuram. With this win, Udhayanidhi has clearly ensconced himself on the political scene, and is now set to go places as he is likely to find a berth in his father’s cabinet. As for the show-stopper brick, Udhayanidhi tweeted a photograph of himself presenting it to his father on Sunday evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tn-udhayanidhi-stalin-wins-big-cements-claim-to-political-legacy/articleshow/82362964.cms||D Govardan

BSL, a public sector unit of the Steel Authority of India Limited, has begun the process of commissioning a 500-bed field hospital in an open field near the main gate of its plant. A 50-bed temporary hospital is also being set up at the banquet hall of its human resource department. Oxygen at these two temporary hospitals will be supplied from the respective plants through dedicated pipelines. Meanwhile, Vedanta’s ESL will set up a 100-bed field hospital equipped with oxygen supply on the Library Ground premises. Owned by the BSL, the 16 acre ground in Sector -5 has been acquired by the district administration under sections of the Disaster Management Act of 2005 for Covid-19 care and management. “With Covid-19 cases rising continuously, it is leading to shortages of oxygen-supported beds at the hospitals. Hence, it is necessary to ensure availability to provide proper care to patients,” deputy commissioner Rajesh Singh said. Singh said water and electricity at Vedanta’s field hospital will be provided by BSL while the office of Bokaro civil surgeon will lend technical assistance. Singh, however, did not reveal the timeline by when the field hospitals will be ready to accommodate patients. Speaking about BSL’s plans to augment Covid-19 care facility, its chief spokesperson Manikant Dhan said: “There will be 500 beds installed in the temporary hospital only for Covid patients. We will start with 50 beds in the HRD banquet hall and later expand it to 500 beds. We have also floated a vacancy for 30 doctors and 30 nurses for engagement on a short term contract for service basis for a period of one month.” Battered by the second wave of the pandemic, Bokaro currently has 2,500 active cases with 300 cases being reported every day for a week. As many as 300 patients are currently hospitalised while the rest are in home isolation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bsl-vedanta-to-set-up-field-hosps-to-increase-bed-count-in-bokaro/articleshow/82360239.cms||Divy Khare
---||Kolkata||Adhikari wins photo finish after day of ups and downs||Nandigram (East Midnapore): The battle for Nandigram — between TMC chief Mamata Banerjee and Suvendu Adhikari — went all the way to the wire, with both candidates leading several times during the day after individual rounds of counting. At 7.54pm, Adhikari tweeted from his official handle, claiming he had won by a margin of 1,736 votes. after the last (17th) round of counting. The TMC agent immediately dem-anded a recount, but the returning officer turned it down. This prompted a team of TMC leaders — Derek O’Brien, Firhad Hakim and Kalyan Bane-rjee — to meet CEO Aariz, demanding a recount. Later, EC sources later said there was no scope of even the poll panel questioning the result of the returning officer, under the Representation of People’s Act, 1951. The only way was to file an election petition in the high court. The EC’s website, updated around 11pm, declared Adhikari the winner by a margin of 1,956 votes. Banerjee herself had earlier said she would “accept the verdict of people in Nandigram”, but also demanded a “review”, alleging “irregularities”. She also indicated she was mulling legal action. Speaking to the press before the results were declared, Banerjee said: “I had raised the issue of Nandigram, about how votes were being looted. The entire state gave one mandate, can one constituency give another mandate? Is it possible? It is not,” adding, “They stopped the servers for about three hours. They announce the winning (candidate) and after that they are saying something (else). This is some looting going on. Some cheating is also going on. We will seek a review. We will file a court case.” Banerjee said she didn’t mind losing Nandigram, as “Bengal won the match”, and “sacrifices have to be made in struggles.” Mamata Banerjee said she struggled for Nandigram “because I had fought a movement here. But all is forgotten now. I will accept whatever verdict is given by the people of Nandigram…. In this match, we won 221 (seats); the BJP has lost face.” According to the results posted by Adhikari on his Twitter handle, it appeared that Nandigram’s fate was decided in the last round, when he took a 2,556-vote lead, reversing a narrow edge Banerjee held till the end of counting at the end of the 16th round. Adhikari tweeted his thanks to people of Nandigram. “It’s my never-ending commitment to be of service to them and working for their welfare. I’m truly grateful.” Ironically, the last round was held in Sonachura, in Nandigram-1 Block, believed to be a Trinamool Congress stronghold, and the epicentre of the anti-land acquisition movement in 2007. Sonachura, however, has a majority Hindu population. Before the last round, however, it appeared Banerjee had bucked the initial trends to pull through a cliffhanger of a contest. Incidentally, it was Nandigram-1 Block — the epicentre of the anti-land acquisition battle in 2007, where counting was held in the last several rounds — which took her closer to a win but also sealed her fate. If early morning trends were any indication, Banerjee was trailing for the most part. It wasn’t before round five that she started to narrow down the leads to 3,110. As counting began for the polling held in Nandigram-1, Banerjee emerged as the clear leader. Nandigram electing Adhikari over Banerjee will have political reverberations not just in this election but more significantly in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, where two elected Lok Sabha MPs in East Midnapore are from the Adhikari family: Suvendu’s younger brother Dibyendu, the Tamluk MP; and father Sisir, the Contai MP. Banerjee has never lost an assembly election in her political career ever since she contested in Bhowanipore in 2011. When she debuted in the electoral politics by unseating CPM heavyweight Somnath Chatterjee in 1984 Lok Sabha polls, she lost only once — in 1989. Barring Prafulla Chandra Sen and Ajoy Mukherjee (Arambag) and Jyoti Basu (Satgachia), Kolkata has usually elected Bengal’s chief ministers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/adhikari-wins-photo-finish-after-day-of-ups-and-downs/articleshow/82361558.cms||Suman Mondal

CBSE had cancelled Class X board exams and come out with a formula to prepare mark sheets but did not announce cancellation of Class XII exams.

The internal assessment for 20 marks will be as per the existing policy while CBSE has decided to distribute the remaining 80 marks into 10 marks for periodic/unit tests, 30 marks for half-yearly or mid-term exam, and 40 marks for pre-board exams. Schools have been asked to submit internal assessment marks by June 11.

There is no certainty that the phase 3 immunisation drive for people aged 18 to 44 is likely to begin on schedule on May 5, as was announced by the state government earlier. Immediately after her party’s landslide election win, CM Mamata Banerjee announced she would write to the Centre seeking free vaccine doses for all citizens. If the Centre refused to honour her demand, she threatened to sit on a dharna at the Gandhi statue on Mayo Road. A health department official said: “With the kind of acute shortage we are facing currently, it might not be possible to start phase 3 drive immediately. But efforts are being made so that we can start vaccinating people between 18 and 44 soon.” The state health department’s recent notification did not specify a date for phase 3 rollout. “People whose second doses are due are be prioritised. All CVCs henceforth will follow a prioritised immunisation regime whereby only second dose will be administered till further order,” the notification added.

But what is alarming is the continuous rise in death toll. On Saturday, 103 patients died in the state, the first time the toll touched three digits in the course of the pandemic. During the first wave, the highest deaths on a single day was 64 in October 2020. On Sunday, however, the state reported a lower death toll at 92. Since April second week, the Covid-positive count has been rising by around 1,000 cases daily on an average. But from April 28, cases have remained almost static. According to the Covid-19 bulletin published by the state health department, 17,207 cases were recorded on April 28 and on Sunday, 17,515 fresh cases were reported. Hospitals said that with rising number of deaths, they are having to keep bodies at the mortuary for days while waiting for the civic body to take these away for cremation. Covid patients in some hospitals have complained that bodies are being kept in the ward for hours. “Imagine the condition of smaller nursing homes that do not have mortuaries. They have to keep bodies on hospital beds till these are taken away for last rites,” said a private hospital’s spokesperson. Meanwhile, Kolkata Police arrested one Jay Asutosh Mittal (39), a medical stockist from Bangur Avenue and confiscated 18 vials of Remcor 100, a brand of Remdesivir. Police said the accused was stocking Remdesivir and trying to sell it at a premium.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/virus-toll-breached-100-but-fell-to-92-on-sunday/articleshow/82362066.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Imported by Linde, which is one of the prime manufacturers of medical oxygen in India, the consignment reached the airport on a Volga-Dnepr cargo aircraft that touched down at 6.30am. They were then loaded on to large trailers and transported to Linde’s plant in Jamshedpur, around 280km away. “We provided the necessary facilities for smooth transportation of oxygen containers, which are the need of the hour. We have been told the containers will undergo tests to check if there are leakages before they are deployed for supply of medical oxygen to different parts of the country. The 12 containers can ferry 240MT of medical oxygen through the nation,” said Kolkata airport director Pulla Hezekiah.

The bomb had been seized from Gangajoara area by Narendrapur police. ASI Jayanta Bal suffered massive injuries to the lower part of his body, requiring amputation of legs. But he could not be saved. Constable Aurobindo Saha was injured in the upper part of his body, includng face. Saturday’s incident not only pointed to hamhandedness of cops, it also indicated serious flouting of protocol, including wearing of protective gear. An investigation has been launched into the accidental blast that took place in Bonhooghly area under Narendrapur PS, according to police sources. “We will cover all aspects in our investigations. It is too early to offer comments,” said DIG (operations) Ajoy Thakur. Five years ago, three CID bomb squad offices were similarly injured while diffusing crude bombs in Malda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/asi-dies-defusing-bomb-as-it-slips-and-explodes/articleshow/82362132.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||‘Nijer meye’ wins war, narrowly loses Nandi||KOLKATA: Mamata Banerjee won the most important match of her life as Bengal’s voters reposed their faith in their “nijer meye (own daughter)” and propelled her to office for a third straight term. The Trinamool comfortably went past the two-thirds mark in the 294-seat assembly, leading in 214 constituencies till late on Sunday evening and bagging an unprecedented 48% of the popular vote. The victory, however, was rendered somewhat bitter-sweet by a narrow defeat in Nandigram. The Election Commission website declared BJP candidate Suvendu Adhikari the winner by 1,956 votes around 11pm after a cliffhanger of a day. That was, however, the only spot in a resounding Trinamool victory. The BJP officially became the state’s main opposition party but finished a distant second, leading in 76 seats and netting 38.1% of the vote.  The 2021 Bengal assembly poll result also confirmed the terminal decline of the Left Front and the Congress; their combined vote share was a little more than 8% and neither led in a single constituency. This would be the first time the CPM would be drawing a blank since 1967 when it first fought an election in Bengal after its split from the Communist Party of India. It would also be the first time the Congress would not have a seat in the state assembly. Their poll partner, the Indian Secular Front, won a seat but its share of the popular vote could not be confirmed. Ultimately, the 2021 assembly poll completed a process of churning within the opposition space but not in Bengal. The assembly poll result may have repercussions beyond Bengal. Banerjee would be looking to consolidate her gains in Bengal by getting together all anti-BJP forces and may become a rallying point for the opposition for the 2024 LS poll; she indicated as much towards the end of her campaign. Crucially for the BJP, it may miss being in office in a state that sends a substantial chunk of 42 MPS to the LS. The Trinamool’s 4% increase in vote share from the 2019 Lok Sabha poll (when it got 43.6% of votes) coincided with a 2% dip in the BJP’s share of votes (from its 2019 share of 40.6%). What would have also boosted the Trinamool was a consolidation of anti-BJP and minority votes in its favour, which would explain the Congress and the LF’s near-decimation (all figures according to EC website at midnight). Several other factors — largely missed by pundits and buried under the hyperbole of the last few weeks — contributed to the Trinamool victory. The biggest of them would be the silent work done by the party machinery in winning back areas and sections of people that it lost to the BJP in the 2019 LS election. The reverses suffered by the Trinamool two years ago became a blessing in disguise as it made the party focus on its organisational problems and areas where the BJP made significant gains. What also played a critical role were the flurry of people-friendly schemes, like Duare Sarkar, Khadya Sathi and Swasthya Sathi, and the schemes targeted at women like Kanyashree; many of the broader schemes also had women as the primary recipients. The party put its best face forward — a CM in a wheelchair with an injured foot, with the catchy “Bangla nijer mekekei chay (Bengal wants its own daughter)” slogan — as the BJP struggled to get a decent local face to counter her. The Trinamool, carried by a surge of support from women voters, made strong recoveries in pockets of North 24 Parganas, Hooghly and Howrah. It also held on to its bastions in and around Kolkata as well as those in South 24 Parganas, East Midnapore and East Burdwan, helping it to comfortably lead in more than 200 seats. The BJP’s attempts at polarising helped it hold on to its positions of strength in some north Bengal districts like Coochbehar, Jalpaiguri and Alipurduar. But its failure to counter Banerjee’s “anti-outsider” slogan — used against the frequent visits of PM Narendra Modi and union home minister Amit Shah — and her portrayal of the BJP as a party overly dependent on “outside support (of leaders from Delhi, UP and Gujarat)” became a severe handicap. Political analysts and BJP leaders admitted on Sunday that they may have misread the “Bengali polarisation” of votes and, instead, focused “only on Hindu-Muslim polarisation”. Banerjee’s “Khela hobe” slogan from her wheelchair against politicians from Delhi and UP ultimately found greater resonance in Bengal than the BJP’s “crusade” against “Bhaipo tax” and “Trinamool tolabaji (extortion)”. ' The Trinamool’s portrayal of the EC as “Extremely Compromised” and the central agencies’ combined focus on “corruption cases” against its leaders may also have worked against the BJP, whose leaders went on claiming it would “form the next government with 200-plus seats” and said — even after the sixth round of vote — that it had already won enough seats to form the government. Another factor that went against the BJP, especially in constituencies in and around Kolkata, was the Trinamool’s charge of Covid mismanagement against the Modi government. It stuck in Kolkata, as the voting percentage dipped in most seats; along with it went the BJP’s hopes of turning any anti-incumbency mood into a strong anti-state government vote. The BJP might have believed too much in defections and defectors. Adhikari himself may be set for a narrow win but he failed to deliver even his own district, East Midnapore, to his new party; the Trinamool led in at least 10 of the district’s 16 seats. Former minister and another celebrated defector, Rajib Banerjee, too failed to retain even his own seat as the Trinamool won all 16 seats in Howrah. Defector after defector — both big and small — lost, giving credence to the claims of the Trinamool leadership that most of those who defected did so because they knew they had no chance of getting a Trinamool ticket or winning their own seat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/nijer-meye-wins-war-narrowly-loses-nandi/articleshow/82361530.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Left, Congress, which governed Bengal for 64 years, draw a blank||KOLKATA: The Left and Congress drew a blank in Bengal, a state in which one or the other had been in government for the first 64 years since Independence. It was a first for both parties in the state and astonishly happened despite the two former rivals joining hands and roping in a third partner. A quarter of a century ago, in the 1996 assembly polls in the state, the Left and Congress between themselves won 280 of the 294 seats and 86.3% of all the votes polled. Even five years ago, they had 76 seats between them and 38% of the votes. Now they’ve been reduced to no seats and under 10% of votes — 5.5% for the Left and 2.9% for Congress. In the 23 years since it was formed, the Trinamool Congress has steadily eaten into its parent party’s vote, and leaders; the process is now near-complete. For the Left, the erosion has been much more sudden and dramatic, with anecdotal evidence indicating it has lost some of its base to the BJP and the rest to the Trinamool, developments confounding all political logic. Unlike in Kerala, where the Left successfully led a two-pronged battle, the Left-Congress, fighting against BJP and Trinamool in Bengal, got subsumed in the Trinamool-BJP binary. The Congress faced a rout in Murshidabad, Malda and North Dinajpur apparently because the party’s minority voters switched over to Trinamool. Congress candidates lost traditional bastions such as Lalgola, Farakka in Murshidabad, Sujapur, Mothabari, Malatipur in Malda, Raiganj, Goalpokhor in North Dinajpur among others, while the Left lost Jadavpur, Siliguri, and Chanditala in Hooghly. The Left couldn’t pick up a single seat from its erstwhile strongholds East Burdwan and West Burdwan. Abbas Siddiqui’s Indian Secular Front (ISF) candidate Naushad Siddiqui will represent the Sanyukta Morcha in the assembly from Bhangar in South 24 Parganas. Morcha leaders hoped that Abbas Siddiqui’s ISF would cut into the Muslim vote-share of south Bengal, where the major beneficiary had been the Trinamool. It didn’t work in most places. Instead, the minorities, feeling insecure because of the aggressive BJP majoritarian campaign, chose Trinamool in South 24 Parganas, North 24 Parganas, Hooghly and Howrah. The Left has no representation from Bengal either in the assembly or in parliament. The Congress disaster, particularly in Murshidabad, Malda, North Dinajpur, South Dinajpur, also has ramification for the party’s state unit. The BJP, instead, has occupied the entire opposition space.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/left-cong-which-governed-bengal-for-64-yrs-draw-a-blank/articleshow/82361546.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Bengal Covid curbs on standalone stores||Kolkata: The West Bengal government has revised its partial lockdown order issued on Friday evening to include standalone stores whose timings have also been regulated to five hours a day, split between morning and evening. Guests at weddings and other family gatherings have been limited to 50 people. The further measures were announced in the wake of appeals by doctors to impose stricter curbs to bring down the rate of Covid-19 infection and allow some breather to hospitals and healthcare workers. At the current rate of increase in infections, health experts say it will be virtually impossible for health infrastructure such as beds and oxygen to keep pace. More worryingly, ensuring care to patients will prove challenging as doctors and nurses will prove inadequate in the wake of rising patient load. Kolkata is recording around 3,000 new infections every day. Kolkata Municipal Corporation has already prepped up its arrangements for strict containment measures and has identified localities and highrises that have emerged as Covid hotspots in the past two-and-a-half weeks. Localities where transmission of Covid has become rampant include Maniktala, Kankurgachi, Bhowanipore, Ballygunge, Dhakuria, Alipore, New Alipore and high-rises and housing complexes along Eastern Metropolitan Bypass. The civic authority has also asked police to keep a watch on markets in Burrabazar, Maniktala, College Street, Taltala, Bhowanipore, Behala, Bijoygarh and Garia. KMC has also shut down all parks. In the supplementary notification issued by the state government on Saturday, standalone shops other than pharmacies, grocery, milk, sweets, telecom, electricity and transport have also been asked to follow the timings that were announced for markets: 7am to 10am and 3pm to 5pm. Doctors feel the government must also take a long hard look at commute in buses and local trains to regulate crowding and break the chain of infection. They also feel measures have to be enforced in word and spirit to prevent people from crowding, be it at para tea shops or local clubs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-covid-curbs-on-standalone-stores/articleshow/82361969.cms||Saikat Ray

It was the district’s highest single-day death toll. Over 100 people have been penalised and several were reprimanded for violating the protocol. As many as 20 commercial establishments were shut by incident commanders in the past week. On Saturday, temporary check posts were set up at seven different police station limits in Jamshedpur for monitoring and regulating the movement of people. “Many are not sincerely following the directives despite repeated appeals.

---||Kolkata||Bengal election results 2021: Overbearing presence of BJP national brass didn’t work, feel state netas||KOLKATA: Between February and April, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah frequented Bengal 38 times — Modi 17 times, Shah 21 times — addressing gatherings once or twice a week to win a state that is the birthplace of the BJP’s guiding light, Syama Prasad Mukherjee.  It didn’t work. Instead, state-level leaders conceded on Sunday that the frequent visits and repeated assertions that BJP would win 200+ seats in Bengal typified a brand of “aggression” that did not go down too well with the voters. The BJP’s target was to consolidate its support base in north Bengal and gain new ground in south Bengal, particularly in Hooghly, Howrah, East and West Burdwan, East and West Midnapore, and North 24 Parganas. The party did consolidate its base in Cooch Behar, Alipurduar and Jalpaiguri of north Bengal, but failed to gain much ground in south Bengal. While BJP emerged as the major Opposition in the state, its vote share dipped to 38.6% from 40.6% in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections even as Trinamool Congress’s increased to 48% from 43.7% in the 2019 LS polls. State BJP leaders feel Mamata Banerjee’s “outsider” campaign did influence Bengal voters, who for the first time witnessed the “overbearing presence” of central BJP leaders in the absence of a credible Bengal face. In fact, none of the Bengal leaders figured among the “star campaigners” who flew down to the state for a couple of hours every day to fill the vacuum. BJP national general secretary and Bengal minder Kailash Vijayvargiya credited Mamata Banerjee for her party’s “astounding performance” and said the BJP would have to introspect. “Trinamool won because of Mamata Banerjee. It seems people have chosen Didi. We will introspect what went wrong, whether it was organisational issues, lack of a face or the insider-outsider debate,” Kailash Vijayvargiya said. A Bengal BJP office-bearer admitted that state leaders “were not taken into confidence” while fine-tuning the election strategy. For instance, Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath’s promise to set up “anti-Romeo squads” in Bengal in a bid to polarise voters proved “counter-productive”. “There was consolidation of Muslim votes in favour of Trinamool, but the majority Hindu community didn’t vote on religious lines except in pockets,” a BJP organiser said. The other important factor that state BJP leaders want to examine is the impact of “throwing open the doors” to tainted leaders from other parties. “It might have created confusion down the ranks. Even voters began to feel that BJP was no longer a party with a difference. Dissent over candidature, particularly in pockets of Hooghly and East Burdwan, might have cast a shadow on the party’s prospects,” a party leader said. Interestingly, defection to BJP from other parties was the least in north Bengal, where the saffron party consolidated its gains. Besides, the BJP possibly failed to strike a chord among women, who are among the biggest beneficiaries of the Trinamool Congress government’s welfare schemes.  While the saffron camp showcased central projects like Ayushman Bharat and Kisan Samman Nidhi, the state’s Swasthya Sathi and Duare Sarkar remained bigger hits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/overbearing-presence-of-bjp-natl-brass-didnt-work-feel-state-netas/articleshow/82361576.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Poll results give all major parties in Jharkhand reason to rejoice||RANCHI: The results of assembly elections, held across four states and a Union territory, declared on Sunday, gave reasons to rejoice to all major political parties. While the BJP celebrated its victory in Assam, Congress remained upbeat about the Tamil Nadu results. BJP tried to ignore Kerala results and Congress remained silent about Bengal where they failed to open account. Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, the ruling party in Jharkhand expressed happiness about Trinamool’s victory in Bengal as it pulled out from the fray in the eleventh hour to support Mamta Banerjee. Chief minister Hemant Soren congratulated TMC for its victory in Bengal. Addressing media at his official residence on Sunday evening, he said that the Bengal  was unique and “most discussed” for several reasons. “We all witnessed big political leaders hitting below the belt during the electioneering. Several constitutional institutions were politically exploited and it appeared as if the Income Tax, Enforcement Directorate, CBI and above all the Election Commission was functioning under the political guidance but eventually, the people’s mandate emerged powerful,” he said. Soren said that it was because of election commission’s decision to go ahead with the elections that not only the electorate but a few candidates too succumbed to Covid-19. Expressing similar views, JMM central general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya congratulated the electorate of West Bengal for not falling prey to divisive politics. “Today I would like to tell Modi and Shah — Didi toh rah gayi (Didi stayed) you had told people May 2 Didi will be ousted and now you should answer where is the vaccine,” he said pointing at the ravaging pandemic and crisis of vaccines in the states. Congress state vice-president Rajesh Kumar Thakur expressed happiness about the Tamil Nadu results where their alliance with DMK is likely to form the government. He said that the reason for a poor performance in West Bengal will be reviewed. “We were contesting against the BJP as well as Election Commission and people taught a lesson to BJP that it is not easy to win elections using the constitutional institutions unless public is with the party,” he said. CPM state secretary Gopi Kant Bakshi celebrated the Kerala results and admitted that the West Bengal situation needs a serious soul searching. “We have not performed well in West Bengal which is a matter of concern and I am sure that that the politburo will conduct a review,” he said. AJSU Party, which contested only one seat in West Bengal, maintained lead for quite some time but finally lost the seat. Party spokesperson Deosharan Bhagat described it as an endorsement to Ajsu Party’s greater Jharkhand demand. “Garnering 50,000 plus votes is not easy and we have rekindled an old sentiment,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/poll-results-give-all-major-parties-in-jharkhand-reason-to-rejoice/articleshow/82360237.cms||Jaideep Deogharia
---||Ranchi||BJP paid in Bengal for taunting Didi, Modi and Shah should resign: Yashwant||HAZARIBAG: Former Union finance minister and Trinamool Congress vice-president Yashwant Sinha on Sunday demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah, saying they should take moral responsibility for BJP's defeat in Bengal and for "insulting" its chief minister Mamata Banerjee. Talking to journalists at his home in Demotand near here, Sinha said, "The way Modi and Shah taunted Mamata ji during the election campaigns was ridiculous. It hurt the sentiments and feelings of crores of people in West Bengal. Today, they gave a befitting reply to Modi and Shah for taunting her. They should now take moral responsibility and resign." Sinha, a former BJP veteran and a minister in the cabinet of PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee, had joined Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress on March 13 this year. Subsequently, he was made the party vice president. Sinha said the results of the Bengal election will affect the upcoming state assembly elections across the country. “They kept telling that they have come for Ashol Poriborton (real change). Now, there will be a real change at the national level as the people want Poriborton,” Sinha claimed. Criticising EC for the long-drawn election in Bengal, Sinha claimed, "I have not seen such a weak Election Commission as it worked in favour of BJP. The election in the state was conducted in eight phases so that Modi and Shah could devote more time in campaigning.” After Banerjee’s victory, Sinha said the time has come to prepare for a win at the national level. “The time has come for the Lok Sabha election and throwing BJP out of power,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bjp-paid-in-beganl-for-taunting-didi-modi-and-shah-should-resign-yashwant/articleshow/82360228.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Positivity rate — the number of people found positive out of every 100 samples tested — has also improved by more than 1%. It was 22.6% on April 27, and it is 20.9% on May 2. This is first time since April 2, when Coivd-19 cases started to surge exponentially in the state. The increase or improvement in recovery rate — number of people recovering from the Covid-19 out of every 100 people who got infected —has been primarily due to the fact that more people had recovered in the past 5 days then the number of new cases reported. On Sunday, while 13890 people recovered, 12662 had tested positive. It was in the 27 districts of the state on Sunday where the number of people recovering from the disease outnumbered the number of people testing positive. Sources said that for the past nearly one week the number of new cases reported everyday has also been stable and has been above 12,000 and below 14,000 in the state. Though it will be too early to say, but it seems that the Covid-19 curve is now starting to stabilize in the state, said sources. There are several factors that have probably led to this condition, first and most important is the restrictions imposed in the districts by administration, on Sunday too, the corona curfew was extended for another 7 days in Bhopal, now it is effective till 6 am on May10.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/ray-of-hope-active-cases-down-7000-recoveries-up-3/articleshow/82363002.cms||Amarjeet Singh

But J Mercykutty Amma, who was elected from Kundara with 30,460 votes in 2016, lost to P C Vishnunath by 6,348 votes. This time, she saw a major erosion in her vote share which reflected the ire of the fishing community over the controversial deep-sea fishing deal. The loopholes in the fishing deal had become a major election topic during campaign and she failed to come up with a convincing explanation on the issue which blighted her poll prospects. In spite of relief packages offered for fishermen post Ockhi cyclone, the results showed that the community was not enthused with the minister. Minister for devaswom and tourism Kadakampally Surendran asserted his authority over Kazhakkoottam for yet another term. Though his words of remorse pertaining to Sabarimala backfired in the initial round of campaign, he managed to glide over an aggressive campaign launched by Sobha Surendran. UDF’s experiment with Dr SS Lal could do little to pose a threat to Surendran won by 23,497 votes. Power minister MM Mani, who exuded confidence, lived up to his word and won by 38,305 votes at Udumbanchola. Labour minister TP Ramakrishnan also did not break a sweat at Perambra as he breezed to a victory by a margin of 22,478 votes. KT Jaleel, who described his victory as historic, battled his way to a second term in the final rounds of counting. Jaleel – who had a stormy tenure as minister after being embroiled in a host of issues which even led to his resignation – was nearly defeated at Thavanur as UDF candidate Firoz Kunnamparambil seemed headed for an upset here. But, Jaleel fought back in the final hours of counting and won by 2,564 votes. Addressing the media, he said that his win was historic and his opponents had tried every single trick to defeat him. Health minister KK Shailaja, who went into elections riding on the plaudits she earned during the outbreak of Nipah and first wave of Covid-19, won with a whopping majority of 61,035 at Mattannur. Her sterling majority is most likely to grant her a second term as the health minister. Transport minister AK Saseendran won by 37,000 votes at Elathur and water resources minister K Krishnankutty was re-elected from Chittur by 35,146 votes. Another minister Kadannappally Ramachandran faced a stiff fight from Congress candidate Satheesan Pacheni but eventually emerged victorious in Kannur by a margin of 1,660 votes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kerala-11-out-of-12-ministers-who-contested-clear-the-hurdle/articleshow/82363008.cms||---

While 12,662 new cases were added during the day, taking the tally of Covid positive cases to 5,75,706, a total of around 13,890 people recovered from the disease. With these people recovering, the number of people who have recovered so far from Covid-19 reached 4,95,367. In all the four major towns of the state, Bhopal, Indore, Jabalpur and Gwalior, which have also been the hotspots of Covid-19, more people recovered, than the new cases reported. Number of active cases also decreased on Sunday. On May 1, there were 88,511 active cases in the state but it reduced to 87,189 on May 2. However, on the flip side, 94 deaths were reported in a single day in the state. With these, death toll due to Covid-19 reached 5,812. The positivity rate-—number of people found positive out of every 100 samples tested—remained 20.9% on Sunday. This means that out of every 5 people whose samples were tested at least 1 was found positive. New cases were reported from all the 52 districts of the state. And all the districts of the state reported cases in double figures.

While 12,662 new cases were added during the day, taking the tally of Covid positive cases to 5,75,706, a total of around 13,890 people recovered from the disease. With these people recovering, the number of people who have recovered so far from Covid-19 reached 4,95,367. In all the four major towns of the state, Bhopal, Indore, Jabalpur and Gwalior, which have also been the hotspots of Covid-19, more people recovered, than the new cases reported. Number of active cases also decreased on Sunday. On May 1, there were 88,511 active cases in the state but it reduced to 87,189 on May 2. However, on the flip side, 94 deaths were reported in a single day in the state. With these, death toll due to Covid-19 reached 5,812. The positivity rate-—number of people found positive out of every 100 samples tested—remained 20.9% on Sunday. This means that out of every 5 people whose samples were tested at least 1 was found positive. New cases were reported from all the 52 districts of the state. And all the districts of the state reported cases in double figures. The highest numbers of cases were reported from Indore where 1,821 tested positive, followed by Bhopal 1,678, and Gwalior 1,072.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/12k-new-covid-cases-in-a-day-in-madhya-pradesh-positivity-still-high-at-21/articleshow/82363001.cms||---

He was pointing out how the project had not progressed beyond the groundbreaking initiative. A month later, the DMK youth wing secretary won the Chepauk-Triplicane seat — represented in the past by his grandfather M Karunanidhi — by a margin of over 69,000 votes. An actor, but not a reluctant political heir, Udhayanidhi tested electoral waters as a campaigner in the 2019 LS election. In the run-up to the assembly polls, Udhayanidhi and DMK women’s wing secretary Kanimozhi, besides Stalin himself, formed the core campaigning team. All through the trail, Udhayanidhi wowed and wooed. With this win, Udhayanidhi has clearly ensconced himself on the political scene, and is set to go places as he is likely to find a berth in his father’s Cabinet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/after-big-win-in-tamil-nadu-dmk-heir-may-enter-cabinet/articleshow/82363034.cms||D Govardan

While Rajinikanth, after a lot of hype, faded, Kamal Haasan, his rival, has barely made a mark. With Vijayakant virtually retired, his party too is on life support. M G Ramachandran (MGR), was the first to extend his popularity to the political arena. After launching ADMK (later AIADMK) in 1972, he won in 1977, formed the government and was in office till his death in1987. Rajinikanth had a shot at grabbing a sizeable vote share if not power, but he chose to opt out, citing health issues. Kamal was a surprise package. Until his ‘Viswaroopam’ outbursts, he was a nonaspirant, but the prospects of filling the vacuum created by the absence of Karunanidhi and Jayalalithaa and a possibility of outdoing Rajinikanth, at least in politics, drew him in. His target was the woke urban voter. After managing a vote share of 3.7% in the 2019 LS polls and despite perceptions of leading an alliance, his theatrics came crashing down along with those of another actor-politician Sarat Kumar, who himself was shunned by his traditional ally AIADMK. Kamal lost by fewer than 1,800 votes to BJP national women’s wing president Vanathi Srinivasan in Coimbatore South. Kamal’s gamble of choosing the cosmopolitan constituency, away from Paramakudi, where he was born, and Chennai, where he lives, failed to pay off. New stars could be on the horizon, but that’s for another day. For now, it is curtains for Kollywood’s kings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/kamal-haasan-wilts-in-tamil-nadu/articleshow/82363050.cms||D Govardan

Edappadi Karuppa Palaniswami is most likely to have been one of them. Unflustered, the incumbent CM exuded confidence on the party’s prospects. After the death of AIADMK supremo J Jayalalithaa in December 2016, and his fortuitous climb up the ladder, EPS, as he is popularly known, has rarely looked back or down. With DMK’s victory, an unfazed Palaniswami is likely to focus his energies on retaining control of AIADMK. While he failed to defeat M K Stalin, EPS may still checkmate his former benefactor and Jayalalithaa’s close aide V K Sasikala and her nephew T T V Dhinakaran. By helping his party win close to 70 seats, EPS has risen in stature within AIADMK. With AMMK’s poor showing — not a single seat won — and its leader Dhinakaran’s defeat in Kovilpatti, EPS’s stock has risen. But before that, EPS has a challenger within — AIADMK coordinator O Panneerselvam. He himself is co-coordinator, but this would not be the best arrangement anymore. The stage is set for a fight to end the dual leadership structure. There’s also the question of who will be leader of opposition in the assembly. Considering that much of AIADMK’s victories were in EPS’s western turf, getting MLAs to support his claim may not be hard. Moreover, OPS has had a tough fight in Bodinayakanur, while EPS maintained an impressive margin early on counting day. Even his rivals agree EPS’s 4-year stint as CM earned him public goodwill. He was a quick learner, say associates. In more than three decades, the jaggery farmer from the Gounder community has climbed the political ladder to leave a mark. EPS as CM shone. Now he has to be the undisputed leader of the AIADMK.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/eps-beaten-but-hopes-to-retain-edge-over-sasikala/articleshow/82363058.cms||---

He lost the Yanam seat to a novice — 28-year old independent G S Ashok, backed by Congress — by less than 1,000 votes. But Rangasamy can take pride in dethroning Congress from its stronghold as the NDA led by his party emerged the single largest party. Rangasamy, who contested from two seats, won Thattanchavady, defeating K Sethu (CPI) by 5,456 votes. The results, declared in 27 of the total 30 seats, indicated the alliance will form the next government in Puducherry. The NDA bagged 15 of the 27 seats, needing 2 more for a simple majority, while Congressled-Secular Progressive Front got just 7. The Congress rout came after the exodus of senior leaders from the party, the anti-incumbency wave against the last government, its failure to fulfil poll promises and strained ties with allies like DMK. Five independents won, four of them AINRC supporters who’re likely to back the party. Rangasamy had gone into a self-imposed exile after his party, which contested the 2016 assembly polls alone, lost to Congress. It also lost the 2019 parliamentary polls and two by-polls to Congress and one to DMK. But Rangasamy’s ‘wait and watch’ strategy worked. BJP, his one-time party Congress and DMK all started wooing him. He joined NDA when asked to lead the alliance, and when BJP was tightlipped on who’d be CM, declared himself the nominee. He asked his men to contest as independents from seats where his allies had nominees. The four independents who have won give him leverage; he need not depend on his allies to stay in power.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/two-term-cm-puts-nda-on-course-to-win-puducherry/articleshow/82363064.cms||Bosco Dominique

The vice chairman of CII West Bengal State Council, Subhasendu Chatterjee, feels that the decisive election victory of the TMC reaffirms the direction of the government and sets the tone for faster economic reforms in West Bengal. “CII congratulates chief minister Mamata Banerjee on her remarkable achievements and pledges to support the government. In the last two terms, the West Bengal government has strongly addressed multiple issues to kick-start a new wave of development,” he added. Aakash Shah, president, Merchants’ Chamber of Commerce & Industry (MCCI), said the chamber is confident that under Banerjee’s pragmatic and dynamic leadership, a new era of reforms and growth will be ushered in the state fulfilling the hopes and aspirations of the people. “We pledge our all out cooperation and support for all her development endeavours, especially those related to commerce and industry,” he added. Deb A Mukherjee, president of Bengal Chamber of Commerce (BCC&I), pointed out that the chamber stands by the new government as a partner in such challenging times knowing that, as always, the people and economy of Bengal will resolutely surge forward. The chamber will soon roll out a project on ‘Vision Bengal - Moving Towards 2030’, which would be a live and sustainable initiative with projects on the ground with the major stakeholders and collaborators being business & industry, research and academia and civil society. Ramesh Kumar Saraogi, president of Bharat Chamber of Commerce (BCC), has observed that the strong and huge mandate from the people in the state has provided another opportunity to the chief minister to steer the pandemic-affected economy of our state out of the woods and serve our people with her uninterrupted strategic leadership. “The three successive electoral victory implies the trust that the people of West Bengal have reposed on Banerjee’s political leadership and, as in the past, BCC once again vouches its whole-hearted support to the future endeavours of the state government,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/biz-chambers-laud-mamatas-victory/articleshow/82361309.cms||---

Starting off as an extremist with vocal support to LTTE’s Prabhakaran and the cause of the Tamil Eelam (homeland), the former film director has created his own space in Tamil Nadu’s mainstream politics. Seeman’s Naam Thamizhar Katchi (NTK) hasn’t won a single seat, but it has come third in many. Of the 234 candidates his party fielded, 117 are women. Through his rabble-rousing speeches, Seeman has built a strong following among educated youth. He has also penetrated micro-communities, which did not have much say in the Dravidian parties. MDMK chief M Vaiko, a vocal supporter of Tamil Eelam, is now part of the DMK front. “DMK is our political enemy and BJP our ideological enemy,” Seeman had told TOI some time ago. “Congress is the enemy of the Tamil community, while BJP is the enemy of mankind itself,” has been his rhetoric of late.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/voice-of-tamil-eelam-3rd-in-many-seats/articleshow/82363073.cms||D Govardan

Ambulances responding to medical emergencies are taking more time amid the pandemic. Lockdown measures have ensured that transfer of patients to hospitals is swift. However, potholed roads are forcing ambulance drivers speeding to push the breaks. From Polytechnic square to Hamidia hospital there are at least three deep potholes which slow any passing vehicles to a standstill. If they miss it, the patient can plunge deeper into a more venerable situation, said an ambulance pilot, seeking anonymity. In March, the urban administration department had directed proper completion of road maintenance work. Lack of oversight, has meant that main roads like the Rs 350 crore BRTS corridor is no longer a smooth drive. Ambulances are also forced to navigate through restricted roads in many areas. For instance, road from Manisha market to Shahpura is blocked. Ambulances have to utilise a service lane. The lane is narrow, with step speed breakers that causes a heavy bump. Demanding immediate repair of the damaged roads has not been easy for the BMC and other civic agencies. “Encroachments by street vendors are still visible during the lockdown,” said a local resident. When contacted, BMC officials did not respond.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bad-roads-big-hurdle-in-covid-fight-say-ambulance-drivers/articleshow/82363030.cms||Jamal Ayub

Hitting roadblocks, both have reconciled to piggybacking on the Dravidian majors — DMK and AIADMK — to stay afloat. Finally, Congress is likely to win 18 seats and BJP 4. BJP’s last win was in the 2001 assembly polls, when it got 4 seats. Southern districts have favoured Congress the most. Interestingly, except Congress chief whip in assembly, S Vijayadharani, none of the winning candidates are heavyweights. In Karaikudi, the Congress candidate was set to win thanks to P Chidambaram’s influence in the region. In more than a dozen seats, Congress is dependent on DMK’s strength . The BJP was set to win one seat each in Kanyakumari and Coimbatore districts, its strongholds. Actor Kamal Haasan lost to BJP’s Vanathi Srinivasan. Ex-transport minister Nainar Nagendran who left AIADMK and joined BJP 3 years ago, was set to win from Tirunelveli.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/national-parties-still-bank-on-dravidian-heft-to-stay-afloat/articleshow/82363080.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Bhopal: Despite curfew, these streets turn gaming arenas at night||BHOPAL: In some areas of the state capital, it does not feel like a lockdown or curfew anymore. Police patrolling has been ineffective and complaints to Dial 100 provide temporary relief. As soon as police patrol moves away, the partying resumes. It is a repeat of last year’s Covid-19 lockdown. Local residents first barricade one of the main streets, to block movement of traffic. After sunset, the road becomes a spot for night cricket and street vendors start their counters. Some dark corners turn dens for gambling and video gaming. It continues way into the wee hours of the morning, residents say. “I am not aware of the situation. Since it has been brought to my notice, action would be taken,” said ASP zone-2 Rajesh Singh Bhadoriya. For the record, ASP zone-1 is down with Covid-19. The area is located in high security zone with boundary wall of the Raj Bhawan to its east and less than a kilometre is the CM house to the west. This mocking of the police by local residents of Roshanpura, one of the largest slums in the state capital has led to beat police officers sitting in vehicle, yell direct abuses. “You have any idea about people dying in the city. The infection does not spare anyone,” shouted police officer last week. The words over the PA system did not deter, the miscreants returned as the police van left the scene. Over100 cases of the infection have been reported from the slum area during the pandemic. During the current surge, three deaths have occurred in the past three weeks. One lane of the BRTS corridor is functional. The irony of the situation cannot be missed, as ambulances carrying patients, pass by regularly with the play and games not stopping. Last week, senior district officials carried a surprise inspection of movement traffic at Roshanpura. The drill lasted almost an hour around 5 pm. Unrelenting residents were not deterred as blatant violation of curfew norms was demonstrated. A ‘Band Baaja’ procession without anyone wearing a face mask moved through the streets – back and forth the street.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bhopal-despite-curfew-these-streets-turn-gaming-arenas-at-night/articleshow/82363029.cms||Jamal Ayub
---||India||Why Muslim, Christian voters chose to trust LDF in Kerala||KOZHIKODE/KOTTAYAM: Ever since the cobbling together of United Democratic Front (UDF) in Kerala in 1970 in the lone Christian pocket in Muslim-majority Malappuram, the front has become the political platform for minority communities that amount to 45% of the electorate. The political experiment helped shape UDF’s rainbow political base, bringing together the bulk of Muslims mostly concentrated in Malabar (26.6% as per 2011 census) and Christians based in central Kerala (18.4%) and aligning them with Congress’ traditional anti-Marxist vote base spread across various communities. This political experiment was key to Kerala’s four-decade-old alternating LDF and UDF regimes. This time, LDF managed to make inroads into what UDF had considered as its electoral fixed deposits. Among the 66 assembly constituencies where Muslim votes play a decisive role in determining the winner, LDF was able to win 45 seats. Even IUML took a beating with its tally coming down from 2016. Of the 21 seats won by UDF where Muslim votes are decisive, 20 are in Malabar; reflecting the Muslims vote consolidation behind LDF especially in central and south Kerala, where they had to choose between Congress and LDF. LDF seems to have sensed minorities warming up to it and was enthusiastic in supporting the mass agitations against CAA/NRC. It put out full-page advertisements exclusively in Muslim-management run newspapers on April 6, polling day, proclaiming the front will not implement CAA/NRC and that there won’t be any detention camps in state. Also LDF’s big win cannot be possible without the support of the church, especially in central Kerala. And this hasn’t happened overnight. The church was agitated for some time with UDF for the prominence it gave to IUML. The speech made by Oommen Chandy’s son, regarding conversion of Hagia Sophia into a mosque in Turkey, did not go well with the church and its bishops. The stand of Jacobite Church made Chandy sweat though he won Puthuppally. Though Jacobite church leaders met BJP ahead of the elections, they went back to LDF at the last minute.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/why-muslim-christian-voters-chose-to-trust-ldf-in-kerala/articleshow/82363087.cms||---

TOI had raised the issue last week about the struggle of citizens to arrange grocery after online suppliers refused to serve. After the district administration issued a list of grocery stores to supply, several shops situated within the colonies were opened. “We were running out of almost all the groceries. Thankfully, I could manage to buy it today from a small shop situated in my colony,” said Adarsh Gupta, a resident of Kolar. As the shops were opened after long-time the shopkeepers were also not able to supply as per the demand. “After distributing the grocery, I exhausted several other important items. I will try to get it in the next couple of days,” said Praveen Mishra, a shopkeeper in the BHEL area. On the contrary, online grocery suppliers continue to struggle. Although a list of the shopkeepers who were supposed to provide grocery at doorsteps could not start it properly on the first day. “I called up a grocery store for home delivery but he told me that he would be able to do it in the next few days as he was not having all items at his shop,” said Ganesh Upadhyay, a resident of Sonagiri area. Notably, supply of groceries in the state capital witnessed a hit for the past few days after online delivery was completely stopped while BMC did not start the home delivery. Online delivery portals even put a notice on their portal that they were not able to provide their services from April 27, 29 to May 1 and 2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/nod-to-open-grocery-stores-offers-respite-to-customers-shopkeepers/articleshow/82363102.cms||Ramendra Singh

What could offer some solace is that the party finished second in 8 seats. At Manjeswaram in Kasaragod, where party state president K Surendran put up a strong fight, it lost by a narrow margin of 745 votes to the Indian Union Muslim League candidate. Apart from Manjeswaram, Surendran contested from Konni in Pathanamthitta. The leader who was also the face of BJP during the Sabarimala agitations was relegated to third position in the constituency where the temple is situated. At Kazhakkoottam, where BJP’s Sobha Surendran raised the issue aggressively against sitting MLA and devaswom minister Kadakampally Surendran, BJP finished second. The minister retained the seat by 23,497 votes. However, the real jolt came from Nemom where BJP won for the first time in 2016. Nemom had emerged as a major arena even before campaigning had begun. In the tightly-contested fight, former CPM MLA from Nemom V Sivankutty defeated BJP’s Kummanam Rajasekharan by over 5,750 votes. The last iota of hope was with ‘Metro Man’ E Sreedharan in Palakkad but the 88-year-old technocrat lost to sitting Congress MLA Shafi Parambil by 3,863 votes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/bjp-no-show-as-sabari-fails-to-click-nemom-slips-too/articleshow/82363110.cms||---

Shailaja, who contested from Mattannur, a CPM citadel in Kannur, won by a better margin than other bigwigs of the party, including CM Pinarayi Vijayan who won by over 50,000 votes. She had contested from Kuthuparamba last term and had won by 12,291 votes. She moved to Mattannur as her seat was allotted to an alliance partner. Shailaja garnered international acclaim for her department’s handling of the 2018 Nipah outbreak in Kerala and the pandemic.

The authorities are scrambling to initiate measures to take care of such children. “On Saturday, we heard of a 12-yearold boy from Summanahalli who lost both parents to the virus. On Sunday, another such case was flagged off from Whitefield. We’re discussing how to handle these cases. Many childcare institutions had closed on the government’s directions during the pandemic to send children back to their parents if the conditions are conducive. We’re checking if they can reopen and accommodate these children,” said Antony Sebastian, chairperson, Karnataka State Protection of Child Rights. Nagasimha G Rao, director, Child Rights Trust, said he received two similar phone calls recently. Kids below five do not understand concept of death: DocOne was from a mother who lost her husband, a daily-wage labourer and bread-winner. They wanted food and counselling. A grandmother called for her grand-daughter who lost both parents. She said she’s in no position to look after the girl.” In some cases, relatives find it difficult to reach out to children because of the lockdown or children themselves testing positive. “The kids are at a loss to understand what’s happening and need counselling,” Rao added. Whitefield Rising, the citizens’ movement, faced two situations on Saturday and Sunday. A member said: “On Saturday, we heard of a father who had passed away, mother was admitted to a hospital and their child was suspected positive. A neighbour finally took her in. On Sunday, we were told of an older, autistic child whose parents are in hospital. We issued an advisory that parents must plan for who will take care of their kids if they fall ill. Note down all information that the caretaker needs to know about the child — allergies, medication, likes and dislikes. Have a conversation with children about the plans.” There are also social media requests for breast milk from lactating mothers following the death of biological mothers. The women and child welfare department said while one helpline number (1098) is working 24/7, it will get the other helpline (14499, that’s currently open from 8am to 8pm) to operate round the clock. “We’ll ask all district children protection centres to notify one centre to immediately shelter children who have lost one or both parents,” said Anuradha KN, director, women and child welfare department. She added that cases brought to their notice through newspapers or otherwise have been taken care of. The government has created a new team for child protection. “In our WhatsApp groups of NGOs and civil societies, we started noticing cases where children needed help — some alone at home as parents were hospitalised or those who lost a parent, among others. We started a group on WhatsApp exclusively for child protection and has experts, including specialists in mental health and child welfare and officials from the government and Unicef,” said Uma Mahadevan, principal secretary, panchayati raj, who coordinates with civil society on needs during the pandemic. Dr John Vijay Sagar, head of child and adolescent psychiatry, Nimhans, said children also experience grief like elders but it’s manifested in different ways depending on age and developmental stage. “Unlike the first wave, mortality rate in the second wave is high. The likelihood of children encountering death of one parent (mostly), or both, or other caregivers like grandparents is high this time. Unlike a chronic disease they battle, death comes suddenly in the family, mostly in two weeks of contracting the virus,” explained Dr John. “Children below the age of five do not understand the concept of death — its finality or irreversible nature. However, they’re aware of the loss. Some cry, throw tantrums and sometimes have regressive behaviour,” he said.

---||India||All that’s Left as UDF/BJP line blurs||The power pendulum in Kerala has come to a rest. A repeat victory of the LDF is an unusual result and one reason could be that this  happened in an unusual time. There is, of course, Covid, and prior to that the state was visited by series of disasters, from deadly Nipah to a once-in-a century deluge. And through these trying times, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has played the role of a pater familias, ‘karanavar’ in Malayalam, to a stressed-out population, imbuing a sense of guardianship. Vijayan was also quick to address problems of the people, like during the sudden lockdown in early 2020, he could rustle up more than 1,000 community kitchens to feed the needy. The poll results show his quick reflexes during crises have earned rich political dividends. Vijayan’s evolution from dry-as-a-bone party apparatchik to a leader who can propel his front to massive victory is interesting. Coming from Kannur, a district notorious for political bloodletting, he wrested organisational control of the state CPM, from the more popular VS Achuthanandan at the State Party Congress in Malappuram in 2006. What followed was intense feuding in CPM that ended only when Vijayan became CM. Three years into his rule, the state witnessed unprecedented floods. Volunteerism flowered in Kerala as never before and at the helm was the CM himself. Typhoons and more floods and Covid followed. The party unofficially crowned him ‘Captain’. The election results suggest that the Captain batted well. He has developed a constituency for himself among women, much like Nitish Kumar in Bihar. For nearly a year, the government had been providing a monthly satchel of household goods, from rice to a cake of soap, to all ration cardholders irrespective of income. Surveys suggest 50% of women voters, went with LDF, and that among voters aged 18-26, Vijayan’s rating was the highest. Allegations of a goldsmuggling case in which the CM’s private secretary is allegedly involved, and a deepsea fishing agreement which could affect fisherfolk were raised but have not stuck, going by LDF’s thumping victory in the panchayat elections of November 2020. In this election, the Congress could have tread less on the path of negativity and concentrated more on universal basic income programme, NYAY, that they promised in the manifesto. Their loss was also attributed to their truck with fringe Islamist parties, which prompted mainstream Muslims to vote for LDF. In the assembly elections, UDF swung the other way. Along with BJP, they promised a law to prevent worship by women aged 10-55 at the Sabarimala temple. This huge LDF victory owes much to Muslim consolidation behind them from one end of Kerala to another.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/all-thats-left-as-udf/bjp-line-blurs/articleshow/82363130.cms||NS Madhavan
---||India||Assam: The kingmaker who is waiting to be king||Himanta Biswa Sarma loves being the centre of attention, and has never shied away from working for it. That’s how he rose from student leader to BJP’s star in Assam. In his long political career, he has met defeat only once, in 1996, when he contested on a Congress ticket from Jalukbari. Five years later, when he won a seat, CM Tarun Gogoi kept him on the bench for a year before inducting him as a minister of state. Sarma played second fiddle until 2015, when he challenged Gogoi’s leadership, but Congress chief Sonia Gandhi persuaded him to step back. When BJP poached him to breach Congress’ bastion, he steered the party to its first win in Assam in 2016, and became Amit Shah’s favourite. After that, he engineered the induction of BJP governments, alone or in alliance, in all the seven northeast states. Yet, the chair he covets eluded him. PM Modi announced Sarbananda Sonowal as the party’s CM candidate while Sarma had to be content with the post of his top cabinet minister. In the 2019 Lok Sabha election, Sarma was eyeing the Tezpur seat but was told to concentrate on the party’s performance instead. Even after leading the state’s Covid fight and introducing several poverty-alleviation schemes, Sarma was still no closer to the CM’s post, so he changed tack. Earlier this year, he declared he was “not interested in contesting the next assembly election”. Many saw this as a ploy to arm-twist the party leadership into elevating him. Weeks later, his name figured in the list of candidates and he was back in the running for CM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/assam-the-kingmaker-who-is-waiting-to-be-king/articleshow/82363141.cms||---

The recovery rate was 80.41% on April 23, which has increased to 84.19% on May 2 today. According to the number of active cases, Madhya Pradesh which was at number 7 in the country, has now come in a better position at number 14. The percentage of recovery has been higher than the new positive cases in 26 districts of the state. In the state, 83.4% of the patients recovered in one day were home isolation patients and 3.9% of the patients were treated in covid care centres. In this way, 87.3 percent of the patients got healthier in home isolation and covid care centers without going to the hospital. The remaining 12.7% have recovered in hospitals. A total of 68,156 patients are in home isolation in the state. Of these, 97% of the patients have been contacted at least once. Home delivery of medical kits and health brochures is being done to 99% of the patients of home isolation. 251 covid care centers have been started in 52 districts of the state, in which patients with mild symptoms are being kept. At present, a total of 16,636 beds have been arranged. Of these,1,180 oxygenbeds have been installed. The number of beds in the centres is continuously increasing. So far, a total of 22,010 institutional quarantine centres have been set up in rural areas. 2,63,715 beds have been put up in them. Medical kits and health brochures are being provided to the patients residing in all the centers established in urban and rural areas. A total of 845 Covid hospitals are operated in the state. Till April 1, a total of 20 thousand 159 beds were available, which have been increased to more than 60,000. More than a thousand beds are being added daily. The work of laying the pipeline to convert the beds of government hospitals in the state to oxygen beds is going on a war footing. ‘Breakthechainof infection at source’: Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has said that the only way to break the chain of corona is that where there is infection, it has to be stopped there itself. Create a micro containment zone and stop the corona there itself if there are cases of infection in villages, mohallas, streets. Also, in areas where there is no corona infection, there should be strict vigilance of those coming from outside, so that the infection cannot enter there. Chief Minister Shri Chouhan said that with the efforts of everyone, 'My village-Coronafree village', 'My locality-Corona-free locality' and 'My city-Corona-free city' should be made successful.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-recovery-improves-to-84-19-new-cases-dip-says-shivraj-singh-chouhan/articleshow/82363116.cms||---
---||India||Sonowal or Himanta? BJP keeps everyone guessing on CM||GUWAHATI: Even as NDA won the Assam mandate yet again, the guessing game on who will be CM — Sarbananda Sonowal or Himanta Biswa Sarma — has begun, since BJP didn’t name a CM candidate prior to polling. Senior party functionary Jitendra Singh said that BJP hasn’t yet decided on the CM, but would do so in a democratic way. “Once counting is over and the results are notified, the decision will be taken in consultation with the highest echelons of BJP,” he said. While the focus may be on Sarma, it was Sonowal, the incumbent, who delivered in BJP’s last term. He had told TOI he has immense faith in Sarma’s abilities, and gave him portfolios like health, education, PWD, and finance. Both Sonowal and Sarma were formerly with the All-Assam Students’ Union (Aasu). Sonowal joined BJP from AGP, and Sarma from Congress. A party insider said the real battle has just begun for BJP. “You cannot just replace one with another without absolute need, and backed by strong reasons,” he said. Assembly election results 2021: Live updatesSonowal, who joined BJP before Sarma, had made himself a natural choice for the CM’s chair in 2016 thanks to his image as a student leader who fought a long legal battle in the Supreme Court to scrap the Illegal Migrants Act. Supporters then crowned him “jatiya nayak” (national hero). On the other hand, Sarma is convener of BJP’s Northeast Democratic Alliance (NEDA), which led to the party forming the government in all NE states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sonowal-or-himanta-bjp-keeps-everyone-guessing-on-cm/articleshow/82363168.cms||Prabin Kalita
---||Chandigarh||Complete week-long lockdown in Haryana from today||CHANDIGARH: The BJP-JJP coalition government led by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Sunday announced its decision to impose a complete lockdown in Haryana for a week from Monday. The decision comes just days after it had imposed a weekend lockdown in nine districts — Panchkula, Gurgaon, Faridabad, Sonipat, Rohtak, Karnal, Hisar, Sirsa, and Fatehabad — to combat the surge in Covid-19 cases. Haryana on Sunday reported 13,322 new cases and 145 deaths, with the NCR districts contributing the bulk of the total count. The spike in the cases led the Haryana government to impose a complete lockdown. “From May 3, there will be a 7-day long lockdown in the entire state,” Haryana’s home and health minister Anil Vij said in a tweet. The chief minister, who has been touring the state inspecting hospitals and district-level arrangements, said the lockdown was the need of the hour. He said the decision to impose it across the state had been taken after taking feedback on Saturday evening during the video conference from district magistrates and other district-level officials such as civil surgeons, superintendents of police, etc. “Jaan hai to jahaan hai. We need to break this chain of Covid 19 in the state,” said Khattar. The chief minister also claimed that Haryana’s oxygen allocation had been increased to 257 MT and oxygen plants would also be set up in six districts soon as an agency had already been assigned the work. Vij told TOI that a complete lockdown was the only option to break the chain of the Covid-19 infection. “The count of active patients in the state has already crossed one lakh and we are getting at least 10,000 to 14,000 new patients every day. Hence, we were forced to take this decision,” said Vij.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/complete-week-long-lockdown-in-haryana-from-today/articleshow/82360852.cms||Manvir Saini

---||India||Assam: 2016 was about deporting aliens, 2021 threat to locals’ identity||GUWAHATI: Unlike the 2016 election, which revolved round PM Narendra Modi and his vow to free Assam of infiltrators, this year’s election concerned the identity of Assamese and indigenous people. Most of Assam erupted in protests in December 2019, when the Centre passed the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill. Five people were killed and numerous others injured in the anti-CAA movement that sparked a chain reaction across the valley. Leading organisations like the All Assam Students’ Union (Aasu), Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS) and Asam Sahitya Sabha expressed solidarity with the protesters. While the saffron camp’s narrative for safeguarding indigenous identity was to resist the “aggression of migrant Muslims” of Bengali origin, ethnic organisations refused to buy the argument and switched to war mode to thwart the CAA. But on Sunday, it was BJP’s narrative that came out tops. “The people of Assam believed us,” said BJP spokesperson Rupam Goswami. Aasu president Dipanka Kumar Nath said that rather than identity, BJP’s welfare schemes helped it sail through. “Perhaps the common voters felt relieved for the time being due to the numerous beneficiary schemes of the BJP-led government like free rice, direct cash transfer, two-wheelers for students and the promise of waiving microfinance loans,” Nath said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/assam-2016-was-about-deporting-aliens-2021-threat-to-locals-identity/articleshow/82363184.cms||Kangkan Kalita

He is the textbook definition of being an accidental politician. A talented wicketkeeperbatsman, he represented Karnataka in the under-19 cricket. His playing career was cut short when he hurt his eye during a match in 2003. A different game awaited him in the field of politics, and he is currently the most soughtafter man in the capital. “My party colleagues say cricket’s loss is the gain of politics. But I believe in destiny. The journey I took in politics started with NSUI [National Student Union of India], which I joined after the eye injury. Soon, my work was recognised by Congress leaders, who took me to the Youth Congress in 2006,” said Srinivas. The 39-year-old youth leader is the son of a railway employee from Bhadravathi, Shivamogga district. His father passed away while he was in school and his mother suggested that he should join the railways. He dropped out as an undergrad from the National College in Bengaluru to become a politician. Srinivas caught the attention of the Congress leadership after leading an agitation against Hindutva ideologue Pramod Mutalik in 2010. The protest resulted in a police case, which reportedly prompted him to shift base from Bengaluru to Delhi. He was appointed as an interim president of the Youth Congress in 2019 after Keshav Chand Yadav resigned over the party’s poor showing in the Lok Sabha elections that year. When the pandemic struck in 2020, Srinivas strengthened his position in the high command’s eyes by setting up a network of Youth Congress volunteers under SOS IYC. Rahul Gandhi was so impressed by him that he recommended that Srinivas’s position be regularised as the Youth Congress national president. He is the first Kannadiga to be appointed for the role. As part of the IYC initiative, Srinivas has overseen the setting up of Covid control rooms in all states. The main one is in Delhi. The network responds to requests for hospital beds, oxygen cylinders, medicines and plasma in places where the local government is unable to provide assistance or is overwhelmed. Many who need help tag him in tweets and other social media posts. The team has addressed issues of several patients and even a few foreign embassies. “@sosiyc@srinivasiyc Could you please help with oxygen cylinder urgently at the New Zealand High Commission? Thank you,” the New Zealand High Commission wrote in a now-deleted tweet. The Philippine embassy in Delhi thanked Srinivas and Rahul for donating six oxygen cylinders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bv-srinivas-the-ex-cricketer-hitting-it-big-in-politics/articleshow/82363198.cms||B V Shiva Shankar

One person identified as Rajeev Kumar Jain has been taken into custody under various sections of Epidemics Act and Black-Marketing Act. He is proprietor of Vindhya Engineering. During the raid at his godown, police made repeated calls for his presence, but he didn’t turn up. Later, the locks were opened in the presence of independent witnesses. “His brother had a license for oxygen supply to areas within jurisdiction of Rewa district. He, however, failed to produce any documents relevant to over 500 oxygen cylinders that were found in his possession in Satna district and some LPG cylinders,” said Dharamveer Yadav, SP Satna district. Following leads of Satna police, 178 more cylinders were seized from Rewa district. There were intelligence inputs that Jain was selling oxygen selling cylinders in black market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/over-600-seized-oxygen-cylinders-provided-to-hospitals-in-satna-rewa/articleshow/82363190.cms||---

Sources said civil surgeons will be asked to prepare details of diagnosis, treatment and death summeries of the deceased to compile the report within a fortnight. According to senior medicos associated with the process, this will help medicos on Covid duty improve planning of management of patients.. Besides, the report will also include if the deceased was Haryana domiciled or not. So far, the weekly data on deaths included age, sex, comorbidities etc in the reports. “This will be sort of clinical audit of deaths in the state. The same will be shared with PGIMS, Rohtak, as well experts for more guidelines,’’ said an official from integrated disease surveillance program (IDSP) which is dealing with Covid management in the state. Till April 1, Haryana had reported 4,341 deaths due to Covid. In related development, health authorities also sought data of Covid crematarioums from the urban local bodies department. There had been a mismatch of death data released in bulletins and Covid cremations in dedicated cremation grounds across the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/to-improve-care-haryana-to-carry-out-clinical-audit-of-covid-deaths/articleshow/82360929.cms||Manvir Saini
---||Chandigarh||Use lockdown to ramp up medical infrastructure in Chandigarh: Bhupinder Singh Hooda||CHANDIGARH: Former CM and leader of opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Sunday said the government should use the lockdown period to improve medical infrastructure in the state as it has completely failed in providing beds, oxygen and medicines to Covid patients. “The government tells the media that there is no lack of oxygen, but admits in the high court that there is a shortage. Why such duplicity? People with empty oxygen cylinders in the streets are a proof of the utter state disarray the government has pushed the state into,” he alleged. Urging the government to use lockdown to ensure provision of beds, oxygen and medicines in hospitals, he added, “It is unacceptable that citizens die due to lack of medical facilities and live saving drugs. We are ready to cooperate with the government in every way to deal with this crisis. We believe that this is the time to rise above politics and unite and fight the pandemic.” He also urged the people “to move towards cities only if it is very important as most of our villages have still not been impacted by the pandemic. All of us must understand our responsibility and take full care”. He also called for restraint and avoid large gatherings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/use-lockdown-to-ramp-up-infra-hooda/articleshow/82360943.cms||---
---||India||Regional parties split votes, help BJP win in Assam||GUWAHATI: The Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP) and Raijor Dal (RD), two new political parties born out of the anti-CAA movement, not only failed to make a mark in the elections but also ended up helping BJP, their main opponent, by splitting opposition votes. Insiders in both the parties blamed Congress’ decision to ally with AIUDF, which many caste Assamese organisations call a ‘communal party’. And this is being seen as the prime reason for votes swinging in BJP’s favour. Only RD could open its account by sending its president and jailed peasant leader Akhil Gogoi to the assembly from the Sivasagar seat. “Had there been a united fight from anti-BJP parties, they could have inched closer to forming the government. Division of votes, mainly in upper Assam, helped BJP win,” said lawyer Santanu Barthakur. Political science professor at Gauhati University, Akhil Ranjan Dutta, said the two parties failed to choose diversity of issues, while focusing on the issue of anti-CAA sentiments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/regional-parties-split-votes-help-bjp-win/articleshow/82363208.cms||Kangkan Kalita
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Punjab gets 3.29 lakh doses for phase III drive launch||CHANDIGARH: Punjab is all set to immunise people in the age group of 18-44 years as it is expected to get the 3.29 lakh vaccine doses shortly. The information was shared by principal secretary health and family welfare Hussan Lal during a Covid review meeting chaired chief secretary Vini Mahajan. To ramp up the health facilities in its fight against the virus, the Punjab government has provided districts another 809 ventilators. Mahajan directed all the deputy commissioners to install the new ventilators and ensure that not a single oxygen concentrator and ventilator remain unused. She also ordered work from home for private offices so that the chain of Covid transmission can be arrested. Addressing administrative secretaries, deputy commissioners, commissioners of police, senior superintendents of police and civil surgeons through video conferencing, the chief secretary directed all departments concerned to increase the number of Level-2 and Level-3 beds to provide the best possible care to Covid patients as 14 of the total 22 districts have been showing above 10% positivity rate. She reiterated that the work to set up two makeshift hospitals equipped with ICU facilities exclusively for Covid patients in Mohali and Bathinda has been expedited and that they will be made functional by the end of this month. Urging private hospitals for more active participation in the fight against the pandemic, the chief secretary ordered DCs to extend every possible support to increase bed capacity in such facilities. “Strict enforcement of restrictions should be ensured in true spirit to save lives,” she emphasised. Taking note of patients from Delhi and NCR heading towards Punjab for treatment, Mahajan said they should also be treated equally in the state. Stating that Punjab was coordinating with the Union government to get additional medical oxygen supplies from Bokaro and other parts of the country besides enhancing its own production, Mahajan asked the departments of industries and medical education and research to further ramp up production to ensure seamless and hassle-free medical oxygen supplies to the state’s medical colleges and hospitals. “No holding back of empty oxygen cylinders should be allowed at any cost,” she asserted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-gets-3-29-lakh-doses-for-phase-iii-drive-launch/articleshow/82360969.cms||---
---||Hubballi||Karnataka bypolls: BJP wins Belagavi thriller, Congress Maski||BELAGAVI: It was down to the wire in the battle for Belagavi, with the last few rounds of counting deciding the winner of the April 17 Lok Sabha byelection here on Sunday. BJP’s Mangala Angadi, wife of late Union minister Suresh Angadi, defeated Satish Jarkiholi by 5,240 votes after hours of counting turned the contest into a cliffhanger. Shubham Shelke, the Maharashtra Ekikarna Samiti-backed independent candidate and tacitly supported by ruling Shiv Sena in Maharashtra in this border constituency, divided the dominant Maratha community votes and this led to the close encounter. Shelke secured 1.2 lakh votes which would have traditionally gone to the BJP. In the two assembly byelections held on the same day, BJP and Congress shared the honours winning Basavakalyan and Maski segments, respectively. Mangala is 1st woman MP from BelagaviWhile Satish secured a lead in the majority of eight assembly segments, what swung the contest in Mangala’s favour was the 85,641 votes she got in Gokak, held by former water resources minister and Satish’s brother BJP MLA Ramesh Jarkiholi. While Mangala got 4,40,327 votes, Satish managed to get 4,35,087. She is the first woman MP from this constituency. BJP and Congress shared honours in the two assembly bypolls, with the former winning Basavakalyan and the latter retaining Maski. Sharanu Salagar (BJP) sailed home comfortably by a margin of 20,629 votes, maintaining the lead from start to finish, negating any impact of rebel BJP candidate and independent Mallikarjun Khuba who couldn’t cross the 10,000 mark. JD(S) played a crucial role in dividing the minority votes for the Congress with its candidate Syed Yasrab Ali Qadari getting 20,448 votes. The Congress, which fielded Mala, wife of late MLA B Narayanarao, managed to get 50,383 votes as against Salagar who got 71,012. The bigger upset was in Maski where BJP MLA Pratapgouda Patil lost by a huge margin of 30,606 votes to Basanagouda Turvihal (Congress). This, despite chief minister BS Yediyurappa’s son and party state vice-president BY Vijayendr campaigning for Patil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/karnataka-bypolls-bjp-wins-belagavi-thriller-congress-maski/articleshow/82363225.cms||---
---||Chennai||Committed and loyal cadre kept DMK on track||Chennai: As the counting progressed and the trend became clearer on Sunday, DMK president M K Stalin must have let out a huge sigh of relief. It was not just a decade long wait for him and the party in the opposition. By returning to power, they have also put to rest doubts over the future of the party under him, especially with an aggressive BJP baying for blood.Of course, for the DMK and its cadres, waiting in the opposition for long is nothing new. They had spent nearly 13 years in the wilderness under M Karunanidhi, when MGR ruled the roost till his death. They remained steadfast when the DMK governments were twice dismissed prematurely in 1976 and 1991.If the party has been able to weather many a political storm to stay afloat, it was not only due to the hard work of its party leaders, but also due to the resoluteness and the perseverance of the DMK cadres at the grassroots. Their last mile connectivity with the people remains unparalleled in Tamil Nadu. If the victories are celebrated as their own, the defeats too are mourned as personal losses.The DMK’s structure that ensured longevity in the posts of district secretaries, even to the extent of their becoming regional satraps, too helped keep the organization alive with the onus on efficient delivery. Dynasties are not just there among the party leaders, even the grass root workers have remained wedded to the Dravidian ideology of the DMK for generations since 1967, when the party first came to power.“We should keep the cadres on the go by organizing protests, events or celebrations regularly. Otherwise, they will go into slumber,” Karunanidhi often used to tell his fellow party leaders. When there were no protests, still Karunanidhi had the uncanny way of staying in touch with his cadres through his daily letters to his “Udanpirappu” in the party organ Murasoli. He had written around 7,000 such letters.If Karunanidhi believed in the conventional way of staying connected, his son and successor Stalin has opted for the digital mode to reach out to the cadres. This was evident during the first wave of corona, when he virtually engaged cadres and functionaries from district after district throughout last year. If Stalin lacked his father’s literary and oratorical skills, he made up for it with his sheer hard work by repeatedly travelling across the state. A cadre-based party, it will remain so at least for the near future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/committed-and-loyal-cadre-kept-dmk-on-track/articleshow/82363227.cms||D Govardan
---||Chandigarh||Don’t fear vaccination, take a shot in Chandigarh: Shiromani Akali Dal's president||CHANDIGARH: Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Sunday urged the people of Punjab to get vaccinated against Covid-19. Sukhbir tried to allay fears among people against the vaccine by citing the example of his father and former CM Parkash Singh Badal, who has gotten injected at the age of 94. Badal asked chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh to review the worsening Covid crisis directly with deputy commissioners to ensure remedial measures were taken immediately. He also appealed to needy patients to avail the plasma facility initiated by the Youth Akali Dal (YAD). Badal said during his earlier tours of the state, and interaction with people, he had realised there was an extreme reluctance on part of the general population to get vaccinated. Appealing to people to leave aside all misgivings and get themselves vaccinated speedily, the SAD president said, “Vaccination is the only way to tackle this pandemic.” He said the Punjab government had delayed placing orders for vaccines and should take required action to ensure availability of vaccines. Sukhbir said there was a growing feeling that people had been left to their fate. “The chief minister must correct this impression immediately. Things have deteriorated to such an extent because all responsibilities of the chief minister have been sublet to officers. He must take charge of the situation and review the situation in worst-hit districts on a daily basis himself. Capt Amarinder should also hold regular meetings with the team which has been given the responsibility of combatting the pandemic,” he added. Badal also asked the chief minister to take immediate action to ensure life-saving drugs were not black-marketed and people do not suffer for want of oxygen and shortage of hospital beds. “I am getting calls on this issue on a daily basis. Life-saving drugs like Remdesivir which are worth Rs 1,000 are selling for Rs 30,000. People are being charged Rs 10,000 to Rs 30, 000 for short distances on ambulances,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/get-injected-badal-sr-vaccinated-at-age-of-94-sad-chiefs-appeal/articleshow/82360997.cms||---
---||Chennai||National parties play second fiddle to Dravidian majors||Chennai: For more than 50 years, the Congress has been struggling to figure out ways to stem its steady decline in the Dravidian heartland and for more than 40 years the BJP has been toiling to make inroads into Tamil Nadu. Hitting insurmountable roadblocks, both parties have reconciled to piggybacking on the Dravidian majors – the DMK and the AIADMK – whenever they have been accommodative, to remain politically relevant. This time, Congress is likely to win 17 seats and the BJP could bag four seats in the TN assembly elections. The BJP’s last victory was in the 2001 assembly elections.The genesis of the decline of the Congress can be traced to the anti-Hindi agitation of 1965. The BJP central leadership, unwittingly though, may have played into the hands of the Dravidian parties on multiple occasions in recent years, giving the much-needed fuel for the latter to fan and keep alive the anti-Hindi sentiments. The Centre was forced to backtrack and issue clarifications on all such occasions that it had no intention to force Hindi down the throat of Tamil Nadu people.While the political narrative may be scripted even today on emotive issues like language or the Centre’s perceived denial of state autonomy, the answer to the question why the Congress and the BJP are struggling in Tamil Nadu may lie elsewhere too. If the 1969 national split in the Congress wrecked the party in Tamil Nadu as well, lack of political will to regain the lost ground in the state has been demonstrated by the Congress leadership in abundant measure right from late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s period. Her complete submission to the then DMK chief M Karunanidhi’s machinations in the 1971 general elections resulted in the Congress not contesting in even a single assembly seat. Indira was more than happy to retain power at the Centre by securing nine LS seats and the support of 29 MPs from the DMK and the CPI. Nothing, including subsequent mergers of Congress factions helped the party stage a comeback. Ill-advised political alliance of the Congress helped the AIADMK in 1991. Five years later, when the voters were keen on booting out both the AIADMK and the DMK, the Congress leadership chose to go with the AIADMK and its splinter group TMC, headed by G K Moopanar surrendered meekly before the DMK. The Congress never got another opportunity; rather, the matured DMK and the AIADMK leadership denied any leeway to the national party in subsequent elections. Despite being a trusted ally of the DMK, the latter made use of every opportunity including the present elections to cut the Congress to size.There is no denial of credit to the DMK and the AIADMK for adapting well to the changing political undercurrents. Despite stemming from Periyar E V Ramasamy’s rationalist stable, the AIADMK leadership demonstrated its religious fervour and beliefs without any inhibitions, thereby denying the BJP any space to play its Hindutva politics. In later years, even the DMK diluted its rationalist credentials to accommodate believers into the fold.So far, the national parties have failed to challenge and force the Dravidian majors to explain their paradoxical stand. And the BJP leadership is still undecided as to whether to confront Periyar and his ideology or to embrace them to grow in Tamil Nadu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/national-parties-play-second-fiddle-to-dravidian-majors/articleshow/82363233.cms||Jayaraj Sivan
---||Gurgaon||Rs 40K remdesivir: TOI sting gets 2 held in Hisar||Hisar: This lifesaver during Covid-19 will cost you Rs 40,000 a vial. TOI’s Saturday-night sting operation helped police catch two local black-marketers of antiviral injection Remdesivir. The accused, Arun Khurana and his nephew, Partha Khurana, both of Multani Chowk in Hisar, are brother and nephew of wholesale chemist association district president Rajiv Khurana. A court on Sunday remanded them in judicial custody. The case was registered at the Urban Estate police station on the complaint of senior drug controller officer (SDCO) Raman Sheoran. The Khuranas run Holi Medical Hall at Hisar’s Holy Help Hospital . Section 27(b) (sale of drug without licence) and 28 (non-disclosure of maker’s name) of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, while Section 51(b) (defying directions) of the Disaster Management Act and sections 3 (control of production, supply, distribution of essential commodities) and 7 (penalties) of the Essential Commodities Act were applied. SDCO Sheoran and the dental surgeon Dr Tarun Khurana joined the raiding party. TOI journalist Kumar Mukesh and RTI activist Ramesh Verma were made decoy customers with Rs 40,000 cash and sent to the chemist. Partha Khurana, the young man at the shop, called his uncle, Arun Khurana, over to seal the deal and was sent to fetch the injection. A car search on the decoy team’s signal yielded two injections inside. The decoys posed as pharmacists, and after basic quries about the patient, when Partha called his uncle over, Arun Khurana first said the injection was out of stock for three days and even a Delhi CBI officer in that hospital had not received it. Told 49 shots were available at Sarvodaya Hospital and a few at CMC, Arun said even "DI" (drug inspector, old designation of drug control officer) Suresh Chaudhary had called him, saying, "Tillu (Arun’s pet name), it’s an emergency", but he had to say sorry. After a bit of forcing, he acted as calling up someone and said a shot was available but it could be a fake Hetero, so we take Mylan for Rs 45,000 (negotiated to Rs 40,000). He said the shot had revived his brother. The drop point was Jahaj Pul and Partha was there in 30 minutes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/rs-40k-remdesivir-toi-sting-gets-2-held-in-hisar/articleshow/82361068.cms||---

The party’s vote share is likely to be around 8%, up from 1% in 2016 and 4% in 2019. It has also come third in many constituencies.Starting off as an extremist with vocal support to LTTE’s Prabhakaran and the cause of Tamil Eelam, this former film director has created his own space in Tamil Nadu’s mainstream politics.Seeman’s pitch is Tamil nationalism, while opposing Dravidianism represented by the DMK. The NTK is also a party for all “living things” including animals and forests. “DMK is our political enemy and BJP our ideological enemy,” Seeman had told TOI sometime ago. “Congress is the enemy of the Tamil community, while BJP is the enemy of mankind itself,” has been his rhetoric of late.When the momentum started building towards the April 2 election, three parties – actor Kamal Haasan’s MNM, T T V Dhinakaran’s AMMK and Seeman’s NTK – were competing for the third place. But the MNM and AMMK bungled midway by opting for alliances.Seeman’s NTK is the first political party in the country to give 50% representation to women. Of the 234 candidates his party fielded in Tamil Nadu, 117 were women. Through his rabble rousing speeches, he has built a strong following among educated youth. He has also penetrated into micro-communities, which did not have much say in the Dravidian parties that sailed with majority communities.“The one statistic I will be keenly watching today will be the votes for @NaamTamilarOrg in each assembly segment. While the party will not win a single seat, its voters by & large are young n educated. They vote for NTK in TN as a protest against established political structures,” tweeted Karti P Chidambaram early on Sunday, just when the counting of votes had begun. By Sunday evening, Seeman and his NTK have proved that they are here to stay.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/seeman-wins-no-seats-but-his-party-makes-a-mark/articleshow/82363237.cms||D Govardan
---||Chennai||In a close race, Vanathi pips Kamal||Coimbatore: Actor-turned politician Kamal Haasan lost by less than 1,800 votes to BJP national women’s wing president Vanathi Srinivasan in Coimbatore South on Sunday.In a race that went down to the wire, the Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) leader polled 51,481 votes to Vanathi’s 53,209 votes. Congress state working working president Mayura Jayakumar, who entered the fray as part of the DMK front, secured 41,426 votes.Though Kamal was ahead of Vanathi Srinivasan as well as Jayakumar right from the morning, the tide turned in favour of Vanathi in the 23rd round. Vanathi surged ahead and maintained the lead for the remaining two rounds before finally turning up trumps.Kamal Haasan’s gamble of choosing the cosmopolitan constituency, away from Paramakudi, where he was born, and Chennai, where he lives, has failed to pay off.It was a three cornered fight with Vanathi and Jayakumar posing a tough challenge to the star. Vanathi had nurtured the constituency for a long time, making the saffron party a force to reckon with in the area. Besides, the Coimbatore south seat has been a stronghold of the AIADMK and the work done by cadres of the BJP’s key ally and Vanathi’s own support base posed a big challenge to Kamal.On the other hand, the DMK-Congress alliance hoped to ride on the anti-incumbency wave as well as cash in due to the frictions within the BJP-AIADMK alliance. Meanwhile, Kamal banked on the support extended by the urban voters in the segment to MNM vice-president R Mahendran during the 2019 Lok Sabha election.Kamal’s narrative, promising an honest and corruption-free alternative, did appear to work well with the voters of the segment. There was good traction for his speeches among youth of the segment right from the beginning and that was perhaps the reason why he was able to run the eventual winner very close.Kamal, who arrived in the city in the morning, went straight to the counting centre at Government College of Technology and remained there the whole day. Tension was palpable at the centre in the evening as Vanathi surged ahead of Kamal. The fortunes shifted between the two and around 6pm cadres of both parties claimed their candidate had won. Finally, around 8.30pm, Vanathi was declared the winner.With Kamal’s defeat, the MNM has lost its only hope of making an entry into the state assembly. Most of the other hopefuls like vice-president R Mahendran have lost. In a majority of the constituencies where they contested, MNM candidates trailed behind those of the Seeman-led Naam Tamizhar Katchi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/in-a-close-race-vanathi-pips-kamal/articleshow/82363243.cms||Mayilvaganan

Indian Medical Association (IMA) unit in Kurukshetra came out in support and threatened to start an agitation if charges against the doctor were not dropped in 12 hours. According to Kurukshetra deputy superintendent of police (traffic) Narender Singh, a court has granted him bail. The DSP said on April 28, DC’s personal assistant Amrik Singh had lodged the complaint against Dr Lokender at the Thanesar City police station. The PA said: “Around 8.30pm on April 27, the doctor and 25-30 attendants of his patients created a ruckus that oxygen was running out.” The DC sent CMO for inspection who found out that day’s oxygen quota would last till 4am. The CMO also found out Dr Lokender was Covid positive. Countering the charges, Dr Subhash Garg of the Kurukshetra IMA said: “We serve people risking our lives, this vindictive action lowers our morale. Authorities have 12 hours to stop us from going on indefinite protest and 24 hours to stop us from going to state IMA. It must tender unconditional apology.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/infected-doc-held-for-o2-crisis-hoax/articleshow/82361182.cms||---
---||India||Will Didi now lead anti-BJP front in LS polls?||NEW DELHI: Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee emerged “Didi No. 1” scoring her best mandate so far, beating back the formidable force of BJP, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah, a feat that can put her at the forefront of any anti-BJP mobilisation ahead of the next Lok Sabha elections. Even observers, who felt Trinamool has the edge, did not foresee the scale of Mamata’s win. She led in 213 of the 294 assembly seats till late Sunday evening, establishing her supremacy in state politics. The collapse of Congress and Left and failure of their alliance with Furfura Sharif Maulana Abbas Siddiqui helped her cause, but no one could deny Banerjee’s fighting spirit in what was the most important election of her career. Till rallies were called off, Modi addressed 15 rallies in 12 days and Shah addressed 62 rallies in 28 days, in the state. A battery of Union cabinet ministers, chief ministers from BJP-ruled states, including Yogi Adityanath, and central BJP leaders campaigned in the state for 117 days. Banerjee faced the onslaught with hordes of TMC leaders being weaned away by the saffron camp creating a situation that suggested it was a sinking ship. As the battle-lines grew sharper and BJP’s offensive got louder, the TMC chief fought head on, campaigning in almost every seat. With many of her MLAs facing anti-incumbency but her own popularity refusing to die down on the ground, Banerjee’s campaign also saw a direct hit at Modi and Shah. “If she is so bad, incompetent as they say, why is it that the country’s Prime Minister has to come down three days a week to campaign against her… she must be very powerful then,” asked Gautam Maity (35), a taxi driver in Kolkata. The personal attacks on Mamata only brought out the best in her supporters who seemed determined to counter it. While Congress, Left and others were washed out in Bengal’s TMC wave, Banerjee faces a new challenge in BJP emerging as the main opposition. Meanwhile, the decline of Congress at the national level gives her a chance to position as a grassroots mass-based leader against BJP. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's decision to more or less skip the state, initially out of tactical reasons and later ostensibly due to the Covid pandemic, was also read as conceding space to Banerjee in some way. Leaving no doubt that she will lead the charge against BJP at the Centre, Banerjee announced on Sunday that “the Bengal victory for TMC is the beginning of the downslide of the Modi-Shah-led saffron supremacy” in the country. With Bengal done, Mamata Banerjee is all set to start working on an opposition unity to challenge BJP at the Centre, as the main fulcrum of any movement geared towards 2024 Lok Sabha polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/will-didi-now-lead-anti-bjp-front-in-ls-polls/articleshow/82363183.cms||Mohua Chatterjee
---||Hubballi||Karnataka bypolls: Sympathy factor failed to have huge voter impact||HUBBALLI: North Karnataka on Sunday saw the defeat of Mala Narayanarao, wife of late Congress MLA B Narayanarao, and narrow victory of Mangala Angadi, wife of late BJP Union minister Suresh Angadi. Mangala made the final cut with a margin of 5,240 votes. While both parties fielded spouses of their late leaders to garner votes, the sympathy card appears to have lost its sheen as it didn’t necessarily translate into many votes. The strategy failed in the 2020 byelections too, when in Sira, JD(S) fielded the better half of late MLA B Satyanarayana, but was relegated to third place when results were declared. On Sunday, when results were announced, a similar fate befell Mala Narayanarao, Congress candidate from Basavakalyan, who lost to the BJP candidate by over 20,000 votes. Even in Belagavi Lok Sabha byelection, Mangala’s victory margin was a paltry 5,240 votes when compared to a whopping margin of 3.9 lakh garnered by her husband in the 2019 general elections. In fact, Suresh Angadi’s margin was one of the highest in the country at that time. Kamalakshi B Tadsad, political observer and professor at Rani Channamma University, said the only exception seen in the recent past, where the sympathy factor worked, was in Kundagol byelection of 2019. Kusuma Shivalli won on Congress ticket, following the untimely demise of her husband CS Shivalli. “However, such sympathy was not visible in Belagavi, where feudal politicking is strong and an elite concept of politics exists. Opponents are dominant in fields such as sugar industry, cooperative banking, etc., while women candidates are perceived to be mild,” she said. Basavarajeshwari Patil, an assistant professor of political science, noted that sympathy wave failed in front of caste combinations, which saw BJP consolidate its votes in Basavakalyan. “The RSS cadre worked on the ground and ensured there were no challenges like it faced in Belagavi. Congress lacked leadership and ground work, while minority communities’ votes were divided between different candidates,” she added. In fact, in 2018 assembly elections, Congress had won Basavakalyan with a margin of 17,272 votes, while this time it lost with a yawning gap of over 20,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/karnataka-bypolls-sympathy-factor-failed-to-have-huge-voter-impact/articleshow/82363254.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

The mammoth mismatch has given credence to claims of massive under-reporting of Covid-19 fatalities in the city. Managers of two crematoriums and a cemetery in Bhopal told agencies that the last rites of 3811 people, including 2557 coronavirus patients from Bhopal district, were performed in the city last month. Madhya Pradesh home minister Narottam Mishra recently rubbished allegations about the Shivraj Singh Chouhan-led government underreporting Covid-19 deaths in the state.“Altogether 2,052 people were cremated at our facility last month. As many as 1654 of them had died of coronavirus,” Bhadbhada Vishram Ghat crematorium secretary Mamtesh Sharma said. Those 1,654 bodies had reached the crematorium from Covid-19 designated centres in air-tight plastic bags as per coronavirus protocol to prevent the spread of the disease, Sharma said, adding they were consigned to flames. The Bhadbhada crematorium and the Zada cemetery in Bhopal were initially authorised to perform the last rites of Covid-19 patients in the district, an official said. However, due to the rise in fatalities, another crematorium, the Subhash Nagar Vishram Ghat, was also allowed to conduct the last rites, he said. “The last rites of 1386 persons were performed at our crematorium last month. As many as 727 of them had died due to the coronavirus,” Subhash Nagar Vishram Ghat manager Sobhraj Sukhwani said. The bodies were cremated while following Covid-19 protocol, Sukhwani said. Rehan Golden, president of the Zada cemetery committee in the Jahangirabad area said 373 burials, including those of 176 coronavirus victims, took place in the Muslim burial ground last month. The official coronavirus death toll in Bhopal district last month, collated using the daily bulletins issued by the MP government in April, comes to 104. As per the government records, coronavirus has so far claimed 742 lives in Bhopal since the first case was reported last year.

---||Chennai||Finally, the prince becomes the king||Chennai: Soon after the single-phase polling in Tamil Nadu on April 6, DMK president M K Stalin told people to follow precautions against Covid-19, wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi demanding universal vaccination, and announced there would be no lockdown in Tamil Nadu after May 2 (counting day). He was already behaving like a chief minister.Some said Stalin was in a hurry, but it also showed his confidence and sense of urgency. "He told party leaders he had made so many promises, he had to start working immediately to deliver on them," says senior DMK leader T K S Elangovan.Amid allegations of dynasty politics, DMK strategists made a conscious effort to put Stalin at the centre of its campaign. "His name has never resonated so much as it did in the past six months," says DMK’s political strategist Prashant Kishor. "Earlier, he was ‘Kalaignar’s son’, ‘former mayor’… now he was just Stalin, the person, the leader."Stalin’s wait has been so long that many saw him as the ‘perennial prince who couldn’t be king’. Being Karunanidhi’s son helped him climb the ladder, but climb he had to be step by step — as DMK general council member in 1973, political prisoner during the 1975 Emergency, DMK youth wing leader in 1982, Chennai mayor in 1996 and 2002, party deputy general secretary in 2003, local administration minister in 2006, and deputy chief minister in 2009.The final step, however, was hard to take. During the run-up to the 2016 assembly polls, Stalin was unofficially projected as the chief minister candidate, but when the going got tough, Karunanidhi, then 92, said he would indeed take the top post. Even after Karunanidhi became bed-ridden in 2017, Stalin was made only the acting president; he was elected party president after Karunanidhi’s death in August 2018.The inheritor now bears the burden of expectation. "It is unfair that Stalin is always compared to his father," says Elangovan. "Besides being a national political colossus, Karunanidhi was a great orator and writer, which Stalin is not. But he makes up for it with his hard work."Ashok Vardhan Shetty, who worked as the municipal administration secretary under Stalin, concurs. "Stalin has the stamina. He works long hours and tours the state extensively," says Shetty. "He is also courteous and listens to officials."A consultant who worked with Stalin says the problem is that he listens to too many people, adding to his indecisiveness. "A chief minister has to take a snap decision at times. Stalin can be wavering," he says. This, multiple bureaucrats confirmed, would be Stalin’s biggest challenge. "Who he chooses as advisers will be crucial," said a retired official who worked closely with Stalin.Stalin had made a mark as Chennai mayor twice (from 1996 to 2001 and from 2001 to 2002), but his final graduation as an administrator was during 2006 and 2011, when he was the local administration minister for the first three years and deputy chief minister for the last two. Officials who worked with Stalin say he sees the bigger picture and does not try to micromanage. This, in fact, gave him an image of being a not-so-hands-on administrator.Veterans who worked with Karunanidhi say the father kept a distant eye on Stalin by assigning smart officers as Stalin’s advisers, but did not make him dependent. "I’ve not heard once Stalin saying he would get back after consulting his dad," says Shetty. "He took his own decisions, though he must have taken his father’s advice at home."People who move closely with Stalin say he cares deeply for his family, but doesn’t allow that to come between him and work. A former bureaucrat remembers an incident when a distant relative of Stalin refused to report to work after he was transferred to another district. The man threw Stalin’s name at his seniors and the matter went up to the highest level. An uncompromising official suspended the man who then approached Stalin through a relative. Stalin inquired with the officer and realising that the punishment was deserving, refused to interfere.On the political front, Stalin has so far carried the mantle effectively. He has neutralised irritants like his elder brother M K Alagiri and revamped the party district units to ensure that functionaries are as loyal to him as they are efficient. Having established a rapport with Rahul Gandhi, he has been strident in his stance against the BJP, though it may be less out of conviction and more because of reading the political pulse better.Stalin’s coronation raises different challenges to his rivals within the state and outside. While the AIADMK will now have to get back to its internal battles (between factions and with Sasikala) to remain relevant, the party’s regional allies will have to fend for themselves. The BJP will face the twin challenge of rethinking its southern strategy and guarding itself against an anti-saffron axis that just got strengthened with the victories of Stalin in Tamil Nadu and Mamata Banerjee in Bengal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/finally-the-prince-becomes-the-king/articleshow/82363264.cms||---
---||Chennai||Cong rides DMK wave, delivers decent score||Chennai: Before the elections, the Congress in Tamil Nadu was put through the wringer by the DMK, which at first offered it just 18 seats to contest. Despite the snub, the Congress leaders kept their nerve, with the TNCC president openly stating that the alliance with the DMK was firm and his party is not exploring any third front option. Actor and MNM president Kamal Haasan was directly and indirectly luring the Congress to join his alliance.One cannot blame the DMK either. Having burned its fingers by its large hearted offering of seats to the Congress in 2011 (63) and 2016 (41), which saw the Congress producing a very low strike rate by winning a mere five and eight seats, the DMK was firm this time. It had lost a golden opportunity to come to power in 2016 because of the low returns of the Congress. The unimpressive performance by the Congress in the Bihar assembly polls last year did not breed confidence either.Eventually the DMK offered 25 seats, after bigwigs from both sides intervened, and the Congress too accepted it without much of a murmur, since it could satisfy itself with the fact that it got a larger number of seats than the PMK (23) and BJP (20) in the AIADMK alliance. Having accepted the offer, the next big question before the Congress leaders was how to improve the strike rate this time? Any repeat of the past poor performances could literally bring down its bargaining power in the future.Not only has the DMK alliance emerged successful, but the Congress has delivered a healthy strike rate by registering a lead in 17 of its 25 seats. This has been Congress party’s best performance in an assembly poll since 2006, when it won 34 seats of 48 it had contested. For once, the DMK will not have much to complain against the Congress.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/cong-rides-dmk-wave-delivers-decent-score/articleshow/82363275.cms||D Govardan
---||India||Congress again emerges an also-ran but still claims only it can unite country||NEW DELHI: The impact of Congress’s failure to win in Kerala, allowing the Left Front to buck the “pendulum politics” of the state, threatens to be vastly disproportionate to the state’s size and the marginal space it occupies in the national political firmament. The defeat magnifies the now-entrenched impression about Congress’s post-2019 decline. That the party could not win a state where not just history backed it to prevail but where its arch nemesis BJP is not a factor, echoes its fading appeal. Assam, on the other hand, was a tough ask for Congress post-Tarun Gogoi as it was opposite of Kerala. Coupled with the failure in Assam, the debacle in Kerala severely dents Congress’s standing as the principal player against the Modiled BJP. When asked, party spokesman Randeep Surjewala sought to put up a brave front saying, “India can only be capably administered by a national party like Congress. Our regional leaders are good but a one-size-fits-all plan does not work in India, and only Congress has the experience and a national vision to unite the country.” Former Union minister Ashwani Kumar said, “The chastening election results are an SOS for Congress ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. The need for demonstrable and purposive action to address the organisational and communication gaps was never more evident.” Inside Congress, the mood was somber. “The results are very bad for Congress and good for the opposition of which we are a part,” a party veteran summed up the irony of the outcome. Leaders said the four state and one UT results had only underscored the organisational paralysis that they have been highlighting, pointing to the leadership vacuum and groupism. Meanwhile, Surjewala said there was no change in the plan to hold internal elections for party presidency in June.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/congress-again-emerges-an-also-ran-but-still-claims-only-it-can-unite-country/articleshow/82363274.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal
---||Chennai||Udhayanidhi wins big, cements claim to political legacy||Chennai: Standing atop his campaign van, brandishing a red brick, Udhayanidhi Stalin, the swashbuckling scion of the DMK family, thundered, “I have brought the Madurai AIIMS along with me”, a battle cry that went viral. There was no doubt about it – the DMK youth wing secretary and son of party president M K Stalin had made an impressive electoral debut.A month later, on Sunday, Udhayanidhi won the Chepauk-Triplicane seat by a huge margin. His convincing win in the assembly segment represented in the past by his grandfather and former chief minister M Karunanidhi, Udhayanidhi has put to rest questions over his fast track induction into the party.His victory is also significant in the backdrop of Stalin’s own reported reluctance in nominating his son as a candidate in this election, to deflate any attempt by the opposition to target the DMK over dynastic politics. Eventually, Udhayanidhi has not only proved himself to his father but also the voters of his constituency.An actor, but not a reluctant political heir, Udhayanidhi tested electoral waters as a campaigner for his party-led alliance in the 2019 Lok Sabha election. He received a good response from people, who loved his extempore speeches.During the run-up to the 2021 assembly election, Udhayanidhi and DMK women’s wing secretary Kanimozhi, besides Stalin himself, formed the three-member core campaigning team. Udhayanidhi began travelling around the state last November campaigning for the party. All through the trail, Udhayanidhi wowed and wooed. His brickbat about Madurai AIIMS to drive home the point that the project had not progressed beyond the customary groundbreaking ceremony – became a hit with the masses.Enthused by the response, Udhayanidhi sharpened his attack on the AIADMK and the BJP. Irked by his remarks, the AIADMK and BJP brought in the big guns to retort – Prime Minister Narendra Modi mentioned Udhayanidhi at a public meeting at Dharapuram.With this win, Udhayanidhi has clearly ensconced himself on the political scene, and is now set to go places as he is likely to find a berth in his father’s cabinet. As for the show-stopper brick, Udhayanidhi tweeted a photograph of himself presenting it to his father on Sunday evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/udhayanidhi-wins-big-cements-claim-to-political-legacy/articleshow/82363278.cms||D Govardan
