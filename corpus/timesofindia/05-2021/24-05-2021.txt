The death toll from the pandemic crossed 3 lakh on Saturday, just 12 days after going past the 2.5-lakh mark. The country has recorded 1 lakh deaths from the virus in the past 26 days, becoming the only country in the world where the Covid toll, in terms of milestones of 50,000, has risen by 1,00,000 in under 30 days. At the height of its third wave in December-January, the death toll in the US had increased from 3.5 lakh to 4.5 lakh in 31 days, as per worldometers.info. India has the third highest cumulative Covid deaths in the world after the US (over 6 lakh deaths) and Brazil (4.5 lakh). Deaths during the devastating second wave in the country now account for nearly half of all fatalities at 1.48 lakh in under three months since February 15. In May alone, more than 92,000 deaths have been recorded in 23 days so far. That's almost twice the toll in April, when 48,768 deaths were reported, which was a record for any month till then. Several experts have said many deaths during the second wave had not been counted in the official statistics, pointing to major discrepancies in the number of Covid-protocol cremations across cities and the Covid fatalities reported there in the past couple of months. While the number of fresh cases has declined steadily after infections in the country peaked around May 8, the daily toll has not decreased by much. The seven-day rolling average of daily cases was down 32% since the peak on May 8, when the average stood at over 3.91 lakh. On May 22, the index was at 2.64 lakh. By contrast, the seven-day average of daily deaths has dipped by just 5% since hitting a peak of 4,040 on May 16. It stood at 3,838 on May 22. For this calculation, "backdated" fatalities declared over the past few days in Maharashtra were not counted in the daily numbers. Maharashtra has recorded by far the highest number of Covid-related deaths in the country, with 88,620 fatalities so far. Of these, 37,068 have taken place in the second wave, that is, after February 15. Maharashtra, along with Tamil Nadu are the only states, among five with the highest cumulative death toll, where second fatalities have been lower than those in the first wave. Karnataka has the second highest Covid toll in the country at 25,284, of which 13,017 have taken place after February 15. Similarly, of the 23,202 deaths reported in Delhi since the start of the pandemic, 12,309 have taken place in the second wave. In UP, 10,520 out of the total toll of 19,224 have come in the second wave. The corresponding figures in TN are 8,043 out of a total of 20,468. On Saturday, India recorded 2,23,234 fresh Covid cases, down from 2.4 lakh on the previous day. There were 3,713 deaths in the country, around the same as on Friday (3,745).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/indias-covid-toll-tops-3-lakh-50000-deaths-in-12-days/articleshow/82892432.cms||Amit Bhattacharya

Massachusetts-based biotechnology company Moderna, which has developed a messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine to tackle Covid-19, has declined the Punjab government’s request for direct supply of its vaccine to the state. The US firm said as per its policy, the company only deals with central governments. Government sources, however, also said Moderna made it clear that it really did not have extra supplies till the year-end. Coronavirus live updatesCentral government sources said in the case of Pfizer, the discussions around the indemnity clause that the company wants to be exempted had progressed well and the issue of supplies had to be sorted out for the vaccines to be delivered to India. The mRNA vaccine is authorised for use in almost 50 nations, including the US, EU, UK, Canada, Singapore and South Korea. Read AlsoWhy Moderna and Pfizer results could be good news for IndiaWe look at how both the mRNA vaccines compare and which one would be more suitable for IndiaEarlier, Pfizer had also said it wanted to deal with the Centre. The company has been in talks with the government to enter India and has sought certain exemptions and safeguards. It has followed a similar model across most countries. Besides, most companies are facing capacity constraints given the massive demand for vaccines around the globe.

Experts are of the view that the first dose generates adequate antibodies to protect from severe infection, whereas the second dose is primarily a booster shot that enhances the levels of protection.Pfizer and BioNTech are looking to ramp up production to 2.5 billion doses by the end of the year. Moderna, for instance, is hoping to make 800 million to a billion shots this year, with its manufacturing capacity projected to touch 3 billion doses in 2022.

ItPunjab nodal officer for vaccination Vikas Garg said all vaccine manufacturers were approached by the state government for direct purchase, including Russia’s Sputnik V, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson and Johnson’s Janssen, as directed by chief minister Amarinder Singh. Garg said Punjab had received a reply only from Moderna, which refused to deal with the state government. The Punjab government was forced to stop vaccination for Phase-I and II categories in the last three days because of non-availability of Covid-19 vaccines. The officer said the Punjab government was making all efforts for procurement of vaccines to meet the acute shortage in the state, which had received fewer than 44 lakh doses from the central government so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/will-deal-only-with-centre-pfizer-moderna/articleshow/82893485.cms||---

The impact on Kolkata could be substantial, beginning on Tuesday morning, with the heaviest rain predicted for Wednesday. Releasing its observed and forecast track, the IMD on Sunday warned of storm surges of about 2-4m in coastal areas of both states. The National Disaster Response Force has positioned 46 teams equipped with boats, tree-cutters, telecom equipment etc in four coastal states /UT — West Bengal, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry — for relief and rescue operation. In addition, 13 teams are being airlifted for deployment on Sunday. PM Modi reviewed the preparedness of states and central agencies to deal with the situation arising out of cyclone Yaas, a name given by Oman. The Prime Minister directed senior officers to work in close coordination with states to ensure safe evacuation of people from high-risk areas. He also instructed all concerned departments to ensure timely evacuation of those involved in off-shore activities, said a statement from the prime minister’s office (PMO). Modi during the review meeting spoke about the need to ensure that time duration of outages of power supply and communication network are minimum and are restored swiftly, and asked officials to “ensure proper coordination and planning with state governments to ensure no disruptions in Covid treatment and vaccination in hospitals”. “Indian Coast Guard and the Navy have deployed ships and helicopters for relief, search and rescue operations. Air Force and engineer task force units of Army, with boats and rescue equipment, are on standby for deployment. Seven ships with humanitarian assistance and disaster relief units are on standby along western coast,” said an official statement. Issuing its warning for coastal areas, the IMD appealed to the fishermen who are out in the deep sea of east-central & adjoining northeast Bay of Bengal to return to the coast. “The intensification and likely movement of the system is under continuous surveillance and the concerned state governments are being informed regularly,” said the IMD.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ndrf-military-on-alert-as-india-braces-for-yaas/articleshow/82893667.cms||---

Vardhan called Ramdev’s statement on allopathic medicines “extremely unfortunate” and said healthcare workers did a tremendous job fighting against Covid-19 day in and day out to save lives. The yoga guru’s statements have hurt the country’s sentiments by disrespecting India’s “Corona warriors”, he said. In his letter, Vardhan asked Ramdev to withdraw his statement on allopathy. “The statement disrespects the corona warriors and hurt the sentiments of the country. Your statement on allopathy can break the morale of healthcare workers and weaken our fight against Covid-19,” Vardhan said. Citing a video circulating on social media, the Indian Medical Association on Saturday had said Ramdev has claimed that allopathy is a “stupid science” and medicines such as remdesivir, fabiflu, and other drugs approved by the Drugs Controller General of India have failed to treat Covid-19 patients. The IMA also quoted Ramdev as saying that “lakhs of patients have died after taking allopathic medicines”. These remarks were denied as “false” by the Haridwar-based Patanjali Yogpeeth Trust.

---||India||Srikumar Banerjee who led India’s nuclear-institutions at the cusp of US Nuclear-deal passes away||NEW DELHI: Less than eight months after former Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) chairman Sekhar Basu succumbed to Covid, another veteran nuclear scientist Srikumar Banerjee, who headed the nuclear establishment when India signed the nuclear deal with the US and later legislated the liability bill, passed away after recovering from the disease. Banerjee, 75, passed away in the wee hours of Sunday in Navi Mumbai due to a heart attack after recovering from Covid-19 last month. A reputed scientist, he was a leading global expert in the use of specialised alloys used in nuclear processes and was widely published. He joined Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) after a BTech in metallurgy from IIT, Kharagpur, from where he later earned his PhD as well. Soft spoken and affable, Banerjee helmed the atomic energy establishment at a tumultuous time when expert and political opinion was sharply divided over whether India will lose its nuclear “autonomy” by signing the 123 pact with the US. His argumentation went a long way in convincing sceptics that India will not lose its strategic options and will in fact gain vastly by coming out of the nuclear cold once the Nuclear Suppliers Group passed an India-specific exemption allowing nuclear trade. His role in the paradigm shift in India’s nuclear thinking will remain a lasting contribution. Condoling his death, minister of state for atomic energy Dr Jitendra Singh told TOI, "Saddened to hear about the demise of Dr S Banerjee who just defeated Covid last month. His contributions in nation building are exceptional. His specialised expertise in physical metallurgy and material science is reflected in several coveted awards bestowed upon him. My heartfelt condolences." Current DAE secretary KN Vyas told TOI, "It’s a huge loss for the entire DAE family. Dr Banerjee was active even a few days ago as he attended the virtual meeting of the governing council of one of our institutes. The amount of academic work he did for the organisation was unparalleled, especially in the field of metallurgy and material science. His overall academic capabilities were also extremely good. He was a down-to-earth person and we had always looked up to him for his suggestions in difficult projects." Vyas said it’s a big loss, losing two veterans in a few months as "they were our guides and advisers". Banerjee worked as BARC director for six years till 2010. During his BARC stint, he had organised research in nuclear fuel cycle, design of innovative reactors, applications of radiation and isotope technology in agriculture, healthcare, and food preservation and industry. After taking over the reins of AEC and DAE from veteran scientist Anil Kakodkar in November 2009, Banerjee oversaw the path breaking shift of India’s nuclear policy. He retired as AEC chairman and DAE secretary in 2012. Banerjee was a recipient of several awards, including the Indian Nuclear Society Award (2003), Padma Shri in 2005, National Metallurgist Award (2008) and presidential citation of American Nuclear Society (2012). The principal scientific adviser to the government of India, K Vijay Raghavan, tweeted, "Dr Srikumar Banerjee’s passing is too sudden, too soon. His interests straddled the most fundamental to the most applied. In every discussion, his astute leadership ensured that there was more light and no heat. Dr Banerjee had a complete lack of condescension, also spoke to authority in the same gentle analytical way he discussed with a student. Welcoming critiques, he gently navigated reality in a principled manner, helping science and institutions. A culture, to imbibe, amplify."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/srikumar-banerjee-who-led-indias-nuclear-institutions-at-the-cusp-of-us-nuclear-deal-passes-away/articleshow/82894433.cms||Surendra Singh

A joint statement by Congress president Sonia Gandhi, former PM H D Deve Gowda, NCP chief Sharad Pawar and CMs Mamata Banerjee, Uddhav Thackeray, M K Stalin and Hemant Soren said the Union government must stop being “obdurate” and resume talks with farmers’ leaders and repeal the three contentious farm laws. Signatories to the joint statement included Farooq Abdullah of National Conference, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav and Left leaders Sitaram Yechury and D Raja. “We extend our support to the call given by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha to observe a countrywide protest day on May 26 marking the completion of six months of the heroic peaceful kisan struggle,” the statement said. “The central government must stop being obdurate and immediately resume talks with SKM on these lines,” it added. This is the third time this month that opposition parties have joined forces to pressure the government. On May 12, they had demanded the “repeal of farm laws to protect lakhs of our ‘annadatas’ becoming victims of the pandemic so that they can continue to produce food to feed the Indian people”. Before backing the farmers’ protests, the joint group of opposition parties had, on May 2, raised the public health crisis triggered by Covid-19, where they asked the government to ensure uninterrupted flow of oxygen to all hospitals and health centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/congress-11-other-opposition-parties-back-farmers-stir-on-may-26/articleshow/82894599.cms||---

The assertion comes even after the UK’s department of health suggested that two doses of Covid vaccine were required for “strong protection” again-st the new variant B.1.617.2 detected in India. An official, who is a member of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) said Covishield’s earlier studies showed a protection of about 57% with a gap of four weeks, which increased to 60% when the second dose was delayed to eight weeks. With a 12-week gap, antibody protection was enhanced to 63%, he said. “But when we analysed real-life data from people vaccinated in UK, we found the protection with two doses with a gap of 12 weeks was 65-88%. Therefore, we decided to change the dosing schedule. It is a scientifically evaluated decision,” the official said. The NTAGI has decided against any further changes in the dosing gap at the moment. Experts are of the view that the first dose generates adequate antibodies to protect from severe infection, whereas the second dose is primarily a booster shot that enhances the levels of protection. Officials said the UK study data may require more clarity and there were some inconsistencies. “We have not taken our decisions in haste. We waited for live data and the change in our protocol or dosing gap was based on that large scale data,” the official said. The NTAGI will review local data after three months from people who are being vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-to-stick-to-12-16-week-gap-for-covishield-doses/articleshow/82894775.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Every child should get flu shot before monsoons, say experts||MUMBAI: The state Covid taskforce and the newly constituted paediatric taskforce have jointly appealed to the state government to immunise every child with the influenza vaccine ahead of monsoon. At a meeting held on Sunday, doctors from both groups told CM Uddhav Thackeray that administering the influenza vaccine would help curb the incidence of this disease, which in turn will help decongest hospitals and prevent unnecessary testing. While the influenza shot that contains two subtypes of influenza A and two lineages of influenza B is widely available in market, it is not a part of the vaccines given under the national immunisation programme. The vaccine costs Rs 1,500-Rs2,000 for a single shot. Dr Sanjay Oak, chairman of the state Covid taskforce, told the CM, “We are of the opinion that the influenza vaccine should be advised proactively. Since it’s expensive, it’s mostly the middle class and upper class that can afford it. At the state level, we may think of reducing the cost or giving it to every child at least in the next six months.” Echoing him, Dr Suhas Prabhu, who heads the paediatric taskforce, told the CM that at least for this year, the state may make an exception and give the vaccine to everyone.  Thackeray said the state will consider the suggestion. “However, we need more clarity on whether asymptomatic Covid positive child can take it,” he said, adding the task force should provide guidance. Dr Vijay Yewale, also a member of the paediatric taskforce, said flu too is a respiratory ailment. “The vaccine is a time-tested one and routinely given to children under the age of five years. It can prevent a respiratory ailment, particularly in children with chronic condition or comorbidities,” he added. They emphasised that children who may have missed out on their routine immunisation doses should complete their schedule. “It is safe for a child to get vaccinated with BCG, measles rubella or any vaccine they may have missed out four weeks after the onset of their Covid symptoms,” Yewale said.

Apart from trimming weak branches, the civic staff and cops did the rounds of dilapidated buildings to convince residents to move out till after the storm. KMC drainage department officials inspected the pumping stations to make sure the arrangements were in order. While ground-level teams were in action, officials of multiple agencies strategized the response mechanism at the Kolkata Police headquarters. The coordination meeting chaired by the police commissioner had representatives from the Army, National Disaster Response Force, civil defence, fire brigade and KMC. A unified command centre will start functioning at Lalbazar from Monday with representatives of all nodal agencies to enable efficient decision making and quick response. As senior officers and officials chalked out the plan of action, KMC and CESC staffers trimmed trees in the Tollygunge-Netaji Nagar-Bansdroni belt that had witnessed power outage for five days after Amphan. The KMC drainage department has kept all 377 pumps in order to function 24x7 if required. Even if the wind velocity isn’t as fierce as Amphan, the Met office has warned of heavy rains causing inundation. The water supply department held meetings with CESC to ensure there was no electricity disruption at booster pumping stations and NDRF held meetings with KMC and police to decide on how to remove fallen trees. The headquarters have asked all police stations to prepare a ward-wide list of CESC gangmen and KMC response team members and submit it to Lalbazar while local cops have been asked to include numbers of local electricians and tree cutters. Among other things discussed was ensuring cops removed all advertisements and road furniture. The commissioner asked his men to be ready with necessary equipment so they can join the disaster response teams if needed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/war-room-set-up-at-lalbazar-foot-soldiers-hit-the-ground/articleshow/82889635.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Ahmedabad||BJP MLA draws flak for injecting remdesivir in Covid patient’s drip||Surat: BJP legislator from Kamrej V D Zalavadiya has landed in yet another controversy after a video surfaced on Sunday showing him doubling up as a health worker at a Covid-19 care centre in Sarthana area which he is operating along with his supporters. Zalavadiya faced a barrage of criticism over social media and political circles after a video went viral on Sunday showing him filling a syringe with remdesivir injection before transferring it to a drip bottle, to be administered to a Covid-19 patient. Zalavadiya did it allegedly on May 17 in presence of a nurse and doctor, who are heard commenting and laughing in the video. Criticizing Zalavadiya for his act of carelessness, Congress spokesperson Jayrajsinh Parmar said, “State health minister Nitin Patel should get inspiration from Zalavadiya, who has studied up to Class V, and open a centre to train BJP MLAs and workers in administering injections and dressing wounds. This would also address the issue of acute shortage of medical staff in state hospitals.” Zalavadiya, however, said that he did not administer the dose to any patient and apologized for his act. “If I did anything wrong, I apologize but I was rendering service to the people with intention of treatment,” he told reporters. Talking to TOI, he said, “I was not doing anything wrong and I did not want to create any controversy. I was merely serving the patient. I have been running the Covid centre to serve people for 40 days now and treated more than 200 patients and sent them home. I did not give the injection directly to the patient. I injected the medicine in the drip bottle.” He refused to take more questions and disconnected the call. Zalavadiya and controversy aren’t strangers with the MLA landing in many a soup. In February 2018, his son Sharad was booked twice and again in August 2019 for allegedly issuing threats to separate individuals over political and business disputes. In November 2020, another video of Zalavadiya went viral in which he was seen flouting Covid-19 guidelines while celebrating his granddaughter’s birthday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bjp-mla-draws-flak-for-injecting-remdesivir-in-covid-patients-drip/articleshow/82891375.cms||---

The two countries witnessed a faceoff last year, worsened by a June skirmish in the Galwan valley in which several Indian soldiers lost their lives, pushing trade and diplomatic connections to the brink. The exports momentum continued in April as well. Engineering goods exports to 23 countries out of 25 key markets — including the US, China, Germany and Italy — recorded positive year-on-year growth in the first month of fiscal 2021 as overall merchandise trade from the country surged, primarily on account of the base effect. The US continued to be the biggest market for Indian engineering goods exporters, followed by China. While exports to the US jumped more than 400% year-on-year in April this fiscal, shipments to India’s second-largest export destination China clocked a monthly growth of 143.3% during this period, data from the Engineering Exports Promotion Council (EEPC) said. Among the top 25 export destinations for Indian engineering goods, exports only to Malaysia and Singapore fell in April.“All the product groups other than ‘ships, boats and floating structures’ recorded positive growth during this period. The growth momentum has continued for the past few months despite the Covid shadow. The high growth rate in outbound shipment is mainly due to the low base of FY21, but recovery is indeed impressive. It mirrors global trends,” said EEPC India chairman Mahesh Desai.Among the 32 engineering goods, in categories which posted positive growth, exports of iron & steel saw a massive jump of 210% in April this year compared to the same period in previous year. Non-ferrous segment as a whole comprising aluminium, zinc, nickel, lead, tin and other products witnessed 110% growth in exports during this period.According to data compiled by EEPC, engineering goods exports in April soared 230% in value terms to $7.6 billion from$ 2.3 billion in the corresponding month last year. Engineering goods account for about one-fourth of the total merchandise exports from India and therefore it has significantly contributed to the recovery in the country’s external trade. Total merchandise exports in April 2021 were $30.6 billion as compared to $10.4 billion in April 2020, showing a threefold increase.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/engg-exports-to-china-in-fy21-up-over-2x-at-4-8bn/articleshow/82891478.cms||Rajesh Chandramouli

Knowing well the veritable death traps, we ignore them. This time we located such loose wires and alerted CESC to take remedial measures. It was promptly done,” said Prabir Banerjee, Parnashree resident. People alerted civic bodies of tripping of transformers as trees covered them.  “If a tree falls on the transformer, our entire area will have a power cut. Last year, we had to spend five days without electricity,” said Gaurab Mitra, a resident of Garia Mahamayatala. Some anxious citizens have called up the private telecom companies so that they take adequate preparation against the possible onslaught of the cyclonic storm.

---||Patna||East Central Railway cancels 22 special passenger trains due to poor occupancy||PATNA: The second wave of the Covid -19 pandemic has virtually cast a gloom over smooth traffic movements of special passenger trains running on different routes falling under the jurisdiction of the East Central Railway (ECR) . Railways has already cancelled more than 23 pairs of special passenger trains originating from or passing through different places of the ECR either due to poor occupancy rate of passengers or other reasons in the past few days. “However, following a spike in the cases of the Covid-19 and extremely low turn out of passengers prompted railways to cancel at least 22 more special passenger trains either originating from or passing through the ECR jurisdiction from Sunday,” said ECR chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar . According to Kumar, railways has cancelled Patna–Bhabhua Intercity special ( 03249/03250 ) from May 25 while Patna–Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminal (CSMT) Mumbai special passenger train (03259/03260) will be cancelled from May 26 from Patna Junction end and CSMT Mumbai from May 28, the CPRO said adding Patna–Banswada in Telangana special passenger train (03253/03254) is cancelled from May 27 from Patna Junction side and Banswada from May 30 onwards. Similarly, Rajendra Nagar Terminal-Banka special passenger train ( 03241 /03242) will be cancelled from May 25 from Patna side and Banka from May 26 onwards. Likewise Muzaffarpur-Maduadih special passenger train (05161/05162) will be cancelled from May 24 from both ends of the journey due to poor occupancy rate. In addition to these, railways has cancelled at least 12 special local passenger trains running on different routes of the ECR from May 24 onwards owing to a direct effect on passengers’ turnout.

According to sources, railways has taken a decision to cancel those unpopular special passenger trains which have very poor occupancy rate of passengers. Besides, several loco pilots and guards of the ECR have fallen victims to the Covid-19 virus and thus railways is finding it difficult to streamline traffic operations, sources said .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ecr-cancels-22-special-passenger-trains-due-to-poor-occupancy/articleshow/82889067.cms||Kumod Verma

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Scramble for Ayurvedic drugs in bid to boost immunity||VIJAYAWADA: The controversy generated by the popularity of Bonigi Anandaiah’s Ayurvedic preparation and its claims to ‘cure’ Covid-19 has brought under the spotlight the number of patients choosing Ayurvedic drugs to treat Covid-19. Ayurvedic medical practitioners and a number of medical colleges across the state are now providing treatment for mild to moderate Covid-19 patients with herbal medicines. The significance given to Ayurveda in rural parts of the state is not new. Treatment for chest and lung diseases is popular under Ayurveda, and the Ayush ministry promotes many Ayurvedic preparations as immunity boosters to prevent Covid-19. The Union Ayush ministry recently launched a campaign to distribute herbal drugs Ayush-64 and Siddha medicine Kabasura Kubineer for the treatment of mild and asymptomatic Covid-19 cases. Ayurvedic hospitals and dispensaries are now registering for treatment cases of Covid-19. “We were confident from the first day that Ayurveda and naturopathy had the ability to cure Covid-19. Ayurvedic medicines have fewer side effects and are very effective in treating lung-related problems. Though Anandaiah’s principles of making medicine are different from Ayurvedic practices he used herbs that are widely used in our medicines. Ayush- 64 and other medicines are also giving the best results,” said Dr J Ram Prasad, an Ayurvedic practitioner from the city. With the flow of patients at Dr NRS Government Ayurvedic College in the city also seeing an increase, the state Ayush commissionerate is eyeing to establish a special wing to handle Covid-19 cases. Demand for Ayurvedic immunity boosters have recorded a near 200 per cent increase recently and stocks of Kabasura Kudineer have disappeared from stores.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/scramble-for-ayurvedic-drugs-in-bid-to-boost-immunity/articleshow/82889615.cms||Venu Lanka

Narkatiaganj SDPO Kundan Kumar confirmed the killing of Binod Yadav (35) and Rameshwar Yadav (45). “Another victim Amar Lal Yadav also sustained grievous gunshot injuries. He is undergoing treatment at Motihari,” the SDPO told reporters on the spot on Sunday. Munna Yadav, who was disputing Mahendra Yadav’s possession of the small plot of land, reached the spot with armed accomplices in the dead of night. Apparently trying to take advantage of Harendra’s absence as he had gone out to attend a wedding, Munna reached the land and demolished a thatched hut standing on it. Binod, Harendra’s brother-in-law who had stayed behind to guard the property, was shot dead. The assailants also opened fire on two others. While Rameshwar died on the spot, Amar’s condition was reported to be serious.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/two-killed-over-land-row-in-w-champaran/articleshow/82888843.cms||Abhay Mohan Jha

The two, according to police, had a love affair. SHO of Kartoria police station Neeraj Tiwari said the two used nylon ropes to commit suicide. “The two had gone missing on Saturday night. Villagers spotted their bodies around 6.30am and informed the police about it,” he said. He added the family members of the 18-year-old boy and 16-year-old girl came to know about their affair six months back and the girl was sent to her maternal uncle’s house and the boy to Kolkata. “However, there was marriage in the girl’s family and the two had reached the village three days back. The two disappeared on Saturday night and their bodies were found on Sunday,” the SHO said. He added no suicide note was recovered from the spot. “The bodies were handed over to the respective families after post-mortem,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cousins-commit-suicide-in-banka/articleshow/82888850.cms||---

From an average default rate in collection efficiency at 2-3% in pre-Covid times, non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) are now seeing 6-8% of borrowers missing their payment schedules during the second wave of the pandemic. IIFL Finance has halted fresh disbursements for unsecured loans for micro-businesses & personal loans. It has also tightened scrutiny and disbursements for secured loans like loan against property, housing loan and gold loan. According to chief risk officer Sanjeev Srivastav, even in secured advances like loans against property, the company has reduced the loan-to-value ratio to 50-40% from 70% earlier. Cholamandalam Investment & Finance executive VP & CFO Arulselvan D said, “In Q1, we want to be more cautious. Disbursements will bounce back once the cases decline. It is difficult to predict fresh lending exposure, especially when our employees want to stay safe and protect their families. We hope there is no third Covid wave.” The collection efficiency of loans has reduced from 115% in March to 95% in April 2021. “The severity of lockdown was more visible in April when we saw the impact on collection efficiency. Thus, we have made an additional provision of Rs 350 crore in the March-ended quarter, 2021, considering a probable impact of the second Covid wave,” Arulselvan said. The head of another NBFC in the wholesale lending business said, “Disbursement in Q1 is likely to be lower than that in Q4. We are trying to do an additional assessment of the impact on the borrower of Covid 2.0. It shall be fair to say that some caution has come in as part of our credit decision making.” Shriram City Union Finance MD & CEO Y S Chakravarti said that, while it is too early to talk about the company’s performance in Q1FY22, April was a steady month in terms of both disbursements and collections. “Disbursements were comparable to our usual start to any of our first quarters. The localised lockdowns in May are, however, likely to have affected business. But considering that there seems to have been some control exercised over fresh infections in important business locations for us such as Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra, we are hopeful that June will look better,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/nbfcs-stop-lending-on-fear-of-rising-defaults/articleshow/82891531.cms||Mamtha Asokan
---||Amaravati||Andhra Pradesh: Private hospitals drag feet on Covid treatment under Aarogyasri||AMARAVATI: In spite of the state government’s instructions, private hospitals are not admitting patients under the Aarogyasri quota for Covid-19 treatment. A few hospitals, which are giving admission to Aarogyasri beneficiaries, are charging more than the prescribed fees, say sources. The vigilance and enforcement wing has registered criminal cases against several hospitals for collection of excessive charges from Aarogyasri beneficiaries for Covid-19 treatment. According to the report submitted to the chief minister, the health department said the situation in Kurnool district was very poor where only 38 per cent of the total beds available in private hospitals are set aside for Aarogyasri beneficiaries. As many as 1,331 of the total 1,958 beds in private hospitals in Kurnool district were found to be occupied by patients. However, only 506 patients were found to be Aarogyasri beneficiaries, which accounts for around 38 per cent. Similarly, private hospitals in Guntur district have allocated 42 per cent beds to Arogyasri patients. Private hospitals in Krishna district spared around 45 per cent of its beds. Interestingly, Anantapur district fared well in managing beds for Aarogyasri patients as private hospitals allocated nearly 75 per cent of the total available beds to the poor. “We have secured about 735 beds out of 972 available in private hospitals for Aarogyasri beneficiaries for Covid-19 treatment with close monitoring of the situation,” said district collector Gandham Chandrudu. Private hospitals in Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts were also doing a generous job by giving admission to Aarogyasri patients. The continuous monitoring by senior officials has improved the situation in the last week. The situation was bad a week ago when private hospitals in Prakasam, Kurnool, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam refused to follow government instructions on giving 50 per cent of beds to Aarogyasri beneficiaries. The situation in Chittoor, Krishna and Guntur was also not satisfactory as private hospitals could allot only around 40 per cent of beds. “Our people are doing their best to provide services to the poor through Aarogyasri scheme. It took a little time to allocate more beds to Aarogyasri patients as majority beds were occupied by other patients by the time the state government issued the GO on sparing 50 per cent of beds. We can allocate beds to the new patients only after the discharge of patients who have already occupied beds, which can happen only after their recovery,” said Dr Busireddy Narendra Reddy, president, Arogyasri Network Hospitals Association. Dr Narendra Reddy added that private hospitals were committed to extending the best possible services to the poor under the Aarogyasri scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/pvt-hosps-drag-feet-on-covid-treatment-under-aarogyasri/articleshow/82889394.cms||Samdani MN

Cops said that the gang of three which was caught on Saturday had sold the injections to many youngsters in the city. “The accused used to sell the vials to the youngsters for a premium. We are trying to find out how they sold the injections and who were their regular customers,” said S G Solanki, Sayajigunj police inspector, adding that they are also digging up for more conduits. “We have sent the accused for Covid tests and if their results are negative then we will arrest them and seek their remand,” Solanki added. Cops are also focussing on the source from which the gang got hundreds of pentazocine injections. Investigating officials said that the accused must have been involved in this racket since a long time. “We are trying to find out the person who sold them such a big stock of pentazocine injections,” the police said. The SOG sleuths had on Saturday arrested Vijay Panchal, Suraj Patel and Harish Panchal for selling the injections without necessary permits. The accused used to sell the injections at the price of Rs 100 to Rs 150 per vial. Pentazocine is a scheduled prescription drug that cannot be sold over the counter. Cops said that the accused ran an agency for trading in baby products and used to smuggle vials in boxes of chocolates, baby products and sanitary napkins. The SOG has seized 906 vials of pentazocine apart from four mobile phones and a car from the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/sog-probes-pentazocine-racketeers-network/articleshow/82887824.cms||---
---||Business||‘Pre-cleared investors’ list to help with bank sales’||TNN Mumbai: Former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) deputy governor R Gandhi has called for pre-approved lists of strategic investors for banks by the central bank to enable proper price discovery during divestment. The government has proposed to divest stake in two public sector banks and the IDBI Bank during the current fiscal. The Cabinet recently approved the decision to sell stake in IDBI Bank, which is already categorised as a private bank. But a challenge in selling a bank is that the government disinvestment involves selling to the highest bidder, while the decision on who is eligible to buy is taken by the RBI. The central bank’s current rules do not allow any investor to acquire strategic stake, even in the secondary market, without prior approval. “Here pricing is going to be a critical factor and a challenge, and the system will find it a challenge. Enablers will also be required from the RBI,” said Gandhi. He was speaking at a webinar on recent reforms in the financial sector organised by Enqube. According to Gandhi, if there is to be total privatisation of a bank, large shareholding by strategic investors will have to be permitted and the RBI will have to be realistic in accepting this proposition. “One important suggestion given by the P J Nayak committee is for the RBI to have a list of pre-approved investors. If that list is available, it will be easier for price negotiations and price realisation,” he said. In 2014, a committee headed by former Axis Bank chairman P J Nayak had submitted a report reviewing the governance of boards of banks in India. The report had recommended a category of Authorised Bank Investors (ABIs) be created, comprising all diversified funds which are discretionally managed by fund managers and which are deemed fit and proper. It also proposed that for distressed banks, private equity funds — including sovereign wealth funds — be permitted to take a controlling stake of up to 40%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/pre-cleared-investors-list-to-help-with-bank-sales/articleshow/82890680.cms||---
---||Business||Digital drive increases edu financing options||Mayur.Shetty@timesgroup.com Mumbai: Education loan provider Eduvanz has said that the pandemic-triggered digitisation of education has increased access to skill-upgradation courses for those in smaller towns. While the pandemic boosted digitisation, digital education lent itself to easier financing, which has expanded the market for some courses. Eduvanz is a new-age digital finance company that specialises in zero-interest loans by subvention from education institutions. Another unique selling proposition is that its underwriting decision is based on placement assurances from the institution. Unlike a mainstream education financier that focus on high-value international programmes or long-term courses, Eduvanz focuses on shorter duration courses where educated and even employed youth upgrade their skills on topics like data science, analytics or blockchain. Speaking to TOI, Eduvanz Financing co-founder and CEO Varun Chopra said that the pandemic has led to the digitisation of the edtech sector. “Even with the big brands in education, the classroom programmes have started to move to digital. Students from tier-2 and -3 cities are now applying for online programmes as they no longer have to address the logistics of accommodation and travel.” This digitisation has opened up the same financing opportunities for education that e-commerce did for retail across the country, he added. Eduvanz has raised $5 million in series-A funding from Sequoia. Although it has a non-bank finance company licence, it is not ‘book heavy’ and it lends in partnership with Fullerton India, Aditya Birla Capital and IDFC First Bank. But given the growth opportunity, Chopra says that the company will raise fresh capital. It has also leveraged its own capital base to raise $12 billion in debt. “We would like to have a $1-billion book in four years,” said Chopra. The company has disbursed loans of over Rs 400 crore, and close to Rs 300 crore of loans have been repaid. “These are loans of 18-20 months and we have already seen two to three repayment cycles and the impact of Covid,” said Chopra. Because Eduvanz focuses on the institution and its placements, it can lend without security, or the need to underwrite based on parents or student’s background. “The core of our business has been skilling and upskilling. Today, 70-75% of our loans are to education that is linked to employment,” said Chopra. This includes courses with placement guarantees and income-sharing agreements.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/digital-drive-increases-edu-financing-options/articleshow/82891630.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Business||RBI’s auditor norms not consistent with Cos Act: CII||Mayur.Shetty@timesgroup.com Mumbai: The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has asked the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to review various aspects of its circular on appointment of statutory auditors for banks and finance companies as they create inconsistent policies vis-a-vis the Companies Act, 2013, “without adding any qualitative parameters”. Last month, the RBI had issued new guidelines to improve audit quality. These new norms included a requirement that auditors be rotated every three years with a cooling period of six years before the next appointments. It also called for joint auditors for non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) with assets of over Rs 15,000 crore. Further, it barred auditors from working for more than eight NBFCs concurrently. “The reduction in the tenure of audit, cap on the number of audits by an audit firm and extending the applicability of the provisions to NBFCs will make it mandatory for many of banks and NBFCs to immediately change their auditors, including requirements of joint audits in certain cases, based on monetary thresholds. The challenge to identify an appropriate firm is further accentuated by the supply-side constraints,” CII said in its representation. “The RBI may not apply the same principles to the commercial banks and NBFCs, including in respect of cap on the maximum number of audits, mandatory joint audits, and rotation/cool off principles. The NBFCs may continue to be governed by the Companies Act, 2013,” it said. The representation called for a review in the definition of related parties, which according to the circular includes group entities using a common brand name.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbis-auditor-norms-not-consistent-with-cos-act-cii/articleshow/82891556.cms||Mayur Shetty

On Sunday – 19 days later – the active cases got almost halved at 75,134. Analysis of the last fortnight revealed that drop in cases in major districts helped reduce the overall numbers. Fifteen days back, Ahmedabad and Surat districts had recorded two of the highest active case tally at 61,956 and 14,752 respectively. This accounted for 53% of Gujarat's total active cases. As of Sunday, both Ahmedabad and Surat had recorded a drop in activity by 60%. Ahmedabad had 22,809 active cases, whereas Surat had 5,647 cases. Vadodara with 8,118 cases had the second highest active cases. Chhota Udepur with 74% drop in cases topped the tally of highest reduction in cases, followed by 66% in Narmada, 64% in Morbi, 63% in Ahmedabad and 62% in Surat. To put the figure in perspective in the past 15 days Gujarat’s overall active cases reported a drop of 48%. Rajkot and Vadodara districts, with sizable urban population, reported a dip of 45% and 16% respectively - lower than the state average. On the other hand, out of 33 districts of Gujarat five also recorded an upward trend – in fact, Porbandar nearly doubled its active cases from 306 to 599 in 15 days. Likewise, Amreli and Junagadh recorded 23% and 14.5% rise respectively. The test positivity rate for Gujarat fell from 8.8% a fortnight ago to 3.7% on Sunday, recording reduction by over 50%. “The figures primarily indicate the official figures, and don’t include the patients who never went to the medical setting – for example those who have tested positive by rapid antigen testing (RAT), or those who started medication after HRCT reports. Nonetheless, the on-ground scenario reveals that there are more beds available now across categories and geographies, and there is a fall in RT-PCR demands,” said a city-based public health expert. “But again, the rural areas would decide the future course of pandemic in Gujarat. Reduction in cities was needed but the focus has to shift on increasing testing in rural areas to quickly identify new cases and isolate them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ahmedabad-surat-record-60-dip-in-active-cases-in-a-fortnight/articleshow/82891316.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Redeveloper neither builds nor gives up Haji Ali project||MUMBAI: After a landslide on August 29, 2011, structurally damaged their building, residents of Vellard View Housing Society, next to the landmark Heera Panna shopping centre in Haji Ali, signed a redevelopment agreement with a builder. A decade since, the 70-odd residents are still without a roof after the builder, HBS View Pvt Ltd, demolished the building but failed to start work. Over two and a half years ago, the builder stopped paying rent for alternative accommodation, forcing some residents to move to far-off locations like Goregaon, Panvel and even Vadodara. The agreement says each family is to receive a rent of Rs 80,000 to Rs 1.4 lakh a month depending on the size of their flat. Some months ago, the society served a termination notice to the builder and signed an MoU with a Hyderabad-based developer, YSK Holdings. Avneet Goel, director of HBS, said: “I can only state that we have challenged the termination. I am unable to comment further as the matter is sub judice.” The flat owners vacated the premises in 2013 because of the damage but the builder razed the building only in 2015. “Since then, the builder has not carried out even the excavation work. Instead, it mortgaged our property to banks to raise tens of crores,” said a resident, requesting anonymity. As the society failed to act against the builder, a flat owner, Priti Sanjay Gandhi, dragged the builder and society to court for various breaches, including not paying the displacement hardship allowance. Last year, the Bombay high court said in an order: “Despite suffering on account of defaults by the builder, the managing committee of the society is taking time from this court since 17th February 2020, stating that they are trying to execute the supplemental agreement with the developer. We fail to understand this conduct, especially since the committee is fully aware of the developer’s conduct.” On October 13 last year, the builder’s advocate gave an undertaking to the court to hand over an amount of Rs 5 crore by October 31 and not seek any extension on any grounds to make the payment. A division bench of the high court said: “The developer issued cheques of HDFC Bank aggregating to Rs 5 crores on 31st October, 2020. Thereafter, the court placed the matter on 3rd November 2020, when the HDFC branch manager informed the court that the developer is only having an amount of Rs 1 crore in his bank account and the cheques issued by the developer will not be honoured. “Despite the conduct of the developer, the managing committee agreed to give a week’s time to the developer to arrange for funds and comply with the undertakings given to the court. The learned advocate for the developer states that they have been able to pay the society only Rs 1.84 crore. We are, therefore, more than satisfied that the developer is unable to abide by the assurances repeatedly given to the court. However, it appears the managing committee for some reason keeps on giving opportunities to the developer to comply with his promises.” In November, the society unanimously decided to terminate the contract.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/redeveloper-neither-builds-nor-gives-up-haji-ali-project-in-mumbai/articleshow/82891941.cms||Nauzer Bharucha
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Black fungus cases rise in Chittoor district||TIRUPATI: Rising cases of mucormycosis, or black fungus, over the past few days in Chittoor district is posing an additional worry for Covid-19 patients as well as the medical fraternity. Of the nearly 20 cases of mucormycosis that have been reported across Chittoor district as on Sunday, nearly 10 are undergoing treatment at the SVRR government general hospital in Tirupati. Dr V Chandrasekhar, professor and head of the ENT department at the SVRR hospital attributed the rise in black fungus cases to multiple factors such as prolonged Covid-19 treatment, usage of steroids, dependence on oxygen and poor immunity levels. “Once black fungus develops in the body, Covid-19 recovery is hit badly as the fungus slowly spreads to various organs of the body through vessels. Black fungus patients need to be administered Amphotericin B 300 mg dose daily for two to four weeks. We have placed an indent for Amphotericin B doses and are expecting them to arrive by next week,” added Dr Chandrasekhar. A separate ward with 25 beds has been set up at the SVRR hospital to treat black fungus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/black-fungus-cases-rise-in-chittoor-dist/articleshow/82889486.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

Usually on Sundays, salons would be busy catering to the needs of customers. But lockdown has changed the picture completely. As per the statistics available with Vijayawada Salons and Spas Association, there are 430 salons and 60 unisex beauty parlours in the city and around 2,000 families are dependent on this sector. Most of the salons remained shut after Covid-19 cases started increasing in the last week of April and many have closed their operations as they are not able to meet even minimum expenses. “People are hesitating to come to salons due to fear of infection. We are sterilising scissors and wearing PPE suits to instill confidence among them. But the response from the public is poor. Most of them are trying haircuts in their homes. We never expected such a tough time,” said Sandesh, who owns three salons in Patamata. Meanwhile, a few salons are offering doorstep services to clients following Covid-19 protocols. “Home consultations are a lifeline for us in these tough times. We receive calls from people seeking our services at their doorstep. We are charging extra for PPE kits and offering services at an affordable price. This helps us earn something to meet day-to-day expenses,” said Lakkavarapu Durga, a stylist from Labbipet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/with-salons-shut-hairdressers-in-vijayawada-serve-clients-at-home/articleshow/82889512.cms||Venu Lanka
---||Business||Companies flaunt health plans to attract, retain talent||MUMBAI: A well-articulated strategy for employee well-being is being leveraged by companies as a key differentiator to attract and retain top talent. A Willis Towers Watson study, shared exclusively with TOI, reveals a decreasing trend in employers who have not formally articulated such a well-being strategy over the last two years. If three years ago 44% of employers had “no strategy” for employees’ health, the number stands reduced at 28% in 2020 (see graphic). A large majority of companies believe employees’ physical and emotional well-being is a top priority over the next three years. The reasons are simple: Workplace stress has become more severe and companies want to remain attractive to good talent by adopting a sound employee wellness policy. Interestingly, more employers are using a variety of financial and non-financial metrics to measure the impact of health and well-being programmes. There is a shift from ‘return on investment’ to ‘value on investment’. Willis Towers Watson India Insurance Brokers head (health & benefits) Vinod V K said, “With costs and employee workforce risks on the rise, it’s more important now than ever to ensure that the investment in employee well-being is made in the right areas. We are witnessing a transition towards a value-on-investment model from a more traditional return-on-investment approach and more organisations are using technology, data and analytics to guide them in this journey. This is an unprecedented and ever-evolving situation, making it critical for employers to have a holistic and long-term strategy on employee benefits and the future workplace.” Crisil president (HR) Anupam Kaura said there’s no doubt that employee wellness is going to be a key differentiator — not just for attracting talent, but also retaining talent. “When external talent is contemplating career opportunities with you, they make it a point to speak to multiple people who have closely known a company (current employees and alumni) and, among other things, they do check for 2-3 fundamental attributes — culture of the company, employee benefits & policies, and the people they will get to work with. All of these attributes have a bearing on mental and physical well-being in a big way. Over the past 15 months in particular, there are innumerable instances of talent (both in-house and external) enquiring about hybrid/flexible work arrangements, specific enablement measures towards wellness, health and recreation. Thus, companies which have taken voluble measures in introducing health and well-being measures during this difficult phase are being seen as a big draw for talent.” Internal talent contemplating job switches are a lot more mindful lately of what they stand to lose by way of “tangible” and “intangible” benefits should they choose to leave their present employer, said Kaura. “In my view, skilled talent that’s attracted to the gig economy/entrepreneurial ventures/startups will also now think twice, as staying on with an employer who has prioritised employee care and well-being during the extended pandemic phase may offer greater sense of mental health and overall sense of security,” he added. General Electric (steam power) HR leader (India & Asia-Pacific) Pramath Nath said, “Though organisations have brought focus to ‘wellness’, it’s contextual and not posturing. It’s a step in the right direction for the long-term good of all than to achieve short-term goals of the organisation. In a corporate world full of companies mirroring benefits and policies, the thematic manifestation of wellness is bound to be a differentiating factor in retaining and attracting talent. It’s a sine qua non (essential condition).” The study, in which 203 organisations (1.7 million employees) across sectors participated, said employee health programmes have to evolve in such a way that they can respond to the multi-generational workforce, get traction with staff on their requirements, which are suited in the future of work. It said over 2 in 5 employers are evaluating the total cost of care and adopting listening strategies to understand their workforce needs. “The unexpected devastation caused by the second wave of Covid shifted the paradigm from work to life. It’s been about survival and empathy. Nuclear families meant leaning on one another within the organisation for support, succour and sustenance. Collective suffering is getting mitigated by joint resilience. At GE, we have undertaken certain policy changes to support our employees during the unprecedented surge of the pandemic — from enhanced insurance coverage to caregiver leave to vaccination camps for employees and dependents to pooling in money for needy employees, arranging hospital beds and oxygen cylinders. These reflect the agile response of organisations and the natural extension of a broad support system to the homes of employees and beyond. The parochial approach to work-life balance has been replaced by a holistic employee wellness endeavour,” said Nath. Organisations are seeing how health and well-being measures have helped ensure higher levels of sustained productivity over a year now. “Over time, this will also make employers who stay invested on the health agenda stand out from the rest in terms of ability to attract and retain talent. Measures on health that we have introduced in the past 15 months cover family members too. And we are already seeing a visible uplift in the narrative. For instance, just overnight, I received a message from a parent of an employee complimenting our efforts for the on-site vaccination drive that’s been commissioned. Families too are thus helping shape the narrative on staying put with an employer who cares for you,” said Kaura. For its India employees, Crisil is offering advance payment of 50% of annual bonus for the current year with May 2021’s salary. It is also offering emergency salary advance of up to 6 months of fixed-pay portion (interest-free) for employees towards Covid medical and allied expenses, and reimbursing Covid treatment expenses not covered by medical insurance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/cos-flaunt-health-plans-to-attract-retain-talent/articleshow/82890878.cms||Namrata Singh

The needy can contact on CICU’s helpline number 8872899992 for availing this service, which has been started with 30 concentrators and the number will be increased in the coming days. Upkar Singh Ahuja, CICU president, said, “The government and the administration are doing their best to counter the deadly wave of coronavirus and it is the need of the hour that everyone who can provide any type of help should come forward. Due to the huge spurt in demand for oxygen and difficulties being faced by the patients requiring it at home, we have started this initiative, under which staff of our member factories will be provided oxygen concentrators for temporary use and no rent will be charged. We have started with 30 concentrators that were donated or procured with the help of our member companies, and we have a target of taking the number to 100. Besides this, we are also looking at other ways to help factory workers, like subsidised vaccination.”Pankaj Sharma, CICU general secretary, said, “Anyone on patient’s behalf can send a WhatsApp message on our helpline number 8872899992 or call us to complete a small formality, after which the concentrator will be provided based on the availability status. We have already started spreading the word about this service to make our members and their employees aware about it.”Lauding the CICU efforts, Jagbir Singh Sokhi, president of Sewing Machine Development Club, said, “This noble gesture by CICU will benefit thousands of workers and even associations like us who are affiliated with it. In order to do our part, we are appealing to our members to contribute to this cause by donating oxygen concentrators.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/business-body-offers-rent-free-o2-concentrators-to-workers/articleshow/82888315.cms||Mohit Behl

Some traders are happy with the relaxation in restrictions. But others, particularly trader associations representing Old City markets, are demanding that shops be allowed to remain open till 5pm, else they will protest outside the houses of ruling party leaders.Bhupinder Basant, senior vice-chairman of Punjab Traders’ Board, said, “We are grateful that our demand of extending working hours from 12pm to 1pm and allowing restaurants, food outlets, cafes to provide home delivery till 8pm has been accepted. The one-hour extension will help shopkeepers immensely, as footfall is likely to be registered post 11am till 1pm. Earlier, traders were suffering huge losses as customers don’t go shopping so early. Food businesses, too, have been saved from closing down permanently.”Some businessmen are seeking more relaxations to help them tide over financial crisis.Sunil Mehra, state general secretary of Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal, said, “We thankful for the one-hour relief. But, this will not help much. The authorities should fix the shop closing time to 5pm like other districts of Punjab. As our demands have not been met, we have decided to protest outside the houses of ruling party MLAs, MP and cabinet minister.

The health department had stopped giving the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine, including Covaxin, a few weeks ago due to limited supplies. It instead concentrated on covering all those who were due for their second dose. But the Union health ministry recently extended the gap between the first and second doses of Covishield vaccine to 12 to 16 weeks. Speaking to the media on Sunday, Singhal said that there are no eligible beneficiaries for the second dose of Covishield vaccine at least until the second half of June as per the revised recommendations. “So the health department has decided to administer the available Covishield vaccines as the first dose to the public. But the Covaxin doses would be used solely for people due for their second dose,” said Singhal. Singhal said that a total of 28.53 lakh Covid-19 doses would be available for the ongoing vaccination drive till June 15, including the doses that can be purchased by Andhra Pradesh on its own. He also reiterated that the state would not start the Covid-19 vaccination drive for the 18-44 age group until the existing priority groups (people aged 45 and above) are fully covered under the programme.

Mewalal Rai (70), a retired village chowkidar and a member of Mahadalit community, was beaten to death. The mob had also misbehaved with women and children following a dispute over a government land, police said. On reaching the trouble-torn village, the BJP leaders spoke to several members of Mahadalit community and took stock of the situation prevailing there. “We interacted with several members of the Mahadalit community who were thrashed by the attackers on the night of May 19. The victims are frightened and they want security. We also enquired about the subsequent police action in the incident from the villagers,” Jaiswal told TOI. He said an old land dispute was the reason behind the attack. “The BJP demands immediate arrest of all accused persons, speedy trial in the case, proper security to villagers and adequate financial assistance to the affected families from the state government,” Jaiswal said, adding the BJP team visited the village at the directive of the party’s state president and Bettiah MP Dr Sanjay Kumar Jaiswal. Party MLA Krishna Kumar Rishi was also part of the team. The Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) has also expressed its concern over the violent attack on Mahadalit families and demanded justice for victims. In a statement, VHP’s national secretary general Milind Parande said, “The immeasurable havoc wrecked on the Mahadalits by the members of a minority community was a replication of violent attacks on BJP supporters in West Bengal after declaration of assembly poll results. The apathy of the local police, administration and the government on these heinous incidents of attacks, beatings, looting, violence and arson is very worrying.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/mob-attack-bjp-team-visits-purnia-village/articleshow/82888837.cms||Madan Kumar

Cyclone Yaas live updates“We had a tough time last year. There was no electricity at home for eight days. Candles were being sold at six times the usual price and we had to borrow filtered water from a friend. This time, however, I have bought three emergency lights and four boxes of large candles. I have also placed an order for two 20L drums of mineral water and have stocked food for a week,” said Arijit Bose, a resident of Thakurpukur. Several others followed Bose and local markets were overcrowded during the three-hour window on Sunday. Cops had to visit multiple markets to ensure they were shut on time. As a precautionary measure, KMC ward coordinators and local youths have joined hands to take a slew of steps, like removing dangerously leaning trees that could disrupt electricity lines if uprooted. “We have been trimming the branches above electrical lines and have cut down some trees. We have also taken steps to prevent waterlogging,” said Rajib Das, the coordinator of ward 124. Das added he is also maintaining close coordination with CESC officials to ensure power lines are quickly repaired and electricity is restored at the earliest in case of prolonged power cut after the cyclone. “CESC has arranged for portable generators to ensure the situation doesn’t get as bad as last year,” Das said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/behala-belt-takes-storm-safety-steps/articleshow/82889894.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Kolkata||Cyclone Yaas: Green activists appeal for tree reinforcement in Kolkata||KOLKATA: For the past two days, environmentalists and ecologists have alerted the civic body to put reinforcements against vulnerable trees to protect them from the possible onslaught of the cyclonic storm which can pass through the city.  Cyclone Yaas live updatesThe memories of a large-scale devastation of greenery by Amphan last year are fresh in green activists’ minds. “For the last couple of days, we kept appealing to Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC), Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA) and Public Works Department (PWD) to put up guards for full-grown leaning trees so they don’t get uprooted. TimesViewThe importance of protecting trees cannot be stressed too much. Similar exercises should be taken in more normal times as well.In some cases, they did what we wanted, but in some cases, they did not respond. We have lost a massive number of trees during Amphan. There is hardly any compensation against lost greenery of the city whose pollution level is ever increasing,” said Somendra Mohan Ghosh, a green activist. Sumita Banerjee, a self-proclaimed guardian of Rabindra Sarobar, is haunted by the devastation wrecked by Amphan last year. “Rabindra Sarobar lost at least 15% of its big trees. I pray Yaas spares the Lake this time. When the city’s Covid patients are gasping for breath, we must remember these trees as our most reliable oxygen generators,” she said. Ghosh has identified more than 50 such trees along Southern Avenue and Sarat Bose Road that are vulnerable to strong cyclonic storms. “Some green NGOs have tried to give a leaning tree support by tying it to a wall hook with a rope. But I wonder whether these ropes can sustain the gusts,” said Sudipto Bhattacharya of Saviours and Friends of Environment. Bhattacharya carried out similar exercises in the northern suburbs of the city. “I closely coordinated with civic bodies to carry out trimming so that trees don’t get toppled by the wind. Over 16,000 full-grown trees were uprooted by Amphan. For survival, a human needs 740kg of oxygen a year. This translates to six-seven trees per person. By this logic, Kolkata’s population of 1.5 crore requires more than 10 crore full-grown trees. But the city has a few lakh,” said Bhattacharya. One full-grown tree, on an average, produces 1,000kg of oxygen and absorbs 22kg of carbon dioxide. “In the city, trees are vulnerable because we don’t allow them to grow straight. Firstly, over-concretization does not allow the root systems to go deeper. A weak root system makes trees vulnerable to gusts of strong wind. Secondly, the overhead wires and billboards affect straight growth. The moment a tree gets crooked, its gets 20 times more vulnerable to storms,” said Bonani Kakkar of People United for Better Living in Calcutta (PUBLIC).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/green-activists-appeal-for-tree-reinforcement/articleshow/82889603.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

Thanks to the DM’s initiative, an expert team of five doctors of AIIMS-Delhi’s trauma centre headed by Dr Sanjeev Bhoi held several virtual sessions with the doctors and paramedics of Aurangabad sadar hospital and trained them to run ventilators which the hospital had got under the PM Cares Fund . Lives of at least seven critical Covid patients undergoing treatment at the hospital have so far been saved following the operationalisation of the ventilators. The Aurangabad district administration has also converted two industrial oxygen manufacturing plants at Barun into plants producing medical oxygen. Jorawal said four ventilators were lying unused at the ICU of sadar hospital for several months. “The ICU was fully equipped, but lying defunct for the last four years due to lack of technicians. When the second Covid wave began, we organised virtual training for doctors, support staff, ANMs and GNMs. They were trained by AIIMS-Delhi experts to run ventilators. Thanks to the state government, engineers came to the hospital and made the ICU functional on May 10,” the DM added. He said the district administration ensured availability of all necessary medicines at the ICU for the treatment of Covid patients. “Even three private doctors assisted the district administration and monitored Covid patients admitted in government hospitals,” the DM added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/aiims-delhi-experts-help-aurangabad-docs-run-ventilators/articleshow/82888780.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Kolkata||Cyclone Yaas may hit coast between Sagar and Paradeep, says Met||KOLKATA: Yaas is likely to thunder into the Bengal-Odisha coast between Sagar Island and Paradeep on May 26 evening with the Bengal coast more likely to take the hit after it crosses north Odisha as a very severe cyclonic storm with a wind speed of 155km/hr-165km/hr.  Cyclone Yaas live updatesFrom a depression on Sunday, Yaas will transform into a cyclone on Monday and a severe cyclonic storm on Tuesday, eventually striking land as a very severe cyclone. Amphan, which had wreaked havoc in south Bengal exactly a year ago, had a higher wind speed of 185km/hr at landfall and had turned into a super cyclone before hitting land. “We will have a better idea of the exact location of its landfall once Yaas turns into a cyclone on Monday. But, in terms of intensity, it is significantly lower than Amphan, which was a super cyclone,” said deputy director general of meteorology Sanjib Bandopadhyay. He added that the sea will remain very rough and fishermen have been asked to return to shore by the evening of May 23. The impact on Kolkata could be substantial and will begin on Tuesday morning with drizzles and it could remain cloudy. Over the next 24 hours, the rain could intensify and turn into a deluge. It will be heaviest on Wednesday. The wind speed and the rain intensity in the city will depend on where Yaas touches land. “If it is Digha, then the wind speed in Kolkata could be as high as 80km/hr-100km/hr. If it strikes Paradeep, then it will be a much weaker wind. Again, if it strikes Sagar Island, the wind speed could go up to 120km/hr-130km/hr,” he said. Amphan had reached a maximum wind speed of 130km/hr in Kolkata, the highest in more than a century. If the landfall happens at Paradeep, the impact on Kolkata could be minimal. “Since Paradeep is 250km away, Kolkata will fall in the outer band of the cyclone and could receive just moderate rain,” said Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) director G K Das. An IMD map, in fact, has indicated such a possibility. But the RMC has explained that it is just one of the several possibilities. Apart from Kolkata, East and West Midnapore, Howrah, Jhargram, Bankura and Purulia will receive heavy rain. “If there is a strong enough wind, Darjeeling and Kalimpong will get rain, too,” an official said. It is, however, too early to predict the post-landfall path of Yaas. “If the landfall happens within a radius of 50km-70km of Kolkata, the city will have a significant impact, probably next only to Amphan in terms of damage. Amphan had lost intensity just before landfall and turned into a very severe cyclone and Yaas, too, will have the same status when it hits land,” said a weather scientist. On Sunday, Yaas was located 670km south-southeast of Digha. “It will continue to move north-northwestwards, intensify and reach northwest Bay of Bengal near the Bengal and Odisha coasts by May 26 morning,” said Das. As Yaas approaches the Bengal coast, squally winds will gather speed. From Monday evening, wind speed will reach 40km/hr-50km/hr, gusting up to 60km/hr. A day later, it will touch 50km/hr-60km/hr and gust up to 70km/hr, eventually taking on a gale wind speed of 60km/hr-70km/hr, gusting up to 80km/hr on the morning of May 26. It will gradually increase and eventually touch 155km/hr-165km/hr.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/yaas-may-hit-coast-between-sagar-and-paradeep-says-met/articleshow/82889571.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

Lessons learnt during the widespread disruption after Amphan are being put to use by internet service providers as they brace for another severe cyclone some time on Wednesday evening.  Cyclone Yaas live updatesRepresentatives of Alliance Broadband, SitiCable affiliate Indian Cable Net Co Ltd (ICNCL) and Reliance Jio Infocomm’s Jio Fibre — which together control over two-thirds of the internet broadband market in Kolkata — said they were better prepared for the cyclone and confident there will be less disruption on the ground than a year ago. But they also warned that if lines were down in localities where the storm uprooted trees and lampposts, restoration could take two-nine days. “We need to get the go-ahead from CESC and KMC to prevent electrocution and wait for installation of lampposts in places where they suffer damage. But in areas where there are no such complications, we should be able to restore connection in a couple of days,” an ICNCL official said. Unlike last year when manpower and material were a problem when Amphan struck, since it was in the midst of a lockdown, this time the agencies are better prepared with adequate manpower and material stocked. “We weren’t prepared for last year’s cyclone. Since then, we have re-organized OFC cables and bunched them together to ensure they have more strength,” said an Alliance Broadband associate. The one concern that everyone has is the Covid situation, which is worse than a year ago. “Ensuring safety of our employees during restoration work will be a challenge,” said All Bengal Cable TV & Broadband Operations United Forum joint convenor Tapash Kumar Das.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/net-firms-better-prepared-this-time/articleshow/82889967.cms||Subhro Niyogi

The state government has kept buffer stocks ready in anticipation of likely disruption of road network with Odisha as AP is largely dependent on transport of liquid medical oxygen (LMO) from the neighbouring state. The state government has also directed the energy department to ensure interruption-free power supply to three key oxygen suppliers—RINL and Ellenbarrier in Visakhapatnam and Liquinox Gases in Srikakulam. The state is getting around 210 MT of LMO from these three plants. It has also asked district collectors to take measures to provide uninterrupted power supply to Covid-19 hospitals. Speaking to the media on Sunday, oxygen war room chairman and principal secretary MT Krishna Babu said that the government is ready to tackle the situation arising out of Cyclone Yaas. He said that ensuring uninterrupted LMO becomes critical considering the fact that AP is largely dependent on supplies from steel plants located in Angul, Kalinganagar and Rourkela. Any disruption of the supply from these places can cause severe distress in AP. “In order to mitigate the risk of any such disruption, the state government has taken initiative to increase the supplies from Odisha in the last two days using Oxygen Express trains in order to maintain buffer stocks in all districts. Almost 100 MT of LMO has been sourced from Rourkela, Odisha and a further 100 MT is expected before May 24 from Odisha through Oxygen Express,” said Krishna Babu. Apart from this, the government has also initiated measures to ensure regular supply of almost 200 MT using road transport tankers from Angul, Kalinganagar and Rourkela. The government has been in regular coordination with the local administration of Odisha to ensure seamless supplies. Meanwhile, International Committee of the Red Cross through Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOCL) handed over 120 MT of LMO through six ISO cryogenic tankers to the state government on Sunday. This 120 MT shall be placed as reserve stock in Guntur and in Tirupati as a buffer stock in case of emergency, said Krishna Babu. Almost 100 MT of LMO has been sourced from Rourkela, Odisha and a further 100 MT is expected before May 24 from Odisha through an Oxygen Express||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/ap-readies-o2-stock-to-meet-cyclone-threat/articleshow/82889481.cms||Samdani MN

A retired chowkidar, Mewalal Rai (70), was beaten to death by the mob. Police had arrested Shakir Alam and Asad Raza alias Asad Alam a day after the violence and one Mohamamd Junaid Alam was nabbed on Saturday. SHO of Baisi police station Amit Kumar on Sunday said the child, Deewana, was rescued from Amaur in Purnia. “Child’s father Pratap Rai had lodged an FIR for kidnapping. However, it is still not clear how the child reached Amaur. Pratap is repeatedly changing his statements,” the SHO said. He added 78 people have been named in three FIRs lodged in connection with the mob attack. At least 150 unidentified people have also been made accused in the three FIRs. “One Rizwi is the prime accused in the case. His house is located just behind Mewalal’s house.

At the meeting it was also considered to have MCQ-based questions instead of descriptive questions, it added. While these suggestions were made for Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE) Class 12 exams, state education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama, who was also present at the meeting, said that in the case of Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB) exams, Gujarat government will decide things after consultation with various stakeholders. “We will consider the option of holding the Class 12 GSHSEB board exams after taking feedback from principals and schools and academicians, among others. The option of reducing the exam duration will also be considered,” said Chudasama. He said that the government will conduct the exams once the Covid-19 situation is under control. ‘Hold board exams in schools’ According to an expert in the field of education, Class 12 exams are necessary as they help lay the foundation of a person’s professional career. “The number of Covid-19 cases have also shown a rapid decline in the past few days and it seems that the government will be in a position to conduct the exams sometime in the middle of June,” he added. One of the options to further safeguard the health and safety of students was to hold the Class 12 board exams in the schools where the students study. “For Class 12 science students, the exam centres are at the district level so they have to travel quite a distance at times. Similarly, there are a large number of students in Class 12 general stream and they are also required to travel to exam centres,” said another academic expert. “If the government can make arrangements to hold exams at school level, it will be a very effective move,” he added.

Amid fears of Covid-19 spreading tentacles in rural areas, such reports are worrying. The health minister said to check Covid spread in villages, they have started Mission Fateh Two.Villagers said though many deaths have occurred at hospitals, the number of home casualties was also noteworthy. “There have been many deaths in our village, but in some cases it was not clear if the person died of Covid or some other disease. Two such suspicious deaths have happened at home,” said Sukhjit Singh, a villager from Akhara and son of the woman sarpanch. He said the government was not doing enough and people feared they would die if they got tested or vaccinated. The villager said the passing away of a teacher in Jagraon after vaccination had a negative impact though the reason for her death was not yet clear. In Aitiana village, 12 persons died between May 4 and 15 and a few of them breathed their last without people knowing the reason. “Normally in our village one person dies in two or three months, but from May 4 to 15, as many as 12 passed away and the majority of them were above 60 years of age. Various reasons are being attributed to their deaths, like cough, fever, high or low sugar levels or heart attack. Though most of the deaths happened at hospitals, two persons died at home,” said Lakhvir Singh, sarpanch of Aitiana. “People don’t reveal and insist their kin was Covid negative. There is fear related to Covid-19, which is the reason for people hiding it,” he added.The sarpanch said though vaccination drive was going on and even testing was being done, many villagers don’t want either. The villagers said people not sharing information about suspected Covid cases was responsible for spread in rural areas.Dr Harminder Singh, a homoeopath and director of Gadri Baba Dulla Singh Giani Nihal Singh Foundation, Jalaldiwal village near Raikot, said, “Unreported deaths are there in almost every village, in some more than the other. People go to registered medical practitioners on having fever and take medicines at home. Some of them die. People in villages say the deaths are due to typhoid. The worst is friends and family going to see ill persons at their places, which may be a reason for the spread of disease.”“In my village, there has been one death at hospital and two where families didn’t share how the persons died. In villages the culture is that we don’t ask families about it. Some villagers also fear that if they are hospitalised, they will not return home,” he said.Health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said, “There are definitely cases of unreported deaths. People take medicine at home. So, we are now carrying out door-to-door surveys in villages to make sure they are saved. We are getting villagers, who have cough, cold, fever, among other symptoms, tested. Villagers were not coming forward for vaccination too, but things are changing now. The person who comes to our facility and if he dies, we do his Covid test. But those who die at home may spread the infection. There is a possibility of such cases, but what to do with people who don’t care.” ‘Need doorstep testing’In many villages, residents said testing was not being done. “There have been no tests in our village. If tests are done at doorstep, villagers will have no problem,” said Chamkaur Singh of Chakar village. Another resident of a neighbouring village said the health authorities should also dispel doubts about fake positives in testing, so that all villagers come forward for it and help in checking the virus spread. “Besides, there is a need to dispel rumours surrounding the vaccine too,” he said. The health minister, however, said they were doing 80,000 tests per day and would increase it to 1 lakh to 1.25 lakh in the next few days. He added that they have started doorstep testing in villages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/rural-dilemma-suspicious-deaths-reticent-villagers/articleshow/82888369.cms||Shariq Majeed

The deceased has been identified as Yogi alias Amit, son of Satpal, a labourer of the same colony. The incident took place on Saturday when Yogi forgot the way home and reached the outskirts of the colony, where he was attacked by some stray dogs. The dogs dragged him into the fields and mauled him to death. Some passersby tried to rescue him, but till then he had succumbed to his injuries. The victim’s father said that his wife Manisha was sick and he took her to the doctor in the morning, but when they reached home in the afternoon, they found the child missing. He said they searched for him and found that he had been mauled to death. Police said the body had been sent to the civil hospital for postmortem examination. Local residents said the stray dog menace had become a major problem for them but authorities had failed to take appropriate measures despite repeated complaints.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/stray-dogs-maul-4-yr-old-boy-to-death/articleshow/82891958.cms||---

---||Aurangabad||No official black fungus data in Aurangabad yet||AURANGABAD: The government is routing the supply of injections required in the treatment of mucormycosis through the respective district administrations, but the Aurangabad district administration had failed to compile data on such patients even till Sunday evening. It is feared that the district administration’s alleged lax approach will have an adverse impact on order placement for Amphotericin B, an anti-fungal medication for mucormycosis that is already in short supply. Aurangabad district collector Sunil Chavan could not share the data on black fungus patients despite assurances till Sunday evening. Earlier, on May 15, Aurangabad Municipal Corporation had revealed that 201 Covid patients have contracted mucormycosis during the second wave. There had been 16 casualties till then. The civic body, which had obtained the data from only six hospitals, was expected to reach out to more hospitals to seek details of mucormycosis patients. However, no further updates were shared by the AMC also till Sunday. Dr Ashok Belkhode, expert member (health) of the Marathwada Development Board, said the Centre has already asked the states to make mucormycosis a notifiable disease under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897. “Maharashtra, it seems, has not ratified the order from the Centre yet. It is important that all hospitals, including private ones, officially report all suspected and confirmed cases of mucormycosis to local authorities every day. Such an exercise is crucial to wage an effective battle against the black fungus infection,” he said. He also expressed disappointment over many district administrations, along with health authorities, not having the desired database of patients even though the district-wise allocation and distribution of Amphotericin B is being routed through them. Meanwhile, the Latur district has started carrying out centralised supply of Amphotericin B with the district having 61 active cases till May 21. Jalna district has had 21 active cases of black fungus infection with a total of three deaths so far, shows official data.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/no-official-black-fungus-data-in-aurangabad-yet/articleshow/82885828.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||India||Covid: 'Infection fears, curbs and lack of jabs behind vaccine rate drop’||NEW DELHI: Infection fears, lockdowns, increased demands on medical staff and a vaccine shortfall in the 18-44 category are seen as reasons for low jab numbers, and any significant increase in daily vaccinations is likely only when supplies for the younger age group increase, government officials said. Responding to queries on vaccinations not matching the available supplies, officials TOI spoke to said there might be a range of reasons, including the lack of mobility due to lockdowns in most states that have discouraged people from venturing out of homes. They said a slack in even the 45-plus category was noticed after the initial rush when the category was made eligible for shots from April 1. There were, conversely, also reports of the second wave causing more people to consider vaccinations, but fear of stepping out could be a dampener. The slow vaccination rate was visible even in the 45-plus segment where supplies were nowhere as constrained as in the new cohort of 18-44 made eligible from May 1. Officials said the younger cohort represents a very large segment of the population keenly awaiting shots and vaccinations will go up once more supplies are available, hopefully from around mid-June. A decline in infections could improve the turnout in the 45-plus category even as the Centre and states plan aggressive vaccination drives. Diversion of medical staff for Covid-19 treatment could be another reason for slow vaccinations, an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-infection-fears-curbs-and-lack-of-jabs-behind-vaccine-rate-drop/articleshow/82895602.cms||---

---||Kochi||Kerala: 51-60 age group constitutes majority of ICU patient load||KOCHI: Most of the Covid patients getting admitted in the intensive care units (ICUs) in the district are in the 51-60 age group. This is followed by those in the age groups of 61-70 years and 41-50 years, shows the Covid situation analysis report prepared by the district health officials and submitted to the district administration on Sunday. Of the total 533 patients in ICUs, as on Saturday, 134 were in the 51-60 age group, 117 in the 61-70 age group and 83 patients in the 41-50 category. The report also cited instances where young patients required ICU admission. As many as three children below 10 years of age were under ICU treatment. There were six children in the ICU last week. However, the case fatality rate (CFR) is higher among those above 80 years of age — 2.74%. It indicates that more than two out of 100 Covid patients in the above 80-years category succumb to the infection. CFR among the 30-60 age group is .10%. Among the deaths declared by the government, three patients below 30 years of age died of Covid in Ernakulam. Meanwhile, number of Covid patients under treatment in ICUs touched 542 on Sunday. Health experts feel that comorbidities lead to more ICU admissions among the 51-60 age group and also they were not included in the first phase vaccination. “More than 50% of patients undergoing treatment in ICUs are those below 60 years of age. The only relief is that recovery rate among such patients will be higher compared to those above 60 years of age. The problem we face is that many patients do not follow the instructions given by doctors. When asked to stretch on bed face down in order to strengthen lung function, many patients refuse to do it,” said IMA, Ernakulam chapter, former president Dr Junaid Rahman. While a district health official said population of those below 60 years of age is high in Ernakulam. “Of the 38 lakh population, only around six lakh are elders. The fact is that discharge of elderly patients from ICUs is slow while it is fast in younger population. And more youngsters continue to get admitted in ICUs than the elderly,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/51-60-age-group-constitutes-majority-of-icu-patient-load/articleshow/82890214.cms||T C Sreemol

---||Chandigarh||23-PB-True Lies||Overcharging: Anger growing against health dept There is growing resentment among people against the health department for no or mild action against the private hospitals fleecing the Covid-19 patients. According to sources, one of the private hospital owned by an ‘influential’ doctor charged almost over Rs 40,000 per day from a patient, and no action, not even an inquiry, was conducted when the matter was brought to the knowledge of senior officials of health department who are either overburdened, lax or in cahoot with the management the private hospitals. More corrupt MLAs also get shield It was generally believed in Congress circles that Punjab chief minister or his office could not be unaware of the illegal activities like mining in certain constituencies when these were widely known but party MLAs or the responsible officers did not face any questioning. A suspicion remained that CM was not acting tough either to avoid embarrassing his party MLAs who remained deferential towards him or he gave them a long rope with the hope that they would remain loyal towards him. However, reactions after the state vigilance bureau’s files on those close to Navjot Sidhu made it difficult for the CM to act even against those MLAs against whom there could be much more credible evidence. “Now, all such action would be seen as vendetta. The sequence of events and the way things have been handled by the CM’s camp has rather provided cover to those MLAs whose working was not above board,” said a Congress MLA. Gulati’s utterances backfire She was supposed to corner and embarrass Punjab minister Charanjit Channi but the way Punjab State Women Commission chairperson Manisha Gulati made noise on the issue and said certain things, the move backfired. After her comments were found too political for someone holding a constitutional post, Gulati has not spoken up further on the issue. It was the first time that state women panel chairperson faced such criticism. Alerting officials or activists? The Haryana public relations department has started sharing success stories and special features to highlight the efforts made by Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar in tacking Covid-19 pandemic. The special press notes project Khattar as a person “known for his farsightedness and making vigilant strategies”. A press release on Friday explained “how CM converted rural dispensaries into 20-bed hospitals”. The move has followed widespread criticism of Khattar government after he went on an “inauguration spree” to dedicate temporary Covid hospitals to the people. Khattar’s newly-appointed media advisor defended him through a tweet that visit of a “captain” is necessary to alert his players in the field. However, given the farm activists’ protest against the CM’s visits only they seem to be “getting alerts” in Haryana. Virbhadra not retiring, supporters sure Irrespective of the fact that age and health is not by his side, supporters of six-times former chief minister Virbhadra Singh still like to project him as the next chief minister of Himachal Pradesh. Those backing the 86-year-old former ruler of Bushahr princely state tore a hoarding installed at the Congress state office in Shimla to mark the death anniversary of former Prime Minister late Rajiv Gandhi because it did not have his face on it. Rather it had blown up face of Virbhadra’s rival within the Congress, G S Bali. State Congress president Kuldeep Rathore has suspended two Congress workers for the incident and has asked them to clear their position in next 15 days, but the incident has once again exposed the divide within the party. The Congress has not been able to win any of the four parliamentary seats in the state in the past two elections. The hopes are not high for the next one either if the house is not put in order by party seniors.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Zumba, baking, calligraphy e-tutorials help kids beat pandemic blues||MUMBAI: Rhea Sinha waits impatiently for the clock to strike 6. She drags a yoga mat out of the cupboard and turns her computer on while humming a tune in broken Español. Last week, Rhea’s grandfather had to be rushed to hospital after he developed Covid- related complications. And even though her mother puts a brave face on, anxiety is palpable in their cramped Wadala apartment. As the song ‘Quema Quema’ booms through the computer speakers and her Zumba instructor pops up on screen, 10-year-old Rhea is transported to a different world for the next hour. Fuelled by the need to keep anxiety at bay and engage children in meaningful activities indoors, parents have taken recourse to a variety of tutorials that have mushroomed online. From baking sessions and brush calligraphy to reciting shlokas and even dressing dolls, children are discovering hobbies that are a welcome break from the monotony of the idiot box. “Most housing societies have prohibited children from playing downstairs due to concerns about a paediatric wave in the coming months. In such times, getting involved in a physical activity indoors and having fun with music at the same time appeals to many,” said licensed Zumba instructor Prachi Jatania, who takes tutorials for children as well as mother-child joint sessions. “I get the children to do jumping jacks or squat Namastes. At the end of an hour, they are sweating. Enjoying the music releases all pressure or worry,” she added. Making thick and thin strokes on paper can be equally therapeutic. “We always teach children to inhale while they are making upstrokes and exhale when they are making downstrokes,” said designer Sanjana Chatlani, who has been teaching brush calligraphy to two dozen children, aged between 8 and 13, every weekend. Chatlani, who uses a second camera facing her paper for children to grasp concepts well, said that when breath and hand movements are in sync, strokes are a lot more precise and accurate. According to educators, the lower brain reacts to stress and anything that creates a calm mindfulness in children is good. “Yoga, music or spirituality classes are a good idea, but anything that increases the focus on academic performance wouldn’t be good at a time like this,” said Swati Popat Vats, president of the Early Childhood Association. “At a young age, the right brain is developing first and that part of the brain is very fond of dance, songs, stories, anything that is a fun or play-based activity. The lower brain reacts to stress, so, any activity that soothes the lower brain is the right activity for children.” When Ananya Nair cooked a continental breakfast for her father for the first time, he had no idea that the eight-year-old had spent the previous week practising with her Bengaluru-based instructor virtually. The advantage of virtual learning is that classes are no longer confined to geographical boundaries. Chatlani's calligraphy classes have children from Singapore and Hong Kong participating. “But while classes may be online, we still get students to run around for some activities and get their hands dirty,” said Darshini Shah of The Square, a Powai-based centre that is running summer camps that include experimentation in the kitchen and environmentalism in the balcony.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-zumba-baking-calligraphy-e-tutorials-help-kids-beat-pandemic-blues/articleshow/82893637.cms||Nitasha Natu

---||Jaipur||Every Indian will be vaccinated by Dec: Shekhawat||Jodhpur: Union cabinet minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat said that India has been working swiftly to increase the production of Covid-19 vaccines and claimed that each citizen of the country will be vaccinated by December. He was addressing the media here on Sunday.“We have been constantly working on increasing the production and availability of the vaccines and will have each Indian vaccinated by December, which will be a huge record,” he said. He added that this will be achieved by the developing country’s own endeavours.Attributing the feat of ably handling the second wave to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the minister said that the opposition did its best to politicise the issue by and questioning its quality and authenticity. However, it could not be successful.“They acted with their vested political interests and blemished the country’s image. But now the same people are queuing up for the shot,” Shekhawat said taking a jibe at the opposition.Referring to the medicines like remdesivir and now Amphotericin B vials for black fungus, Shekhawat said that the country has already reached a surplus state with production of 1.50 crore vials of remdesivir per month. Efforts are on to meet the growing requirement of Amphotericin B vials now.He added that six companies are producing these vials in the country and five more companies have been given permission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/every-indian-will-be-vaccinated-by-dec-shekhawat/articleshow/82892001.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Vax hesitancy leaving camps with zero takers in some villages||JAIPUR: Tribal-dominated Gyaspur gram panchayat, 25km from Pratapgarh district headquarters, did not see any villager turning up for vaccination at a special camp held at Sadariya Fala School on May 22. The newly appointed community health officers, two nurses and social workers, went door-to-door to convince people for taking the first dose, but didn’t succeed. The village, which has crossed 50 positive cases in the second wave, is averse to the idea of vaccination fuelled by months of misleading Whatsapp forwards. On May 21, officials at the vaccination camp at Anoop Pura in Pratapgarh, waited for six hours under the canopy only to return without opening a single vial. Health workers in several tribal villages are finding no takers for vaccinations due to a barrage of misinformation against the doses. Several villages in Pratapgarh, Chittorgarh and Dungarpur have recorded zero or few takers of vaccines giving a challenge to the district authorities in meeting the targets. Genda Devi, sarpanch of Devpura Village, was not present with the health workers when they were knocking on the doors of villagers asking them for the jabs. She said, “People are scared and even beating health workers. What if something happened to anyone? Who will pay the ‘motana’ if anyone dies after taking a dose?” Motana is a prevalent practice in which hefty money is paid to the family of the deceased by the person or the family who is held guilty for the death. Dhariyawad Tehsil, whose MLA Gautam Lal Meena died due to Covid, has barely vaccinated 40% of its 60 years above population. DM Pratapgarh Renu Jaipal said they have initiated campaigns to counter vaccine hesitancy in tribal areas. “The villagers are being convinced for vaccines by integrating traditional and modern means of communication,” said Jaipal. Similarly, villages in Chittorgarh’s—Chikarda, Sangesra, Chapakheri — have kept the health team waiting from 9 am to 3 pm with no one going for the vaccination. Radhey Shyam, a grade-III government teacher on a vaccination drive, said on May 19, they had to wait from 8 am till noon to see the first recipient arriving. “Total of seven persons turned up for the vaccination consuming one vial,” said Shyam. Like the live dashboard on the availability of beds in the hospital, the government is providing figures related to vaccines from the last two weeks leaving the health experts with no scope to positively intervene in expediting the vaccination. Rashmi Jain, head of department sociology, Rajasthan University, said vaccine hesitancy stems from years of mistrust the vulnerable communities have developed and experienced with consecutive governments. “The misinformation on social media has only added to the belief. The religious leaders, elected representatives and sustained campaigns rooted in their customs and rituals can counter the hesitancy,” said Jain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/vax-hesitancy-leaving-camps-with-zero-takers-in-some-villages/articleshow/82891998.cms||Shoeb Khan

While addressing the teachers and research scholars during a meeting held at the varsity on Sunday, Cherian said that the state government would implement a large-scale project to resolve the sea erosion issues in Chellanam. He said that Kufos would formulate the project for the government. Cherian also directed the Kufos authorities to submit a preliminary report after conducting a study on how to resolve the issues in Chellanam. A high-level meeting between the ministers and officials of industries, water resources and fisheries department will be held in Thiruvananthapuram on Monday to discuss the coastal security issues of Chellanam. Though the residents, under the banner of Chellanam Janakeeya Vedi, said that they welcomed the government’s initiative, they are concerned about the already-proposed ‘Punargeham’ project of the fisheries department that aims to relocate fishermen families living in the close vicinity of the sea to safer locations. Janakeeya Vedi chairperson Mariyamma George said that the uncertainty prevailed over the ‘Punargeham’ project as the government’s plan to evict fishing community from their houses and protect the coast was unacceptable. Residents said coastal security measures need to be implemented instead of eviction and rehabilitation. Ensure safety of Chellanam residents: KCBCMeanwhile, Kerala Catholic Bishops Council (KCBC) has urged the new state government to intervene in the sea erosion issue faced by Chellanam residents and implement a comprehensive solution. KCBC, in a statement, welcomed the fisheries minister’s directive to Kufos to adopt the coastal panchayat. KCBC also welcomed leader of opposition V D Satheesan’s statement that a permanent solution was necessary for Chellanam. “Ensuring coastal security and sustainable development in Chellanam is the urgent need and we could know that the chief minister is aware of this. Projects need to be approved and effective implementation must be ensured,” stated the statement signed by KCBC deputy secretary general Fr Jacob G Palackapilly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/fisheries-minister-asks-kufos-to-adopt-chellanam/articleshow/82890248.cms||---

Supervising KV Dham project PWDs executive engineer Sanjay Gore said, “The proposal of four new features including the Ganga view gallery added later to already started project is waiting for the state governments approval. Completing this formality was delayed as before the government could go through it, the massive surge in Covid cases started with the intensifying of its second wave. Tackling this wave had become priority for all.” The gallery has been proposed to enable the visitors viewing the beauty of holy Ganga and mythological ghats along it on one side by standing on it. Entire corridor area can also be viewed on the other side of this gallery. Inclusion of the proposal of this gallery had become possible for the officials following removal of dilapidated buildings, which were purchased late, as it resulted in some changes in the initially approved design of the project area especially at its entry points from ghats along river Ganga. The officials said that not only the space for creating ‘Ganga view gallery’ was found but the alignment of the approach road from the access points to KV Dham being created near Manikarnika, Jalasen and Lalita Ghats is also getting changed and becoming more convenient for the visitors. Two platforms under this view point have also been proposed to construct towards the ghats. Between both platforms steps will be constructed in pyramidical shape. The space at lower platform will be utilized for holding Ganga Aarti and cultural events while landing of visitors through jetty after reaching KV Dham by boats will also become convenient.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/proposal-of-ganga-view-gallery-awaits-govt-approval/articleshow/82891510.cms||---

The SMS Medical College has warned that the incidence of mucormycosis has seen a rise in the wake of the ongoing pandemic and uncontrolled blood sugar levels during the disease. Among the five hospitals given permission are Medical College in Bharatpur, Pacific Medical College in Udaipur, GBH American Hospital in Udaipur, Chirayu Hospital and Apex Hospital in Jaipur. Earlier, the health department had given permission for mucormycosis treatment to 20 hospitals across the state. Apart from giving permission to hospitals for treatment of mucormycosis, the health department has put a cap on price of around 35 diagnostic tests, including CT scan brain, for mucormycosis treatment. Private hospitals will not be allowed to charge more than Rs 1,100 for CT scan brain. However, there will be a cap of Rs 2,500 for MRI-brain without contrast, Rs 2,000 for MRI orbit without contrast, Rs 3,500 for MRI brain with contrast and MRI orbit with contrast. The two orders were issued by principal secretary (health) Akhil Arora on Sunday. Health department officials said as the brain gets affected in the advanced stage of mucormycosis, an MRI and CT scan of brain becomes necessary. The official said all the 35 tests are helpful in diagnosis of any disorder of any other organ such as kidney and tests for diagnosis of mucormycosis. Also, tests have been included to check inflammatory markers such as IL-6 and D-dimer. The health department has already directed its officials to conduct door-to-door survey across the state by taking details of patients who were given steroids during Covid treatment. The health department officials have been directed to complete the survey in three days to identify the suspected mucormycosis cases. Meanwhile, the health department is expanding healthcare facilities for mucormycosis treatment by increasing the number of authorised hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/udaipur/govt-caps-price-of-diagnostic-tests-for-mucormycosis-allows-5-more-hosps-for-treatment/articleshow/82898431.cms||---

The majority of deaths took place in April and May. The data available with Catholic Associations revealed that the nine Catholic priests who died were from different areas of Hyderabad, Vijayawada, Vizag and Guntur dioceses of Andhra Pradesh. Capuchin Priest Father Suresh Mathew compiled the list. Suresh Mathew said, “In 50 days, the country has lost 350 Catholic priests and nuns due to Covid-19. On Sunday, three priests and two nuns were added to the list. Sadly, in a few cases human errors caused the death. Many died while they were in their active ministry. We have cases of sisters who got infected while they were on hospital duty. Priests who conducted funeral services of Covid deaths got infected. Many of our priests who work in remote corners of the country had no access to better hospital care. Had they been in cities with better infra they would not have lost their lives,” He added, “They lived and died in rural areas. They worked among the poor who had no access or could not afford multi-speciality hospitals.” “In a few cases, I personally know, they got infected for not being more careful. Many priests and the religious are reluctant to wear masks, maintain social distancing, or use sanitizers while doing the service to the public. Most of them didn’t get vaccinated,” Fr Suresh added. In Hyderabad, Bowenpally Parish Priest Golamari Inna Reddy died of Covid-19 on Sunday. According to Archbishop of Hyderabad Poola Anthony, the burial of G Inna Reddy took place in Gagillapuram. He condoled the death of the priest. Catholic Association leader from Hyderabad Royden Roch said, “Most of the nuns and priests who died are either working in hospitals or educational institutions. A significant number of Jesuit priests who work in colleges and schools died.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/350-catholic-priests-and-nuns-died-of-covid-19-in-2nd-wave/articleshow/82893654.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

The incident triggered a commotion when four junior doctors led by junior doctor’s association president Dr Hardeep Jogi dashed towards the area where the CM was about to brief waiting press reporters. Alert police and security personnel dashed towards them to prevent a security breach and took the memorandum in their possession while junior doctors engaged in a scuffle. The police personnel overpowered the doctors and whisked them away. SP City Vivek Tripathi said police had no idea about the credentials of the four persons. “Since the area was under high security we took them to a different place, interrogated them, and let them go after coming to know that they were junior doctors,” he said.

Now, instead of getting completed by August-end, the project is likely to complete by November 15. The features added later like Ganga View Point will be delayed further as approval from state government is pending since the second wave hit hard all work. Divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal said, “The official leading the team of company executing the KV Dham project had also tested Covid-19 positive. Besides, a large number of labourers, including those from West Bengal, left for home with the surge in Covid cases. Moreover, the agency had to reduce man power for maintaining social distancing at sites as per Covid protocol. Hence, the work has been affected. But, we are still confident of completing work by November 15.” PWD executive engineer Sanjay Gore, who is supervising the project, said, “A total of 24 buildings are proposed in KV Dham area. Structural work of 12 buildings has been fully completed while work on 12 others is in progress. Construction of jetty and its retaining wall at Manikarnika, Jalasen and Lalita ghats has also been completed. In total, 53% works of KV Dham has already been completed.” The work of over Rs 600 crore KV Dham project had been hit with the beginning of lockdown in 2020.

After purchasing over 70% buildings of 296 structures identified for demolition, PM Narendra Modi had laid foundation of the project on March 9, 2018. Over Rs 300 crore was spent on purchase of 296 buildings. The project is coming up in an area of 5.30 lakh square feet.

The municipal commissioner told the child specialists that in view of the third Covid wave, a 50-bed hospital would be established at Chacha Nehru hospital. Of the 50 beds, 20 beds would be in the ICU and the remaining 30 beds would be equipped with oxygen equipment. He asked the doctors to recommend a number of doctors, nurses and the paramedical staff for the hospital which would be developed like a private hospital. The hospital, to start shortly, would run its OPD round the clock, he further said. Dr Rao said that a plan for level-22 hospitals would be made as per the requirements. “We have asked the civil engineering department to chalk out a plan for renovation of the building and start the work in this regard while the health officer has been directed to get vacated rooms from the employees residing in the hospital”, the municipal commissioner said. The mayor had presented the proposal to the chief minister to reopen Chacha Nehru hospital for children to which the latter gave his nod when he visited the city last Saturday.

A three-pronged treatment approach is required for addressing mucormycosis, which includes controlling sugar levels, anti-fungals and surgical debridement. Sawai Man Singh Medical College has issued treatment guidelines for mucormycosis, which mentions two different treatments. One is medical treatment and the other is surgical. It pointed out that surgeries are conducted to facilitate medical treatment and it alone cannot be a complete process as it requires cure from anti-fungals. The treatment, which includes liposomal amphotericin B as the drug of choice, can be replaced by conventional amphotericin or amphotericin B deoxycholate as an option. In general, 2-3 weeks of amphotericin B is required but it might have to be increased depending on clinical profile of the patient. As a step down therapy, tab poscanozole is given for up to three weeks. However, in surgical treatment, early debridement of all necrotic tissue by a team of expert ENT and ophthalmologists to decrease the load of fungus and facilitate medical treatment. Patients suffering from Covid who have diabetes mellitus and have taken steroids are at high risk of getting infected with mucormycosis. SMS Hospital has been conducting surgical debridement for the last seven days and conducted almost 40 such surgeries. “Debridement has its own benefits as it helps in removing dead necrotic tissues so that fungal load decreases and chances of local and distant spread reduces. It facilitates for proper cleaning, regular endoscopy and better drug delivery to the sites of infection. It also prevents secondary infection and reduces pressure on eye and brain tissues,” said Dr Pawan Singhal, professor (ENT), SMS Medical College, who is among the doctors performing surgical debridement. However, doctors say surgical debridement is not the only treatment, as patients should also be treated with anti-fungals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/three-step-treatment-needed-for-mucormycosis-surgeries-not-enough/articleshow/82892070.cms||---

IPS Anil Kumar posted as the ADCP of Traffic (Kanpur) set up a 16-bed L1-Covid hospital at the Reserve Police Lines where he is treating patients, mostly policemen and their families. As soon as the second wave of corona hit the country, City Police Commissioner Aseem Kumar appointed Kumar as in-charge of the Covid cell taking into account his professional qualification. Kumar now attends to patients in the OPD of the temporary hospital every day. “More than two dozen patients have so far been cured after being admitted to the L1 hospital. Besides, more than 400 infected people who came to the OPD were prescribed medicines and got cured in home isolation. Majority of the patients were policemen and their family members,” Kumar told TOI. Kumar, who hails from Alsisar in Jhunjhunu district of Rajasthan, had done his MBBS course from the S N Medical College in Jodhpur. Prior to his selection in Indian Police Services, he had worked at Guru Tegh Bahadur Hospital, Delhi. “Even during UPSC Civil Services examination interview, I was asked why I wanted to become an IPS after becoming a doctor. Many others had mocked me saying I had wasted my time and education. May be, this is the answer,” said Kumar. “I always believe education and knowledge never go waste, always help you. In this time of severe crisis, I used my knowledge and skills and cured 400 people when there was acute shortage of beds in hospitals and so many were dying,” he added Interestingly, Kumar’s sister, Manju who is an IAS officer and had also done MBBS. She is currently serving as district development officer in Udaipur, Rajasthan and has been given charge of the Oxygen Audit team in Udaipur. Talking to TOI over phone, she said she did an audit of available resources like ventilators and consumption of oxygen when there was acute shortage. “We found that large amount of oxygen was being wasted while the patient was having meal or going to toilet. We introduced changes to save oxygen and are now providing oxygen support to 100 additional patients every day with the same supply,” she said. “Besides being in-charge of the oxygen audit team, I am also monitoring Covid patients in a government hospital and four private medical colleges in the district. I have additional responsibility of patients and oxygen consumption of 20 private medical colleges,” Dr Manju informed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/ips-with-mbbs-degree-posted-as-adcptraffic-runs-hosp-opd-saves-400-lives/articleshow/82891576.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
---||Allahabad||Prayagraj: Sale of Covid medicines, essentials drops by 80% as second wave ebbs||PRAYARGAJ: The sale of Covid-19 medicines has fallen by 80% in the Sangam city in the past once week with the big decline in new cases and high recovery rate. Traders in wholesale and retail medicine markets claimed a drastic fall in sale of Covid medicines like Remdesivir, Fabiflu, Ivermectin, Azithromycin, Doxycycline and others. Prayag Chemist & Druggist Association (Retail) organising secretary Nikhil Malang told TOI, “The sale of Covid medicines has dropped by 70 to 80%. Medicine traders in wholesale and retail business who had placed orders when demand exceeded supply are now not getting as many customers.” Sale of medicines grew exponentially between April 3 and April 26 when Covid cases were rising and hit peak, but started declining gradually after April 28 as infection spread was controlled. “Some pharmacies which placed big orders in mid-April are now left with large stocks of medicines with few takers. There has also been a big decline in sale of pulse oximeter, nebulizer and vaporizers,” Nikhil added. The demand of masks and sanitizers is still strong since people are now following precautionary measures earnestly, he added. UP Chemist & Druggist Federation regional secretary Prem Agrawal, told TOI, “The sale of Covid medicines has declined across Prayagraj, Pratapgarh, Kaushambi and Fatehpur. There is hardly 10% sale of Fabiflu now in the city.” Some traders had stocked medicines during Covid peak and now the demand has fallen, he added. On Saturday, the city reported 81 new Covid cases while 286 patients recovered, bringing the number of active cases down under 1,500. The effect of second wave was felt from April 6 when 1,084 cases were recorded in a day, the day tally breached the 1,500-mark on April 10 with 1,682 new cases being detected and then 2,324 on April 15. The city saw Covid peak on April 17 with 2,436 cases in a day. The caseload then started dipping and came down to 1,874 on April 25. The daily cases fell below 1,500 on April 28, when 1,493 cases were detected and below 1,000 with 984 cases on May 2. The slide continued and only 96 cases were detected on May 19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/sale-of-covid-medicines-essentialsdrops-by-80-as-second-wave-ebbs/articleshow/82891606.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Good samaritans gives this Covid recovered patient renewed hope||PRAYARGAJ: We often come forward to offer a helping hand to a friend or family member who is in need of help, but it takes much more to care for someone unknown or strangers. In the present situation of the deadly second wave of Covid-19 pandemic, and at a time when the country is trying to put up a brave fight, a group of citizens have come forward to do their bit to help people in fighting Covid-19. For instance, people turned good samaritan for 56-year-old Rajesh Kapoor, who had no relatives or close friends in the city when he was fighting against Covid-19 at Swaroop Rani Nehru (SRN) hospital. Sharing his experience, Civil Lines resident Kapoor told TOI, “I was admitted at SRN hospital on May 1. This is when one Ritesh Srivastava helped me to get admitted in a hospital after I was diagnosed with Covid-19. This when people were struggling to find a bed in any medical facility in the city. As I had no relatives or close friends in city, Ritesh stayed for hours at the hospital till I was shifted to a Covid ward. After my admission in a Covid ward, I had no one to seek help from outside but a woman named Mayuri, when she came to know about me having no one to ask about my well-being, came forward and started sending meals three times a day including breakfast, lunch and dinner.” “Despite being unknown to me, she not only arranged quality meal for me three times in a day but also made calls to me regularly to ask about my condition every day and encouraged me in my fight against Covid,” he added. Kapoor further said, “Mayuri had helped me for 14 days in terms of sending a balanced diet from her home and connecting with me every day so that I did not feel lonely or isolated”. Kapoor was discharged from SRN hospital on May 14. He, however, said, “The two people gave a me a new lease of life at a time when I had no one in the family to take care of me.” 48-year-old AK Tripathi told TOI, “When I was diagnosed with Covid-19, I was supported by some of my neighbours whom I was not even on talking terms. When I got admitted in a hospital, they kept on taking my care in terms of arranging medicines and meal and welcomed me when I reached home back after getting a discharge.” He also added, “I am so grateful to my neighbours for giving me so much love and affection when I needed it in the time of crisis.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/good-samaritans-gives-this-covid-recovered-patient-renewed-hope/articleshow/82891623.cms||---

While earlier this week, the duo were at war over taking credit for the uninterrupted power supply in Fatorda during the blackout, this time, Goa Forward Party president Vijai Sardesai and his arch rival, BJP general secretary Damodar Naik, sparred over the issue of non-Goans being vaccinated at the Margao urban health centre (UHC). On Sunday, a notice was put up at the centre announcing that vaccination for workers of pharmaceutical companies has been temporarily withdrawn until further notice. As the notice came just a day after Sardesai and his group of councillors barged into the vaccination centre objecting to the large number of pharma workers queuing up for the jab, GFP lost no time in claiming that it was its diktat that prevailed. Health officer of the UHC, Anju Kharangate, confirmed that the vaccination has been temporarily suspended upon the instructions of the directorate of health services, but stressed that the move had nothing to do with Sardesai’s protest. “The proposal for setting up a separate facility for pharma workers at Verna industrial estate is already under the consideration of the health department. The vaccination programmes are conducted under the supervision and instructions of the central government, and not by political considerations,” said Kharangate when asked if the move was prompted by GFP’s objections. Following Sardesai’s protestations at the vaccination centre on Sunday, Naik had slammed him, terming his “antics” as a “publicity stunt.” Stating that he had already moved a proposal before the government for setting up a vaccination centre at the multi-purpose school complex, Borda, Naik said that Sardesai was ignorant that many pharma workers were residents of Fatorda and thus had every right to get vaccinated at the Margao UHC. On Sunday, GFP members addressed reporters condemning Naik’s statement and accusing him of working more for the welfare of pharma workers at the cost of locals’ health. “It’s because Sardesai did what he did yesterday that the vaccination for pharma workers has now been kept on hold,” one of them said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vijai-damu-now-spar-over-vaccination-of-pharma-staff/articleshow/82893683.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Four nabbed for duping aspiring cops with forged letters||AHMEDABAD: Local crime branch (LCB) of Gandhinagar police held four persons including a woman on Saturday for cheating at least 40 aspirants with the promise of jobs in police. Police said the gang had cheated the job aspirants abore Rs 1 crore in total. The accused were identified as Sidharth Pathak, his wife Pooja Pathak, residents of Satellite, Rahul Lalluvadia, resident of Ramol, and Jagdish Jakharia, resident of Chandkheda. LCB officers said that they nabbed the four accused when they came to Punit Van in Sector-19 in Gandhinagar and also seized fake identity cards and other documents from them. Police booked them under charges of breach of trust, cheating, forgery and criminal conspiracy and began an investigation. An LCB officer said that the accused Sidharth and Pooja contacted aspirants though social media advertisements and personal contacts and lured them with promise of jobs in the Gujarat Police. They used to tell the aspirants that they had contacts in senior cadre of the police force and the home department using which they could provide jobs. The case came on surface after a man from Surat filed a complaint with Sector 21 police of Gandhinagar. The complainant, Pratap Jat, 20, resident of Kamrej in Surat, said in his FIR that he was introduced to Sidharth around two years ago through a common friend after which the accused promised him a job in police without undergoing any written or physical exam. Jat said that Sidharth had on October 21, 2019, sent him an appointment letter carrying the signature of an IPS officer, G S Malik. After that, Jat paid Sidharth the Rs 3 lakh he demanded. After few days, Sidharth sent him an order to join duty signed by then Junagadh SP Saurabh Singh. Sidharth told Jat to join the duty only after he says, but he then kept mum. On September 10, 2020, Sidharth sent him another order signed by then DCP, zone-5, Ahmedabad city, Ravi Teja Vasamsetty, telling Jat that he would get a job of Lok Raksak Dal (LRD) jawan in Ahmedabad city. But as Sidharth told him not to join the duty without consulting him, Jat again waited for long. As he did not get a job as promised by Sidharth, Jat told him to meet him and sort out the issue. Sidharth told him to come to Gandhinagar in October last year but went Jat went to the spot of appointment, he found other aspirants who were also duped by Sidharth. Police officers said that Sidharth promised the aspirants with jobs in the police department. His wife Pooja, with the help of her friend, one Arijit Singh of Punjab, forged documents like appointment letters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/4-nabbed-for-duping-aspiring-cops-with-forged-letters/articleshow/82892170.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||‘Ensure proper rehabilitation of patients’||Aurangabad: On the occasion of World Schizophrenia Day (May 24), health experts have underlined the need for proper rehabilitation of patients suffering from schizophrenia, including the need of addressing residual symptoms such as inability to mix with people, concentration deficit and impaired functioning at large. Consultant psychiatrist Dr Tejas Gayal on Sunday said psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia need proper rehabilitation similar to any physical illness. “Schizophrenia can have a long and chronic course and may lead to significant impairment in social and occupational functioning capacities of the patient. The proper psychiatric rehabilitation, also known as psycho-social rehabilitation includes adequate symptomatic improvement and prevention of future relapses with prime focus on helping the person return to an optimal level of functioning and to achieve their life goals,” he said. Senior consultant psychiatrist Dr Vinay Barhale said overall 1% of the population in the world suffers from schizophrenia. “Most of the symptoms of schizophrenia can improve with conventional modes of treatment like regular medications and a course of electro-convulsive therapy in some cases. But many times. symptoms relapse due to lack of knowledge about the disease and its treatment among patients and their family members. Besides, irregular follow-ups and stigmatising beliefs associated with psychiatric illnesses along with financial constraints often prove roadblocks,” he said.Another consultant psychiatrist Dr Vinayak Patil said specific techniques like social skills training, cognitive remediation therapy and vocational and occupational therapies prove effective on certain residual symptoms of schizophrenia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/ensure-proper-rehabilitation-of-patients/articleshow/82886288.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Deaths at Mumbai High: Is it an accident or a case of gross industrial negligence?||By: Yatendra Singh Cyclone Tauktae has caused probably the biggest tragedy since 2005 when an ONGC platform at Mumbai High and several platform supply vessels (PSVs) were lost. Given the technology and weather reporting systems available, such loss of lives is unacceptable due to a cyclone hitting an offshore oilfield. There are rules on actions to be taken to ensure zero loss of life in such situations. Barge PAPAA 305 was an accommodation barge built in 2004, which did not have its own propulsion or steering system. It’s not a typical ship but a floating structure. A vessel of this type is severely restricted in her ability to manoeuver and is towed by a tug boat of suitable size in fair weather only. These vessels are not built to face the rigors of the sea and are allowed permission to operate in fair weather only. Barge PAPAA 305 is a foreign-flagged vessel registered under the flag of St Kitts and Nevis. St Kitts and Nevis is a black-listed flag under the Paris MOU and Tokyo MOU which are global conventions meant to enforce an effective port state control regime and tackle poor standards in shipping. St Kitts and Nevis is also a US Coast Guard-targeted flag for deficiencies. Vessels under black-listed flags are generally considered to be maintained substandard and are specifically targeted through thorough inspections when they call at any port. The bigger oil and gas companies with stricter safety standards generally do not charter vessels under black listed flags. PAPAA 305’s ownership and management registration details too must be examined to see if it was foreign-controlled. Such vessels are generally allowed to operate in the sensitive zone of ONGC only after DG Shipping issues a General Trading License after inspection. As per DG Shipping circular 1/2007, non-propelled vessels are exempted from complying with Chapter 2 of SPS code (regarding Stability, Subdivision, and Bilge Pumping Arrangement) and can comply with relevant requirements of the MODU Code. “The above relaxations shall be applicable for operation of the offshore vessels in fair season only,” say the rules. Such exemptions, however, make a vessel more vulnerable to surviving flooding. As per DG Shipping circular 3 of 2008, it is unambiguously mentioned that “Owners /Operators should, however, observe due diligence and take all necessary safety precautions if such vessels are deployed in the offshore fields keeping in view the condition of sea and weather.” Considering such vessels would need about 24-48 hours to get towed safely to the harbour and considering the vessel had more than 100 persons on board, transfer could have only been possible by helicopter or crew boats in advance. What commercial compulsions did ONGC management face that delayed the decision? The other question is, what is the actual documented relationship of AFCONS with PAPAA 305, and is it indeed competent and certified to manage a marine asset?

The three ambulances, donated by Congress MLA T Jayaprakash Reddy, will be stationed at Gandhi Bhavan in Nampally. Covid-19 patients or their family members living within a 50-km radius of the state capital, can call on Gandhi Bhavan help desk number 040-24601254 to avail the ambulance service facilities, which are free. Uttam said the TRS government should urgently increase the number of Covid-19 tests and also come clear on whether Covid-19 treatment will be included in Arogyasri scheme or the treatment would be offered free of cost under the Centre’s Ayushman Bharat or both. “What is stopping the chief minister from announcing Covid-19 treatment free of cost when states like Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu are providing Covid-19 treatment free of cost. Maharashtra government has taken over many private hospitals and is providing free treatment in them and Kerala is strictly ensuring collection of reasonable charges for treatment in private hospitals,” Uttam said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cong-make-covid-treatment-free-for-bpl-families-in-state/articleshow/82893685.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Thiruvananthapuram Covid deaths: Official figures contradict crematorium stats||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Going by the official figures, Covid-19 deaths accounted for only 8% of the total deaths recorded in the district this year. However, data of Covid cremations collected from some of the crematoriums in the district in the January-May 22 period show higher number of figures. Whether this disparity happens due to underreporting, undercounting or due to deceased from other districts being cremated here is not known to authorities. Death registration figures for Thiruvananthapuram between January and May 22 put total deaths at 9,579 (figures of 11 panchayats are not available). Health department data show that there were 762 Covid-19 deaths in the district during this period. Total death figures could be even more since death data of 11 panchayats is not shown in registration wing’s figures. However, figures from Santhikavadom run by city corporation show that 1,337 bodies were cremated between January and May of which 615 were of Covid victims’. Another crematorium run by SNDP at Muttathara shows that 421 bodies were cremated in May alone and in April it was 280. Of these more than 90% were Covid deaths. At Maranallur, where panchayat runs a crematorium, 200 cremations were held in April and May. Staff associated with transport and cremation of bodies receive mortal remains in accordance with Covid protocol and according to them nearly all of the bodies cremated in these areas belonged to Covid victims. There has been a similar spike in cremations of Covid victims’ bodies at crematoriums run by Pazhayakunnumel, Nedumangad and Attingal municipalities. While official figures limit Covid deaths to less than 800 this year in the district, cumulative data from just three crematoriums alone account for nearly 1,300 Covid deaths. According to officials, except in rare cases many of the deceased are based in Thiruvananthapuram itself. TOI has not been able to collect Covid burial data from mosques and around four crematoriums and even then there has been a difference of over 600 deaths. If only 762 persons died of Covid-19 in the district, it has to be assumed that around 9,000 deaths happened due to other causes. Deaths from around 18 types of communicable diseases in Thiruvananthapuram have been 53 and 61 in 2018 and 2019 respectively and fatalities from these communicable diseases have not peaked alarmingly in the district. In 2020, 367 people died in road accidents in the district. Even for the entire state, cumulative fatalities from 20 types of communicable diseases this year is 38. Of the total deaths registered in Thiruvananthapuram this year, 5,768 happened in hospitals while 3,811 occurred in other places. From the confirmed Covid-19 deaths, the health department has not included some deaths in the list since the reason for death may not be attributed to Covid-19. The number of such non-Covid deaths has also been low in the district — 25 in 2021 and 64 in 2020. In 2020, Covid deaths accounted for 2% of total deaths in Thiruvananthapuram.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/covid-deaths-official-figures-contradict-crematorium-stats/articleshow/82890331.cms||Aswin J Kumar

In her FIR, the woman said that she had met the accused for the first time when she had carried her wife in a 108 ambulance to Sola Civil hospital for delivery. As the accused was from the same district as the complainant, his wife befriended her and later the accused also became friends with her husband and began visiting her house. She said in the FIR that the accused Yogesh Prajapati, a mobile phone repairing shop owner, came to her house around six months ago and told her that he loved her and tried to rape her. She said that she somehow managed to escape and stopped talking to him. Meanwhile, her husband gave her cellphone to Prajapati to repair it. At that time, he took all the intimate videos of her and her husband from the cellphone and with them he began blackmailing her. She said that Prajapati used to make video calls and told her to disrobe. If she refused, he threatened to make her videos and pictures viral and defame her. She said that Prajapati also took screenshots of the video calls using which he continued to blackmail her and began demanding money from her. The woman said that Prajapati made a fake Facebook account through which he befriended all her friends and blackmailed her by saying that he would send her pictures to all of them. Using this threat, he extorted Rs 30,000 from her and then began demanding Rs 40,000 more in March this year.  She said that she had once thought to commit suicide in March this year but as she was pregnant, she did not end her life. She said that when she did not pay him the money he demanded, Prajapati threatened to inject HIV virus inside her. After such threats, she approached police and filed a complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/woman-complains-of-blackmail/articleshow/82892206.cms||---

Police said two accused — Dhiraj Mandkar (21), from Pathardi, and Santosh Lomte (21), from Bhatkudgaon, in Ahmednagar — have been arrested. The prime accused, Dyaneshwar alias Bhaiyya Gaikwad, is absconding. The accused, after strangling and stabbing the jeweller in the mouth with a pair of scissors inside a hair-cutting salon, had travelled nearly 60 km — with the body wrapped in a blanket — to Bhatkudgaon village in Ahmednagar. The body was buried in the farm of the key accused. The deceased has been identified as Vishal Kulthe and his body was exhumed on Sunday morning. Beed superintendent of police R Raja said: “The murder case came to fore while the police were working on a missing complaint lodged by the jeweller’s family. The accused were rounded up on Saturday and they have confessed to the crime.” Police said Dyaneshwar had recently contacted Kulthe and said that he wanted purchase ornaments. He also paid Rs 5,000 as advance. Kulthe came to Beed and collected the ornaments. On May 20, he received a call from Dyaneshwar who asked him to come to the salon. The same evening, Kulthe reached the salon. The accused trio took him inside the shop, downed the shutter and allegedly killed him. They then wrapped the body in a blanket and pretended that they were taking a patient to the hospital. Then they went to Dyaneshwar’s farm and burried the body.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/2-arrested-for-jewellers-murder/articleshow/82886363.cms||Mohammed Akhef

AMC has recovered a fine of Rs 3.87 lakh, as per the official data. The civic body conducted Covid testing of 371 citizens, who were found moving on the streets without any valid reason. While all these violators had to undergo rapid antigen testing, none of them tested positive, the local civic body said. AMC administrator Astik Kumar Pandey had already appealed to the citizens to follow Covid prevention norms. Observing that a section of citizens was violating these norms as the lockdown-like situation is scheduled to end by June 1, Pandey said AMC authorities would be on their toes to ensure orders under ‘Break The Chain’ are followed till the end. “All Covid related curbs need to be followed in letter and spirit till the end. It is essential to break the chain of the infection, failing which, the society at large would have to face a resurgence of the pandemic situation,” Pandey said. Meanwhile, city MP Imtiaz Jaleel on Sunday accused the authorities of having a biased attitude while initiating a crackdown against violators. “The authorities had sealed one famous sweet-mart for violation of Covid prevention norm, but its seal was removed within a couple of hours. Such double yardstick while taking action is outrageous,” Jaleel said on his Facebook live. The city MP also alleged that there was no check on the alleged illegal sale of liquor during the current Covid related curbs with authorities deliberately turning a blind eye towards certain commercial establishments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-179-people-shops-face-action-in-2-days/articleshow/82886393.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: CM K Chandrasekhar Rao orders probe against Eatala Rajender son over land grab charge||HYDERABAD: Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has ordered an inquiry into the alleged land grabbing allegations made against MLA Eatala Rajender’s son, E Nitin Reddy. The move comes even as Eatala, his son and their family-run Jamuna hatcheries are already under investigation for allegedly encroaching assigned temple lands in various places. The inquiry has been ordered following a complaint lodged by farmer P Mahesh Mudiraj that his land in Ravalkole village in Medchal-Malkajgiri district was allegedly encroached upon by Nitin. He urged the chief minister to provide justice. Mahesh is a Mudiraj, a community of Backward Classes (BC) to which even Eatala Rajender belongs. Responding to the complaint from Mahesh, the chief minister instructed chief secretary Somesh Kumar to inquire into the complaint immediately. He also instructed the Anti-Corruption Bureau, Vigilance, Revenue and other concerned officials to conduct a comprehensive probe and submit a report at the earliest. Eatala and his family’s Jamuna hatcheries are already under investigation by vigilance and revenue officials for allegedly encroaching about 100 acres of assigned temple lands in Devaryamjal mandal among other places. A four member IAS officers’ committee was appointed to inquire into the issue and they have reportedly submitted a report. However, Eatala Rajender has been denying these allegations as a campaign to defame him. In his complaint letter to KCR, Mahesh said his grandfather owned 10.1 acres land behind survey no. 77 in Ravalkole village. “As per the 1975-76 Ceiling Act, the government had also issued a certificate. From Khasra Pahani in 1954 to Adangal Pahani in 1986, the revenue records showed my grandfather, Narasimha, as the owner,” he said. Mahesh said that after 1986, the names of Satyam Ramalinga Raju and others were shown as owners in records. “In the last few years, the land belonging to my grandfather was purchased by Nitin by exerting pressure on officials. I had tried meeting the minister then as he is also from the Mudiraj community, but he did not meet me. I finally got to meet him about eight months back but he warned me against talking about it,” Mahesh alleged.“I have the 38-E certificate and the Pahani records that have my grandfather’s name on it. As per Tenancy and Ceiling Act, we have had rights on this land for so many decades. Give us back our land,” he stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cm-kcr-orders-probe-against-eatala-son-over-land-grab-charge/articleshow/82893690.cms||Roushan Ali

Shadow Council convener Savio Coutinho on Saturday submitted a memorandum to this effect addressed to the chief minister and the South Goa district collector. “It is essential to note that unlike the neighbouring constituencies, which roughly have a population of below 40,000 each, the Margao Municipal Council (MMC) area has a population of nearly 1 lakh, yet a single vaccination centre. The crowds seen at the Margao urban health center are indeed very disturbing and a solution to the same becomes the need of the hour,” Coutinho said. He pointed out that a premises owned by MMC at Malbhat was lying idle which, he suggested, be taken over immediately for the setting up of an additional vaccination centre there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/need-addl-vax-centres-for-margao/articleshow/82893691.cms||---

Among the eight districts from the region, Parbhani and Nanded continue to have the costliest petrol at Rs 101.87 and Rs 101.71 per litre, respectively. The relatively bigger transportation cost of fuel is attributed to stiff retail prices in these two districts. Non-premium petrol was sold in Aurangabad for Rs 100.78 per litre, Rs 100.65 in Jalna, Rs 100.54 in Beed, Rs 100.56 in Latur and Rs 100.49 in Hingoli. The price of diesel is also moving up. On Sunday, diesel was sold at Rs 92.19 and Rs 92.06 per litre in Parbhani and Nanded, respectively. In Aurangabad, diesel was priced at Rs 92.6 per litre on Sunday. Suhas Patil, a professional, said rise in fuel prices would compound the Covid crisis. “The market is bound to witness inflation when Covid-related curbs are be lifted. Rise in prices of petrol and diesel will have a cascading effect on the economy,” he said. Aqeel Abbas, the president of fuel retailers in Aurangabad, said hike in fuel prices leads to more investment cost for retailers. “The investment amount goes up without any increase in profit margin. Also, there is no account for evaporation losses of fuel and the same has to be borne by the petrol pump owner,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/barring-osmanabad-petrol-crosses-rs-100-mark-in-mwada/articleshow/82886452.cms||Prasad Joshi

Though works of all the roads undertaken by CSML should have been completed by September 2020, the work on many roads in West Kochi are yet to begin. A total of 87 roads works are being undertaken by the agency. “In Fort Kochi, roads are being renovated by CSML in an unscientific manner. The agency, which carries the tag ‘smart’ in its name, miserably failed in understanding the importance of heritage. Authorities removed cobblestones on footpaths which were laid during the colonial period and replaced it with concrete slabs. We had held talks with CSML authorities before starting the works and they gave us their word on protecting the heritage in the area. But the works carried out by the agency’s contractors have dealt a big blow to the heritage features in the area,” said K J Sohan, former mayor of Kochi. “They constructed footpaths on either side of even narrow roads. At the same time, the work started a couple of years ago still remain incomplete,” Sohan said. The deadline for completing the works of all the roads was 15 months. In Fort Kochi area, the work on five smart roads, including K B Jacob Road, Bellar Road and River Road, had been stopped for months. “The work on the five smart roads worth Rs 31 crore had been awarded to ABC Builders. But the contractor failed to complete the work even after 15 months. On Thursday, we served a notice to the contractors demanding the firm to show the cause for not terminating their contract. They should give reply to the notice within 15 days,” said CSML CEO Jaffer Malik. According to the CSML authorities, the works of roads in West Kochi were started after much delay as the contractors were not ready to undertake it. There are 84 roads, other than the five model roads, the renovation of which have been undertaken by CSML. “We had to cut a single work into three or four subdivisions and invite tenders for each piece. Most of the contractors are not ready to undertake road works in Fort Kochi area,” an official with CSML said. Of the 53 other roads in I and II divisions of the Kochi corporation in Fort Kochi, work on just eight roads have been completed so far. Of the 34 roads to be renovated in III, IV and V divisions of the corporation, none of the works have been completed. Tile-laying of 17 roads have been completed, while drain works of 27 roads have been completed. Laying footpath of 18 roads have been completed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/csml-road-works-in-west-kochi-lag-behind-schedule/articleshow/82890372.cms||M K Sunil Kumar
---||Ahmedabad||For violators, ‘friend in need’ is a curfew pass attempt||Ahmedabad: Covid-19 protocols demand social distancing, but some people can’t seem to stay away from those they care for — but pleasant meetings in the time of corona attract extra guests, in the form of police. An analysis of 100 FIRs filed in the city over the past four days suggests that meeting a friend in need was the most common excuse offered by people caught for breaching the curfew norms. Recently, four persons including two women in their 30s were caught by Vastrapur police for celebrating a birthday party at Judges Bungalow Crossroads in Bodakdev during the curfew hours. Cops said that in most other cases, people who are stopped for venturing out during the curfew say that they were rushing to meet an ailing friend. Others say they were out to inquire about a friend who recently recovered from an illness. In many cases, when cops verified the stories, lies emerged and the offenders were booked for violating the curfew norms. On Saturday, Vastrapur cops caught four persons including two women —aged between 25 and 30 — near Sindhu Bhavan Crossroads during a night patrol. Police said the four claimed that they were going to check on a friend who had fractured his leg in an accident. Cops were firm that the reason was not good enough to break the Covid curfew. Police booked them under the charges of violating the curfew notification. The provisions of the Disaster Management Act and the Epidemic Act were also invoked. A senior police officer said that most of the cases of “attending to an ailing friend” are noted in areas such as Vastrapur, Bodakdev, Satellite, Anandnagar, and Prahladnagar. These are the areas where people hang out in the evening. Cops in the eastern part of the city said that they too come across people who say they flouted the curfew rules to help a friend or relative in need. As police personnel have been instructed to be humane, they check the claims. When people lie they are booked, said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/for-violators-friend-in-need-is-a-curfew-pass-attempt/articleshow/82892231.cms||---

According to an FIR filed by the taluka mamlatdar for Nadiad, Jayendrasinh Jhala, 40, a resident of Nadiad, it is the responsibility of taluka mamlatdar to make arrangements for firewood for cremation. He was on this duty when the incident took place on the night of May 16, the FIR states. Jhala stated that and three persons were going to a government-run nursery to arrange for firewood for cremation at Vaso village. He then spotted a man driving a tractor which had a huge stock of wood in the trolley and Jhala stopped him. The mamlatdar stated that he asked the man for his permit for the wood but instead of furnishing a permit, the man called three other men who rushed there and abused Jhala and his staffers. He said the accused persons then fled the spot and had thus obstructed a government officer in his duty, by denying him the firewood. Investigating officer and sub-inspector of Vaso police, J V Vadhia, said, “The accused person had collected the firewood from his land, which had been acquired in a road-widening project. When Jhala saw him, he first asked the man to give him the wood for cremation, but the man was adamant. Jhala emphasized that he needed the wood as part of his duty. The man then abused him and his three aides also threatened Jhala and got into a scuffle with him,” said Vadhia. Vadhia said a complaint under the charges of obstructing a public servant in his duty and abetment was lodged and an investigation was started.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/mamlatdar-gets-into-row-over-pyre-wood/articleshow/82892253.cms||---

The vessel started its journey to Paghar after her diving team searched through all four storeys of the P-305 accommodation barge and did not find any bodies stuck in any of its rooms or chambers. The barge is on the seabed at a depth of 30 metres. The spot is around 80km off Mumbai’s coast. “Diving on the sunken wreck of barge P-305 has been completed by specialised teams onboard INS Makar, and no bodies have been found. (For Varaprada) diving operations will be conducted on Monday,” said a Navy official. Karnik said the INS Makar will continue its operation to locate the Varaprada. “We haven’t called off the SAR yet.” The Navy’s chief PRO, commander Mehul Karnik, told TOI, “A total of 274 crew were reported missing on May 17, of which 261 were from P305 and 13 from Varaprada. A total of 188 survivors were picked up at sea (including two from Varaprada) during SAR.” Of the 16 bodies recovered, eight each were found at Valsad and Raigad, of which five belong to P-305 and 11 to Varaprada. Confirming the breakup of bodies found at Raigad and Valsad, Karnik said, “Thus all 274 crew initially reported missing have been accounted for. Final confirmation will however be pending till the identification of all bodies recovered is completed.” P-305 started sinking on May 15 at midnight after its eight anchorage steel cables started snapping one after the other, before its 261 crew onboard started jumping into the sea wearing life jackets, while some tried to use life rafts, almost all of which were found punctured. The decomposed body of the captain of Varaprada has been identified with the help of his watch and ring. On Sunday, naval warships Betwa, Teg and Talwar, along with helicopters and Coast Guard and offshore vessels, recovered four bodies. An ONGC spokesperson said all 101 ONGC personnel onboard drillship Sagar Bhushan and 196 on barge SS-3 are safe. “The 44 ONGC employees onboard P-305 were rescued safely during the SAR. A total of six crew were rescued and seven of those employed by Afcons directly died,” said the official. “Two of the bodies that washed ashore at Valsad were identified as those of Captain N Kumar and crew member Umed Singh of Varaprada. Singh was identified through his wallet and I-Card. One I-card, bearing the names Glory Shipping and Yatinder Vikram Singh, was found floating in water.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/naval-divers-find-and-search-p305-sail-on-to-look-for-missing-tugboat/articleshow/82893707.cms||Mateen Hafeez

This will be the second such township after Navi Mumbai, the development of which started in the 1970s. The township will be developed on 337 hectares given to the City and Industrial Development Corporation (Cidco) in lieu of constructing the district headquarters, spending Rs 1,000 crore. Cidco has been given 400 hectares, of which 70 hectares is prime sea-facing land. The 337 hectares, which can accommodate 35 Oval Maidans, is on the other side of the newly developed district HQ spread over 103 hectares. “We have not been able to predict the market with the Covid pandemic. We have, therefore, invited expression of interest as we want to know what the market demands, understand the views of stakeholders, be it educational institutions, IT companies, large industrial houses, experts, scholars. Covid has changed how we shall live and we want to know what will be the right product mix for Palghar,” said Sanjay Mukherjee, MD, Cidco. Mukherjee said the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), which is the planning authority for the region, wants Palghar to be a residential township. With the terminal station for the Bullet train in BKC, the MMRDA proposes to shift its back office to Palghar so that its employees can live and work there and if required travel by the Bullet train to BKC. The draft plan is ready and depending on the response Cidco may allow four to five master developers to build the township. If the response is not good, Cidco will build infrastructure and auction plots. Mukherjee wants Palghar to be a walk-to-work place. Palghar city at present comprises its industrial area too. The Trans MIDC Industries Association (TMIA), which represents industries in the Thane-Navi Mumbai belt, said the notified industrial area must be excluded from the future civic body, the new Palghar city municipality. “Municipal bodies have no role to play in industrial areas. MIDC is a statutory corporation, which is duty-bound to provide infrastructure and amenities in this area. The Maharashtra government has failed to respect the constitutional mandate that notified industrial areas are to be exclusive. Navi Mumbai and Panvel industrial areas have been included in municipal limits, resulting in double taxation, resulting in flight of industries to other states,” said Raja Bujle, chairman, legal, for TMIA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-palghar-township-to-come-up-on-337-hectares-of-cidco-land/articleshow/82892311.cms||Clara Lewis

The accused used to run a consultancy firm by the name Kaloor Take Off, police said. The arrested persons have been identified as Firoz Khan, 42, of Nettoor and Sathaar, 50, of Cherthala. Police said that the accused had taken Rs 2.5 lakh each as advance from several job aspirants before sending them to Dubai. However, the accused had no recruiting licence and was planning to arrange the job through other agencies. However, the accused invested the money that they took from the victims in vehicle sales business and purchased second-hand vehicles with the money. The other agencies withdrew from the deal with the accused as they never got paid, leading to the job aspirants getting stranded in Dubai. “Many found jobs on their own in Dubai to survive. The victims soon approached the authorities including the Chief Minister’s Office with complaints. Ernakulam North police soon registered an FIR and arrested the accused,” said an officer. Police said that the accused were arrested when they were planning to escape to Delhi.

Sailors L Jhansipriya, 14, and V Vaishnavi, 15, made it to the Indian team for the world championship after battling tough financial crisis. Both crafted sailing history after getting selected for one of the largest sailing championships in the world. Jhansipriya’s mother works in a hospital’s housekeeping team, Vaishnavi’s mother is a domestic helpThis is the first time that two girls from Telangana have been selected for a world championship in sub-juniors (U-16) category, which will be attended by 264 sailors from over 60 countries making it one of the most competitive regatta for youth in the world. While Jhansipriya’s mother works in a hospital’s housekeeping team, Vaishnavi’s mother is a domestic help. The championship will start from July 1, 2021Jhansipriya’s mother is a single parent who works as part of the housekeeping team at a private hospital in the city. She is excited and happy about her daughter going for her fourth international tour after the 2019 Oman Asians and the Atlantic Week in Portugal and Spain. Vaishnavi’s mother works as domestic help in Marredpally, and couldn’t believe that her daughter is India number 2 and will be carrying the Tricolor to Italy for a world championship. Both Jhansi and Vaishnavi, students of Udbhav School at Rasoolpura, joined sailing in 2018 and rapidly rose to the top of the Indian fleet. Lake Riva Del Garda is one of the largest lakes in Europe in the northern Italy, and provides challenging sailing conditions. Garda is host to all the largest Sailing Championships in the world, and despite being a lake simulates huge waves and is backed by sky-high cliffs. The championship will start from July 1, 2021. Speaking to TOI about the challenging weather conditions they might have to face in Italy, Jhansipriya said, “It is true that Garda is known for heavy weather conditions, but we are confident that we will do well. Our experience in the previous international competitions will be of help. We are also planning to go there at least a week prior to the championship to get used to the huge waves and the entire environment.” The duo said that they are both looking to move up the ladder to the Olympic and Asian games. “We plan to participate in the forthcoming Asian Trials to be held in Hyderabad in August,” said Vaishnavi, who is eagerly looking to migrate to the Lasers and the 29er under the watchful eyes of her coach. “Both girls are training hard, and I do hope that Covid related visa issues and quarantine issues do not spoil the party. Fingers crossed,” said Suheim Sheikh, coach and president of the Yacht Club of Hyderabad Foundation, a charitable sports organisation at Hussain Sagar that works only with marginalised children taking them to International levels of sailing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-girls-to-make-waves-at-global-regatta-in-italy/articleshow/82893693.cms||Moulika.KV

Kamat has also asked the government to ensure that Goa’s internet connectivity is improved so that students can appear for online entrance and aptitude tests. “I welcome the decision of the government to cancel SSC examination for this academic year. I urge the chief minister to continue consultations with educationists and take appropriate action on HSSC exams at the earliest,” said Kamat. The Congress party’s students wing, the NSUI, has demanded that the HSSC exams should be postponed until all students are vaccinated. “If the exams are held without vaccination of student community, it will lead to the third wave. With the health facility in a poor state, NSUI fears the health hazard and the threat to the lives of the young students,” said NSUI president Ahraz Mulla. Epidemiologists and modelling studies suggest that the third wave could hit Goa around September and affect children and youngsters who have not been inoculated. “It is important that a proper plan of action is prepared for the next academic year for all levels after seeking advice of experts. I strongly believe that decisions pertaining to education and academic career of students must always be taken in proper consultation with experts from the field of education,” said Kamat. The former chief minister has also urged the government to ensure that proper network connectivity is established in the state, especially at the centres where online entrance exams and other aptitude tests will be conducted. “Uninterrupted and consistent network connectivity will help students concentrate and answer the examinations and give their best performance,” said Kamat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/prepare-action-plan-for-new-academic-year-kamat/articleshow/82893743.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Fake adoption posts under cop scanner||Kolkata: The detective department has launched a probe into social media posts appealing for adoption of children orphaned during the pandemic. The probe was ordered by joint CP (crime), Murlidhar Sharma, after a Twitter user lodged a complaint in this regard and shared a contact number with him. Activist Sumita Dutta Basu lodged the complaint on May 20 through Twitter. She said that the adoption message had been circulating on social media for about a month even though it was illegal to adopt children in such a manner. “The message is about adopting a two-year old boy and a two-month-old girl whose parents have died due to #Covid-19. I know this type of adoption is illegal and might aid child-trafficking,” she wrote in her complaint, tagging the senior Kolkata Police officer. In another follow up tweet, she also shared one such number floated on social media. “The detective department is looking into the matter,” Sharma replied. Activists working on child rights and trafficking have expressed concerns over how social media has been flooded with citizens sharing the details of the children who have lost either both their parents or the only living parent to Covid-19 and pleading for their adoption. Activists have repeatedly warned that such posts are illegal under Section 80 and 81 of the Juvenile Justice (JJ) Act, 2015, which prohibits offering or receiving children outside the processes laid down under the Act as well as their sale and purchase. Such acts are punishable with maximum punishment up to five years in jail and/or Rs1 lakh fine. West Bengal Commission for Protection of Child Rights chairperson, Ananya Chakraborti, said that most of the news on orphans doing the rounds in the social media were fake but warned that any attempt to adopt a child without following the due process, even if the intention is good, is illegal and a criminal offence. “If a child is orphaned or his or her parents are in hospital and the child is too young to stay alone and there is no one to look after, cops have to be informed and they will in turn inform the child welfare committee that will decide where and with whom the child can stay. In case the child needs to be adopted, he or she will stay in a home till the adoption happens. For teenagers whose adoption is difficult in our society, foster homes are an option. But again, it has to be through Child Welfare Committee,” said Chakraborti. Bivas Chatterjee, special public prosecutor has already come out with a Bengali podcast to explain the Covid-related cyber crimes. “Such adoption messages are illegal. The committee has to be involved in such process,” he said. “When there is a child without a family, the state becomes the guardian. If an orphaned child is brought home without following the process under the JJ Act, the government will take his or her custody,” said child rights activist, Neena Nayak.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fake-adoption-posts-under-cop-scanner/articleshow/82890464.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolhapur||Kolhapur city shops running low on stocks of oil, grain & pulses||Kolhapur: Kolhapur city is expected to witness people rushing to the markets to buy essential supplies on Monday, as the strict restrictions, which were in place for eight days, are to be lifted. However, the retailers and wholesalers said they do not have adequate stock of foodgrain, pulses and cooking oil left in their shops. All essential shops were shut during the restrictions. Anticipating that the curbs may be extended, many people had bought the essentials in large quantities. But many are, however, facing a shortage of essentials like grain, pulses and cooking oils. Saurabh Salokhe, the owner of a mini-market in the Line Bazaar area, said, “We have no stock of foodgrain and pulses. The cooking oil prices had earlier skyrocketed. Therefore, many citizens did not buy oil in large quantities. There is some oil stock left with us. On Sundays, most of the wholesale markets in other places in Maharashtra remain shut. That is why we could not even place bulk orders.” The Laxmipuri market area is famous for wholesale trade of grain, pulses and spices. The traders here too have very limited stock left. Sadanand Korgaonkar, a grain and pulses trader, said, “Pulses arrive from the Marathwada region while grain is brought from outside the state. It will take at least one to two days to get the consignments for further distribution. Since many citizens have already bought the essentials in excess, they may not face a big problem.” The bakeries will also reopen on Monday. However, they do not have biscuits and bread left. A bakery owner said the local manufacturers of bread and snacks had stopped production due to the strict curbs. The supply of bread and biscuits will take time to normalise. The state government-enforced Covid restrictions will continue even as the strict curbs are relaxed. Accordingly, the essential shops will operate for four hours in the morning. The police administration has decided to enforce the restrictions strictly, especially in the Kolhapur city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-city-shops-running-low-on-stocks-of-oil-grain-pulses/articleshow/82886601.cms||---

The disease is caused by a mould found in soil and in decaying organic matter and affects mostly immune-compromised individuals, ones with poorly-controlled diabetes or those administered high doses of steroids, they said. Joint director of Indira Gandhi Institute of Cardiology (IGIC) A K Ashu said healthcare providers are inadvertently seeding mucorales, the virus which causes black fungus, in Covid patients. “Prolonged use of masks covering nose and mouth contributing to humidity and smoldering pathogens inside may cause this infection in people. Poorly and hardly ever replaced nasal catheters/prongs with adhesive plasters applied, oxygen humidifier and other hospital equipment and accessories also result in such infections,” he said. Dr Ashu prolonged and unwarranted use of high doses of steroids, blunderbuss of broad spectrum antibiotics and other immuno-modulators to curb cytokine storms or even without, are the reasons for opportunistic infections like mucormycosis. “The usual antifungal drugs like Voriconazole used in intensive care are effective against candidosis or aspergillosis, but not at all against mucormycosis (black fungus). Only polyenes are effective in treating black fungus,” he added. Paediatrician and viral disease expert Dr Arun Shah said black fungus affects the sinuses, eyes, brain and the lungs and can be life-threatening in diabetic or severely immune-compromised individuals, such as cancer patients or people with dialysis and chemotherapy. “It is usually triggered by the use of steroids, a standard care and a life-saving treatment for severe and critically ill Covid-19 patients. Though the steroids reduce inflammation in the lungs, they also reduce immunity and push up blood sugar levels in both diabetics and non-diabetic Covid patients. This drop in immunity along with high blood sugar due to steroids could be triggering these cases of black fungus,” he said. Dr Shah said one way to prevent the possibility of this deadly fungal infection is to ensure that during Covid treatment, steroids are being administered judiciously in the right dose and duration as per the guidelines. Steroids are not recommended in mild disease, but in moderate to severe cases only. Gynaecologist Dr Punam Raman said people are using steroids in rheumatoid arthritis, vascular collagen disorder, interstitial pneumonia, some varieties of glomerulonephritis and several allergic conditions of skin for years, but this black fungus (actually this fungus is not exactly black in colour but named so due to tissue necrosis caused by fungus) was hardly seen. This infection in Covid cases may be caused by several factors, but one of the important factors cited by medical researchers recently is the excessive use of zinc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/docs-blame-irrational-steroid-zinc-use-for-rising-black-fungus-cases/articleshow/82888759.cms||B K Mishra

Nearly 2.5 lakh people need to take the second dose of Covaxin and their date schedules are coming closer. The state government had only about 53,000 vaccines given by Centre, when the vaccine drive was totally halted. Subsequently, another one lakh doses were given to state. While the Centre is giving vaccine doses depending on the population for free to states for the people aged over 45 years, the state government is not clear if they can use the Covaxin doses they directly purchased from Bharat Biotech. Telangana purchased about 92,000 doses of Covaxin for vaccinating people in the age group of 18- 45. “There is no clarity if these doses are used for second doses for the people above 45 that can be reimbursed by the Centre, so we are waiting to take a decision,” said officials. Sources said that the state is condering a special drive for those needing the second dose of Covaxin. Meanwhile, the state government has asked the local authorities to quickly prepare the list of possible super spreaders like shop keepers, LPG/gas suppliers, drivers (auto/cab), street vendors, delivery boys (E commerce), postal, bank employees etc. It is expected that there will be more than 2 lakh such people in the entire state. Authorities say that state has about 5 lakh Covishield doses and very few people need to take their second dose in this month as the centre has increased interval between two doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/special-drive-for-2nd-covaxin-dose/articleshow/82893714.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

After four bodies were found on the coast at Dungri and Tithal on Saturday, three more bodies were found on Sunday morning. Police said that of the seven bodies, four bodies have been identified. “One is of Nagendra Kumar, the captain of the tugboat, and others could be the personnel of the tugboat or the barge,” said Dr Rajdeepsinh Zala, superintendent of Valsad police. The identification was done from the identity cards found on the bodies. “Once the family members reach and identify, this will be confirmed formally,” Zala said. He added that one more body will also be identified by Sunday night. “We have found some clues and we are waiting for a confirmation,” he said. For identifying two other bodies, police are planning to go for a DNA test. At around 6.30 am on Sunday, two bodies were found near the Sai Baba Temple at Tithal beach and at around 10am another body was found at Magod Dungri. Sources said that locals in Tithal had seen the bodies near the sea protection wall and alerted police. After four bodies, one of which was of Kumar, were found on Saturday, police intensified the patrolling along the coast. The barge and the tugboat had sunk off Mumbai’s coast in the wake of cyclone Tauktae. The barge was found on the seabed on Saturday evening by the Indian Navy’s catamaran hydrographic survey vessel – INS Makar, it was to carry out another mission to locate the tugboat’s wreck.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/bodies-found-on-valsad-coast-are-of-mumbai-vessels-cops/articleshow/82890523.cms||---

The epicentre of the earthquake could not be located as per the report issued by the Koyna irrigation department located at Koyananagar, where the equipment measuring earthquakes is placed. The region falls in the seismic zone of the high-intensity category. Frequent earthquakes of mild intensy are felt in the region. On May 8, two earthquakes of 2.9 and 3.0 magnitude had occurred around 8 km from Koyananagar with an interval of 2 minutes. This time the epicentre is 20 km away and that is why people in Koyananagar did not feel the tremors. But the equipment recorded the earthquake of 3.0 magnitude on the Richter Scale. The National Centre for Seismology, a Government of India undertaking, reported that latitude 17.36° and longitude - 73.84° for the Sunday’s earthquake. The comparison of the latitudes and longitudes for the earthquake that occurred on Sunday and the one on May 8 shows that the epicentre is in the same region on both days. Seismometer out of work In the south Maharashtra region, seismometers, the earthquake measuring devices, are placed at Koyna dam in Satara and Chandoli dam in Sangli district both along the Sahyadri’s of Western Ghats. The TOI on Sunday learnt that the seismometer at Chandoli dam has been defunct for several weeks. The earthquakes that occurred so far have had their epicentres between Koyna and Chandoli dams and so a functional seismometer is necessary at Chandoli dam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/tremors-felt-near-koyna-dam-in-satara/articleshow/82886651.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Sale of O2 continues at ten times the fixed cost in Hyderabad||HYDERABAD: While Hyderabad’s oxygen demand has largely stabilised over the past week – with tonnes being shipped in from other states – the cost of oxygen continues to be abnormally high across the city, say industry sources. A quick market survey by TOI revealed that dealers are still selling liquid oxygen for anywhere between Rs 150 and Rs 170 per cubic meter (CUM) — more than 10 times the cost fixed by the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) — while refilling plants are quoting Rs 1,500 and upwards for a jumbo cylinder. The normal cost of refilling these cylinders (46.7 litres) isn’t more than Rs 400 to Rs 600. “Earlier, we used to have 400 to 500 people queuing up for refill cylinders every day. That number has dropped to 100 (or less) now. Similarly, with hospitals, the requirement has reduced by about 40%. Yet, manufacturers are citing an artificial demand and charging exorbitant rates,” alleged an executive from a refilling plant in Jalpally attributing this to the high cost of refilling. Another refilling plant in Miyapur, that TOI called, said: “We are getting supplies from other states, hence, the cost is high. We cannot give it for anything less than Rs 1,500 (for a jumbo).” Faced with a shortfall of about 100 to 150 tonnes of oxygen last month, Telangana started sourcing it from other parts of the country – primarily Odisha, Chhattisgarh, and even Andhra Pradesh. “The additional supplies have certainly helped stablise the requirement. But since we are not being able to get refills at a lower cost, we aren’t being able to pass the benefit on to our customers,” said a trader of oxygen cylinders from Mehdipatnam claiming that some plants – including GST — are charging up to Rs 2,000 for a refill. “We only add transportation cost to this and an extra Rs 100, while lending the cylinders. But even that is very steep for some patients,” he said. Manufacturers, however, insist that they are sticking to the rulebook. “We are selling at Rs 15.22 per CUM and not more,” said ESK Sastry, general manager at Inox Air Products Ltd.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sale-of-o2-continues-at-10x-the-fixed-cost/articleshow/82893720.cms||Sudipta Sengupta

The Metro viaduct on Karve and Paud roads passes through the centre of the carriageway. The construction of the viaduct and the median has almost been completed on most of the stretch. TimesViewThis is a major area of concern when flyovers, medians and viaducts are built. The space below is misused not just to dump garbage and scrap, but also for illegal parking or recreation. There are instances when people set up shanties and it became difficult to evict them. The best way to prevent this is to include a plan of utilising such spaces and execute the same as soon as the infrastructure is ready.Abhay Joshi, a regular commuter on Karve Road, said, “While it is clear that the median has been constructed properly, a lot of garbage is being dumped inside it, which is alarming. This median should not become a garbage dumping spot. There is a need of proper maintenance. It is the tendency of people to throw garbage at vacant spots,” Joshi said. According to Aalok Deshmukh, besides the garbage, some unused material like traffic signal posts, pipes have also been lying along the median. “This space should not be utilized for storage as it may also lead to obstruction to the traffic flow. The dumping also leads to garbage burning,” he said. MahaMetro officials said they have initiated steps to fill the median with soil as the space could be utilized for plantation in later stages. Hemant Sonawane, general manager (public relations) at MahaMetro, said, “We have already started filling up the median with soil on the stretches where construction has been completed. We are also clearing the garbage on regular basis from the sites where Metro work is under way. The MahaMetro will coordinate with the Pune Municipal Corporation to keep the median clean.” Sources from the PMC said cleaning and sweeping was carried out on Karve and Paud roads on daily basis. Ajit Deshmukh, head of the PMC’s solid waste management department, said, “We will ask local sanitary staffers and sweepers to clean the spots. Local officials will be told to increase vigil at the spots to prevent dumping of garbage along the median. We appeal to the citizens to hand over garbage to the waste picking vans and not to throw it on road or any vacant places,” Deshmukh added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mahametro-to-fill-median-with-soil-to-stop-trash-dumping-along-metro-viaduct/articleshow/82892362.cms||---

The incident still haunts me even after two years,” he said.“I have started to train village youths to how to drive motor or mechanised boat, how to respond in case any technical issue arises while rescue is underway. The 2019 tragedy had occurred because shrubs got stuck in the motor of an overcrowded rescue boat — over 40 people on a boat with capacity of 24,” he added.Gurav caught the attention of authorities during the rescue operations in 2019 flood and since then is called ‘devdoot’ — messenger of God. The authorities claim that one motor boat has been provided to every village along the river that was affected by floods. Now, the zilla parishad has bought 14 new boats. Senior authorities have also asked Gurav to train the policemen to operate the boat. “By training the local youths we also gets to know whether the boat is working properly. So far we have found that motor of one boat is not working properly and have asked the Kerala-based manufacturer to repair it,” Gurav said.On Saturday, revenue and police officials visited the training site and apprised the youths about the twin challenge of Covid and flood during monsoon. The youths have been asked to get more volunteers on board to ensure speedy rescue in case of floods.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/youths-in-sangli-villages-being-trained-to-operate-boats/articleshow/82886682.cms||---

Earlier, two other trustees were nabbed on May 15. The arrested trustees include office-bearers. Although the FIR registered by cops on May 12 had named only president Dr Khalid Patel as accused, others too were held responsible for the mishap that claimed 18 lives on May 1. Besides Khalid, vice-president Faruk Ibrahim Patel, general secretary Zuber Patel, treasurer Salim Patel, Ahmed Ruwala, Faruk Abdullah Patel, Habib Patel, Mohammed Faruq Patel and Suhel Dalal have been made accused. Police said that the president alone cannot be held responsible for the incident as the entire board of trustees manages the trust. “We checked the details and records of the trust available with the charity commissioner and found that as per the rules all are responsible,” said deputy superintendent of police M P Bhojani. Later, all accused were presented before a local court that granted them conditional bail. Sparks in a ventilator had caused a fire in the ICU unit of the Covid building of the hospital on May 1. Sixteen Covid-infected patients from Bharuch, Vadodara and Surat and two trainee nurses had died of burn injuries and asphyxiation. The hospital authorities had shifted the treatment of Covid patients to the new building without any permission. The building did not have usage permission from the civic body, NOC of the fire department nor any fire-fighting equipment that could control the flames at primary stage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/nine-more-trustees-of-welfare-hospital-held/articleshow/82890623.cms||---

He had recovered from Covid last month. Anil Kakodkar, former AEC chief, told TOI, “Banerjee and I worked very closely. He worked in the area of materials and I in reactors. We had collaborated a lot. I am very sad as I have lost a good friend.”Kakodkar recalled that after Banerjee recovered from Covid, they had both attended conferences and interacted regularly. Banerjee was director of Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) from April 30, 2004 to May 19, 2010. He then became chairman of the AEC till 2012. Since his focus was on material science, his work had bearing on the May 1998 Pokhran nuclear weapons tests. In 1967, he obtained a BTech degree in metallurgical engineering from IIT Kharagpur, joined the BARC training school and then went on to be a part of the metallurgy division of BARC. He won the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar prize for science and technology in 1989, and the Padma Shri in 2005. Director of Nehru Science Centre Shivprasad Khened said Banerjee was a pillar of strength for the National Centre For Science Communicators, and supported the Nehru Science Centre in organising two recent mega conferences — a conference on recent trends in nuclear energy to commemorate the 80th birth anniversary of R Chidambaram, former Indian nuke chief, and a centenary tribute conference to Dr Vikram Sarabhai, the father of space programmes in India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/ex-atomic-energy-commission-chairman-srikumar-banerjee-dead-in-mumbai/articleshow/82892435.cms||Srinivas Laxman
---||Nashik||MSRTC generates revenue of Rs 3.2cr by transporting goods||Nashik: The Nashik division of Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) has generated a revenue of Rs 3.2 crore by transporting goods during the past one year ending May 21, divisional transport officer KS Patil informed on Sunday. The state transport utility last year in May got into transportation of goods, benefiting industries and other sectors. The service is now called Mahacargo.“The MSRTC has largest network of bus depots across the state along with huge fleet of buses. However, with the imposition of lockdown last year during March, the passenger transport service of the MSRTC was affected following which a decision to get into transportation of goods was taken,” an MSRTC official said. Accordingly, the MSRTC converted its old buses in to trucks by removing the benches and creating an opening in the back so that the goods could be loaded and unloaded easily.“It is a weather proof service that was offered to the citizens who were willing to use the same at very rationale price. The people definitely benefited from the same,” another MSRTC official said. The Nashik division currently has 49 trucks that are engaged in delivering of goods from Nashik to other parts of Maharashtra. These trucks carry anything from industrial goods to vegetable and fruits — only after pre-booking. With an average income of Rs 27 lakh per month, the Nashik division did the best business in the month of March 2021 when it earned an income of Rs 43.32 lakh. The second-best was in October with Rs 42.8 lakh of revenue. The trucks used by the MSRTC are maintained at their own depots on a regular basis. Besides the drivers are allowed to travel only a certain distance to ensure they are not over worked or over stressed.The trucks from Nashik division have conducted 4,147 trips in one year, covering over 7.42 lakh km.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/msrtc-generates-revenue-of-rs-3-2cr-by-transporting-goods/articleshow/82886773.cms||Abhilash Botekar

On Saturday alone, 1,409 challans were issued and as many as 939 vehicles seized. On Sunday, the figure stood at 819 challans issued and 501 vehicles seized. Similarly, as many as 540 persons were arrested on Saturday and 316 till 8 pm on Sunday for breaking Covid norms. A total of 665 persons were prosecuted in the weekend for not wearing masks. Kolkata traffic police carried out a special drive this weekend after it found that a considerable section of vehicle owners — mainly the two wheeler owners — were flouting the enhanced restriction norms and trying to take unfair advantage of the exemptions provided to those involved with emergency services. “We had already seized over 3000 vehicles till Friday but still found a section of citizens flouting the rules. As it was a weekend, we had expected vehicle count to be considerably less as banks were closed and some other emergency services worked with limited strength. But we found that an increasing number of people on the road had emergency service boards and stickers pasted on their vehicles —mostly two wheelers — claiming they were involved with Covid-19 and Cyclone Yaas emergency work. However, they could not produce required documents when asked for,” said an ACP in charge of two central Kolkata traffic guards. Police sources said that a section of two wheeler riders also openly flouted normal traffic rules in the hope that there would not be cops on the road. “Some did not wear masks and speeding was a major issue. Unlike the first lockdown, the vehicle count in pockets of the city — mainly the central business district, Park Street and around some major markets — have not seen much of a drop. These were areas which we concentrated during the drive,” said an officer. Cops also stopped almost every vehicle on the road and questioned them seeking reasons for coming out. Those who failed to come up with valid reasons were immediately arrested. According to cops, a couple on the EM Bypass roaming around on their bike said they were out looking for a shop to buy medicines. When cops asked them why they — both residents of Beliaghata — had come towards Tiljala when they could have searched the areas closer to Sealdah for medicines, the couple had no answer. They had reportedly pasted an emergency board on their bike. Another man was arrested after he was found making casual rounds on his bike making videos of empty streets along Park Street.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/amid-enhanced-curbs-cops-seize-over-1k-vehicles-in-weekend-raid/articleshow/82890602.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Many policemen contracted Covid infection while working on the frontline during the pandemic and are currently on medical leave. Besides, there are many others who are on leave because their immediate family members have tested positive, and they are busy in taking care of their kin. Hence, in order to deal with the shortage of manpower, the police had placed a demand for homeguards so that they could get some assistance in carrying out the arrangements. Commandant general of homeguards (Maharashtra) has therefore deployed 1,100 personnel for assistance of the Nashik police. It also includes 100 women personnel. “Deployment of homeguards is being carried out with regular police personnel at checkpoints that have been announced as part of Covid containment plan,” deputy commissioner of police Pournima Chaughule said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-dist-gets-1100-homeguards/articleshow/82886743.cms||---

But the Navy rescued us and we are on the way to Mumbai. Don’t worry anymore. I will explain everything when I reach home.” These were the words of Tiju Sebastian (31), one of the survivors from barge P305, when he phoned his family in Kochi after being rescued from the cyclone-ravaged Arabian Sea where he battled huge waves in pitch darkness for more than 10 hours to stay afloat. Tiju was a safety officer aboard P305. He left a Mumbai hospital and reached his Kochi home on Saturday noon, but is yet to recover from the trauma. Aleesha Swarna, Tiju’s wife, received the last message from him hours before the barge went adrift in the cyclone. When they found out that Tiju’s barge had sunk, they tried all possible ways to reach him, in vain. The family was in prayers until Tiju made the call. “He was so sure the barge would be safe as it was heavy and had eight anchors. But when they received reports that the anchors had given way one after the other, they felt like their countdown had begun. He clung onto the barge as it went adrift, hit a platform and started to sink. Though others were jumping off the ship, he didn't let go until he realised there was no other option. He jumped into the freezing waters and managed to stay afloat with his life-jacket. The waves swept him away and took him into the depths, but somehow he managed to surface again. He said he could see bodies of his friends floating around though saltwater had begun to burn his eyes,” said Tincy. Tiju told them that while floating in the sea he never thought he would see his family again. “He is physically stable now, but still in shock. He has to stay in quarantine as his Covid test result is yet to come,” Tincy said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-like-titanic-climax-says-p305-survivor-who-floated-for-10-hrs/articleshow/82893850.cms||Anantha Narayanan K

As per the orders, no vehicles coming from the Mumbai side will be allowed beyond Dwarka on the flyover. They will have to exit at Dwarka using the ramp and take the regular road to KK Wagh College. Similarly, the vehicles coming from Dhule, that take up the ramp for the existing flyover at KK Wagh College, will also not be allowed on the stretch till Dwarka. So, these vehicles will take the regular route off the flyover till Dwarka.The police have announced the diversion till July 4. The police along with NHAI has made adequate arrangements including the workforce and putting up signage at various places to ensure the motorists have a clear idea of the traffic restrictions. There are about 30 police personnel including four officers and more than 100 wardens from the NHAI, who would be guarding all diversion points, the crossroads in the city.The NHAI has been asked to ensure proper roads for the movement of the traffic, enough lighting arrangement to ensure clear visibility to motorists in the night, keeping two cranes at stand by each at Dwarka and at KK Wagh college points.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/traffic-diverted-due-to-work-of-connecting-2-flyovers/articleshow/82886817.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Lockdown extended till May 31, reopening will be gradual: Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal||NEW DELHI: Delhi will stay under lockdown for another week. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced on Sunday that if the number of Covid-19 cases and positivity rate continued to dip at the current pace, the unlock process would start gradually from May 31. All existing restrictions, including the suspension of Delhi Metro services and bar on weddings in public places, will stay till 5 am on May 31. “The battle is not over yet. Even now, more than 1,000 cases are emerging daily. The general opinion is that the lockdown should be extended for another week. If we are to lift the lockdown right now, then whatever we have gained after the struggle, hard work and sacrifice of one month might be lost,” Kejriwal said on Sunday. “Therefore, Delhi government has decided that the lockdown will be extended by a week,” he said, adding that the decision was taken after asking a lot of people as it was a collective effort of the citizens of Delhi. “It won't be wise to immediately unlock, so we will start unlocking certain processes from May 31. But right now, as per everyone’s response, the opinion of the people of Delhi, we are going to increase the lockdown by one week,” he said. The capital has been under lockdown since April 19 -- when it recorded 23,686 fresh Covid-19 cases with a positivity rate of 26.12% -- with even more stringent restrictions imposed from May 10. While last Sunday saw 6,456 new cases and a positivity rate of 10.4%, this Sunday saw 1,649 new cases with a positivity rate of 2.42%. “When the wave had emerged and the cases were rising rapidly, we did not know how long it would persist, nor did we know whether we would be able to gain the victory of this wave or anything else (sic) ,” Kejriwal said, adding that within a month, the government imposed a lockdown, and because of the discipline shown by Delhiites, the deadliest wave till date seemed to be waning. “I will not say that we have won the battle. There is still a lot left to be won. But now it seems that we are gaining control over the situation,” he said. “The levels have come down from 28,000 to 1,600. So, the speed of the coronavirus has declined rapidly in Delhi,” he said. Kejriwal said the shortage of medical oxygen had been a major challenge but everyone came together to resolve it. “Now, there is a problem regarding vaccines, we are facing a shortage,” he said, adding that he was hopeful that this problem would be resolved too. “Right now, it is our top priority to figure out as to how to vaccinate the 2.5 crore people of Delhi. We have made all the arrangements in Delhi so that we can vaccinate all our people within three months. But there is a paucity of vaccines all over the country,” he said. “It is being said that a third wave will emerge. We have to be completely prepared for the that. If all are vaccinated, then, probably, we can be protected from the third wave,” he said, adding that he was trying that maximum vaccines be administered by talking to everyone, including the central government and vaccine manufacturers. “It does not matter at what cost they are giving the vaccines to us, we are willing to spend from the budget of Delhi government,” he said. Kejriwal said all arrangements were being made to combat a possible third wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lockdown-extended-till-may-31-reopening-will-be-gradual-cm/articleshow/82890835.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The Union minister of education Ramesh Pokhriyal held a national-level consultation with government officials from all the states on Sunday to discuss conducting the class 12 exams and professional courses entrance exams. Various options regarding the methodology, process, duration, and timings of the exams were discussed. “Almost all states batted for holding exams but with precautions of vaccination for students and staff. In Telangana, we will go ahead without changing the existing pattern. The examination time will be reduced to 90 minutes. The possibility of conducting the exam from mid-July to September was discussed,” said Omar Jaleel, secretary, Telangana State Board of Intermediate Education who attended the meeting. All participants have been asked to submit their proposals in writing to the Union HRD ministry by May 25. Subsequently, the government of India will examine the suggestions received from various state governments and convey further information in this regard to the students by or before the first week of June 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-likely-to-go-ahead-with-inter-exams/articleshow/82903614.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Puja organisers slash budget to serve Covid patients in city||Kolkata: Clubs and associations that organise some of the most popular Durga Pujas in the city have responded to CM Mamata Banerjee’s call for action during the pandemic as they have slashed the puja budget and utilised the funds to take various initiatives to help Covid patients. The top clubs that have puja budgets in excess of Rs 50 lakh usually finalise their plans months before the festival and pay theme artists and decorators in advance. Last year too, amidst the first wave of the pandemic, the popular puja committees had gone ahead with the plan and set up theme pandals. But with the Calcutta High Court restraining people from going pandal-hopping, the turnout at the pandals was poor. Sensing that curbs could be even stricter this year with the pandemic infecting more people and claiming more lives in the second wave, the clubs have decided utilise the funds for social work instead of investing money in themes. Some have arranged oxygen support for the needy, others are providing free meals and medicines while others have arranged free telemedicine for Covid patients with the help of the doctors residing in their localities and willing to provide their service online. Many other clubs like Bosepukur Sitala Mandir, Barisha Club, Mudiali Club and Behala Nutan Sangha are keen to join in the efforts but are waiting for the members, who are down with Covid, to get well so that they can work on a bigger initiative. Jodhpur Park 95 Pally has set up a 50-bed safe home with free oxygen support facility. Ahiritola Jubak Brindra has bought five oxygen cylinders and is providing oxygen free to people experiencing breathing difficulty. Suruchi Sangha, too, is setting up an oxygen support facility. Members of Kashi Bose Lane Durga Puja Samity are converting a government school in north Kolkata to a safe home with an approval from the health department. Forum for Durgotsav, a platform representing some of the leading puja organisers in the city, have launched Covid awareness drives in localities, particularly in markets that have in recent times witnessed crowding. The organisation is also distributing masks and sanitizers. Encouraged by the actions of major clubs, even mid-budget and smaller clubs have joined the efforts in their own way with some organising an oxygen cylinder or oxygen concentrator to provide relief to those in need in their respective localities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/puja-organisers-slash-budget-to-serve-covid-patients-in-city/articleshow/82890671.cms||---

For almost a month, every police district in Jaipur has been witnessing a surge in such cases. In some cases, the vehicle thieves even stole cars parked outside houses. Senior officers of Jaipur police commissionerate have asked its DCPs to crackdown on such criminals. The most affected areas are Jhotwara, Murlipura, Tonk Phatak, Jagatpura, Ramganj, Bajaj Nagar and Haramda. These areas have witnessed a lot of cases when two-wheelers have been stolen. Mobile snatchers are also active during these hours when the public comes out to buy groceries, fruits and vegetables. “These incidents are being witnessed. We have made prompt arrests in several cases. Still, I have asked all the DCPs and police stations to be vigilant,” ACP (crime) Ajay Pal Lamba said. Jaipur police (east) has been witnessing a spurt in such cases and several criminals have been arrested. “We had arrested four persons and seized four bikes and seven mobile phones from possession of the gang members.

---||Trichy||Veggie prices go up as orders get cancelled, stocks run out||Trichy/Madurai: The sudden relaxation of lockdown coupled with panic buying by residents on the weekend pushed the vegetable prices up again in Trichy and Madurai. Assuming that Sunday will be complete lockdown, vegetable traders in Trichy city cancelled orders from Nilgiris and Karnataka. This has led to the shortage of vegetable supply in the markets.When the decision to relax weekend lockdown came on Saturday, most of the vegetable shops were already shut. Markets were crowded on Sunday and shortage of supply triggered price rise. “We could not ensure supply of vegetables from Karnataka and Nilgiris after the sudden decision on lockdown relaxation,” said N Kannadasan, wholesale vegetable seller at Gandhi market, Trichy. “The announcement on lockdown relaxation was sudden. Only a few farmers could send their produce from Nilgiris and Karnataka. The supply was insufficient considering the high demand, which led to the increase in price,” he said. Prices of vegetables such as carrots and beans, which are brought from other districts, almost doubled on Sunday. One kg of these vegetables was sold for Rs 120-Rs 130. Similarly, the price of other vegetables such as tomatoes, onions, shallots also went up. A kilogram of tomato, which was sold at Rs10 in Madurai, was sold at Rs 60 at the farmers’ market at Anna Nagar. Many had to conclude their purchase in minimum quantities owing to the exorbitant prices. R Anbalagan, a resident of Karumbalai, said that he went to the market to purchase vegetables required for the next 10 days and carried Rs Rs300. “But, I have purchased only onions and potatoes. The price of onion was increased from Rs 20/kg to Rs 70/kg,” he said.Apart from the local farms, most of the vegetables come from Nilgiris, Karnataka and Maharashtra. Vegetables such as carrots, beans and beetroot are brought from Nilgiris and cauliflower and onions come from Karnataka. There was a similar price rise two weeks ago when lockdown norms were relaxed on a Sunday on May 9. Minister for food and civil supplied S Sakkarapani had warned of severe action against traders who fleece customers exploiting the demand.While vegetables shops are not allowed during the weeklong lockdown from Monday, they would approach the district collector on selling vegetables through mobile shops in coordination with the district administration, Kannadasan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/veggie-prices-go-up-as-orders-get-cancelled-stocks-run-out/articleshow/82892471.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

As an alternative, people were using the Thennur RoB to reach Thennur, Sasthri road and Thillai Nagar which are dotted with hospitals. Recently, the civic body closed the approach road of Thennur RoB for reconstructing a culvert on Thennur high road. The Rettaivaikal culvert is being widened by the civic body under the smart cities mission. The simultaneous construction works without providing an alternative route is forcing frontline workers and vehicles carrying patients to hospitals take a 3-5km detour. “We are providing drinking water cans to hospitals and even MLA offices, but both the Maris theatre RoB and Thennur RoB are closed for load carriers. We could not reach our customers awaiting water on time,” said S Tamilselvan, a drinking water supplier in the city. Those unaware of the works have to take a detour at the last minute. Though residents and NGOs were urging the civic body to take up the civil work at night to complete the bridge renovation activity, the civic body has been reluctant. “We will complete the work in a month.

---||Kolkata||Bright spot in Covid season: Mangoes flood Kolkata markets||KOLKATA: There is a sweet surprise amidst the pandemic gloom. Mangoes have flooded the market from shelves to mobile vendors. The prices are easy on the pockets since the supply is abundant, say fruit vendors. There is more good news in the coming weeks when more varieties from Bengal, Bihar and UP will arrive. “It is going to be a good season for mango lovers. Several varieties are already available and in abundant quantity. Prices are affordable as the supply has been good,” said Shahid Ahmed Khan, joint secretary of the Calcutta Fruit Merchants’ Association. During the enhanced restrictions, vehicles carrying edibles are allowed to move freely. Traders in India’s biggest fruits market of Mechua say most of the varieties selling in the market — like Gulab Khas, Totapari, Rani and Langra — are from southern parts of the country. Himsagar grown in Bengal has just made an entry into the market few days ago. “The lorries loaded with mangoes had already started from southern states before the restrictions came into effect on Sunday. More mangoes are in transit as there is no restriction in movement of goods vehicles. Lots of mangoes have arrived in the city,” said Mullick Mohammad Ishaque, a fruit merchant in Mechua. While Himsagar is selling at Rs 35-Rs 40 kg, gulab khas is selling for Rs 50 per kg. “We are reducing the price if people are buying in bulk. Since the markets are open only for three hours and people don’t want to come everyday, many are buying 4-5 kgs at one go,” said Subir Pal, a fruit vendor in College Street market. Many vendors who cannot open their stalls due to restrictions have started selling mangoes in cycle vans. Mango lovers are getting the fruit delivered at their doorsteps. “There is a mobile vendor who comes every two days from whom we buy a few kgs every time. It is a good arrangement since we do not have to go to the crowded market and even he can earn his livelihood,” said Abhishek Saraf, a resident of Sir Hari Ram Goenka Street in Burrabazar. However, traders are worried about the cyclone warnings this week. “A lot of harvest gets wasted which is not good for the business,” said another wholesaler in Mechua.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bright-spot-in-cov-season-mangoes-flood-mkts/articleshow/82890789.cms||Zeeshan Javed

Now, the authorities have converted a private bus with berths into an oxygen bus, which will be available from Monday. As Thanjavur is reporting over 1,000 fresh cases per day, people with severe Covid-19 symptoms had to wait for beds at the hospitals. For such patients who have breathing difficulties, the district administration set up two vehicles equipped with oxygen concentrators two days ago. Each vehicle can provide oxygen support to the six patients until they are admitted to the wards. “We are arranging a private sleeper bus now. At present, patients are seated in the vehicles, but in the omnibus, they can lay down on the berths,” S Muthukumar, coordinator of volunteer teams, said. The vans were provided by Thamarai International School in the city. Two other vans with oxygen cylinders were stationed at the screening centres of Thanjavur Corporation at Manambuchavadi and the railway hospital. “The mobile oxygen support facilities were of great help to prevent mortalities. The vans can also act as oxygen-supported ambulances too,” Dr S Namasivayam, deputy director of health services told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/oxygen-bus-to-aid-patients-waiting-for-hosp-admission/articleshow/82892493.cms||---

The city corporation’s Twitter handle saw a minor activity on Sunday after seven months. With the city reporting more than 600 fresh positive cases a day, Trichy corporation has been keeping residents ill-informed about the occupancy status of Covid care centres. Neither awareness nor any resourceful information to keep the residents well-informed about the pandemic has been shared by the civic body. While 44 fever camps are said to be conducted daily by the local body here, their locations are not shared with the public. Even the corporation officials are not aware of fever camp locations.“Salem corporation is helping people under home isolation by providing helpline numbers to avail food. Thoothukudi corporation is sharing information about vaccination status, such measures will keep the people informed and help them to stay confident. Trichy corporation has no connection with the locals,” K Shyam Sundar, a resident of Thiruverumbur, said. As the public relations officer (PRO) post in the urban local body is vacant for five years now, it has not been able to connect with people and share information. With vegetable sales to be taken care of by the corporation with all shops shut for a week now, residents urged the civic body to activate the Twitter handle at least now to share information with the people who are indoors. “Since events were not happening, we did not activate our Twitter handle.

The order, issued by Haryana chief secretary Vijay Vardhan, will remain in force from May 24 to May 31 5am. However, some relaxations have been provided with immediate effect, including stand alone shops being allowed to open during the day. Punjab already has lockdown-like restrictions in the state till May 31. While restrictions on opening of malls continue, shops, other than stand alone ones, are allowed to operate from 7 am till noon in two groups of odd and even — shops with odd numbers on odd dates and shops with even numbers on even dates. Liquor vends, which come under the category of stand alone shops, will also be allowed to open during the non-curfew hours. However, the excise and taxation department has clarified that vends operating from markets shall have to follow the odd-even rule, those which are stand alone and away from market can open as per relaxations. Vends have also been given additional 19 days in the current financial year on the account of loss suffered during the lockdown period.  “We had made the provision in the excise policy for this year.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Panel asks NCERT to delete ‘chhokri’ word from textbook||JAIPUR: The state child commission took cognisance of an ‘improper’ word used in an NCERT Hindi textbook and has shot a letter to the council to omit the same. A poem in the ‘Rhimjhim 1’ textbook prescribed by NCERT contains the word ‘Chhokri’, which according to the child commission is improper and expressive of child labour. The poem shows a six-year-old girl carrying a fruit basket and she is being referred here as ‘Chhokri’. This word is considered as slang in some parts of the country and its use in the course books is very disgraceful, said the letter. The commission has asked NCERT to make the necessary correction and send a report within 15 days of receipt of the letter. The word ‘Chhokri’ is expressing child labour in an uncompassionate way in the poem “Aam Ki Tokri’. One can argue about its usage as a colloquial term referring a girl, but its usage is completely outrageous and objectionable in formal education system. The commission condemns the fact that this poem has been part of Hindi course book since 2006 and is abashed to see how this could go unnoticed by learned members of the council for so long!,” wrote Mahendra Pratap Singh, member secretary, Rajasthan commission for protection of child rights (RSCPCR) in his letter to NCERT. The commission has directed the concerned authorities to take corrective measure with immediate notice. The letter dated May 22 further said that the last two lines of the poem depict insensitivity and first-grade students reading this poem will not be able to gain a reformative perspective through this poem rather the first take away that they would gather is casualness and mockery towards such children who can be seen working in the neighbourhood. Elaborating more on the subject, Singh said, “As responsible adults we should avoid exposing our children to such immoral words and unhealthy emotions. Even if we wish to highlight the social harsh realities to them it should be done in softer way by inciting right kind of emotions in them. Our pedagogy is expected to include the material that helps school and teachers in inculcating high moral values and unfortunately this piece of work is terribly falling short on that.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/panel-asks-ncert-to-delete-chhokri-word-from-textbook/articleshow/82892573.cms||---

---||Delhi||Teachers, students strongly oppose UGC note on 40% online learning||New Delhi: A recent UGC note, calling for a blended mode of teaching with 40% online learning, has created a storm in the academic circle, with many stating that such a move could jeopardise the education system and lead to a situation where many students might have to opt out of higher education. Delhi University Teachers’ Association (DUTA) has come out strongly against the proposal. In a statement, it said: “It is extremely shocking that UGC has brought out a notification allowing higher education institutions (HIEs) to teach up to 40% of syllabus of each course (other than SWAYAM course) through the online mode and the remaining 60% in the offline mode. This un-academic and ill-timed recommendation will erode the autonomy of HIEs and teachers further.” It added that the move would ensure that a large number of students from underprivileged sections or rural areas with limited internet access and computer devices were denied access to quality education. Student group AISA has raised similar objections. National president of AISA, N Sai Balaji, said: “This is a very dangerous push towards online education and a blueprint for exit and exclusion. This new announcement is just another extension of the exclusionary New Education Policy (NEP) and will push out the students from marginalised sections with no access to computers, smartphones and internet connection from the sphere of higher education.” DUTA president Rajib Ray said UGC’s concept note sought to turn students into customers and used fancy clauses like “pick teachers and timings”, “frame your courses”, “design your degree”, “student centric”, and so on. “Such dubious and meaningless clauses mask the ulterior reality of the move towards dismantling public education in the country,” Ray alleged. He claimed that a clear objective behind these policies was to reduce the need to hire teachers. “This notification puts in immediate jeopardy the future of over 4,500 ad hoc teachers working in DU and will have disastrous consequences for the classroom experience for students. The teachers collective will resist this anti-student, anti-education move.” The UGC notification, while stating the proposal for blended learning, also issued a concept note and asked for feedback from stakeholders. Sanjay Batra, chemistry teacher at Sri Venkateswara College, said: “This is clearly one of the aspects of NEP that allows students to choose their source of online learning. What it will further do is that it will reduce the workload of teachers and many ad hoc teachers will miss out.” Ray said UGC and the ministry of education needed to focus on the current crisis and possible measures to bring relief. “Such notifications and NEP itself should be subjected to wider scrutiny and consultation and not be thrust upon educational institutions in this manner.” SP Aggarwal, principal of Ramanujan College, however, differed. He said: “This proposal is very viable. We can further develop the technology and make it easier for students. If students have issues with connectivity and infrastructure, we can provide them the necessary relief and make the whole new system feasible. Eventually, when ICTs become intensive, then this sort of teaching will become the norm.

Officials said they have noticed people getting bored during the pandemic situation as they have been working from home for months and most of them are willing to go back to their offices and work. “The idea is that this opportunity will help people — mostly the IT and ITES employees who have been working from home for a long time — to get some respite from the boredom by a little bit of outing close to their homes without any need to go out of the city and work in a serene environment. As an incentive, we are giving a 50% discount to bring their laptops along with their families and stay in the cottages,” said an official. Those, who have been working from home since last year, welcomed the initiative. “It’s a wonderful initiative. Many people are getting bored to stay confined indoors for such a long time. This will help them in getting over the boredom for a few days,” said Kaustav Dey, an IT executive and resident of New Town.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hidco-help-to-beat-wfh-blues/articleshow/82890838.cms||Suman Chakraborti

His home is shelter for nearly 40 dogs, two peacocks, one eagle and four monkeys which were rescued by him over the last two years. They either met with road accidents or were subjected to cruelty in residential areas.Many of the animals may not survive if let loose because of their injuries. Some of them are permanently handicapped and requires someone to take care of them. He has been selflessly taking care of these animals by meeting their food requirement until they die.“Monkeys eat fruits and vegetables, but given the high cost, I could not purchase them fresh on Sunday.” He goes to market at about 10am to collect leftover and damaged fruits at cheaper cost which has been their feed over the last few weeks. Without market and sales for the next one week, he will have to look for alternative ways to feed the animals.“Poultry waste especially the heads and legs are essential for the recuperation of dogs which I used to get as shops were open till 10am. Now that all the shops will be closed for a week I am unlikely to get the waste to feed the dogs,” he said.Ramakrishnan said the condition of the stray animals will be even more pathetic as food waste is unlikely to be found in the streets as people would not venture out of their homes for a week.He asked the administration to take necessary steps to ensure that the animals don’t die due to starvation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/activist-worried-over-finding-feed-for-rescued-animals-in-coming-days/articleshow/82892526.cms||---

Not just the cases, tests and recoveries but even the positivity rate (PR) in both plains and hills has decreased in Uttarakhand in the last one week. The state reported 11.01% PR between May 16 to 22, compared to 22.66% in the week prior to that. “The deaths, however, remained the most disturbing and worrisome part as we have reported the highest ever — 1111 weekly deaths last week. This is the 2nd straight week when we had 1000-plus deaths per week,” added Nautiyal. Secretary (health) Amit Negi said that the state is doing one of the highest number of tests across the country per lakh population. “Our PR has declined and this shows that the efforts that are being put in are working,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/over-42-of-total-covid-cases-and-54-of-total-deaths-in-just-23-days-in-ukhand/articleshow/82886881.cms||Ishita Mishra

Kumar asked if the positivity rate had come down to 3.5 percent as of Saturday, why did the death toll not witness a sharp fall? He said that 6,684 Covid-19 fatalities in May in Delhi indicate total governance failure. He demanded that a monthly financial incentive of Rs 10,000 be given to every family till the situation is under control.

Two students had recevied the fellowship last year under the fellowship program. They are eligible to get a fellowship of Rs 70,000-Rs 80,000 per month for the next five years. Besides this, a research grant of Rs 2 lakh per year will be provided to each of the fellows for a period of 5 years.Rima Das, student from the civil engineering department who is one among the 11 students is working under a technology named Induced Partial Saturation (IPS) to improve earthquake liquefaction risk mitigation planning. “India being a highly seismic country with many areas at risk of liquefaction, this technology is expected to be working on economically sustainable methodologies for the mitigation of liquefaction effect,” said K Muthukkumaran, Rima Das’ guide and professor, department of civil engineering, NIT - Trichy.Speaking to TOI, director of NIT Trichy Mini Shaji Thomas said only PhD students from IITs, IISc and IISERs were eligible for the fellowship and she had sought inclusion of NITs also. “The union government however decided to include the top 25 institutions according to the NIRF ranking. We were inducted too under the scheme by virtue of being the only NIT to feature in the top 25 institutions in the NIRF ranking,” she said. “We followed a set of criteria and shortlisted 20 students and recommended their names out of which 13 managed to bag the fellowship,” she added. This is a very prestigious fellowship as the stipend is over Rs 70,000, seen as better than the post of an assistant professor. Therefore, the review is also rigorous, and students needs to show progress, she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/11-students-of-phd-in-nit-t-bag-pmrf-fellowships/articleshow/82892530.cms||---

---||Kolkata||City youths launch app to read O2 saturation, pulse rate||Kolkata: A smart phone app to get the readings of SpO2 (oxygen saturation) and pulse rate has been tested on 1,200 patients at state-run IPGMER for about two months after the ethical committee’s approval. The study found that the app has 98% accuracy in SpO2 reading and 96% accuracy in detecting pulse rate. Called CarePlix Vitals, the app uses artificial intelligence to remotely measure the oxygen saturation and pulse rate without any wearable device. The app uses the PPG (photoplethysmography), a non-invasive technology that uses light sources as a photo detector. While the pulse oximeter has infrared light sensors the CarePlix Vitals has the flashlight of the phone camera. Once the rear camera and flashlight are covered with a finger for about 40 seconds, the difference in light intensity is calculated from where the PPG graph is plotted and the oxygen saturation and pulse rate are derived from the graph. Developed by three Kolkata youths as a start-up initiative, the app has already been downloaded by more than 50,000 users. It was launched on the Google Play Store on Saturday. “All that one needs to do is download the app, place a finger on the smart phone’s rear camera and the flashlight for about 35 to 40 seconds and the SpO2 and pulse readings will be displayed on the phone,” said Subhabrata Paul of the start up, CareNow Healthcare. “The measurement of oxygen saturation and pulse using the app on patients is well-correlated with the reading by the conventional pulse oximeter,” said Soutrik Kumar of the ENT department at IPGMER. Paul, along with tech enthusiast brothers Monosij and Abhisek Sengputa, has been working on the app for several months. “We started working on the app prior to the pandemic. We are happy that we could launch it at a time when people are scrambling for pulse oximeters. We are thankful to Swaroop Anand, Pathikrit Sanyal and Ankit Saha from CareNow Health for their support,” said Manosij Sengupta. While Manosij and Subhabrata worked in the app from Kolkata the duo would regularly coordinate with Abhishek, who is currently based in Chicago, though online meets. Initially launched on Apple play store as Google was taking time to verify the product, the app ranked second only after Arogya Setu on the Google play store on Sunday hours after its launch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-youths-launch-app-to-read-o2-saturation-pulse-rate/articleshow/82890858.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Officials said the approaches of both ends of the bridge have subsided a bit. “The test is being done to assess the soil properties and how it has been filled up so that soil grouting could be done accordingly to stop the layer from receding further,” said an official. Two lanes of the bridge have been closed for the work but traffic is not much affected due to the ongoing restrictions that will continue till May 30. Earlier last year, KMDA had conducted a load test of the bridge. The bridge’s expansion joints were repaired in 2018. KMDA is also scheduled to start repairing the single span of the EM Bypass-bound flank of Ultadanga flyover from next week. The span had developed some cracks as the Bypass-bound flank was remained closed for about three months in 2019 when KMDA had taken up urgent repairs. Some work is still left to be done on the said span, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/soil-test-on-dhakuria-bridge/articleshow/82890873.cms||Suman Chakraborti

On Sunday, with the addition of 726 previous deaths (those that occurred earlier in the month) along with 594 recorded over the last 48 hours, took May’s mortality numbers to 19,807. The state’s cumulative death toll has now touched 88,620. Although cases have been declining steadily, the state continues to see between 500-700 deaths daily. State officials are expecting the high death toll to continue for weeks since there is a lag in mortalities after a peak in cases. On Sunday, Maharashtra reported 26,672 new Covid positive cases, the fourth day in a row when the state saw below 30,000 cases. The state’s caseload has now increased to 55.79 lakh. Mumbai, however, saw a marginal rise in cases and the daily positivity rate. On Sunday, the city recorded 1,427 new cases, a jump from 1,283 cases recorded on Saturday, pushing the case tally to 6,96,910. A total of 49 deaths were reported in the city on Sunday, taking the overall toll to 14,565. On the other hand, the state’s active cases dropped to 3,48,395, while that of the city came down to 28,284.

Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer said that a drop in testing usually pushes up the positivity rate. A taskforce member expressed concern that the city has plateaued at 1,400-1,500 cases and hasn’t managed to reduce cases further. CM Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday interacted with over 6,300 paediatricians to discuss preparations for the third wave. “Though the state has managed to control the cases, Covid threat still exists,” he said. While the Mumbai Metropolitan Region recorded 87 fatalities, Pune rural recorded 84 deaths, its highest on Sunday.

Taiyab, one of the six recipients from Jamia, is associated with Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Basic Sciences and her research focuses on cancer suppressant drugs. “The pandemic is the reason why I realised that research is extremely important, especially since we are researching the virus. We must believe that what we do eventually helps the society,” she said. While it was difficult to research during the lockdown, she pointed out that the family’s support was important. “With the support of my parents and husband, I managed to get the prestigious fellowship. The fact that five of the six fellows from Jamia are women will encourage more girls to come forward in the research space.” Jamia Millia Islamia has stated that six of its research scholars have been awarded PMRF under the Lateral Entry Scheme of the December 2020 drive. Vice-chancellor Najma Akhtar personally reached out to the scholars and congratulated them. “Jamia stands for excellence and strives hard to provide its students every possible support to achieve great heights,” Akhtar said. The fact that five of them are girls shows how well women are doing in research, she added. Momina, a research scholar from the civil engineering department, said, “This fellowship requires a lot of hardwork. Despite the pandemic, I managed to cross the 80% score. I also managed to secure a number of publications.” She added that “five women students from Jamia getting the fellowship is a welcome step and would encourage other girls to come forward”. The other three scholars are Fozia Tabasum of civil engineering, Azra Malik of electrical engineering and Ashi Saif of Center for Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation Sciences. In the May 2020 drive, two women researchers, Marya Khan and Abgeena Shabir from Centre for Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, got the fellowship. The VC also appreciated the efforts of PMRF-JMI coordinator Abdul Quaiyum Ansari. Each of the six researchers will get a monthly fellowship of Rs 70,000 for the first two years, Rs 75,000 in the third year and Rs 80,000 in the fourth and fifth years, Ansari said. They will also get an annual research grant of Rs 2 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/five-of-six-jamia-scholars-awarded-pm-research-fellowship-are-women/articleshow/82890882.cms||---

On Sunday, with the addition of 726 previous deaths (those that occurred earlier in the month) along with 594 recorded over the last 48 hours, took May’s mortality numbers to 19,807. The state’s cumulative death toll has now touched 88,620. Although cases have been declining steadily, the state continues to see between 500-700 deaths daily. State officials are expecting the high death toll to continue for weeks since there is a lag in mortalities after a peak in cases. On Sunday, Maharashtra reported 26,672 new Covid positive cases, the fourth day in a row when the state saw below 30,000 cases. The state’s caseload has now increased to 55.79 lakh. Mumbai, however, saw a marginal rise in cases and the daily positivity rate. On Sunday, the city recorded 1,427 new cases, a jump from 1,283 cases recorded on Saturday, pushing the case tally to 6,96,910.

---||Surat||Gujarat: BJP MLA draws flak for injecting remdesivir in Covid patient’s drip||SURAT: BJP legislator from Kamrej V D Zalavadiya has landed in yet another controversy after a video surfaced on Sunday showing him doubling up as a health worker at a Covid-19 care centre in Sarthana area which he is operating along with his supporters. Zalavadiya faced a barrage of criticism over social media and political circles after a video went viral on Sunday showing him filling a syringe with remdesivir injection before transferring it to a drip bottle, to be administered to a Covid-19 patient. Zalavadiya did it allegedly on May 17 in presence of a nurse and doctor, who are heard commenting and laughing in the video. #Surat BJP legislator from #Kamrej #VDZalavadiya doubles up as a health worker at a #Covid19 care centre in… https://t.co/qxboGr18SS— TOI Surat (@TOISurat) 1621823680000Criticizing Zalavadiya for his act of carelessness, Congress spokesperson Jayrajsinh Parmar said, “State health minister Nitin Patel should get inspiration from Zalavadiya, who has studied up to Class V, and open a centre to train BJP MLAs and workers in administering injections and dressing wounds. This would also address the issue of acute shortage of medical staff in state hospitals.” Zalavadiya, however, said that he did not administer the dose to any patient and apologized for his act. “If I did anything wrong, I apologize but I was rendering service to the people with intention of treatment,” he told reporters. Talking to TOI, he said, “I was not doing anything wrong and I did not want to create any controversy. I was merely serving the patient. I have been running the Covid centre to serve people for 40 days now and treated more than 200 patients and sent them home. I did not give the injection directly to the patient. I injected the medicine in the drip bottle.” He refused to take more questions and disconnected the call. Zalavadiya and controversy aren’t strangers with the MLA landing in many a soup. In February 2018, his son Sharad was booked twice and again in August 2019 for allegedly issuing threats to separate individuals over political and business disputes. In November 2020, another video of Zalavadiya went viral in which he was seen flouting Covid-19 guidelines while celebrating his granddaughter’s birthday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/bjp-mla-draws-flak-for-injecting-remdesivir-in-covid-patients-drip/articleshow/82890916.cms||---
---||Delhi||Noida to form four O2 supply chains||Noida: Noida has devised a ‘4x4 oxygen security strategy’ to be prepared for any further onslaughts of the pandemic. The strategy, which the city conceived following a meeting with experts and other stakeholders, splits the oxygen supply chain into four – one each for big Covid hospitals, smaller hospitals, CHCs and PHCs, Covid care centres and isolation centres operated by RWAs, and home isolation patients. The city has started working on the strategy and will increase oxygen availability within a month, said officials. Several corporates have, meanwhile, come forward to set up oxygen plants or help with refilling of liquid medical oxygen (LMO) plants. “We realised that last month, we struggled to arrange for oxygen on an urgent basis when the cases surged. To prevent such situations in the future, we will work strategically so that there is sufficient availability at all levels, from tertiary care specialised hospitals to home isolation cases,” said nodal officer for Covid response in Gautam Budh Nagar, Narendra Bhooshan. At the bigger tertiary care hospitals, the administration has asked the private centres to try to install oxygen plants or have LMO reserve tanks. Additionally, the tertiary care centres will have to keep sufficient oxygen cylinders and concentrators. Officials are also trying to install at least seven Pressure Swing Adsorption oxygen plants in the district. Using this technology, atmospheric oxygen is absorbed, the components are separated and further converted into usable oxygen gas. The district has already tied up with IIT Kanpur and three other corporate groups for setting up these plants. “While we have already confirmed setting up PSA plants with three groups and we are in talks with some others too,” added Bhooshan. The second level of care is at smaller hospitals with less than 100 beds, community health centres (CHCs) and primary health centres (PHCs). Officials said along with the bed capacity, the oxygen availability will also be increased. At a 30-bed CHC, concentrators and at least 60 cylinders will be made available. The officials said some CHCs may also be able to set up smaller PSA plants. The third level is that of Covid care and isolation centres set up by RWAs. These will be strengthened with cylinders and concentrators. Efforts will also be made to ensure that all such centres are tied up with tertiary care centres. The last level is that of home isolation. For such patients, the authorities have started oxygen banks where people can get their cylinders refilled. More such banks will be added if demand rises.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/noida-to-form-four-o2-supply-chains/articleshow/82890930.cms||Snehil Sinha
---||Delhi||Bouquets, not brickbats: Policing the lockdown violators in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police on Sunday decided to deal with the lockdown violators quite differently. They refrained from challaning people for the violations for a day, and instead asked them to recite a pledge to obey rules and gave them flowers. Police commissioner S N Shrivastava also tweeted about the drive. “#COVIDPROSECUTION For a change, a non-coercive mode is adopted today. The emphasis is on educating violators and utilising them too in furthering awareness among the residents. Policemen are encouraged into adopting effective alternate means instead of challan @LtGovDelhi,” he wrote. The initiative was first adopted in southwest Delhi by DCP Ingit Pratap Singh and his team. During the day, the cops were seen greeting violators with roses. “On Sunday, lockdown violators were themselves sensitising others not to violate the lockdown in the interest of society. We gave them flowers and placards for awareness,” PRO Chinmoy Biswal said. Meanwhile, Delhi Police continued its crackdown on crooks duping people on the pretext of providing Covid-related help. A gang that cheated people by promising medicine for treatment of black fungus has been busted by the Shahdara police. To check criminals involved in black marketing of essential Covid drugs, a cheat falsely promising Amphotericin B for treatment of black fungus has been arrested, the Shahdara DCP said. “The team recovered two mobile phones used in the commission of the offence,” the DCP said. SHO Shivraj Singh Bisht had received a complaint from a woman informing that her brother-in-law was admitted to Sir Ganga Ram Hospital for treatment of black fungus. On May 21, the doctor prescribed a medicine named Lipsomal Amphoperecin B, which was not available in the market. She had contacted a number circulating on social media and WhatsApp and a man assured that he would provide her the prescribed medicine and demanded Rs 3,000 as advance. The money was transferred on his Paytm account but he neither sent her the required medicine nor returned the money. During investigation, the subscription detail of the mobile number was collected, screenshots of the transaction were analysed and intelligence was developed. Later, Prashant Sharma, a driver, was arrested from Ghaziabad. The cops are looking for his associates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bouquets-not-brickbats-policing-the-violators/articleshow/82890948.cms||---
---||Kolkata||KP Hospital to open as 300-bed modern Covid facility today||KOLKATA: Kolkata Police Hospital, which is a Grade-I heritage structure, will be inaugurated on Monday as a 300-bed modern Covid hospital. For the last few months, Kolkata Police authority carried out restoration work of this grand red-brick building at the heart of Bhowanipore. More than a century-old hospital has been catering multi-specialty health services to Kolkata Police, West Bengal Police and other allied forces such as CRPF, EFR and Fire Service Department since 1905. The Kolkata Police has decided to earmark 110 beds for the general public. Of the rest, 150 general beds will now be reserved for policemen and 40 HDU beds will be used for all critical patients admitted. An oxygen plant is being set up to meet the needs of the HDU. All beds will also come attached with B-type oxygen. In addition, the 50-bed safe home set up for cops at the facility will continue to function. Patients are set to be admitted from this week itself, according to an officer. The hospital exemplifies the perfect unison of public and private partnership. The city-based Bandhan Konnagar, part of Bandhan Group that established the first private sector bank in Kolkata in 50 years, has joined hands with Kolkata Police to convert the police hospital into a Covid hospital. It will be managed by Medica Group. The Police hospital was acting as a satellite unit of SSKM Hospital. After being an independent hospital, there will be better utilization of its doctors and nurses. Kolkata Police, because of the high exposure to mass contact, has a large number of Covid infected personnel. The ball started rolling for its conversion into a Covid facility after chief minister Mamata Banerjee visited the hospital on Wednesday. “We have shifted all patients to other hospitals. Since we work as a satellite unit of SSKM Hospital, we have the necessary doctors and nurses at our disposal. We plan to admit cops and general patients as early as next week,” an officer from the welfare cell that is in charge of executing the project, said on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kp-hospital-to-open-as-300-bed-modern-covid-facility-today/articleshow/82890883.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

An official spokesperson described the programme as an important step in bringing much-needed medical care to people who need it the most, when they need it the most. The pilot project will begin in Karnal with a full roll-out across many districts to follow in the coming weeks. “Sanjeevani Pariyojana” will extend medical care to rural areas, where awareness of the second wave of the virus and ways to treat it remains low. With the right processes and care, officials believe home convalescence is possible for over 90% of patients. The “Sanjeevani Pariyojana” initiative, which is being supported by Deloitte, is expected to transform healthcare services.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/haryana-to-supervise-patient-home-care/articleshow/82893869.cms||---

A spokesperson for ONGC told TOI, “Two of the bodies found at Valsad have been identified as that of the captain and a crew member of the tugboat Varaprada, that sank with 13 aboard off Satpati Port, Palghar. Till Sunday, we have received information about the bodies of the tugboat’s captain N Kumar and crew member Umed Singh.” Till Sunday evening, Mumbai police had registered 75 bodies of barge P-305’s crew and 45 were handed over to families. “For the unidentified bodies, we are collecting DNA samples to match with relatives. Six to seven families went to identify some bodies but could not,” said an officer. The police are collecting blood samples for DNA testing. Asked if persons or companies concerned have been issued summons in connection with a case registered against P-305’s captain Rakesh Ballav at the Yellow Gate police station, DCP Chaitanya S said, “It's an ongoing investigation. I will have to check it with the police station.” A Yellow Gate police team that went to Gujarat returned late on Sunday. Two of Varaprada’s crew members, chief engineer Francis Simon (51) and Sahebsapan Bhutia (23), were saved by INS Kolkata while the warship was on its way to rescue the crew of P-305. Police are recording statements of those rescued from the accommodation barge. The ONGC official said 44 rescued ONGC employees have been kept in quarantine at a hotel in Mumbai and 139 employees of Afcons and subcontractors have been kept in a building owned by them in Navi Mumbai. ONGC will hold a meeting to decide on whether salvages of the wrecked barge and the tugboat should be carried out.

Seventeen firms will be supplying oxygen to Karnataka, so its allocation will increase from 1,015 to 1,200MT. “Before issuing the order directly to companies, the Centre should have assessed the situation.

The doctors also submitted a memorandum to the Prime Minister through the district collector to take action against the MLA for denouncing the work of corona warriors. The association state that if the MLA does not apologise then they will go on strike. Similarly, many other associations of Ajmer condemned the act of Anita and demanded the state government to take action under pandemic act. Bhadel on Saturday barged into the hall of doctors and warned senior doctors of JLN Hospital and alleged that they were responsible for the deaths of Covid patients at JLN hospital. As the news broke out, there was massive protest against doctors and staff as well in the city. Dr Shyam Bhutra, president and Dr Hemeshwar, secretary of RMCYA , said that they are working from last the two years to save patients, but somehow if a patient dies that does not mean they are not treating them well. Resident doctors said that they try to save every patient, but an MLA does not have the right to abuse them. They alleged that she used derogatory language against professors and doctors. Local Congress leaders also leapt at the opportunity and slammed the BJP for remaining silent over their MLA’s ‘inappropriate behaviour’. They alleged that Bhadel never came out to help people during the pandemic and now she was playing politics over the deaths of patients. Meanwhile, MLA Bhadel said she will not apologise as she has done nothing wrong .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ajmer/ajmer-medics-want-apology-from-mla-bhadel-for-insulting-them/articleshow/82892624.cms||---

NCP general Secretary Sanjay Barde said the chief minister is more worried about the economy rather than the lives of Goans and demanded a Covid-19 relief package for the state. “Many Goans have lost lives in Covid-19 crisis due to the mismanagement of the government. Instead of reaching out to the families who have lost their near and dear ones, the ministers are squabbling among themselves,” Barde said, adding that a minister in Bardez has been making statements in the media against his own government clearly indicating that all is not well within the government. “Chief minister Pramod Sawant is not taking his own cabinet colleagues into confidence while taking decisions. If the minister from Bardez who has helped in forming this government is being sidelined then there is something seriously wrong in the state,” Barde said.  “The government delayed in imposing a lockdown at least by two months and that is why so many Goans have lost their lives to Covid. The CM was more interested in tourism rather than protecting the lives of the Goans,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/governor-must-dismiss-govt-for-mishandling-covid-crisis-ncp/articleshow/82893871.cms||---

But party leaders in the state urged me to continue in the post for strengthening the UDF. That was the reason why I did not resign,” he said. It was clear that he was disappointed at the manner in which he was kept in the dark on the party high command’s decision to replace him with V D Satheesan. “AICC leader Mallikarjuna Kharge called me on Saturday morning and informed that the party high command has decided to appoint a new opposition leader,” Chennithala said. However, he added that he is not dejected and that he is totally satisfied with his performance as the opposition leader. “I have tried to do my maximum as the opposition leader and the people of the state are aware of it. I do not need the certificate of Pinarayi Vijayan. I will continue my fight against his government,” he said. He assured all support for opposition leader-designate Satheesan. UDF and Congress are going through one of their worst phases and hence, Satheesan has a massive responsibility on his shoulders, he said, adding: “We would provide all support to him to strengthen UDF and also the party.” Meanwhile, Satheesan reached the state capital on Sunday morning and visited several senior party leaders. He first called on AICC general secretary K C Venugopal at his residence. “It is the time to put an end to groupism and to work for the party. It is time to rejuvenate the party and hence, the party needs a total revamp,” said Venugopal. Later, Satheesan went to the headquarters of Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) and met KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran. Satheesan also met former KPCC president V M Sudheeran, who pointed out that factionalism has spoiled the party and he is hopeful that Satheesan will perform “beyond groups” and discharge his duties ably. Satheesan also met former KPCC president Thennala BalakrishnaPillai, UDF convener M M Hassan and former chief minister Oommen Chandy. Satheesan will be meeting Chennithala only on Monday as he was in his home constituency Haripad on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/chennithala-upset-over-unceremonious-exit/articleshow/82888952.cms||---

Further, plasma and blood donors who had ventured out to donate blood for needy patients and had necessary passes were slapped challans. In one such incident, a blood donor, Gautham C, who was returning home after donating blood at Osmania General Hospital, was fined Rs 1,000 for ‘disobedience of orders in lockdown S 51(b)’ of DM Act, as per the challan copy. This was done despite the donor showing proof of blood donation. Citing the problems faced by doctors, Dr Ashish Chauhan tweeted on Saturday, “Today medical doctors and health related vehicles were tremendously harassed. The Senior most police officer at Shaikpet gave answers like we don’t care if you are Senior Anaesthetist” on your way to surgery.” While many healthcare professionals and pharmacists reached their workplaces late, pharmacists in Nalgonda and Adilabad decided to stop operating after 10 am citing police high-handedness. “Day before yesterday, there were a lot of issues faced by medical shop workers and distributors as some were stopped and even beaten up after showing ID cards. So we kept the shops closed post 10 am on Saturday. The issue was resolved on Sunday after the district police called us. We have rolled back our decision after closing shops for two days,” said Venkatpati S, president, District Chemists and Druggists Association. While distributors in Hyderabad too faced some issues, medical shops were functioning with delays and less staff. Others faced problems in obtaining the mandatory passes to operate during lockdown hours. “sir, we are pharma and medical supplies agency in Hyderabad and from last 2 days we are trying for Epass and every time we apply it’s getting rejected,” tweeted Praveen from the twitter handle @praveen5757 on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/med-shop-workers-docs-face-commuting-woes/articleshow/82890984.cms||Amrita Didyala

DGP M Mahendar Reddy held a review meeting with city commissioners on Saturday night after facing criticism about the excessive use of force during lockdown enforcement. After the review, the top cop instructed the police commissioners to “ensure seamless supply of essential services including food deliveries, while executing strict lockdown. Further, the three commissioners of police have been instructed to get in touch with all stakeholders and redress all grievances at the earliest for smooth supply of essential services, while tightening the lockdown enforcement.” As a result, food delivery was allowed along with other essential services but police continued to crack the whip against lockdown violators. Minister KT Rama Rao urged home minister Mahmood Ali and DGP to issue e-pass to the family of a thalassemia patient requiring blood transfusion in Pune after a family member brought to his notice the fact that the application for the pass has been rejected and the home minister said that he spoke to the DGP to address the issue. Some users complained about not being able to access e-pass portal but the DGP office clarified that it was temporarily under maintenance for new features update.

The move is set to impact 24,300 students. Meanwhile, the state hasn’t yet decided about the Class XII exams, and Sawant said a decision could be expected on Wednesday. Sawant’s announcement came after a high-level meeting chaired by Union defence minister Rajnath Singh. For science seats, a one-day examGoa, like other states, has now to write to the Union education ministry by May 25 about its plan for Class XII board exams, for which 19,200 students have registered. “We had asked the Goa Board to form a committee of officials from the board, education department, education experts and teachers and managements of private education institutions,” said Sawant. “Based on the consultations and the discussion at today’s meet, in the interest of everyone concerned, as we are going through the pandemic, we have decided that the Class X exam for 2021 stands cancelled.” Officials said that a marking scheme will be drawn this week by the Goa Board for promotion of Class X students to a higher class based on their internal marks. “Based on the assessment of internal marks, if a student is found failing in a couple of subjects, he or she will be Allowed to Keep Terms (ATKT),” Sawant said. To decide on the students who qualify for admissions to Class XI science stream seats and diploma programme seats, the Goa government and education department have decided to hold a one-day exam of three hours’ duration, consisting of objective-type questions, said the CM. “Students will be informed of the day of the exam well in advance, at least 15 days earlier. Tentatively, the test will be held July-end,” said Sawant. Around 350 ITI and private candidates appear for the Goa Board Class X exams every year. “For these students, once the Covid-19 situation is seen improving, the Goa Board will decide and will conduct either a one-day or three-day exam,” the CM said. On the Class XII exams, he said, “I know that Class XII students and their parents are also under strain, but JEE, NEET and other such national entrance exams are held for Class XII students. Following the meeting with Central government officials, a decision on such national exams will be taken soon. Once the decision is made, we will immediately inform Class XII students about it.” Sawant said the decision to cancel the Class X exam will relieve students, parents and teachers of the stress they have endured over the past few weeks. “I am aware that parents as well as students are under stress over the past many days,” he said. “Students, parents and teachers have been calling up Goa Board, the education department and also me as education minister to constantly inquire about how and when the exams will be held. I know all of you have gone through this tension.” On April 21, the CM had announced that the Class X and XII board exams have been deferred. The Class XII exams were to be held from April 24 and the Class X from May 13.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-cancels-class-x-exams-decision-on-class-xii-by-wed/articleshow/82892635.cms||---
---||Delhi||Vaccinate students before boards, says Delhi minister Manish Sisodia||NEW DELHI: Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said on Sunday that he was not in favour of conducting the Class XII board examinations unless the students appearing for it were vaccinated. The Centre should approach Pfizer as it has already developed vaccines for 12+ children and prioritise vaccinating 1.4 crore students who are to appear in the exams, the education minister suggested at a national-level meeting hosted by the Union education ministry on conducting the board exams. If vaccines are provided, Delhi government will vaccinate all such students in the city in two days. “Only after procuring vaccines and vaccinating all students, should the central government think about conducting any kind of examination,” he said. Exams should be cancelled if that cannot happen, Sisodia suggested. Reiterating his “no-exam policy”, the minister said students could be awarded grades on the basis of their unit tests, pre-board and practical exams, similar to the Class X promotional policy, and should get the choice to retake exams for improvement. While “the consensus of the entire education community is that the conducting exams is important”, it is not needed that students and teachers are put at risk, he said. “As a guardian of the state, Delhi government is taking a stand to keep the safety and security of our students as the first and most important priority. Until we can vaccinate our students, we should not even think of conducting the 12th board exams,” he said at a press conference. The Centre needs to take a decision on the exams, “considering it has caused enough tension among our student and teacher communities”, the education minister pointed out. “Conducting board exams in these unprecedented times would be a big mistake on behalf of the central government. It would render our children and teachers even more vulnerable.” Conducting a board exam when the world is preparing for the third Covid-19 wave and India is recording 2.5 lakh daily cases “is irresponsible”, he said. “Our students, parents and teachers will not be in a good mental state to sit for any kind of exams.” Sisodia pointed out that 95% of the Class XII students were approximately 17.5 years old and the Centre should find out from health experts if vaccines for 18+ age group could be administered to these students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/vax-students-before-boards-says-sisodia/articleshow/82891054.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kerala: ‘Ready to conduct CBSE exams if Centre decides’||KOCHI: The state government has informed the Centre that it is ready to provide all measures for the smooth and safe conduct of the CBSE Class XII board examinations, if the central education ministry decides to proceed with the exams. The state has also assured support to conduct entrance examinations like NEET or JEE to various professional courses adhering to Covid-19 protocols, if the Centre decides to conduct them. The state’s stand was conveyed to the Centre during the high-level virtual meeting convened by the defence minister Rajnath Singh and education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal on Sunday. Representing the state, education minister V Sivankutty and director of general education K Jeevan Babu, who is also the examination commissioner, told the Centre that the opinion regarding the conduct of the exam is divided in the state as majority of parents and students want the exams to be held while others oppose it citing the safety of both students and teachers amid the pandemic. Meanwhile, parents and teachers in the state are anxious to know the fate of students as the final decision on the conduct of the exam is yet to be announced. While a few states like Maharashtra and Delhi demanded cancellation of CBSE Class XII exams, most other states, the Centre and the CBSE are exploring methods of conducting the exams. The final decision will be taken by the Prime Minister. A section of students has been campaigning for cancellation of exams on social media tagging their posts with #cancelboardexams and #cancelallboardexams. K A Francis, general secretary of Confederation of Kerala Sahodaya Complexes, said that they were awaiting the Centre’s decision. “Parents and students are worried about the uncertainty . CBSE can conduct the exams in such a way that the marks are evaluated based on a centralized objective type online exam and the offline exams that could be held at school level,” he said. Meanwhile, the state also suggested before the Centre about Covid vaccination of all school students at the earliest. Sivankutty also said measures were taken to complete the evaluation of Class X and XII public examinations, held by the state in April, by June end and announce results by July first week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ready-to-conduct-cbse-exams-if-centre-decides/articleshow/82888867.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi govt sanctions one-time aid of Rs 5,000 to 1.5 lakh auto, taxi drivers||NEW DELHI: From Monday evening, drivers and owners of para-transit vehicles like auto rickshaws, taxis, e-rickshaws etc., will start receiving a one-time financial assistance of Rs 5,000 from Delhi government directly in their bank accounts, transport minister Kailash Gahlot said on Sunday. On May 4, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had announced financial aid for para-transit drivers, apart from two month’s free ration for all ration card holders. The AAP government had provided similar financial aid to drivers during the lockdown last year and Kejriwal said they are facing a tough time as their homes are run on daily earnings. Delhi Cabinet had approved the financial assistance of Rs 5,000 to drivers of para-transit vehicles on May 14. Gahlot tweeted on Sunday that under the leadership of Kejriwal, the transport department has cleared 1,55,301 cases for financial assistance and from Monday evening, these drivers and owners will start getting the aid, which has been transferred to their Aadhaar-linked bank accounts. The government had earlier said that a total Rs 78 crore was given as financial assistance to more than 1.5 auto rickshaw and taxi drivers in 2020 and these beneficiaries would not need to reapply and will get Rs 5,000 directly transferred to their Aadhaar-linked bank accounts subject to verification of deaths from local bodies. All individuals holding public service badge (drivers) of para-transit vehicles and permit holders of para transit public service vehicles are eligible for the assistance being provided in the wake of the ongoing wave of Covid-19 cases and curfew announced by Delhi government. Apart from taxi, auto rickshaws and e-rickshaws, total 2.8 lakh PSV badge holders and 1.9 lakh permit holders of phatphat sewa, eco-friendly sewa, gramin sewa, maxi cabs etc. are eligible for the assistance scheme. Those beneficiaries who did not get financial assistance last year because of any reason, will have to apply and register again on the website.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-sanctions-one-time-aid-of-rs-5k-to-1-5l-auto-taxi-drivers/articleshow/82891068.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Delhi||A chase through 5 states: How wrestler Sushil Kumar was tracked||NEW DELHI: In a cat-and-mouse game lasting 18 days, two-time Olympic medalist and international wrestler Sushil Kumar was finally arrested by the special cell of Delhi Police on Sunday morning in the murder case of another international-level wrestler, Sagar Dhankad (23), which took place at Chhatrasal Stadium in northwest Delhi. One of Kumar’s associates, Ajay, has been arrested too. The case has been transferred to the Crime Branch and Kumar has been sent to six days in police custody by a court. Kumar, a Padma Shri, Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna and Arjuna Award recipient, had been shuttling between Delhi, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to evade arrest. He was finally nabbed in Mundka near the Delhi-Haryana border. The use of a dongle to browse the internet on a mobile phone, which was without a SIM card, helped police narrow their search. Apart from this, human intelligence also played a major role in the arrest. At least 14 teams from different units of Delhi Police, including northwest district and Special Cell, had been chasing Kumar ever since he went into hiding. After Dhankad’s thrashing, Kumar went home and slept. The next afternoon, when he found that he had been named in the FIR for murder, he fled to Rishikesh. For the first three days, he used his mobile phone intermittently, but later destroyed it. As raids began to intensify, he left Rishikesh and reached Mathura in an Innova, where he was captured on CCTV at a toll booth. In the next few days, he kept shuttling between Delhi and Bahadurgarh, but later fled to Chandigarh. From there, he went to Bathinda and Jalandhar, only to return to Chandigarh. On Saturday, he reached Gurgaon to collect money from a liquor supplier. By evening, at least three police units had closed in on him. At that time, his associates kept spreading false news on social media about his arrest from different places in Punjab and elsewhere. However, he was tracked in Gurgaon by police using internet-aided communication. However, he managed to dodge them late at night. The accused wrestler then proceeded towards Hari Nagar in west Delhi to meet a woman friend. He took a scooty from there, but ditched it in the early hours of Sunday. The team trailing Kumar from Gurgaon later found the abandoned scooty. It was learnt that he had boarded a car and finally started walking to meet his contact near the Delhi-Haryana border. “As he proceeded towards Mundka, a special cell team led by inspector Shiv Kumar cornered and arrested him at 9.15am,” said DCP Pramod Kushwaha. During Kumar’s interrogation, police would ascertain the identity of the people who sheltered him. At least six prominent people, including two police officers of another state, are under the scanner, sources said. In the intervening night of May 4 and 5, Dhankad was beaten to death in the parking lot of Chhatrasal Stadium, allegedly by Kumar and his associates. Kumar initially denied his involvement, but later went into hiding when police arrested his associate, Prince, and recovered a mobile video showing him and others assaulting Dhankad, the son of a Delhi Police head constable. Kumar had allegedly asked Prince to make the video to “send a message” across to his rivals. TOI was the first to report that Kumar was clearly seen participating in the murder. Police had seized four vehicles from outside the stadium and a double-barrel gun was recovered from one of them. Dhankad’s autopsy showed he had been brutally thrashed. He had multiple fractures and died due to cerebral damage, which was the result of blunt force impact on his head. Multiple abrasions and bruises were found on his upper limbs, chest and abdomen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/after-18-day-run-across-5-states-sushil-kumar-held-near-delhi-haryana-border/articleshow/82896490.cms||Raj Sekhar

Kerala Fishing Boat Owners Association said that an unverified report quoting coastal police officials on May 16 that the boat had been located in Mangaluru had affected the pace of search operations. But later, the message turned out to be false. “There are 11 Tamil Nadu natives and four West Bengal natives on the boat. While all boats that had gone from Beypore have berthed in various harbours following the alert message from the state government in the wake of cyclone Tauktae, there has been no information about Ajmeer Sha,” said K T Shamsudheen, owner of the boat. Kerala Fishing Boat Owners’ Association vice president Karichali Preman said that after they contacted fisheries department and Coast Guard again on May 19 saying that the boat was yet to be traced, Coast Guard was searching the seas using a Dornier aircraft and two ships. “The searches have not yielded any results. We appeal to the government to intensify search operations by pressing in the Navy. The boat had gone for fishing on the Goa side and used to normally return after 15 days; which has passed. We request that the search operations should be extended to an area of 60 nautical miles,” Preman said. One more Keralite dead in barge accident Meanwhile, the number of Keralites who died in the barge accident at Mumbai High rose further with the identification of the body of Saneesh Joseph, who hails from Eruvassi in Kannur. Saneesh, who was working as a rigger with Mumbai based M/s Mathew Associates, was on board the P- 305 barge which had sunk during cyclone Tauktae. Saneesh had jumped into the sea from the sinking barge, he could not be rescued in the search operations conducted by the navy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/missing-fishing-boat-from-beypore-yet-to-be-traced/articleshow/82888932.cms||---

What is disheartening is that cops are thrashing and obstructing even those involved in essential services delivery,” Sravan said. Stating that the police action has been affecting the livelihood of scores of poor and marginalised families belonging to SC, ST, BC and minorities communities, Sravan sought to ask why neither the police nor the Covid-19 task force headed by municipal minister KT Rama Rao is not showing the same intensity in cracking down on private hospitals which are allegedly fleecing people in the name of Covid-19 treatment. “Are the two GOs brought by the TRS applicable only to poor and middle class people? Every day, people are pouring in their anguish over exorbitant bills by corporate hospitals,” he said. Stating that the police have collected Rs 31 crore from people for not wearing masks, he said, “Why are they not acting against corporate hospitals charging huge bills. According to GO 248, no hospital should charge more than Rs 7,000 for an ICU bed but this rule is not being followed. According to GO 539, RT-PCR test cost should not exceed Rs 500 but many diagnostic centres are charging about Rs 1,200 to Rs 2,000,” said Sravan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rein-in-erring-pvt-hosps-labs-cong/articleshow/82891064.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

He said that stopping food delivery would leave thousands starving. “Persons living alone, the elderly, IT employees and many other sections of people depend on online food delivery system. There are thousands of old people in the city who order food online as they cannot cook due to ill health and physical weakness,” he said. Narayana Reddy said that food delivery should be considered as an essential service during the lockdown period and it should have been allowed without any hindrance. “It is inhumane to stop food delivery. There is no other alternative to get cooked food for people who cannot cook meals at home,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/allow-food-delivery-bjp-leader-gudur/articleshow/82891070.cms||---
---||Jaipur||2 lakh staff e-passes issued to 34,000 firms during Covid curfew||JAIPUR: Over 34,000 companies in the state have registered for operating their factories during the ongoing curfew and generated over 2 lakh e-passes for their employees. The government has made registration of companies and generation of IDs for their employees mandatory for commuting to their work places and carrying out operations. Times ViewDespite challenges to containing the pandemic, the government has allowed the manufacturing sector to operate during the ongoing lockdown so as to prevent workers from returning to their native states. It has also put in place a system of issuing transit e-passes for hassle-free commuting to work places. The government should now prioritise vaccinating workers in factories so that the risks at production centres are kept to a minimum.A senior official in the department of IT and Communication said that by the end of May 22, which was the last date for generating IDs, 34,772 commercial establishments had registered while IDs of 2.12 lakh employees were generated. Manufacturing units in the state catering to both domestic and exports market have been exempted from the curfew, but to regulate the movement of their officials, employees and loading and unloading of vehicles, they were required to get transit passes and IDs self-generated from the government web portal. Representatives of the business community said that most of the domestic market oriented manufacturing units are operating at a lower capacity of 20-25% due to the downward spiral of demand while in units catering to overseas markets, the capacity utilisation is much higher. Rajiv Arora, president of Federation of Rajasthan Exporters, said, “Exports are doing pretty fine. Markets in the US, the UK and Europe have opened up. There is demand for goods. That’s why the export oriented units are running at almost full capacity.” Arora said because of the government decision to allow factories to operate, the industry was spared of the kind of labour migration witnessed last year. “Some have gone home, but the work is not affected as much. The government should consider vaccination of the employees at factories so that the labour feels safe, but stays here,” added Arora. The situation is different for companies supplying to the domestic retailers. Saurav Gupta, a leading manufacturer of apparels and home furnishing products in Sitapura industrial area, said, “We only operate at 20-25% capacity. We expect the demand will come back only after the markets, malls and retail outlets reopen.” “However,” Gupta said, “The decision to keep the factories open gives us the operational comfort to raise capacity much faster whenever the government decides to withdraw the curfew. Had we closed our operations and our raw material and other value-chain partners shuttered, the restart would have taken much longer.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/2-lakh-staff-e-passes-issued-to-34k-firms-during-covid-curfew/articleshow/82892707.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana govt not to scale up testing, focus more on treatment now||HYDERABAD: Hinting that the state may not increase testing for coronavirus cases, the government has asked local authorities to focus on treatment first. The action plan for remaining days of the lockdown clearly specified the tasks, but testing and tracing is not part of it. A mobile application will soon be made available to enter data of all symptomatic people found in the fever survey. “Testing should be done only for symptomatic individuals. Focus should be on treating patients, not testing,” the instructions, from top government functionaries to all departments concerned, said. Health officials have been asked to complete the second round of fever survey quickly. The directives said all symptomatic cases should be monitored on daily basis. Data collection of symptomatic would include name, age, gender and date of onset of symptoms. In another important decision, out-patient (OP) services would resume at all government and private hospitals. District authorities have been asked to collect daily reports from hospitals on symptomatic patients and medical kits given. “If a symptomatic person insists on testing even after getting the home isolation kit, the officials must dissuade the individual from testing,” sources told TOI. The instruction also asked oxygen supply be monitored on daily basis and proning sessions be done twice a day in all hospitals. “Audit of patients should be done in all government hospitals on daily basis. All medical department staff should be given Covid duty roaster and will be posted in wards,” the action plan said. In addition to this, special officers would visit all government and private hospitals on daily basis. In addition to encouraging symptomatic people to be under home isolation, it also said the focus would be on drawing their attention towards using the call centre for treatment advice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-govt-not-to-scale-up-testing-focus-more-on-treatment-now/articleshow/82891060.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Goa||Goa police’s anti-terrorist squad struggling with rickety vehicles||PANAJI: Goa police’s anti-terrorist squad (ATS) appears ill-equipped to deal with the frequent alerts the state receives, as its vehicles — five ramshackled jeeps that break down regularly — are barely enough to take on the increasingly well-equipped terrorists should they decide to strike in Goa. A source told TOI that ATS has been sending proposals for replacement of old vehicles to Goa police, but there doesn’t seem to be any progress in the matter. Two of the jeeps are two decades old, and two others are around 10 years old. The four patrol Margao, Vasco, Panaji and Mapusa. Superintendent of police (SP) Bossuet Silva, who is in charge of motor transport, said, “Goa police is in process of allotting new vehicles to the ATS”. The vehicle that patrols Margao has an area up to Canacona within its jurisdiction, and the Mapusa vehicle takes care of the North Goa coastal belt, right up to Pernem.  The Panaji vehicle looks after an area up to Ponda, while the Vasco jeep patrols the Mormugao taluka. Police said that other vehicles purchased along with these ATS vehicles have been scrapped, but the squad continues to use these vehicles. “Today (on Saturday), one vehicle broke down in Verna,” a source said, adding that these incidents happen every couple of days, leading to embarrassment to the commandos. Pointing out that Goa receives frequent terror alerts as it is an international tourist destination, sources said that in case of an untoward incident, it’s unlikely an old ATS vehicle will make it to the spot without it breaking down. Goa police has recently added new vehicles to its fleet, but not a single one was allotted to the ATS. Some ATS staff use their own vehicles for beat patrolling and later claim reimbursement, a source said. ATS conducts beat patrolling at Canacona, Quepem, Colva, Margao, Vasco, Panaji, Calangute, Mapusa, Pernem, Bicholim and Ponda. The state government formed a quick reaction team in 2009, and later, in 2014, the state constituted an ATS to investigate terror-related cases, with a sanctioned strength of 102 personnel. At present, the ATS has around 150 personnel. The ATS is headed by superintendent of police (SP) Shobhit Saxena and deputy superintendent of police (DySP) Sandesh Chodankar. It has two police inspectors and seven police sub-inspectors. Cases probed by the ATS include terrorist activities, offences against the state, activities of gangsters, smugglers, gun runners, mafia, counterfeiters and narcotics smugglers, offences prejudicial to national security, etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-polices-anti-terrorist-squad-struggling-with-rickety-vehicles/articleshow/82892666.cms||Murari Shetye

The search operation was conducted by the patrol team of Margao police led by South Goa SP Pankaj Kumar Singh, who noticed the illegal activity while patrolling the area to ensure that curfew norms were not breached. Sources said that several such illegal online gambling dens are in operation in the locality and that the police hardly bother to take any action. “It goes to the credit of SP Singh that he cracked down on the gambling den. The police brass should now take similar action on other such gambling dens in operation in Margao without yielding to any political pressure,” a trader from Gandhi market said. Margao police had on Friday arrested 11 persons following the operations. All accused were later released on bail. Cash amounting to over Rs 80,000, 11 ‘all in one’ computers each worth Rs 25,000, besides one internet modem, one router, two wi-fi dongles all worth nearly Rs 35,000 were seized. Police had caught Rajesh Babal Naik, a resident of Housing Board, Gogol, Margao, red-handed operating the online gambling game of chance/roulette in Lotlikar building. The accused were arrested under Sections 269 and 188 of the IPC and 3 and 4 of the Public Gambling Act. Sources said that illegal online gambling units have surfaced at many places in Margao. Following the first lockdown in the state last year, many matka bookies had shifted to the online mode and thus sustained their illegal business. Online gambling dens are the latest addition to innovative enterprises in the chance gaming market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/police-action-has-exposed-thriving-online-gambling-activity-say-locals/articleshow/82893905.cms||---

Some said that deprived of food and water, a number of their cattle, their only source of income, died on the road.Twelve families, comprising around 100 people and as many domestic animals, set off on foot from Mohand and Badakla areas of Doon and Shakambhari area of Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh on April 30. Some of the families said that on reaching the wildlife sanctuary, they were told to “put up on the roadside” rather than proceed to Sankri and Rupin ranges (where the sanctuary is located) to graze their cattle. In fact, forest police were given orders to keep an eye on their movements so they wouldn’t enter the forest reserve. One of the Van Gujjars who was forced to return to Dehradun after being turned away, Yakub Ali (36), told TOI, “We have lost 12 buffaloes to starvation as our animals need meadows for pasturing and were denied that. A single truck of dry grass from Vikasnagar to this area would cost us at least Rs 25,000, so any option other than grazing the cattle is not feasible for us. We have permission from the chief minister’s office, chief wildlife warden as well as the head of forest force but the local administration is not allowing us to enter the forests.” When queried, chief wildlife warden JS Suhag said, “The gujjars have permission to enter and they have entered the protected forest range.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/van-gujjars-migrating-to-upper-reaches-turned-away-from-govind-sanctuary-many-stay-on-roadside-with-cattle-and-children/articleshow/82888935.cms||Shivani Azad

Superintendents of CCIs have been told to give a special protein-rich diet for children who were or are presently affected by the viral infection. There are 26 government-run and 75 NGO-run child care institutions in Delhi that provide care and protection services to children. Over 800 children live in government-run CCIs, while more than 2,200 children live in NGOs-run centres. Till mid-May, there were more than 70 active Covid cases among children across these CCIs. Officials said that in CCIs and similar shelter homes, children are given quite a nutritious diet. The food options are diverse and balanced, as per the prescribed diet. The diet for children have been planned in such a way that they recover quickly. The special diet consists of Vitamin C tablets, lemon in food, coconut water, pineapple, salad, protein powder, if required, as per weight, and calcium tablet prescribed by a doctor for 15 days. An official said they have been focusing on increasing immunity among children for which superintendents are encouraged to go beyond the routine diet to give nutrients that boosts immunity. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/give-special-diet-rich-in-protein-to-children-hit-by-covid-care-centres-told/articleshow/82891080.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||GAP NARROWS AT CIVIL: COVID 545, MM 412||Ahmedabad: Sunday was third consecutive day for many relatives of the mucormycosis patients in the city and state where they returned empty-handed from the LG Hospital. The hospital is made the nodal centre for city-based private hospitals to get the stock. “With hospitals are forcing the relatives to arrange for injections, where should we go? Whom should we ask?” lamented one of the relatives outside the LG Hospital on Sunday. “Day by day, the fungal infection is spreading, and my mother could die.” Meanwhile, the state government on Sunday announced that the new stock of liposomal amphotericin B injections from the Centre is likely to arrive in Ahmedabad on Sunday night. The state government also claimed that they have so far disbursed 20,700 injections to medical colleges, general hospitals and municipal corporation-run hospitals. CM Vijay Rupani said that the new stock will be distributed to the nodal centres as soon as possible. “We are procuring more stock of the injections so that there is no dearth of medication for mucormycosis treatment,” he said. “For the private hospitals, the injections will be made available according to guidelines of the state health department.” With no injections available in private sector hospitals, the sources at Civil Hospital said that there is a major rush of mucormycosis patients from the private hospitals. Amid speculations that the AMC-run hospitals will also start treating the black fungus patients, the top AMC officials said that there is no such plan afoot. “As on Sunday evening, Civil Hospital has 545 patients of Covid-19 at 1200-bed hospital and 412 patients of mucormycosis. It’s an inverse relationship – while the Covid cases are constantly decreasing, several of the patients of mucormycosis who have got surgery done at other hospitals are getting admitted in hope of getting medicines,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gap-narrows-at-civil-covid-545-mm-412/articleshow/82892968.cms||---

Sanjay Krishna, inspector, legal metrology, who carried out the raids based on a complaint, found that the weight of goods was being recorded in a wrong way. Officials seized the records, weights and measuring devices from the weighbridge and served notices to the grade secretary of the agriculture market. The weighbridge is meant to weigh loads of goods along with the vehicles.

---||Goa||Goa: Residents turn to inverters, gensets to keep work from home going||PANAJI: With memories of Goa’s massive power outage still fresh and with monsoons around the corner, domestic inverters, batteries and roof-top solar power plants are back in demand. Some are even willing to go the extra length and invest in compact 1KV to 3KV gensets to bid goodbye to power-cuts. Manufacturers and dealers say that though there has been a steady market for domestic inverters over the last few years, inquiries have increased over the past week after Goa went without power for as long as 100 hours. With work from home, virtual classes and online exams becoming the new norm, the need for uninterrupted power supply and internet connectivity cannot be stressed enough. “Inquiries for home inverters are very much picking up. Once the power outage started, inverters began to sell very fast,” said Valpoi-based Terrance Mascarenhas. “I have got many inquiries for solar plants. The ones for whom I installed were very happy with the performance during the power outage.” Goa witnessed one of its worst power outages in recent times as 70% of the state was plunged into darkness after Cyclone Tauktae wreaked havoc leaving behind a trail of destruction in the state. Power infrastructure such as transformers, feeders, electricity poles and distribution systems were damaged across the state. “Earlier we used to install about 20 inverters in a month, but after the cyclone, we got over 60 orders,” said Sudin Kamat, who manages a 45-year-old electrical appliance business that was started by his father Vinayak Kamat. For some, the inverter is not the answer to their problems. An inverter can provide limited power for a few hours and cannot be used to pump water or power fridges. An 850VA to 3KVA genset on the other hand can meet this requirement, but the fuel fumes and associated noise, not to mention the prohibitive investment, deters most. Queries for solar power systems are largely for independent homes, while inverters are more suited for residential apartments. “I have an inverter, but the power back up is limited,” said Mapusa resident Warren Rodrigues. “We expect that this monsoons there will be more power cuts. With a toddler at home, we need a small generator to run the pump, keep the fan running and the food safe.” Rodrigues is on the hunt for a 1KVA petrol genset, but has yet to meet with success. Yashi Das, a resident of Taleigao, is another parent who is toying with the idea of a compact generator to ensure that computers, phones and the fridge have constant power supply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/residents-turn-to-inverters-gensets-to-keep-wfh-going/articleshow/82892693.cms||Newton Sequeira

Childline Chittorgarh received reports from two separate areas where children were found in need of care and protection. “We reached a home in Shambhupura’s Sanva chowki and found a 7-year-old boy who had no one to take care of. The child’s mother died a year ago and his father is suffering from some serious ailment and is bedridden. The grandparents, who were his only support, recently died of Covid,” said Bhupendra Singh, district co-ordinator of Chittorgarh Childline. Ramesh Dashora, chairman of the Child Welfare Committee, and others met the boy on Sunday and assured all support. In another case reported from Chanderiya, two boys of 16 and 14 years of age were found helpless. Their mother had died four months ago and their father recently died of Covid. One of the teen is infected and quarantined at home. “The children are presently taken care of by their relatives, but in the long term, they would require state assistance. Reports would be sent to the authorities concerned for intervention and help,” Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/chittor-childline-reaches-out-to-3-orphaned-children/articleshow/82892733.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: NGO steps in with ration, essential items for disabled||NEW DELHI: Avadesh (38), a physically handicapped person who works as a helper in a shared auto, has hardly earned anything in the past one month since the Covid lockdown has been imposed. “I met with an accident seven years ago, which led to a dislocation of bone on my left leg. I cannot walk properly but used to earn my living by working as a helper in a shared auto on the Peeragarhi-Uttam Nagar route,” said Avadesh, the breadwinner for the family. But since the current lockdown has been announced to contain the viral infection, “we didn’t get passengers and our auto driver decided to go off-road from May 5. My mother and younger sister are dependent on me and it has become difficult to arrange two-square meals”, he added. Avadesh is not alone. Many persons with disabilities have been affected in the pandemic, and an NGO, NIPUN, has been distributing dry ration and sanitation kits among such people in Meera Bagh. Over the last two days, NIPUN provided ration and other essential items to 50 people with mental illness and various physical disabilities. Pradeep Kumar, its secretary, said, “In the next phase, we are planning to involve the government and like-minded NGOs to provide community-based rehabilitation to persons with disabilities. We want to help them get skill-based employment.” Twenty-five-year-old Deepak, another physically handicapped person, has been jobless for nearly a year while his mother, a domestic help, has lost employment around a month ago. “I used to work in an electrical equipment factory. I lost the work last year and, despite my repeated attempts, have failed to find another work,” said Deepak. While his elderly father is bed-ridden, his mother’s employers stopped calling her after the lockdown was imposed last month. “I also have a younger sister. It has become difficult to buy medicines for my father or pay the rent of Rs 2,500,” said Deepak, thanking NIPUN for providing the ration. Another beneficiary, Gulab Mandal (20), said, “My sister Geeta and I are blind while my younger brother is a Class XII student. Our mother is a domestic help, but has no work in the lockdown. We request the government to help us.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ngo-steps-in-with-ration-essential-items-for-disabled/articleshow/82891190.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

Postmortem reports showed that death was due to drowning. Justice K Haripal ordered a high-level probe into the death of Ivin Vijayan of Chathannoor in Kollam after considering a petition (WP-C No. 10259/2021) filed by the man’s wife through advocate R Rajesh Varkala. News reports of the drowning had mentioned that Ivin was allegedly attacked on the road and then at his home by some other motorists following a road-rage incident earlier the same day. He was on his way to the police station to lodge a complaint when his car hit a temple’s compound wall. In the final report, police had concluded that death was due to traffic accident. The petitioner’s counsel argued that the postmortem report shows that death was due to drowning and that the body was found in a river 150 metre away from the scene of car accident. Ivin had contacted his wife over phone after the accident and had intimated her about it, the counsel pointed out while submitting that foul play is suspected in the death. While ordering for constituting a SIT headed by a senior police officer of good track record at the level of SP, the judge said, “I feel that the matter needs to be considered in all seriousness and a detailed investigation is warranted.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-orders-sit-probe-into-death-of-road-rage-victim/articleshow/82889050.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Pandemic makes closure hard for bereaved||Ahmedabad: Jignesh Prajapati (name changed), 41, was brought to a city-based psychiatrist after he showed signs of physical distress including the loss of sleep, appetite, and the lack of drive to do anything. The doctors got to know that Prajapati had lost his father in the pandemic, and he could do nothing, as he was under home isolation. He could not help in hospitalization and later at the funeral. Thus, his question to the doctors was how could he come to terms with such a death. The last he had seen of his father was when he was taken to the hospital. Dr Ajay Chauhan, medical superintendent of Government Hospital for Mental Health (HMH), said that the psychology helpline 1100 is getting an increasing number of distress calls spurred by the loss of someone near and dear. “Due to the nature of the pandemic, the relatives often don’t find closure. Thus, grief counselling becomes a necessity,” he said. Dr Dipti Bhatt, coordinator of the helpline at HMH and senior psychiatrist, said that they are receiving at least two calls daily about grief and loss. “None of us would have seen so many deaths around us in our lives,” she said. “Thus, when it hits close to home, it takes a systematic approach to get the person out. The tell-tale signs of distress include not being able to grieve, communicate, or sleep. Incessant body pain or headache are other signs.” Often the calls are about guilt, helplessness, anger, and despair. “Give yourself time, don’t blame yourself for everything that has happened, and don’t isolate yourself,” said Dr Bhatt. “There is no right way of grieving. But closure and accepting reality is the step in the right direction.” She said people can channelize the feelings in activities. “Some families encouraged friends and relatives of the departed to plant a tree each in his remembrance,” she said. Priyanka Adalaja, senior counsellor of Jeevan Aastha helpline (1800 233 3330) said that in one case, a man was asked by a doctor to choose between his wife and his newborn child as they could not save both. “Both were suspected to be Covid-19 positive, and the doctors eventually could not save the child,” she said. “They apparently also refused to treat his wife as it was a non-Covid hospital. He could not come to terms with the loss.” She added: “It’s very important not to suppress feelings, and to observe them to address them for a proper closure.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/pandemic-makes-closure-hard-for-bereaved/articleshow/82892973.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Every child should get flu shot before monsoon, say experts||MUMBAI: The state Covid taskforce and the newly constituted paediatric taskforce have jointly suggested immunising every child with the influenza vaccine ahead of monsoon. At a virtual meeting held on Sunday, doctors from both expert groups told chief minister Uddhav Thackeray that administering the influenza vaccine would help curb the incidence of this disease, which in turn will help decongest hospitals and prevent unnecessary testing since the signs of seasonal flu can mimic Covid-19. Indian Academy of Paediatrics (IAP) recommends the influenza vaccine for children below the age of five. The vaccine, that contains two subtypes of influenza A and two lineages of influenza B, is widely available in the private market, but it is not a part of the vaccines given under the national immunisation programme. It costs Rs 1,500-Rs2,000 for a single shot. Dr Sanjay Oak, chairman of the state Covid taskforce, told the CM, “We are of the opinion that the influenza vaccine should be advised proactively. Since it’s expensive, it is mostly the middle class and upper class that can afford it. At the state level, we may think of reducing the cost or giving it to every child at least in the next six months.” Dr Suhas Prabhu, who heads the paediatric taskforce, said flu patients may present Covid-like symptoms. “If they all start coming to hospitals and if RT-PCR has to be done for all, there will be added expenses and crowding in hospitals,” he said. He told the CM at least for this year, the state may make an exception and give the vaccine to all children. CM Thackeray said the state will certainly consider the suggestion. “However, we need more clarity on whether asymptomatic Covid positive child can take the vaccine. Vaccination is not at all an issue but how, when and whom to vaccinate should be clear to avoid further complications,” said Thackeray. Meanwhile, members from both taskforces said children who may have missed out on their routine immunisation doses due to a Covid infection should complete their schedule. “It is safe for a child to get BCG, rubella or any vaccine that they may have missed out on if four weeks have passed since the onset of Covid symptoms,” said Dr Vijay Yewale, also a member of the paediatric taskforce.

---||Jaipur||No let-up in restrictions: Rajasthan locks down till June 8||JAIPUR: The state government extended the lockdown by 15 days from May 24 to June 8 on Sunday. The decision was made after cabinet ministers recommended the continuation of strict restrictions despite the reduction in daily cases, death rate and increasing availability of hospitals in the state. The ban on marriage ceremonies has also been extended till June 30. Marriages will be allowed either at homes or at the court with only 11 persons allowed to attend. The penalty for not wearing a mask in public places has been revised from Rs 500 to Rs 1,000 in the new guidelines. Directions have been given to health workers to identify those with influenza like illness (ILI), distribute medical kits to them and ensure home quarantine under medical supervision. Every household should be surveyed every 10 days. The home delivery of processed food and Indira Rasoi has been allowed till 9pm. The 15-day lockdown will be known as the ‘Three-Tier Self Discipline Lockdown’. The first tier is to prevent the entry of outsiders into homes and to hold such meetings with others, if required, in an open space following social distancing norms. “The second tier is to stop activities that can lead to the spread of the infection and to ensure that not more than five persons gather in a common place,” the official statement said. The third tier is to prevent anyone, who does not have a medical emergency or have the requisite permission, from moving from one city to another, city to villages or from villages to other villages. Village-level committees will play a vital role in restricting such movement. It was also decided to keep the markets closed from 12 noon on May 28 (Friday) to 5am on June 1 (Tuesday), and from 12 noon on June 4 (Friday) to 5am on June 8 (Tuesday). On both these extended weekend lockdowns, mandis, dairy along with shops, push carts and other vehicles selling milk products, vegetables, fruits, and flowers will be exempted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/no-let-up-in-restrictions-raj-locks-down-till-june-8/articleshow/82892793.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: At Amma’s famous dog centre, rise in abandoned pets even as funds dry up||NEW DELHI: A dog shelter run by an elderly woman, Pratima Devi, fondly called Amma, near the PVR Anupam complex in Saket has seen many cases of canines being abandoned by their owners during the second Covid-19 wave. The helpers at the shelter have reported over 15 such recent cases. The surge in the number of infections has also dried up donations. Devi, who came to Delhi in the early 1980s from Nandigram in West Bengal, has been living in a shanty for the last three decades and often works as a ragpicker. Pawan Kumar, who helps her in running the shelter, said, “We are feeding around 300 dogs at the shelter, apart from around 100 dogs in the neighbourhood and the market. We have seen many new dogs abandoned by their owners in the closed marketplace.” In November 2017, the makeshift shelter was razed by the municipal corporation, but Devi salvaged things from the rubble and restarted operations with the help of animal lovers. Earlier, TOI had reported how the deadly second wave of the pandemic was tough on animals. In many cases, the guardians of the pets had passed away. Animal shelters like Friendicoes-SECA and Sanjay Gandhi Animal Care Centre had also provided refuge to many such abandoned pets. Meanwhile, Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) has written to the chief secretaries of various states to allocate money for feeding stray animals, while recognising veterinarians and animal feeders as frontline workers. The letter by AWBI director Dr OP Chaudhary stated that animal lovers, welfare activists and veterinarians were risking their lives while rescuing and taking care of the animals. They were also travelling to nearby areas and veterinary clinics for treatment of injured or sick animals. However, they had not been designated as frontline workers. It was noted that Odisha had allotted funds from the CM Relief Fund for feeding stray animals. “Kindly allocate sufficient funds for feeding of community animals and include veterinarians and animal feeders as frontline workers,” the letter concluded. The disturbing trend of dogs being abandoned has been witnessed across the country. A large number of pets were let go during the initial phase of the pandemic, perhaps due to misinformation that animals could spread the novel coronavirus. While isolated cases of pets testing positive had been found, World Health Organisation had repeatedly clarified that there was no evidence that the virus could be transmitted from pets to humans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/at-ammas-famous-dog-centre-rise-in-abandoned-pets-even-as-funds-dry-up/articleshow/82891142.cms||Paras Singh
---||Kochi||Kerala: ‘Call back island administrator’||KOCHI: Rajya Sabha MP from Kerala Elamaram Kareem has written to President Ram Nath Kovind requesting him to urgently call back the administrator of the union territory of Lakshadweep, Praful Patel, alleging that his anti-people policies have led to widespread protest among the people.  Many existing laws were being amended unilaterally and new legislations were being drafted without consultation with the people or their elected representatives, he said in the letter.  “All these unilateral, undemocratic and anti-people decisions have created massive unrest among the people and the whole island wants the administrator to leave. In this scenario, I humbly submit to you that such an authoritarian administrator should not be allowed to continue in office and that he should be urgently called back. All the orders and reforms promulgated under his rule should also be immediately reviewed and withdrawn,” the letter said.  Kareem shared a copy of the letter on his Facebook page on Sunday night.  “Patel was appointed as the administrator on December 5, 2020… as soon as he assumed office, he unilaterally changed the standard operating procedure which was in force in the island for preventing the spread of the pandemic. According to the people of island, the unplanned and unscientific altering of SOP has led to the current surge in Covid cases in Lakshadweep, where not even a single case was reported in the year 2020,” Kareem wrote in the letter. The letter further said that under the new administrator, hundreds of casual and contract labourers who were working under different departments have lost their jobs. “Casual and contractual staff were terminated from services from different government offices on a daily basis. About 38 Anganwadis were closed and 190 people were sacked in the tourism department. Sports teachers and those who make meals in schools were asked to go. Many in the department of animal welfare and the Agriculture department too lost their jobs. All this has caused great suffering among the islanders during the time of the pandemic time,” the letter said.  He also said sheds where fishermen used to keep their nets and other equipment were demolished by the new administration on the grounds that they violated the Coast Guard Act. The letter said that neither the island community nor the local bodies were ever consulted before framing these regulations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/call-back-island-administrator/articleshow/82889102.cms||---

Also, out of the total 4,77,484 samples tested, 65% are RT-PCR, while the remaining are Rapid Antigen test (RAT). “We are ramping up RAT which is faster in reporting and seldom has errors when the transmission is higher. Also, we have already started giving reports of tests online,” said director health services of the UT Dr Amandeep Kang. The number of cases has also been declining. The daily cases have been declining since May 9 when there were 895 cases a day. On May 10, this number reduced to 863 and finally to 650, with a sharp decline from 760 on May 13 to 650 on May 14. Now, the numbers are 406 as on May 21. However, the number of deaths was 14. “The mortality is still high. The decline in cases should not be seen as the pandemic is over. In fact, we need to prepare for the surge again,” said a public health expert. He cautioned, “As predicted recently by the IIT Kanpur model, the wave will almost come to a halt by the end of June. But with the onset of winters, there can be another surge.” Moreover, 10 ventilators will be installed at the trauma area of GMSH-16, which will be only for Covid-19 patients. These ventilators will be commissioned in the next two days. Also, head of forensic medicine Prof Dasari Harish informed that there is urgent requirement for walk-in mortuary to keep the increasing number of bodies and prepare for the third wave. He said they tried to get some vendors on GeM, but none of them agreed to register on GeM. Therefore, a short notice tender will be issued to set up this mortuary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/33-city-residents-tested-5-infected-so-far/articleshow/82889044.cms||Shimona Kanwar

It is an ultra-successful scavenger lurking with an omnipresence in the Tricity’s environs. The kite is one avian species that has benefited immensely by adapting seamlessly to human habitation and habits. The smart bird has ruthlessly exploited the inefficient disposal of garbage by civic authorities and the tendency of citizens to carelessly litter and scatter leftover foods! So well adapted are kites to scavenging from human wastes that their hunting of live prey has been virtually relegated to a secondary instinct. These handsome brown raptors are encountered everywhere in urban habitat from well-watered lawns to school playgrounds to squabbling over fish at Sukhna Lake to diving adroitly within traffic and salvaging a morsel from a busy road with a consummate display of aerial manoeuvre and survival skills. By far the most adaptable, numerous and successful of the raptor species, the ‘cheel’ has defied the downward trend in numbers of other raptor species which show a marked sensitivity to habitat destruction and toxicity-laced food sources, such as poisoning of prey species (rodents, frogs, small birds) by extensive use of farm chemicals. Unlike the other common raptor of the Tricity, the shikra, ‘the cheel’ does not bat an eyelid while going for non-live prey. The shikra is lured by warm blood so it must slay live prey, the kite is bound by no such sophistication of taste and will pick cold wastes from outside a butcher's shop or stinking waste from the Dadumajra dump to fill its stomach. Save the grains people put out for pigeons, kites eat virtually everything including bread crumbs and are classic omnivores, a rare trait among raptor species which are normally blood-loving. Formations of ‘cheels’ can be observed at dusk flying over PGI and heading towards nearby forests to roost in large groups. This is the gutsy, naughty robber that is adept at snatching tiffin snacks of school children during the brief break from classroom toil! “Will swoop and carry off a dead rat or other tidbit lying in the middle of a congested thoroughfare, turning and twisting with masterly adroitness to avoid the tangle of overhead electric wires and the bustling traffic below. Or one will bide his time and suddenly swoop down from nowhere before the picnicker’s sandwich has reached his mouth, whisk it neatly out of his hand and decamp as suddenly as it came!” wrote Dr Salim Ali, the legendary birdman of India, while describing the kite’s irascible habits. At golf clubs, kites have carried away golf balls from the fairways much to the annoyance of players who had managed finally to strike a good hit but found the results of their dream shot vanishing in thin air. The Tricity's numerous tall and mature trees are used extensively for nesting by kites. They are protective of nests and adept at identifying precisely the human perceived as a threat. Nesting kites single out a human from a group and repeatedly attack him/her, as evidenced by a Sector 8, Chandigarh, resident fond of flying drones. A pair of kites had a nest on a tall tree in his house and whenever he stirred out, the kites dive bombed him much to the discomfort of his jittery nerves! The kite pair associated him with the drone, which they felt was a real threat to their nest and fledglings. “When nesting near buildings, they have been known to break window panes when people appear at windows facing the nest, and to attack maintenance workers on the head on high-rise buildings,” wrote raptor specialist Rishad Naoroji in his seminal volume, ‘Birds of Prey of the Indian Sub-continent’. The ‘cheel’ also suffers from frequent misrepresentation. It is captured illegally and exhibited wrongly as the ‘Guru’s baaz’, which is actually the very rare Northern goshawk enjoying an authentic historical association with the Sikh Gurus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cheel-is-dominant-scavenger-lurking-in-tricitys-blue-skies/articleshow/82889095.cms||---

Gautam cycled his way to Kumkum’s village, about 24km from his home, without any companion or baraat, and tied nuptial knot with her last Friday. Block development officer (BDO) of Shambhuganj, Prabhat Ranjan, reached the marriage venue and also the groom’s place at Uchhagaon on Saturday and blessed the couple. The BDO said the Banka district administration would recommend a reward under Mukhya Mantri Kanya Vivah Yojana for the bride. “The required form is being filled. It will be sent to the officials concerned after local mukhiya issues the marriage certificate,” the BDO added. Gautam and Kumkum’s marriage was supposed to take place in January last year. However, it was delayed due to Covid outbreak and the two families had to wait for 15 months for the big day. The virulent second wave of Covid forced the families to keep the wedding a low-key affair. In fact, Gautam reached the Kumkum’s house alone on a bicycle after getting permission from his family and tied nuptial knot with her.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/no-band-baaja-baraat-as-groom-pedals-24km-to-reach-brides-house/articleshow/82891252.cms||Kumar Rajesh
---||Mumbai||With 3 new govt medical colleges, 300 more seats in Maharashtra this year||MUMBAI: In a huge push to public health education, the state government has decided to open three medical colleges, adding 300 affordable seats in the 2021-22 admissions sessi-on. Civic hospitals of Alibaug, Sindhudurg and Satara will be taken over and the first-year departments will be set up. It is for the first time that three medical institutes will come up in one go in Maharashtra. Previously, one government medical college was established in Nandurbar (2020), Baramati (2019) and Jalgaon (2018). Adding fresh MBBS graduates into Covid duty, delaying the PG-NEET, and now new colleges is one more initiative of Covid-19’s shake-up to health education that will get more physicians in the healthcare system. “We have fast-tracked our plans due to Cov-id,” said Dr T P Lahane, head of Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER). “In many of our existing colleges, we have additional staff, so we are asking who would be willing to go and set up these three colleges.” The human resource of teaching faculty has been rationalised under the new regulations, titled Minimum Requirements For Annual MBBS Admissions Regulations (2020); the notification replaces the Minimum Standard Requirements for Medical Colleges, 1999. Over and above the minimum prescribed faculty, there is a provision for ‘visiting faculty’ to enhance the quality of training. Additionally, the state has estimated the cost of purchasing the requisite medical equipment at Rs 2.98 crore, accruing Rs 8.9 crore for the three colleges. Of the 36 districts, at least one medical college exists in 25 districts. “This is very good news. With the three new colleges, the state will cover Raigad which does not have one,” said Dr Pravin Shingare, former head of DMER. However, seven districts in the state —Hingoli, Bhandara, Gadchiroli, Buldhana, Osmanabad, Parbhani and Washim—are still deprived of an MBBS college. According to the latest perspective plan of the Maharashtra University of Health Sciences in 2017, the state has 1:1540 ratio of doctor to population, better than the national average ratio of 1:1700. The doctor: population ratio drawn for a state largely differs within the state itself: the region-wise student intake capacity per one lakh population for Konkan (Mumbai) region is 2.83, for Pune region is 3.18, for Nagpur region is 4.68, for Marathwada (Aurangabad) region is 2.67, for Amravati region is 2.66 and for Nashik (North Maharashtra) region is 0.54. “If more doctors are produced, out of them, at least a few may go to rural and tribal areas, and the cost of health services may get reduced,” stated the MUHS perspective plan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/with-3-new-govt-med-colleges-300-more-seats-in-maharashtra-state-in-2021-22/articleshow/82887328.cms||Hemali Chhapia

A retired chowkidar, Mewalal Rai (70), was beaten to death by the mob. Police had arrested Shakir Alam and Asad Raza alias Asad Alam a day after the violence and one Mohamamd Junaid Alam was nabbed on Saturday. SHO of Baisi police station Amit Kumar on Sunday said the child, Deewana, was rescued from Amaur in Purnia. “Child’s father Pratap Rai had lodged an FIR for kidnapping.

He added 78 people have been named in three FIRs lodged in connection with the mob attack. At least 150 unidentified people have also been made accused in the three FIRs. “Rizwi is accused in all FIRs.

To recall, in 2019, more than 40 villagers had died after consuming hooch in Bhagwanpur region in Haridwar. Villages like Sahdevpur, Dinarpur and Shivgarh falling under Pathri police station, as well as several remote villages of Bhagwanpur and Jhabrera regions are notorious for hooch production, which is done in deep forests and then supplied to city areas in plastic bags. Charnjeet Pahwa, a local resident, told TOI, “Hooch is being supplied to the city area with the help of chemicals and medicines the use of which are prohibited. Now how the mafia finds these drugs readily available should be investigated by the administration.” According to police, the hooch mafia has started to employ women and children to deliver hooch in city and village areas to avoid suspicion. The SSP told TOI, “The hooch mafia has emerged as a big challenge for us. To stop the production of hooch, we are going to impose Gangster Act against perpetrators, which is a non-bailable charge.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/with-liquor-out-of-bonds-circulation-of-hooch-surges-in-haridwar/articleshow/82889122.cms||MS Nawaz

Captain Russi Bunsha, executive trustee of JRD Tata Memorial Trust, said Captain Bose was commander of Emperor Ashoka — AI’s first B747. “He was the first AI pilot to be appointed MD in 1984 (a position he occupied) till his retirement in 1987,” said Bunsha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ais-1st-pilot-to-become-its-md-dead/articleshow/82893991.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||95% hit by virus recovered at home in Gujarat: Study||AHMEDABAD: About 95% of the people in a study who had tested Covid-19 positive have recovered after taking home treatment. These people were covered in the recent study by Gujarat Technological University. The university conducted 2,368 RT-PCR tests for the diagnosis of Covid-19 over a period of three months. Of these, 1,127 tests returned positive results while eight of these patients lost their lives. The study also surveyed people who took vaccination before being tested for Covid-19. “About 54% of the people who were administered the vaccine did not test positive for Covid-19,” the survey said. This means that a large number of people, comprising about 47% of those who tested positive, had received at least one dose of vaccination. “But they all had mild infections and have recovered,” according to GTU vice-chancellor Navin Sheth. The details of these tests were analyzed by a survey team headed by Dr Vaibhav Bhatt who is also the head of the Atal Incubation Centre which is assisting the lab in various tests. The university’s bio-safety lab, set up as a part of the Atal Incubation Centre, was granted approval to conduct Covid-19 tests in February. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had cleared the decks for GTU to conduct RT-PCR tests for Covid-19 diagnosis. In a statement, Sheth said it has been established that vaccination was the need of the hour. The results have shown that 94.74% of the patients were cured by home isolation treatment; the majority of the tested people, 99.29%, beat corona. About 5.26% of the people had to be admitted to hospitals following complications, the statement said. The highest number of positive cases were 44.99% in the age group of 21 years to 40 years. About 31.14% of the infections were in the age group of 41 to 60 years. In the second wave of corona, young people have been more prone to getting the disease. In the age group of 10 years and below, 2.31% were found infected; while in the age group of 11 to 20, the figure was 10.65%. People above the age of 60 years comprised 10.91% of the total found infected in the survey. After March 20, the rate of positive cases was seen to be steadily increasing. The first two weeks of April saw a jump of more than 60%. This has recently seen a decline of 50%, the statement said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/95-hit-by-virus-recovered-at-home-study/articleshow/82892953.cms||---
---||Delhi||Together we can: How RWAs are helping patients brave Covid||NEW DELHI: When the healthcare infrastructure got overwhelmed during the deadly second wave of the pandemic, a large number of good Samaritans, community members and organisations came forward to help brave the crisis. Albeit late, the expansion of beds in hospitals has taken place, along with a large number of community and RWA-run Covid care centres in community halls and schools over the last one month. A government report shows that currently 32 such Covid centres with a cumulative capacity of 630 beds are operational in Delhi. So far, 178 patients have been treated and discharged at these centres, while 122 patients are still receiving healthcare. Dr Sameer Pandit, who helps out at three such centres at DDA community centre Dwarka and SDMC primary schools in Kakrola and Palam, said the units were being run with the help of NGOs and donations. “One advantage of these centres is that patients can get treatment in their own locality. Only mild patients with oxygen saturation level above 90 are treated here. In case the oxygen levels drop, they are transferred to another healthcare facility,” he added. Out of 630 beds, 163 are equipped with oxygen cylinders and concentrators. The largest number of such centres exists in South district with 110 beds, followed by New Delhi district with 70 beds and South East and South West districts with 67 and 65 beds, respectively. North East district has the lowest number of such facilities with two centres being run in municipal corporation buildings by the local gurdwara committee, Sewa Bharati and NGO Sofia, which are facing a shortage of doctors. One of the largest centres is located in government higher secondary school in Pushp Vihar Sector 3 where Western Avenue Residents’ Welfare Association (WARWA), Sainik Farm has set up an 80-bed facility. Currently, 56 patients are admitted there. Ashim Badhwar from WARWA said this was one of the first RWA-run isolation centres set up in June 2020. “Around 30 patients will be discharged in a couple of days. We have kept a 1:5 oxygen bed and concentrator ratio with beds. Two doctors are available 24x7 for online consultation and a ward boy and nurse are present along with monitoring equipment for BP, sugar and oxygen levels. A coordinator remains in touch with the area SDM and hospitals in case anyone needs to be shifted out,” he added. In East district, three centres with 25 beds have been made operational in the community hall of RWA Beverly Hills, DJB office and a site run by Ahimsa Jain Dharmarth Sansthan. However, patients are yet to avail of the benefits of these units due to oxygen procurement issues. In North East district, two Covid care centres were not made operational as the RWAs couldn’t arrange for doctors and paramedics. Recently, DDA had relaxed the norms to book its community halls for long periods to run such facilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/together-we-can-how-rwas-are-helping-patients-brave-the-storm/articleshow/82891168.cms||Paras Singh

Speaking to TOI, the 56-year-old, who was expelled from Congress after she contested as an Independent candidate from Ettumanoor in the assembly polls, said that she had held talks with NCP state president P C Chacko and will formally join the party in two days. “I had spoken with P C Chacko on Saturday regarding this,” she said. She also said that there will be others too from Congress who will be joining NCP along with her. Chacko, a senior leader and working committee member of Congress, himself had joined NCP earlier this month. She also said that several political parties had contacted her earlier after she was expelled from Congress. “I have been holding the flag of the Congress party since the age of 16. So I chose NCP as it is a national party which has a Congress tradition. She also said that she knew Chacko from a young age, since he too is a native of Kottayam. “I have not put forward any conditions for joining NCP. I am not a person who puts conditions,” she said. She also said that several leaders in Congress had spoken to her. “Though many have spoken, senior leaders who ought to call me did not. Only A K Antony called before the elections asking me not to contest,” she said. She also said that only senior Congress leader V M Sudheeran had called to console her. Subhash had tonsured her head and quit Congress after being denied ticket to contest from Ettumanoor constituency in the recent assembly polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/lathika-subhash-to-join-ncp-says-others-to-follow/articleshow/82889182.cms||---
---||Noida||Four hospitals respond to ‘social obligations’ notice||Noida: Responses have started to trickle in from private hospitals to a notice served by the Gautam Budh Nagar administration on whether they had served their ‘social obligations’ during the second wave of the pandemic. The notices were served after Jewar MLA Dhirendra Singh raised the issue in a letter to chief minister Yogi Adityanath. Gautam Budh Nagar chief medical officer Deepak Ohri said the notices were dated May 19 and hospitals had been asked to reply within three days. However, by May 22 evening, only four responses had come. “Some hospitals received the notice the same day while others sent us acknowledgement on May 20. We received responses from four hospitals by Saturday evening. Other hospitals are expected to respond on Sunday and Monday. We will compile their responses and forward it to the state government. Expertise and guidance of medical professionals is needed for such matters and we will wait for further directions,” said Ohri. Compliance with corporate social responsibility rules and sections prescribed under the Companies Act, 2013, have to be evaluated by domain experts “All companies with a net profit of Rs 5 crore or more during a financial year need to have a mechanism in place to fulfil their corporate responsibilities. Even hospitals have to follow the guidelines stipulated under the Companies Act, 2013 and Social Responsibility Rules, 2014,” said Abhishek Yadav, a Supreme Court advocate-on-record. Sources in the health department said the four hospitals that had responded had given details of the free medical aid they have given to some individuals. “Volume of oxygen, medicines and free consultation provided to needy patients has been mentioned in the response,” said an official. The notices had drawn an angry response from the Noida chapter of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), which said such moves hurt the morale of private hospitals and doctors that had “shouldered 80% of the patient load in the district”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/four-hospitals-respond-to-social-obligations-notice/articleshow/82880264.cms||Shalabh
---||Delhi||‘Dubai-based gangster was also hot on the heels of Sushil Kumar’||NEW DELHI: International wrestler Sushil Kumar was not only trying to escape from Delhi Police for the past 18 days, but also from Sandeep alias Kala Jathedi, one of the most wanted gangsters of north India who is currently believed to be in Dubai. Jathedi had recently orchestrated the shootout at GTB Hospital to free his associate, Kuldeep Fajja, who was later killed by the Special Cell in an encounter. Kumar knew that using an electronic device would do him in, but he didn’t seem very worried about police. Using a dongle for internet on his phone despite being cautioned by his well-wishers, he had been trying to contact Jathedi to forgive him, said a source. Even after his arrest by a Special Cell team led by inspector Shiv Kumar on Sunday, Kumar had no regrets about Sagar Dhankad’s murder. He just wanted police to save him from Jathedi’s men in jail, suggesting he had failed to strike a truce in the last two weeks. But why is the Jathedi gang after the decorated wrestler? When Kumar had assaulted Dhankad, he had also thrashed another man named Sonu. With 19 cases of murder, extortion and robbery lodged against him, Sonu is Jathedi’s nephew, who treats him like his son. After the incident, there was more outrage about the assault on Sonu. Jathedi had been indulging in large-scale grabbing of disputed properties in Delhi through Sonu and others, police said. Kumar had allegedly joined hands with Jathedi and landed a flat in M2-Block of northwest Delhi’s Model Town, which was at the centre of the controversy. This flat was being used to shelter criminals belonging to the Jathedi-Lawrence Bishnoi gang and many crime plots were hatched there. The alliance was aiming at having complete control of toll tax booths in Delhi, UP and Haryana. “According to the initial arrangement, the proceeds from the sale of the property were to be divided equally between Kumar and Jathedi. However, in the last few months, Kumar’s proximity with rival gangs, including henchmen of jailed gangsters Neeraj Bawana and Naveen Bali, had increased, which created distrust between the wrestler and Jathedi’s gang,” explained a senior officer. When Jathedi pressed Kumar for money and sale of the flat, he asked Dhankad and others, who had been living there, to vacate the premises. This angered the Jathedi gang, who started to foul mouth him publicly. After Kumar got to know this, he challenged Dhankad and others for a face-off. Sonu felt that Kumar would not cross lines given Jathedi’s clout. However, a short-tempered Kumar, with the backing of Jathedi’s rival, didn’t hesitate in taking the step that was supposed to be a sign of establishing his supremacy. For this very reason, Kumar ordered the assault to be filmed so that the video could be circulated and a message sent across to gangs to not mess around with him. However, Dhankad’s death and severe injuries to Jathedi’s henchmen led to the gangster declaring an all-out war against Kumar and his associates with the threat to eliminate him. Sources have confirmed that Jathedi’s men are still looking for Kumar and his associates who were accompanying him on the night of the murder.

Samir Kakkad, founder of All India Handicap Association, said that they had sent emails to the state government and AMC officials, requesting them to carry out special camps. “We already have registration of over 500 persons with us.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Two new papers, more centres for GATE||MUMBAI: Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE) aspirants can opt for two new papers in the coming year, taking the total subjects to 29. With more aspirants taking the test from smaller towns in the pandemic year, the organising old IITs and IISc-Bengaluru also plan to increase centres even in 2022. All benefits for candidates this year in GATE 2021 – allowing students to opt for more than one paper and opening GATE for third year students – will continue in 2022. At a National Coordination Board (NCB)-GATE meeting on Saturday, for official handover of GATE duties – from IIT-Bombay to IIT-Kharagpur – organising institutes approved inclusion of two papers in GATE 2022. After demand from the shipping ministry, it was decided to include naval architecture and marine engineering as one of the papers, said organising chairman of GATE 2021, Prof Deepankar Choudhury. Geomatics engineering (collection, measuring, monitoring, and archiving geospatial data) will be added in GATE 2022, he said. IIT-B, organising institute for GATE 2021, had introduced two papers (humanities and environmental science) and 14,000 candidates each opted for them. For the first time, GATE was opened to students from arts and commerce in 2021 and 2022. With many taking the test from home towns in the pandemic year, new centres were opened in smaller towns in GATE 2021, like Shirdi, Latur, Akola and Dhule. Choudhury said the cities figured among top 10 of percentage attendance of students among registered from there who wrote the exam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-2-new-papers-more-centres-for-gate/articleshow/82894030.cms||Yogita Rao
---||Kochi||Highway heist: BJP leaders fail to appear before SIT||Thrissur: Two BJP functionaries who were summoned by police in connection with the recent highway heist case at Kodakara failed to appear before the investigation team on Sunday. BJP state organising secretary M Ganesh informed the special investigating team that he could not turn up because of other engagements, while state office secretary G Girish cited health issues for not appearing before the police. According to police sources, both have sought time to appear before the probe team. The special investigating team under Thrissur range DIG A Akbar had sent communications to Ganesh and Girish on Saturday to appear before them on Sunday. Party leaders in the district K R Hari, Sujay Senan and V Kasinath were questioned by the police on Saturday on the robbery that took place on the highway. There were reports that the money was allegedly being transported for the election campaign of a national political party. As per the complaint filed by the driver of the car Rs 25 lakh was looted from the vehicle. The police have, however, recovered about Rs 1 crore and 20 people have been arrested in connection with the robbery. AK Dharmarajan, who had allegedly sent the money, had told the police that he was an RSS activist. He had also told them that the money was handed over to him by Sunil Naik, the former state treasurer of Yuva Morcha, the youth wing of BJP. Later, they conceded to the police that around Rs 3.5 crore was stolen from the car. The police had also received inputs that it was illegal money that was being transported. The goons who stole the money had followed the car in two vehicles, and allegedly decamped with the cash after intercepting the car by setting up a fake traffic accident near Kodakara on April 3, three days before the assembly elections. Though the police were told that the money was meant for real estate business, the ruling CPM had alleged that it was part of black money brought for the election campaign of a national party and sought a detailed probe into the incident. However, BJP state president K Surendran on Saturday said his party had no connection with the incident. Alleging that there was an attempt to link the BJP with the case and tarnish its image, the leader said the interrogation of the party leaders was only a drama. The saffron party never used any illegal money for campaigning, he added.

On the other hand, Andhra Pradesh’s total positivity rate (TPR) is 24% and yet to peak. University of Michigan’s school of public health chair of biostatistics Bhramar Mukherjee told TOI that Andhra Pradesh and Telangana were behaving differently on Covid-19 surge. On Sunday, Telangana reported 21 deaths and 3,308 new Covid-19 cases. Director, public health, G Srinivasa Rao told TOI, “In urban areas, we crossed the peak two weeks ago and the decline started. In the next ten days, it will become normal. In Warangal and other tier-two cities, peak passed a week ago. In Nagarkurnool, Mahabubnagar, Bhongir and Khammam, the cases are still increasing. We are focusing on containing the spread in rural areas.” Andhra Pradesh reported 18,767 new Covid-19 cases and the toll increased to 10,126 with 104 deaths on Sunday. Bhramar Mukherjee, in an email conversation with TOI, said, “Telangana has passed the peak, based on the reported numbers. I am surprised by AP numbers. Still quite high TPR (24%) and R number is above unity. Possibly, quite close to the peak, but we have to be cautious. ” R is the number of people, on an average, an infected person would pass on the virus. The two Telugu states look different in terms of timing of the peak and duration. “AP had about 10,000 cases at its wave 1 peak and wave 2 peak is nearly double, whereas Telangana had only about 3,000 cases at last peak and this year around 10,000, so three times more cases at peak. The national peak is four times more than wave one peak,” she added. When asked about under-reporting by states, she said, “There are challenges with case and death reporting faced by every state. Overall nationally, we estimate 10-20 times more infections and 2-5 more deaths by using models.” Telangana health authorities denied any under-reporting of cases. “What worked for us is the house to house survey. We surveyed one crore houses across the State and identified 4.5 lakh symptomatic patients and distributed medicines to them. Imposing lockdown at the right time is also helping us,” the officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/state-passed-2nd-wave-peak-experts/articleshow/82893025.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

Sangrur is the first satellite centre of PGI that has come up with a screening OPD already functional. But the completion of the building is awaited. The centre, once fully functional, can help relieve the OPD count and other specialities in the region when Covid is exhausting resources. A few essential services like medical gas and laundry are left, for which tenders have been either awarded or floated. “For shifting patients, apart from beds, we need trained manpower, equipment and other essential services. We are trying hard to complete the work to operationalise the centre at the earliest. I am taking regular meetings (mostly virtual) with the executing agency officials and visiting the site, whenever feasible,” said Kumar Gaurav Dhawan, deputy director, PGI. There is a requirement of 1,000-plus faculty and non-faculty. “For prioritisation, we’ve bifurcated into phases I and II. The requirements were sent to the ministry of health and family welfare for submission to the ministry of finance (department of Expenditure). We are actively pursuing with the ministry and hopeful of a quick solution,” said Dhawan. Sarangpur, which is close to PGI, is the second satellite of the institute. Trauma centre and OPDs will be shifted to Sarangpur. It will also have a cancer centre and a learning resource centre for training and teaching programmes. “Saranpur will take some time to be used for any purpose. However, we have other areas at PGI, which can be put to use, if required,” said Dhawan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pgi-centre-bldg-ready-next-month-staff-wait-to-linger/articleshow/82889267.cms||Shimona Kanwar

The milk procurement was cut by 40% due to the reduction in the sale of milk in the districts of Palakkad, Malappuram, Kozhikode, Kannur, Wayanad and Kasaragod. Later, the procurement was raised to 80% of milk produced by the dairy farmers. There is a sales reduction of 3 lakh litre daily, resulting in a daily loss of Rs 60 lakh to the Malabar MILMA, said its chairman K S Mani. “We are planning to distribute the surplus milk to Covid care centres through the local bodies. Also, some part of it will be given to labour camps where guest workers stay,” he added. MRCMPU used to procure 7.85 lakh litre of milk daily but the sale came down to 5 lakh litre.

---||Delhi||‘No one above the law’: Sushil Kumar sent to 6-day police custody||NEW DELHI: A court on Sunday remanded Olympic medalist wrestler Sushil Kumar and another accused in six days’ police custody in an alleged case of murder of another wrestler. Metropolitan magistrate Divya Malhotra noted in the order that “no one is above law and law treats everyone equally”. The remand order further highlighted that the Constitution guarantees right to life and liberty to all persons subject to just exceptions. “The importance of the initial days of the investigation for unearthing the truth should not be overemphasised….While the liberty of the accused is not to be curtailed unnecessarily, at the same time, it is also to be seen that the investigation is not hampered and that crucial evidence is not lost,” it stated. The court further underscored that the allegations were grave in nature. “Involvement of a large number of persons, some of whom are stated to be belonging to some notorious gangs stationed outside Delhi, is also suspected and they are yet to be arrested. The CCTV installed at the place of incident has allegedly been tampered with and there was no sign of its digital video recorder,” the judge said, allowing the six-day custody of Sushil and Sunil alias Ajay Kumar “only in the first instance”. Additional public prosecutor Atul Shrivastava sought 12 days’ remand on the ground that Sushil had to be taken to Uttarakhand, Punjab and other places where he reportedly hid during his run. “Sagar was also a national-level wrestler. Other persons who were beaten up also represented our country at the international level. We have to unearth a larger conspiracy,” he submitted. The prosecutor further pointed out that one faction was brought by Sushil and his associates to Chhatrasal Stadium and everyone brought there other than Sonu were wrestlers. Sushil had hired another gang, whose members were yet to be arrested, the prosecutor claimed. “The video footage shows that the victim was being beaten up as if he was some wild animal.” The prosecutor informed that “pistols” were found in the vehicle used in the crime. “The accused hid himself for sufficient time, instead of coming out with his plea.” Shrivastava pleaded, “We need at least 12 days to come to the truth of the case.” For Sushil, advocates B S Jakhar and Kumar Vaibhaw argued the cops hadn’t shown a single recovery from their client to connect him with the crime. “The pistol is a licensed weapon given to me legally. The cause of death is a stick, which was already recovered. They have raided everyone… all my relatives. They called my wife to the police station,” submitted Jakhar. Shrivastava, however, countered the submissions saying Sushil didn’t surrender even after his anticipatory bail was rejected, but was arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-one-above-the-law-sushil-sent-to-6-day-police-custody/articleshow/82891215.cms||Aamir Khan
---||Dehradun||Air ambulance kept waiting in Dehradun for five months||DEHRADUN: All the while the pandemic was fanning out in the hills of Uttarakhand and scores were dying due to the lack of healthcare in remote areas, an air ambulance continued to be stationed at Dehradun waiting for permission to spin its rotors and take seriously ill patients to hospitals. The files, which would have made the chopper-based service operational, lay buried somewhere in the drawers of National Health Mission (NHM). Even after the Centre’s in-principle permission -- which had come way back in 2018-- the air ambulance service project is yet to take off. “The air ambulance service project for the hills, for which a nod was given to a private airline in December 2020, has been stuck. The ambulance service should have started in 2019 itself. The NHM has initiated the tender processes twice in last three years. Once it got delayed due to the lockdown and no one knows what the problem is now,” a senior health department official said on the condition of anonymity. When asked about the status of the air ambulance project, MD of NHM, Sonika (who uses only her first name), said that she had approved the project in December and after that she had gone on maternity leave. “I have resumed office last week. We have already started the process to get a go-ahead from the Centre on this as projects under NHM are funded by it,” she added. SP Sachan, CEO of Kestrel Aviation -- the firm that got the contract to run the air ambulance-- said that the firm has deployed a helicopter and a pilot at the Sahestradhara helipad soon after they received a go-ahead letter from the health department. “We are spending seven to eight lakh rupees every month on the pilot and infrastructure while waiting for the go- ahead,” he added. The introduction of the air ambulance was expected to give a much-needed boost to emergency health care in the state. According to NHM officials, if things would have gone the way they were planned, the air ambulance in Uttarakhand would have been the first regular air ambulance service being run by any state in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/since-5-months-air-ambulance-kept-waiting-in-doon-not-given-permission-to-operate/articleshow/82889253.cms||Ishita Mishra

The milk procurement was cut by 40% due to the reduction in the sale of milk in the districts of Palakkad, Malappuram, Kozhikode, Kannur, Wayanad and Kasaragod. Later, the procurement was raised to 80% of milk produced by the dairy farmers. There is a sales reduction of 3 lakh litre daily, resulting in a daily loss of Rs 60 lakh to the Malabar MILMA, said its chairman K S Mani. “We are planning to distribute the surplus milk to Covid care centres through the local bodies. Also, some part of it will be given to labour camps where guest workers stay,” he added. MRCMPU used to procure 7.85 lakh litre of milk daily but the sale came down to 5 lakh litre. The surplus milk is sent to milk-powdering units in Tamil Nadu, resulting in a huge loss to Malabar Milma, Mani said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/malabar-milma-to-buy-entire-milk-produced-by-farmers/articleshow/82899046.cms||---

To address the problems of the elderly in the context of the pandemic, the helpline — Elderline — is now available at the number ‘14567’. On May 17, the union ministry of social justice and empowerment had urged all states to start the helpline in order to take care of the senior citizens who are staying alone. While the facility was launched by the government last year, the service has been revived during the second wave. It is now enabled to deal with the emergency needs of the elders with the help of local police. The district has a senior citizen population of 21,000 who avail the benefits of the government-run schemes. Social welfare officer of the district, Shailendra Singh said, “It is estimated that at least 1.50 lakh senior citizens are settled in the district. Out of them, 21,000 avail the pension scheme of the government. The pensioners have limited income and means. The focus of the helpline is to help them. Since the number of retired people settled in Noida and Greater Noida is high, we will also respond to their SOS calls in a prompt manner,” said Singh. The officer added that a mechanism is being evolved to provide emergency relief to elderly couples and senior citizens who are staying by themselves. Officials said they are in talks with private doctors to find out if they would volunteer to counsel and talk to senior citizens in case they feel lonely. A mental health expert, who has been looking after the senior citizens in the twin cities, Ashutosh Mishra said: “During the pandemic, senior citizens staying alone feel extremely vulnerable. They are not advised to move out and have no support system. In metro cities, we have come across a lot of elderly individuals who are staying alone and need constant care.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/noida-activates-elderline-for-senior-citizens/articleshow/82880304.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Dehradun||Record showers raise water level of Naini Lake, which was nearing zero||Nainital: A record rainfall in two weeks has given a breather to people of Nainital, as the water level of Naini Lake, the town’s only drinking water source, rose by two and a half feet. “On May 5, the water level in Naini was about to touch zero but it rained that night and the level has been on the rise since,” said lake superintendent, Ramesh Singh. Meanwhile, the over 375mm rainfall witnessed in Nainital in May, even with a week left for the month to end, has emerged as the highest rainfall ever recorded in the district in May since 1990. Previously, the highest ever rains in Nainital in May since 1990 was recorded in 2014, with around 350mm rainfall. According to officials tasked with management of the Lake, the water level in Naini had peaked in September 2020 because of monsoon rains and almost zero tourist activity because of the pandemic. However, since then, the water level started to decrease because of increased tourist footfall and no post-monsoon rains. “In September, the lake’s water level was above 11 feet 3 inches but in January, it came down to just over 5 feet,” Singh said. However, the water level in the lake is still below what it was at this time last year. Singh said that in May 2020, the water level in the lake was over 6 feet. “Last year, there was a decent amount of snowfall in January and by March, the town was under lockdown and therefore there was no tourist activity. However, this year most of the hotels were booked till Holi and there was very high pressure on the lake,” he said. Apart from being Nainital’s central tourist attraction, the Naini Lake supplies almost 8 million litres of water to the town every day. Although the usage has been halved from December 2017, when over 16 million litres per day (MLD) water was supplied from the lake, water level dips significantly in summers. For instance, in 2017, it had dipped to negative six feet and six inches.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/record-showers-raise-water-level-of-naini-lake-which-was-nearing-zero/articleshow/82889315.cms||Prashant Jha

---||Delhi||Haze engulfs Delhi, air quality worsens due to dust cover||NEW DELHI: A thick haze covered the capital on Sunday morning and visibility dropped to 600 metres from 8am to 9am at the Safdarjung observatory due to high concentration of dust in the air. This sent Delhi’s air quality, which was “satisfactory” and even “good” over the last three days, into the “poor” category. Met officials said the haze was triggered by a western disturbance trough and strong southwesterly winds. The dust-raising winds caused advection of dust — transfer of matter by the flow of a fluid, especially horizontally in atmosphere — from southwest Rajasthan. Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at India Meteorological Department (IMD) and head of Regional Weather Forecasting Centre, said, “Some parts in west Rajasthan received less rainfall in the past few days. Due to a western disturbance trough and southwesterly winds, the dust was transported from Rajasthan to south Haryana and Delhi-NCR, affecting the visibility.” Besides the dust, low temperatures that slow down the dispersion of pollutants also made the air quality “poor”, he added. Delhi’s overall air quality index (AQI) on Sunday was 237 as against 94 in the “satisfactory” category on Saturday, according to Central Pollution Control Board. However, the air quality is expected to improve from Monday. System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research, a central forecasting body, said, “High winds and better ventilation are forecast for the next three days. Hence, AQI is likely to improve to ‘moderate’ category on Monday and may improve further in the ‘moderate’ category on May 25 and 26.” The maximum temperature on Sunday was 33.5 degrees Celsius, six degrees below normal, while the minimum temperature settled at 22.4, four notches below normal. IMD says the mercury will start rising from Monday. The maximum and minimum temperatures are likely to be 36 and 21 degrees Celsius, respectively. Strong surface winds at 20-25kmph are predicted for the next two days. “As the influence of a western disturbance will be over, the mercury will start rising. The maximum temperature may touch 39 degrees Celsius by May 29,” said a Met official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/haze-engulfs-delhi-air-quality-worsens-due-to-dust-cover/articleshow/82891261.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Chandigarh||Need Rs 10,000 monthly aid per migrant family for lockdown in Punjab: Study||CHANDIGARH: A study on Punjab’s migrant labour crises during the Covid-19 lockdown has recommended a compensation of Rs 10,000 per month per migrant family by the Punjab government for the lockdown period of 2020 and also for the current lockdown imposed to control the second wave. According to the study, conducted by former economics professor of Punjabi University, Patiala, Lakhwinder Singh, in view of the crisis faced by migrant labourers during the pandemic and in normal times, there is an urgent need to frame a comprehensive public policy to ensure decent work and upward mobility of the migrant workforce. A large number of migrant workers faced misery during the first lockdown that lasted more than 68 days, says the study. In the initial phase, migrant workers and their family members travelled back home with their own meagre transport facilities such as bicycle and barefoot. Some died on the way due to the lack of food and water and other lifesaving facilities. Although the Punjab government has claimed that the migrants’ travel back home, while hiring buses and trains, was supported and paid from its sources, the study says, “The support of the Punjab government has remained crucial but it was too late and too little compared to the contribution of the migrant labour to the economy of the state.” Concluding that the upward mobility of migrant labour force is quite limited in Punjab, the study also recommended that if the state government would like to draw full benefits of the young migrant workforce working in urban locations, it should provide them education and skills keeping in view of the emerging employment opportunities. It also emphasised that the female migrant workforce should be imparted two-pronged literacies — education and skills, and financial — so that they are saved from double exploitation and also empowered and ensured upward mobility. “The resolution of elimination in theory and practice will not only have an enduring impact on the migrant labour but it will help the smooth transition of the economy from the low level of economic equilibrium to self-sustained economic development,” Prof Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/need-rs-10k-monthly-aid-per-migrant-family-for-lockdown-in-punjab-study/articleshow/82894112.cms||Sanjeev Verma
---||Mumbai||Now, Maharashtra mulls ‘no exam’, grading on past academic score for HSC students||MUMBAI: In what could come as a relief to 14 lakh class 12 students in the state waiting to appear for their board exam, state education minister Varsha Gaikwad said that a ‘no-exam route’ needs to be examined as it is possible to evaluate them based on their past performance. Gaikwad told reporters after attending a virtual meet of education ministers and officers of all states with Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Sunday. While the state had cancelled the class 10 exam, the class 12 exam was put on hold. The Bombay high court had on Thursday questioned the state’s rationale for this. Admitting that the uncertainty over exams needs to end and a decision in students’ interest must be made, Gaikwad said a call will be taken in a day or two after consulting chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. For class 10 students, the state is considering evaluating them based on their class 8 and 9 marks.  “The court will consider our views on not holding exams for class 10 sympathetically as the decision was taken in unusual conditions due to Covid-19. We will ensure that students do not suffer in the next academic year,” said Gaikwad. She said that during Sunday’s virtual meeting, it was felt that children are vulnerable to new strains of coronavirus and hence class 12 students too can be evaluated based on a past assessment model. The minister said that the focus should be on evolving a uniform assessment policy, vaccination of all teachers and students and safe resumption of schools and colleges for the next academic year. She stressed the need for more vaccines for teachers and eligible students. The general consensus among education officers across states was that students need to be vaccinated if they have to take an offline exam. “The state may have to derive a methodology to evaluate class 12 students just like their class 10 counterparts. Vaccinating these students (they are below 18) is not possible, nor can they be made to wait for the exam,” said a state education board official. The official said that all states are concerned about the pandemic and its impact on students. Some state officers spoke about waiting till September before taking a decision on the class 12 exam. All states were unanimous in their decision to cancel the class 10 exam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/now-maharashtra-state-mulls-no-exam-grading-on-past-academic-score-for-hsc-students/articleshow/82894098.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

The cardamom and winter vegetables sector mainly faced large-scale damage as a result of Tauktae. Hundreds of acres of cardamom plantations in the district were destroyed by the heavy wind in Vandanmedu, Mali, Anyartholu, Anavilasom and Chakkupallam areas. According to cardamom growers association, Vandamemedu, executive member TC Mathew said that as a result of Cyclone Tauktae the cardamom production will be reduced nearly 30% in the district. “Acres of cardamom plantations were destroyed in the heavy wind. In many plantations, the trees fell down due to heavy wind and destroyed the farms. The unexpected climate change was a huge hit to the cardamom farmers in the district,” said Mathew. K Jayaprakash, president of the winter vegetable society in Vattavada, said that the cyclone destroyed acres of winter vegetable farms in the area. “Two weeks before, the seed sowing of vegetables was completed, and beans and vegetables had started growing. But due to heavy rain the vegetables were damaged. Some of the farmers started re-sowing the seeds. The repeated rain warnings are raising concerns among the farmers,” he said. Officials of the revenue department are recording the extent of damage and a report will soon be submitted to the government. Climatologist Gopakumar Cholayil said, “The repeated cyclones and unexpected rains severely affect the farming sector. The climate variations are primarily witnessed in the agriculture sector and any such variations will cause large-scale loss to the farmers. Before the arrival of southwest monsoon, farmers traditionally engaged in completing the works in the farm lands. But for the last several years, the agricultural calendar was changed due to unexpected rain patterns. As a result of Cyclone Tauktae, the farm sector, including paddy, cardamom, and winter vegetables, faced huge losses.” Thomas Mathai, a farmer in Kattappana, said that the unexpected rain severely affected the farming activities. “The main works in cardamom like clearing the dried leaves and pest-prevention measures are usually done in May. But this year, it was not completed yet due to rain and chances are that it will affect the production next season.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/farm-sector-faces-large-scale-losses-due-to-cyclone-tauktae/articleshow/82889385.cms||Sandeep Thomas
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Second corona wave slows passenger movement at airport||AHMEDABAD: Apprehensions on travelling triggered by the nastier second wave of Covid-19 infections have impacted passenger movements at the city airport significantly. However, Air passenger traffic remained relatively unaffected in March 2021 with a marginal 6.3% decline year-on-year, according to data by Airports Authority of India (AAI). Passenger movement including both domestic and international traffic stood at 5.56 lakh passengers in March 2021 against 5.93 lakh during the same month last year. Sources at the city airport estimated that passenger traffic dropped significantly in April as the second wave of Covid-19 infections intensified. AAI, however, has not yet released exact passenger movement data for April this year. Explaining the trend, a travel industry expert said, “In Gujarat, restrictions mandating a negative RT-PCR report were executed in March-end which did not affect passenger traffic to a great extent. The same in Maharashtra was implemented much earlier. Moreover, due to the second wave, travellers had serious apprehensions to move out of their city unless there was a pressing emergency. Therefore, passenger movement was expected to take a hit.” The protocol making it compulsory to give RT-PCR negative reports upon arrival in a given state varies from state to state and according to travel industry experts, it was a dampener for impacting travel. Due to varying rules from state to state, according to industry players, leisure travel as well as corporate travel had already taken a hit, giving a further blow to air travel, causing demand to fall further on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/second-corona-wave-slows-passenger-movement-at-airport/articleshow/82893009.cms||---

Also, three more bodies were found at Valsad on Sunday, taking the total found there to eight. Late Saturday evening, the barge was located at a depth of 30 metres by a survey vessel. Its interiors were inspected on Sunday. The toll from P-305 and the tugboat Varaprada, which sank hours before the barge, now stands at 86, which includes 16 bodies that are yet to be identified. Since all missing crew have either been rescued or found dead, the toll stands at 75 from P-305 and 11 from Varaprada. Naval divers find and search P305, sail on to look for missing tugboatCatamaran survey vessel INS Makar, after locating and searching the wrecked barge P-305, sailed towards Satpati Port at Palghar to look for Varaprada. The vessel started its journey to Paghar after her diving team searched through all four storeys of the P-305 accommodation barge and did not find any bodies stuck in any of its rooms or chambers. The barge is on the seabed at a depth of 30 metres. The spot is around 80km off Mumbai’s coast. “Diving on the sunken wreck of barge P-305 has been completed by specialised teams onboard INS Makar, and no bodies have been found. (For Varaprada) diving operations will be conducted on Monday,” said a Navy official. Karnik said the INS Makar will continue its operation to locate the Varaprada. “We haven’t called off the SAR yet.” The Navy’s chief PRO, commander Mehul Karnik, told TOI, “A total of 274 crew were reported missing on May 17, of which 261 were from P305 and 13 from Varaprada. A total of 188 survivors were picked up at sea (including two from Varaprada) during SAR.” Of the 16 bodies recovered, eight each were found at Valsad and Raigad, of which five belong to P-305 and 11 to Varaprada. Confirming the breakup of bodies found at Raigad and Valsad, Karnik said, “Thus all 274 crew initially reported missing have been accounted for. Final confirmation will however be pending till the identification of all bodies recovered is completed.” P-305 started sinking on May 15 at midnight after its eight anchorage steel cables started snapping one after the other, before its 261 crew onboard started jumping into the sea wearing life jackets, while some tried to use life rafts, almost all of which were found punctured. The decomposed body of the captain of Varaprada has been identified with the help of his watch and ring. On Sunday, naval warships Betwa, Teg and Talwar, along with helicopters and Coast Guard and offshore vessels, recovered four bodies. An ONGC spokesperson said all 101 ONGC personnel onboard drillship Sagar Bhushan and 196 on barge SS-3 are safe. “The 44 ONGC employees onboard P-305 were rescued safely during the SAR. A total of six crew were rescued and seven of those employed by Afcons directly died,” said the official. “Two of the bodies that washed ashore at Valsad were identified as those of Captain N Kumar and crew member Umed Singh of Varaprada. Singh was identified through his wallet and I-Card. One I-card, bearing the names Glory Shipping and Yatinder Vikram Singh, was found floating in water.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/divers-inspect-sunken-barge-toll-rises-to-75/articleshow/82894084.cms||Mateen Hafeez

Doctors and healthcare workers are working day and night in the war against Covid and are god-like figures. Your comments have not only disrespected the Covid warriors but also hurt the sentiments of people of the country,” Harsh Vardhan wrote, aadding that the clarification issued on behalf of the yoga guru — that he was reading out comments about allopathy from a Whatsapp message on his phone — was insufficient to soothe the hurt emotions of the people . Harsh Vardhan’s letter came a day after doctors at Indian Medical Association (IMA) demanded that the yoga guru be booked under the Epidemic Act for his comments. In his letter, Harsh Vardhan further wrote, “It is extremely sad that when so many doctors and nurses have lost their lives while serving people in the pandemic, you termed allopathy medicine’s usage in Covid-19 as ‘tamasha’, ‘bekaar’ and ‘diwalia’. If today the country has a recovery rate of 88% and death rate is just 1.3%, a lot of credit for this is due to allopathy and its doctors.” The health minister added that being a public figure, the yoga guru should have spoken keeping in mind the situation and time. “Your statement will affect the morale of doctors and will weaken the country’s fight against the virus,” said Vardhan, adding that Ramdev should take back his ‘unfortunate and objectionable’ statement completely. Meanwhile, late on Sunday, Ramdev posted on Twitter that he was laying to rest the entire controversy about the tussle between different treatment modalities and taking back his statement. In a detailed letter to the health minister which he also put up on the micro-blogging site, the yoga guru wrote that he is not against modern medicine or allopathy which has made great progress in surgery and emergency healthcare and served humanity. “However, highlighting the lacunae in any medical system should not be viewed as an attack on the system. Everyone should self-introspect and keep progressing. Similarly, comments by some allopathic doctors terming traditional systems of medicine, yoga and Ayurveda as ‘pseudo science’ is also a form of disrespect which hurts the sentiments of crores of people,” Ramdev wrote.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/people-of-the-country-are-hurt-by-your-comments-harsh-vardhan-writes-to-ramdev-on-his-allopathy-has-killed-lakhs-statement/articleshow/82889410.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Noida||11 of gang that bought, sold babies held||Ghaziabad: A gang that allegedly bought newborns from poor parents and sold the infants to childless couples was busted in Ghaziabad, with the arrest of 11 people. Police began investigating after a complaint was lodged in Loni on May 12 by a couple that claimed their 15-day-old child was abducted from their house by a man and a woman who had visited them on the pretext of renting a flat. “The complaint was lodged by Fatima and Fariyad, residents of Dabur Talab area. Based on an initial investigation and the circumstances, we concluded that it was highly unlikely that a child could be abducted in that way,” said Atul Kumar, circle officer, Loni. “However, upon further investigation, it came to light that it was not a case of abduction but that of a baby-selling racket. In this case, Fatima and Fariyad had agreed to sell their newborn to the accused but lodged a complaint with the police when the buyers hoodwinked them and took away their child without paying the agreed amount,” he added. Five of the 11 arrested in the case are local resident Wahid, Delhi-based couple Asmit Kaur and Gurmeet, and Lucknow resident Alok Agnihotri. Three more accused in the case are on the run. Police have identified Asmit and Gurmeet as the kingpins of the racket they ran through Wahid, whose primary job was to spot poor and vulnerable couples and convince them to have a baby and subsequently sell them off. “Asmit and Gurmeet attracted potential customers through their website, Sulekha. They used to charge up to Rs 5.5 lakh from childless couples for a newborn,” said Kumar. In the case of Fatima and Fariyad, Wahid had struck a deal with the couple and offered them Rs 2 lakh for their baby. “But Wahid, along with another woman, visited the couple’s house on May 12 and took away the baby when they were busy with household chores, without paying them a penny. The baby was taken straight to Asmit and Gurmeet in Delhi, from where the accused couple boarded a flight to Lucknow and delivered the baby to Alok Agnihotri for Rs 5.5 lakh,” the circle officer said. In fact, to crack the case, the Ghaziabad police had formed three teams and activated local intelligence units. “We first arrested Wahid who spilled the beans and named all those involved in the racket. Eventually, 10 more people were arrested, including eight women and three men. Lucknow resident Agnihotri is among those held for buying the baby for his childless sister,” said Iraj Raja, SP (rural). Police have, however, not yet pressed any charges against the complainants in the case, Fatima and Fariyad. “Efforts are on to nab the other three accused in the case,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/11-of-gang-that-bought-sold-babies-held/articleshow/82880341.cms||Abhijay Jha

The thefts had occurred over the last one month in the temples in the old city areas, including Rasta Peth, Shukrawar Peth and Budhwar Peth, among others. The series of thefts had prompted deputy commissioner of police (Zone I) Priyanka Narnavare to set up a special team under assistant commissioner of police Satish Govekar to work on leads. Police personnel from Khadak, Faraskhana and Samarth police stations were part of this team. After studying the CCTV footage from different temples and other establishments located in front of the temples, the police team identified the suspects. The team then arrested Rameez Iqbal Hakim Khan (20) of Bhavani Peth and booked his accomplice on the charge of stealing a silver donation box and other valuables from a Jain temple in Guruwar Peth. Police recovered the silver donation box and the scooter used in the crime. The team arrested Anil Mindha Patel (28) of Budhwar Peth from a place in Madhya Pradesh on the charge of stealing Rs900 from the donation box of a Ganapati temple at Phadke Haud Chowk and nabbed Vinayak Bandu Karale (22) of Bhawani Peth on the charge of stealing silver ornaments worth Rs8,000 from a temple in Rasta Peth. Police recovered the silver ornaments from his possession. Police said that Khan’s accomplice too was detained but he developed some health issues. The two had also targeted two other temples in Shukrawar Peth.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cops-nab-3-crack-five-theft-cases-in-temples/articleshow/82891255.cms||---

For perspective, only 20 murder cases were registered during all of 2020. There has been a similar spurt in body offences (causing injuries using weapons) — 525 cases have been registered so far this year, while 410 cases were recorded in 2020. Even attempt to murder cases are relatively higher, with 98 cases so far this year as against 130 in 2020. “There was a strict lockdown last year. Very few people ventured out on the streets and in public places for nearly two-three months last year,” said Ashok Morale, additional commissioner of police (crime). “This year too, Covid restrictions are in place but people continue to move around, which is a concern. This is a key factor in the lower number of cases last year, compared to this year. Most of the murder cases have been solved; the others are still under investigation,” Morale added. He conceded that the number of body offenses was rising in the city. “Many reasons can be attributed to this, but primarily, trivial issues or old rivalries between groups or individuals are to blame. Even crimes because of domestic reasons are on the rise,” Morale said. Police the group clashes were reported majorly in areas like Bibvewadi, Kondhwa, Hadapsar, Wanowrie, Bharati Vidyapeeth, Sinhagad Road and Yerawada. “Such incidents are also high in slum pockets,” Moreale said. “Eight criminals on police record were killed in the city since January this year, owing to old rivalries,” the additional CP said. In fact, Morale said, most of the body offences last year were reported when the restrictions were relaxed. “The lockdown norms were relaxed after August-September last year and around that time, there was a rise in body offences in the city,” he said. “People started coming out of their houses; they were impatient and were under stress for a variety of reasons — shortage of money, domestic issues, limited freedom, among others. In such a situation, they took their frustration out on the streets or at home,” Morale explained. “About 48% of the total attempt to murder cases occurred because of trivial reasons; 42% were due to old rivalries,” Morale said, adding, “Fifty-five per cent of the murders also were due to trivial causes; 14% occurred because of suspected infidelity or illicit relationships and the rest were a fallout of other causes, like robbery, domestic reasons, or even poverty.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/murders-body-offences-on-the-rise-despite-covid-curbs/articleshow/82891243.cms||---

Sources close to the development said that the decision is taken to address the spread of the pandemic among the working population. The daily average of vaccination in this category is about 30,000, they added. From the start of the vaccination drive for the category, there were widespread complaints of not getting slots for vaccination. The officials said that the initiative is so far limited to the 10 districts and municipal corporations where concentration of the cases is the highest. For the past four days, the trend of the vaccination has got changed, said experts. With the gap of at least three months between two shots of Covishield – the vaccine used in 90% of inoculation in the state – there is a major drop in second shot vaccination. In comparison, the shots for the first dose have increased by over 50%, they added. Senior officials were not available for comment on whether the distribution of shots would affect the ongoing vaccination for 45+ year citizens.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/more-slots-for-18-44-group/articleshow/82893021.cms||---

The pre-term baby, delivered on April 17 after just 28 weeks of pregnancy, was born to a woman who had also tested positive for Covid-19 and was on ventilator support. The baby weighed just 1,000 grams at birth and was initially being treated for respiratory distress. The baby’s first Covid-19 tests came negative. After eight days following birth, the baby’s oxygen levels were falling and she was facing increased breathing difficulties and had to be put on ventilator support. Upon another RT-PCR test, the results came positive for Covid-19. The baby weighed only 920 grams then and was shifted to Covid-19 isolation ICU for treatment. “We provided ventilator support, intravenous antibiotics and nutrition. Later, the ventilator support was weaned to nasal ventilation and to CPAP and the newborn was managed with a combination of supportive care and steroids,” said clinical director for neonatology at KIMS Cuddles, Dr C Aparna.

In Mancherial and Nirmal districts, local deities are offered different pujas, asking them to ward off Covid-19 from their lives. In Godavarikhani, people have even made a idol and statue of the Covid-19 virus and have been praying to it to leave the world. In Adilabad’s Sangidi, local deities are being offered pujas. People in Adilibad’s Bodh mandal even went to the extent of offering Bonalu to local deity. In Utnuru mandal, locals offfered abhiskeham. In Jagityal, lord Shiva is being offered prayers in the local Subramanya temple. During the first wave, the infection did not reach the villages, but many imposed a lockdown anyway. “Last year we did not have many cases. In fact, one of our villages reported zero cases for some time. But this time, most villages have cases. We are praying not just for ourselves but for everyone, so that life becomes normal,” said Sheil Vali, a private teacher from Mancherial.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/villagers-seek-divine-intervention/articleshow/82893047.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Ludhiana||Gold given for gurdwara pinnacle to be used to buy ambulance: Seechewal||JALANDHAR: A gurdwara in Seechewal village has decided to use the gold meant for the pinnacle of the dome of the building to buy an ambulance and other equipment required to save lives of Covid patients. Environmentalist Baba Balbir Singh Seechewal said people had donated gold, including ornaments in the last few years for the project. Though the gurdwara was built some years ago, and a dome was also built, the pinnacle is yet to be made. Devotees wanted to gold plate the pinnacle. “Now, we have decided to purchase an ambulance and if we still have money left we will buy other equipment required,” added Baba Seechewal. According to him, the village panchayat has already established a Covid care facility in the village where people without access to space to isolate themselves can stay. Baba Seechewal, who is also a member of Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB), has also bought five oxygen concentrators for Covid patients from villages. “Earlier, we had one concentrator and now two days ago, we got four more. People can take these to their homes as doctor’s advise,” he said. Gurdwara Singh Sabha Model Town in Phagwara has also arranged 10 oxygen concentrators and 10 oxygen cylinders that are being provided free to patients who are at home. “A philanthropist from Canada donated 15 concentrators and we started the service over a week ago. We gave five to Vishavkarma temple Phagwara. We don’t ask for any security deposit and people return after use. We have also arranged an operator who fits the machine at patients’ homes,” said gurdwara management committee president Satbir Singh Saabhi. Chanpreet Memorial Charitable Hospital associated with gurdwara in Basti Guzan, Jalandhar, is also running 10-bed level-1 Covid care centre since May 12 with provision of oxygen concentrators and cylinders and two ambulances. “We also provide oxygen to the patients at their homes,” said hospital chairman Kamaljit Singh Bhatia. Similarly, Gurdwara Singh Sabha in Model Town Jalandhar is also set to start the facility after getting five machines from entrepreneur and philanthropist Vikramjit Singh Sahney.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/gold-given-for-gurdwara-pinnacle-to-be-used-to-buy-ambulance-seechewal/articleshow/82894160.cms||IP Singh
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: 68% patients got beds after calling Covid Control Room post HC order||NAGPUR: After orders of the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court, 2,205 (68%) of 3,260 Covid-19 positive patients got admission in hospitals between May 5 and May 22 after contacting the Covid Control Room (CCR) being operated by the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and district administration. As per data available from CCR, less than 4% patients could get beds in hospitals through it before May 5. The NMC had started CCR for admission of positive patients in Covid hospitals during peak of the first wave in August last year. It continued operations during the peak of second wave that started in March this year. The HC on May 2 had directed the NMC and district administration to set up CCR and ensure admission of all patients through it in all hospitals in the district. Accordingly, the NMC on May 4 made it mandatory for all government and private hospitals to admit patients through CCR from May 5. As per data of civil surgeon, the district had registered 41,478 patients May 5 and 22. As per the state government’s guidelines, 20% patients require hospitalization, which means 8,296 patients needed beds. Of them, 2,205 (27%) got beds through CCR. Remaining 73% patients probably directly got admitted to hospitals. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B told TOI, “CCR is doing satisfactory work. Our target is to make bed available to every eligible patient within 30 minutes after contacting CCR. CCR received 6,391 calls between March 25 and May 22. Beds were made available to 3,844 (60.15%) patients. Remaining patients either preferred home quarantine or did not get admitted to hospital chosen by CCR or did not respond to calls,” he said. Convener of Vidarbha Hospitals Association Dr Anup Marar said, “Around 50% of Covid admissions are being routed through CCR. Hospitals have to charge patients at the rates fixed by government for patients referred by the authorities. Therefore, patients who want 80% rate regulation benefits should approach CCR instead of walk-in.” “However, SARI patients turn positive after admission. Also, some patients reach casualty ward of private hospitals in emergency. Private hospitals should be allowed to admit such patients. Instead of creating obstacles, norms should always facilitate healthcare seeker and provider,” he said. Medical officer at CCR Dr Shafiya Fatema said, “We are giving option of three hospitals where beds are available. Achievement of CCR is 67.64% between May 5 and 22. CCR is operating round-the-clock in three shifts at NMC head office,” she said. Giving details about working of the CCR, Dr Fatema said representatives receive call, take detailed information of patients, upload it in software. Four doctors then talk with patients, coordinate with private hospitals for beds. Patients are given OTP which he/she has to tell after reaching the hospital. After uploading the OTP, the hospital gets detail information of the patient in software. Dr Fatema further said software is being updated with latest features. “Patients from rural parts of the district and across city are availing the benefit of CCR. We are even receiving calls from patients in other districts and CCR is facilitating beds for them here,” she said. The daily Covid-19 cases in the district have stabilized at around 1,000. As against 1,042 new cases on Sunday, 2,326 patients recovered. Deaths too have reduced. There were 24 fatalities on Sunday. There have been more recoveries than new cases for last 24 days. Active cases have dropped to 13,934.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/68-patients-got-beds-after-calling-covid-control-room-post-hc-order/articleshow/82891285.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Jagjit Singh, a PCS officer, is heading the inquiry. “To examine the allegations, all three private refilling vendors, Chandigarh Gases, Super Agencies and GPL are directed to provide details of hospitals and Covid centres where cylinders were given, their number, which types were refilled and charges taken. If the allegations are correct, it is a clear case of extortion and the private vendor will face exemplary action in the next few days,” according to the order. The four — Mukut, Sector 34; Healing Hospital, Sector 34; Kare Partners Hospital Sector 19; and Apollo Hospital, Sector 8 — had accused a vendor engaged by the UT administration for refilling oxygen cylinders of overcharging. During a meeting between the hospitals and the UT administration on Saturday, the hospitals complained Super Agencies had charged more from them. They claimed the refilling charges for type D oxygen cylinders were fixed at Rs 295 plus 12% GST, but the hospitals were forced to pay between Rs 600 and Rs 800. The hospitals have to send their representatives to record their statements. “As the hearing is fixed on Monday, you are directed to send your authorised representatives to record their statements along with a formal complaint and supporting documents/evidence,” the order said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/submit-22-day-record-o2-refilling-pvt-agencies-told/articleshow/82889449.cms||Deepak Yadav
---||Delhi||After rain, PWD to put desilting on fast track||New Delhi: Barely a month from the monsoon, public works department (PWD) officials say they have completed 40% of the desilting work. Last year, the desilting of drains by the municipal corporations, PWD and other civic bodies was delayed by over 1.5 months, starting only towards the end of May due to the coronavirus lockdown and the subsequent shortage of labour. This year, too, the work, which usually takes two months, has started only in mid-May, said an official. The monsoon usually hits Delhi by the end of June. Following the recent rain, PWD, which handles major drains, has expedited the process and will increase the number of water suction pumps across the city. It now has 10 hi-tech suction pumps. The desilting work is yet to start at full pace in the areas under the east civic body. A day after AAP blamed the BJP-run corporations for completing only 30-35% desilting, Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor has written to LG Anil Baijal alleging that all drains above 4 feet were cleaned by PWD, Delhi Jal Board and the flood and irrigation department, but the work was yet to start. He claimed work hadn’t started at three major drains, including Barapulla and Najafgarh, which hampered cleaning in connected small drains.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/after-rain-pwd-to-put-desilting-on-fast-track/articleshow/82891305.cms||---
---||Rajkot||National Green Tribunal orders Gujarat to set up panel to clear encroachments in Banni||RAJKOT: In an important judgement to protect Asia’s finest grassland, Banni, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed the Gujarat government to constitute a joint committee of Kutch divisional commissioner and chief conservator of forest ( Kutch) to prepare an action plan within one month clearly defining the extent of encroachments and modalities to clear them. “Some encroachments are claimed to have been removed and tje process to remove the remaining is said to be underway. To enforce the rule of law and to protect the forest lands, meaningful further action should be taken expeditiously and completed within six months. The execution of the action plan may be reviewed by the committee at least once every month,” NGT orders states. In 2018, Banni Pashu Uchherak Maldhari Sangathan (Banni Breeder Associations), a pastoralists’ organization, had moved NGT over a massive encroachment of 18,000 hectares of land in the Banni protected area. The petitioner's grievance was against the continuing of non-forest activities in the grasslands in violation of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 "There are rampant encroachments in Banni protected forests which was declared as protected forest in 1955. Non-forest activities are going on without following the provisions of the FC Act and Scheduled Tribes and other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights, Act, 2006 (FRA, 2006). There is lack of coordination between forest and revenue departments on account of which no effective action is taken for protection of the forests,” the petition stated. Banni grasslands accounts for approximately 45% of the pastures in the state and area comprises 48 hamlets organized into 19 panchayats with a population of approximately 40,000 people.. Petitioner said that the Banni area consists of two ecosystems in juxtaposition; wetlands and grasslands. These grasslands harbour a rich array of flora and fauna including 192 species of plants, 262 species of birds, several species of mammals, reptiles and amphibians. Traditionally, Banni grasslands were managed following a system of rotational grazing. Encroachments are affecting the rights of the tribals, the old Maldharis. Their main occupation is rearing livestock. The Banni grassland is said to have spread over an area of 2,618 sq km and is home to indigenous breeds of livestock – the Banni buffalo and Kankrej cattle. Earlier in July 2019, NGT had ordered the state government to demarcate the boundaries of the grassland and ensure that no non-forest activity was carried out. Kakan Mutwa, a Maldhari from Abhdanga village, said, "The order has brought relief to our community members. I have myself encroached some part of the grassland for agriculture but I am ready to give it back.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/ngt-orders-state-to-set-up-panel-to-clear-encroachments-in-banni/articleshow/82889469.cms||Vijaysinh Parmar
---||Delhi||Idle hands for artisans as Covid punctures incomes||NEW DELHI: It has been nearly a year since Narottam Lal Rai, a craftsman, has found work. Rai used to go to schools across the country and — and had even visited countries like Sri Lanka, Malaysia and Kenya — to conduct crafts workshops. But of late, he has been idling at home for lack of work due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “I conduct workshops in schools on how to make paper flowers and garlands. I also sell books on arts and crafts for Rs 10 each, my main source of income,” said Rai, who lives in Bhatt Camp in Badarpur, home to several artisans and craftspersons like him. “With schools closed, I have had to undertake menial jobs to make ends meet. But even labour work is hard to find due to the lockdown.” Rai used to earn Rs 500-1,000 from each school he visited. Many artistes, including acrobats, puppeteers, magicians, singers and dhol players, too have found their avenues of earnings blocked by the lockdown. Residents of Kathputli Colony, who have been moved to Anand Parbat while their colony is under redevelopment, are among the worst hit. Puppeteer Anil Nat, a resident of the camp at Anand Parbat, said in a dull voice, “We used to perform at cultural events and functions across the country, sometimes even abroad. However, all such events have been cancelled and our income has dried up completely.” The artisans and craftspeople are mostly unread, having learnt their art from elders and passed from one generation to the next. Babu Bhat, 52, a folk singer, said, “I sing folk songs in eight languages and have performed at many events attended by foreign dignitaries. However, beyond this, I know of no other way to earn a livelihood. A labourer cannot become an artist and we cannot do a labourer’s work.” Bhat has borrowed money to tide over his financial drought. Dileep Bhat, who ties turbans on people at events, said, “As artisans, most of our annual earnings come in the wedding season, and we use this money throughout the year. I was booked to attend seven weddings in April and May, but all were cancelled following the lockdown.” Many artisans said their finances had only just started improving by 2020-end, but the surge in Covid cases last month hit them hard. Acrobat Subhash Bhat, 29, said, “When I couldn’t find work last year, I started working in a factory. But I lost that job too when the lockdown was imposed last month. I have no money to provide proper meals to my two children, no money to recharge my phone.” Bandhua Mukti Morcha, an organisation that fights against bonded labour, provided around 450 families in Bhatt Camp with dry rations on Thursday. Its general secretary, Nirmal Gorana, said, “The artisans have been severely impacted over the past one year. Even when the lockdown was lifted, there was hardly any work for them. Moreover, many families do not have ration cards. The government should give them financial assistance of Rs 10,000 each and provide free food grains and essentials.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/idle-hands-for-artisans-as-covid-punctures-incomes/articleshow/82891361.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

The civic administration should get its share from the state government. It will help carry out Covid-19 mitigation work,” Hemant Rasane, standing committee chairman, said. The civic body has urgently sought Rs 176 crore. According to civic officials, they had decided to reduce their budget expenditure due to poor revenue generation in 2020-21 and introduced a 40 % cut. Only essential services, mandatory and emergency works were allocated funds. “Our revenue sources are limited. The share that the state gives from stamp duty is one of the key incomes. If utilised properly, the civic body will be able to survive this financial crises,” a senior PMC official said. A number of initiatives include procurement and free distribution of lifesaving injections. “We have been spending on pandemic-related works. Funds from state government should come and they will be used for the pandemic’control,” Rasane added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-wants-state-to-give-stamp-duty-dues-of-rs-176cr/articleshow/82891276.cms||---

Unlike last year, when most travellers had cancelled their trips, this year many have postponsed them to a later date after proper planning. “No one is going on vacation at present. However, a sizeable number of people, who had booked their trips in the summer months, have rescheduled them to November or December. There have been cancellations, but there are also many trips being rescheduling,” a city-based travel agent said. A working professional Vivek Kulkarni, who had planned a trip to Darjeeling in May, decided to postpone it to December. “Last year, I had planned the same trip with my family, but once the pandemic hit, I panicked and cancelled it. Last year, Covid-19 was new for all of us. So, once the second wave hit in April, rather than cancelling again, I moved it to December,” Kulkarni said. Travel company representatives told TOI that travellers were planning the rescheduling of their trips carefully and meticulously. “There are clients that are closely studying the spike in cases and comparing the same with last year. A client had booked a trip to Goa in February after looking at the trend last year when the spread had started March onwards. However, he couldn’t travel due to some reasons and rescheduled his trip to November-end again after seeing that last year too, cases had dropped in November,” a representative of a travel company said. Amol Choudhary, who had planned a trip to Kolkata with his wife had to reschedule it to October. “If things don’t improve, we will further reschedule it for early next year,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/many-travellers-choose-rescheduling-over-cancelling-trips-during-2nd-wave/articleshow/82891290.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Pune||Key software can track corona beds live: Experts||Pune: Experts who are helping the PMC revamp its Covid beds dashboard have urged the civic body to consider using a medical management tool called HL7, or Health Level 7, for hospitals. The revamp was launched after the Bombay High Court recently slammed the PMC for gaps in its bed-tracking system. The HL7 tool, experts said, will help the PMC track beds in real-time. HL7 is a set of standards (messaging formats) for transfer of data between applications used by healthcare providers. Simply put, it allows hospitals to 'talk' to each other. The National Digital Health Blueprint of India, released in November 2019, had recommended HL7 to be the de facto standard for healthcare interoperability (exchange of information). Hospitals only need to integrate this framework with in-house software. Sanjay Patil, chairman of the IMA’s Hospital Board of India, said, “The IMA’s help has been sought to plug gaps in the PMC's beds dashboard. We have experts who have been advocating use of HL7 since Covid broke.” Pune’s Covid bed dashboard, plagued by lags, relies on manual data entry. “A hospital now has to share data on Covid patients, bed availability, drugs availability and oxygen supply with authorities every day. We need a system that makes this tedious data entry work easier. HL7 has the potential to connect all hospitals,” Patil said. Most city hospitals have robust electronic medical record (EMR) systems. “Integration of EMR systems with HL7 shouldn't be a problem. We are going to discuss this matter with PMC officials this week," Patil said. HL7 could speed up bed allotment. “Dashboard data changes according to admissions and discharges. Manual updates can be tedious. But HL7 can ensure real-time updates without the need for manpower,” said medical informatics expert Rajeev Joshi, who is helping PMC revamp the dashboard."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/key-software-can-track-corona-beds-live-experts/articleshow/82891309.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The other accused, Kishore Kashinath Gawali (57), had been working for the 75-year-old Johrabai Akbarali Shaikh. They used to procure drugs from Himachal Pradesh and sell them to various clients for the past eight to 10 years. The duo has been booked under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 and remanded to police custody till May 27. The crime branch (Unit 7) led by inspector Manish Sridhannkar and assistant police inspectors Anand Bagade and Sunaina Sonawane received information that an old lady from Waterfield Road had been selling drugs. The police team laid a trap and detained Gawali, who was waiting for a client. They recovered seven small packets of charas from his bag. “We verified the drugs with a drug testing kit to confirm the same following which we interrogated Gawali. He revealed that he had been working for Johrabai since childhood and had no family of his own,” said Sridhannkar. The cops raided Shaikh’s house and recovered 3.8kg of charas. “We seized the purest form of charas procured from Himachal Pradesh,” said the police. The cops are now trying to find the source of the drugs and how the woman never came under the radar of the agency as she claims to have been a drug peddler for 10 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-75-yr-old-woman-aide-held-with-charas-worth-rs-1-crore/articleshow/82894203.cms||Ahmed Ali

While panic shopping drove people in huge numbers to grocery stores and markets a day before another week-long complete lockdown kicked in, it also showed that the newly-elected government has a long a way to go to break the chain of the virus. Chaos prevailed in crowded market areas such as TK Market, Ukkadam vegetable market, TK Market and grocery shops across the city, where narrow roads and the population density does not allow for Covid appropriate behaviour, through Sunday. At shopping hubs and other places, physical distancing went for a toss despite warnings that hefty monetary fines would be slapped on violators. Vegetable prices shot up manifold as demand rose due to short supply from farms. “More than 50,000 people visited TK Market on Sunday to buy vegetables. We don’t have any stock to sell after 3pm,” said A M Shajahan, a vegetable seller. A kilogram of beans, which was sold for Rs 60 on Saturday, was sold for Rs 200 on Sunday. Tomato was sold for Rs 50 (Rs 20 on Saturday), brinjal for Rs 80 (Rs 40), beetroot for Rs 60 (Rs 20), carrot for Rs 60 (Rs 40), cabbage for Rs 30 (Rs 15), lemon for Rs 120 (Rs 70), bitter gourd for Rs 80 (Rs 40), big onion for Rs 50 (Rs 25) and 1.5 kg of small onion for Rs 100 (Rs 50). “People stocked up on vegetables and essential items as shops won’t open for a week,” Shajahan added. Though most of the customers wore masks, they failed to maintain social distancing. Meanwhile, people thronged bus terminals to leave for their native places, mostly to southern districts. The Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) operated buses to Tirupur, Erode, Salem, Madurai, Mettupalayam, Pollachi, Udumalpet, Palani and Trichy from Coimbatore city. Thousands of people were gathered at Singanallur bus stand, Ukkadam bus stand and Coimbatore central bus stand. The Tamil Nadu State Express Transport Corporation (TNSETC) operated buses to southern districts. To enforce lockdown norms, the city police will deploy 1,000 cops from Monday morning. People can step out only for medical emergencies, deputy commissioner of police G Stalin said. “We will book anyone found loitering and seize their vehicles,” he said. The rural police will deploy 750 cops. The situation wasn’t any different in the state’s capital city. “The efforts of frontline workers all these days are being negated because of policy decisions like this. To blame everything on public indiscipline is also unfair as the authorities gave only one-and-a-half day for people and naturally panic mode creeps in. The decision makers should have thought better,” said S Srinivasan, a resident of Velachery in Chennai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/madness-on-lockdown-eve-protocols-go-for-a-six/articleshow/82891314.cms||---

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) also predicted overcast conditions from Wednesday with thunderstorms and lightning till Saturday. On Sunday, several areas of the district received light spells of rain in the evening hours. Shivajinagar and Lohegaon recorded 0.1mm and 1mm rainfall, respectively. Anupam Kashyapi, the head of the weather forecast division of the IMD, Pune, said, “The weather condition of four meteorological regions — Vidarbha, Marathwada, Madhya Maharashtra, Konkan and Goa — is mainly governed by the trough line between Eastern Uttar Pradesh and Coastal Karnataka, at present, because of which the Pune city will get light rainfall with thunderstorms and lightning in the evening hours till Tuesday.” The maximum temperatures of the city throughout the week were likely to remain in the range of 36°C to 38°C, an official from the met department said. On Sunday, Shivajinagar recorded the maximum temperature at 35.3°C, which was below normal by one degree Celsius. The Lohegaon observatory recorded the maximum temperature on Sunday as 37.2°C, which was above normal by 1.2 degrees Celsius. “In the last few days, the city’s day temperature has reduced by one or two degrees Celsius because of the rainfall activity and overcast conditions in the afternoon hours,” a met official said. On progress of the Southwest monsoon, an official from the met department said that it was likely to set in over Kerala during the next two weeks, particularly between May 27 and June 2. “The progress of the monsoon is positive and it is most likely to hit the mainland before June 1, a day ahead of its normal onset date,” the met official added. This would also mark the beginning of the four-month rainfall season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/city-to-receive-light-rain-with-thunderstorm-imd/articleshow/82891341.cms||Sandip Dighe

The deceased was identified as M Chinnathangam alias Subbulakshmi, 60, of Vellimalaipattinam. The accused, P Veerasamy, 49, of Vellimalaipattinam, had borrowed Rs 50,000 from Subbulakshmi last year and failed to pay the interest amount. Veerasamy is a farmer. On May 8, Subbulakshmi went to Veerasamy’s house and reprimanded him for not paying the interest amount. On the same day around 12.30pm, Veerasamy contacted Subbulakshmi over the phone and informed her that he had arranged the money. He even invited her to visit his house to receive the money. When Subbulakshmi visited Veerasamy’s house, he offered a tablet as vitamin tablet as she looked feeble. After taking the tablet, she developed dizziness. Veerasamy took Subbulakshmi in a car to a hospital. When the car reached Pollachi-Negaman road, Veerasamy stopped the car on the roadside and attacked Subbulakshmi using an iron rod and snatched gold ornaments from her. Thinking that Subbulakshmi is dead, Veerasamy dumped her in the PAP canal. People who were grazing cattle in the area noticed the elderly woman in the canal and alerted 108 ambulance service. The elderly woman was admitted to the Pollachi government hospital. She was shifted to a private hospital on May 13. Meanwhile, Subbulakshmi tested positive for Covid-19 on May 15 and was shifted to CMCH from the private hospital. She died without responding to the treatment on Saturday evening. Based on Subbulakshmi son M Jagadeesh Kumar’s complaint, the Alandur police arrested Veerasamy under section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/farmer-held-for-killing-60-year-old-woman/articleshow/82891323.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore inches close to 4,000 daily Covid-19 cases||Coimbatore: While the pandemic situation seemed to get better in cities like Chennai and Madurai, it turned gloomier than ever on Sunday in Coimbatore.There were 3,944 fresh Covid-19 cases detected in Coimbatore. It was not only the highest ever in Coimbatore, but the highest any district other than Chennai reported in Tamil Nadu. Making the situation worse, the number of people diagnosed with mucormycosis (black fungus) also increased to 12 as one more person got admitted with the infection on Sunday.With a far lesser number of people treated and discharged from hospitals than the number of people infected every day, the number of active cases too continued to grow exponentially.Ten days ago, the district had 16,271 active cases, but on Sunday the numbers almost doubled to reach 31,578 after 2,454 people got discharged.In contrast, the number of active cases saw a steady decline in Chennai. The number of deaths however saw a drop from 32 on Saturday to 21 on Sunday.However, much of the infected were under home isolation. According to health officials, 19,695 patients, about 62% of the total infected in the district, were under home isolation.That helped reduce pressure on the health infrastructure to a large extent, but the shortage of beds in hospitals continued with people clamouring for beds, particularly those equipped with oxygen support.According to the district health bulletin, there was not even a single oxygen-equipped bed available in Coimbatore Medical College Hospital, ESI Hospital or other government hospitals in Pollachi or Mettupalayam. All the 1,203 beds were occupied. The 250-odd ICU beds in these government hospitals were also full. The situation in private hospitals was not any better. Out of the 2,757 O2 beds in the 70 private hospitals that treat Covid patients, only 34 were available for occupancy as of Sunday evening.As far as ICU beds were concerned only 11 were unoccupied out of 456 available.Health authorities however said that more treatment facilities are being opened to accommodate the patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/coimbatore-inches-close-to-4000-daily-covid-19-cases/articleshow/82891311.cms||---

Admissions to most professional courses are based on entrance exams and many experts have given their views that it was possible to evaluate the performance of Std XII students based on a retroactive assessment model and a uniform assessment policy, Gaikwad told TOI after attending a video-conference of education ministers from all the states with Union minister of education Ramesh Pokhriyal on Sunday. “Most of the states are of the same opinion and are considering the no exam route. We will examine the legalities before a final call,” she said. For now, the focus would be on evolving a uniform assessment policy, vaccination of all teachers and eligible students and safe resumption of schools, colleges campuses for the next academic year, she added. Gaikwad said, “The health and mental well-being of children and their families must be our priority. Students, parents have been sharing their concerns regarding taking exams amid the pandemic. Students have been studying in Std XII for over 14 months. Personally, I believe that we should remove the uncertainty regarding exams and make a decision that is in the students’ interest.” The Union education ministry has sought feedback from the states on two options it has proposed for conducting the CBSE Std XII exams.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/edu-min-backs-no-exam-route-for-cbse-std-xii/articleshow/82891315.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

On Thursday, Viradiya, who was on BiPAP, went live on Facebook to chat with his friends and talked about meeting them soon. But that was not to be. The chat was the last when they saw their friend. Suffering from post-Covid complications, Viradiya breathed his last on Saturday. After catching the infection around 17 days back, Viradiya had tested negative for Covid-19 recently and was looking forward to getting discharged, one of his friends told TOI . “During the FB chat Viradiya told us that he wanted to come to Gondal as soon as he got discharged from the hospital. In fact, I had told him that I would come to Ahmedabad on Sunday and take him to Gondal,” Tushar Viradiya, a close friend of Deepak Viradiya, told TOI. Three years back the Viradiya had shifted to Ahmedabad from the Rajkot district town. Viradiya used to run a restaurant at his native Gondal before he moved to Ahmedabad for better education of his son. “We were heartbroken by the news of the passing away of our dear friend. We are all in shock. Viradiya would put his heart and soul into helping people in need. He was President of Sardar Patel group. Because of his kind nature, he had a huge friend circle and he remembered friends in his last days,” an inconsolable Tushar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/covid-man-dies-after-fb-chat-with-friends/articleshow/82889495.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Civic body goofs up, hands over 6.7 acre land it did not own to SAI||NAGPUR: The construction of the much-anticipated regional sub centre of the Sports Authority of India (SAI) in South Nagpur (in Wathoda and Tarodi) has hit a roadblock. The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has given advance possession of the 6.76 acre private land – which is a part of the 87.23 acre land – to SAI for its regional sub centre. The goof-up has further delayed the ongoing SAI project indefinitely. The NMC’s property tax department submitted a proposal before the general body meeting to be held on May 28 for measurement and acquiring land for SAI. In the past, the civic body had handed over 140.25 acres of land to SAI, which also had the state government’s approval. It came to the fore that of the total land allocated to SAI, almost 60 acres was occupied by residential localities. So, it was decided to hand over only the vacant land of Wathoda and Tarodi localities for SAI’s project, which is around 87 acres. According to sources in the estate department, the NMC had given advance possession of 13.18 acre in Wathoda to SAI. Here, all the land was owned by the civic body. However, in Tarodi, where it gave 74.05 acres in advance to SAI, it was found that the land was owned by different people at five places. Sources asked as to how did the NMC give advance possession of land to SAI. Earlier too it made the same mistake. Initially, some portion of the land in both areas was reserved by the Nagpur Improvement Trust for garbage disposal but NIT could not implement the scheme for 40 years. Under the land acquisition rules, if the government failed to implement any scheme for 10 years, the land must be returned to its original owners, but this did not happen. Since 1961, the government has not mutated the name of NMC on the 7/12 extracts. So, the original owners, through societies, sold the plots. Apart from the protest by project-affected people, the civic body had also witnessed opposition from elected representatives like BJP MLA Krishna Khopde and Congress MLC Abhijit Wanjari among others, which led the NMC and state government to reduce the land allotment to SAI and also shift its location. Presently, hundreds of concrete houses have come up in 5.28 acres in Tarodi. Like in the past, the NMC will face hurdles and stiff opposition from the affected residents in getting possession of the land. Sources said the NMC will acquire the required land and will ensure the project gets started at the earliest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/civic-body-goofs-up-hands-over6-7-acre-land-it-did-not-own-to-sai/articleshow/82891346.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

Meanwhile, the meteorological department has predicted dry weather across the state for the next few days. While the Yamunotri highway remains blocked near Kisala in Uttarkashi, the Badrinath highway got obstructed after a 50-metre-long stretch of the road at the Radang bend caved in due to heavy rainfall on May 20. Officials told TOI that the restoration work is underway and it might take some more time to repair the damaged stretches due to the downpour that lashed the hills on May 19 and 20. Devendra Patwal, disaster management officer of Uttarkashi district,said, “Pokland and JCB machines are working round the clock to clear the boulders and debris from NH-94 near Kisala. We faced some difficulty in removing the big boulders. Light vehicles will be allowed to pass through the highway after the work gets completed. On the other hand, the restoration of vehicular movement on the Badrinath highway at Radang bend might take a couple of more days. The officials are saying that the required number of machines and manpower has been pressed into service to repair the damaged part of the caved-in road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/badrinath-yamunotri-highways-blocked-for-the-fourth-consecutive-day-due-to-heavy-rains/articleshow/82889487.cms||Gaurav Talwar

The number is much higher than Saturday’s 36 centres. The new Covishield stock (35,000 doses) landed late on Saturday evening. It allowed vaccine coverage in the region to regain some pace. A total of 10,664 beneficiaries were vaccinated on Sunday across PMC and PCMC limits. Vaccine drives were paused in Pune rural areas. Nearly 6,000 beneficiaries from the 45-plus group were given their first jabs. In the 65-plus category, nearly 2,836 people got their first shots. The PMC’s vaccine-on-wheels initiative also saw some success on Sunday with 180 residents of the Niwara old-age home vaccinated on site. Photos from the drive were posted on Twitter by Rubal Agarwal, additional commissioner, PMC. In their statements to the press, the PMC and the PCMC said vaccination for the 45-plus will continue on Monday as well. The PMC’s statement read, “For the first-dose booking of the 45-plus group, slots will be opened at 8am on Monday. The vaccination drive will be held across 65 CVCs and only Covishield will be available across the said venues. Around 60% of first doses will be made available through online booking, while 20% will be available via offline mode, that is via walk-in mode. The rest of the 20% will be reserved for the second-dose beneficiaries.”Officials from the PCMC said nearly 33 of their CVCs will hold drives on Monday. But commissioners of both the civic bodies did not offer comments on Covaxin availability. Data shows at least 50,000 people are waiting in line for a Covaxin second dose in the region.Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said, “Covaxin availability is currently scarce. We’re not sure when the supply will streamline.” On Sunday, a total of 6,640 beneficiaries were vaccinated in PMC limits. Another 4,000 were given jabs in PCMC limits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/fresh-covishield-supply-gives-temporary-boost-to-vax-drive/articleshow/82891370.cms||Piyush Bhusari

---||Nagpur||Maharashtra lost 87 leopards in 140 days; 33 in road accidents||NAGPUR: In Maharashtra, one leopard is dying every two days. Officially, in the last 140 days, 87 leopards have died in the state. If the deaths keep happening at this speed, the majestic cat may become a rare sight. Of the 87 deaths, 47 are claimed to be natural and 33 due to road accidents. Road hits continue to be a major cause for concern. As per official data, two leopards were poached, one electrocuted, while three died due to unknown reasons. However, on January 5-6, 2021 two leopards were poached in the Goregaon range in the Gondia forest division. This was followed by poisoning of two animals in Bhandara in February. One animal was poached in the Sadak Arjuni range this month. Overall, in Bhandara and Gondia districts alone, five leopards have been poached. According to the database of wildlife law enforcement NGO Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI), nine cases of poaching and seizure of leopard body parts have been recorded in Maharashtra since January 1, 2021. “Road accidents appear to be the biggest reason behind unnatural deaths of leopards in the state. Widening of roads and increased speeds of vehicles are resulting in many animals being killed. Better mitigation measures need to be taken to avoid such deaths,” said Nitin Desai, director, WPSI. In 2020, 172 leopard deaths were recorded in the state. This was a 57% jump as compared to 2019 when the toll was 110. Stung by a large number of deaths, the 16th meeting of the State Wildlife Board (SWBL) chaired by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had announced to set up an 11-member technical group of experts and officials to suggest measures to curb leopard-human conflict. “We are ready with the draft report, but owing to Covid-19 spread, the committee was unable to meet. We will meet and submit the report to PCCF (wildlife) soon,” said M Adarsh Reddy, deputy conservator of forests (DyCF) who is member-secretary of the expert group. The road widening projects are the biggest threat to big cats. This can be gauged from the fact that in 2020, 34 leopards had died in road accidents during the entire year. In 2021, 33 leopards have died in less than five months. As per the MoEFCC's ‘Status of leopards in India’ report released in December last year, Maharashtra has 1,690 leopards, which is the third-largest population in the country. Madhya Pradesh has the highest number of leopards (3,421), followed by Karnataka (1,783). “Having more leopards doesn’t mean these animals should be left to die. Every small road in the state is being widened despite low traffic volume. The highways ministry and PWD is expanding more than 15,000km roads. It is high time forest department, NHAI and PWD together decide on mitigation measures,” said green activist Shrikant Deshpande.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/state-lost-87-leopards-in-140-days-33-in-road-accidents/articleshow/82891364.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Hospital authorities said they’re now making plans to call up 7,000 people who are due for the follow-up. As of May 22, the hospital has given 15,672 people a single dose of Covaxin. Nearly 8,000 have been given both jabs. The hospital site, which started off as the city’s only Covaxin centre, was seeing good turnouts until vaccine shortages started to impact coverage. Its vaccination drive has been suspended since Saturday, May 22. The drive for the 18-44 group has been on pause since May 11. A hospital official said the number of beneficiaries who’re due for their second dose could increase if adequate Covaxin supplies don’t land over the next few days or weeks. “The stock we’ve been getting is so less that we’re not able to cover more than 100 beneficiaries daily. On good days, we used to vaccinate at least 300 people,” the official said, requesting anonymity. Hospital authorities said they will start making the calls to their list of 7,000 people once supply resumes. “The phone calls will start at 9am every day, until we have covered the entire list. We know the process will take time, but it has to be done,” another hospital official said. Currently, both the PMC and the PCMC don't have enough Covaxin stock to cover first-dose beneficiaries. In Pimpri Chinchwad, PCMC officials said they have more than 24,000 beneficiaries who're due for a Covaxin second dose. The officials said this number could increase to 50,000 if the waiting lists from Pune city and Pune rural areas are added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/covaxin-site-to-call-all-7000-people-due-for-second-dose/articleshow/82891378.cms||Piyush Bhusari

On Sunday, Union cabinet ministers held a virtual meeting with education ministers from all states and sought their views about conducting these exams. Even though autonomous institutes conduct these exams, it’s important to bring states on board as exam centres will be located in their geographical jurisdiction. Maharashtra school education minister Varsha Gaikwad stressed on the need for “non-examination route” but kept her options open, citing pending discussions with state chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. Gaikwad said, “Keeping in mind the ongoing pandemic situation and the projection that children are vulnerable to new strains of coronavirus, option of a non-exam route for Std XII students should be actively examined. Health and mental well-being of children, their families must be our priority. Students and parents have been sharing their concerns regarding sitting for exams amid the pandemic.” She added that the government focus should now be on evolving a uniform assessment policy, vaccination of all teachers, students and safe resumption of in-campus schools and colleges in the next academic year. Defence minister Rajnath Singh presided over the meet along with education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal, Smriti Irani and Prakash Javdekar. Both Irani and Javdekar have held the Union education minister (previously HRD) portfolio. Pokhriyal said Sunday’s meet had been called “to enable central and state boards and other examination agencies to be able to examine various options available in the present challenging circumstances through a consultation process”. The discussions were held around two themes, board exams to be conducted for Class XII by the Central Board of Secondary Education and other state boards, and the All-India entrance examinations for various higher education institutions and professional courses. Various options regarding the methodology, process, duration and timings of the exams were discussed. Singh reiterated that the priority of the government is to conduct all examinations in a safe and secure environment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cbse-xii-exam-states-to-send-suggestions-by-may-25-to-centre/articleshow/82891387.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

The recurring issue faced by the residents of the area is frequent overflowing of sewage water and storm water on the 12-feet road during heavy rain.“In the last two weeks, sewage water overflowed from manholes several times. When we complain, municipal workers clear blocks,” said a resident. “There needs to be a permanent solution to the issue. Many of the portions of the sewage pipe are broken underneath the road. Walking on the sewage-run road is a miserable experience.”Also, a part of the road is on the verge of caving in, posing a threat to 20 houses in the area. “When heavy vehicle pass, the road might cave in along with the side revetment. Despite complaints, municipal officials turned a blind eye to the serious issue,” said Sathesh Premnath, another resident.The narrow, curvy road is also used as a parking area, interrupting traffic flow. Police don’t regulate parking on the road.“The drainage line in Missionary Hill needs to be relayed.

---||Nagpur||Stock up on IVIG for kids before third wave, task force tells admn||Nagpur: The paediatric task force members have in the last week apprised the district guardian minister Nitin Raut and the administration regarding the importance of ‘Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG)’ required to treat Multisystem inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) and neonates (MIC-N) in severe Covid or post-Covid cases during the anticipated third wave of the pandemic. The task force was created last week to recommend protocols, standard operating procedures (SOP) and help the administration to prepare and tackle the projected third wave when, it is feared, more children may be affected. Against the backdrop of the chaotic short-supply of Remdesivir during second Covid wave followed by ongoing shortage of Amphotericin B to treat mucormycosis, the task force members had underlined the fact that IVIG would be needed to treat almost every MIS-C or MIS-N patient for which an optimum preparation should be undertaken. The meeting was also participated by the divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar and collector Ravindra Thakare. The state-owned institutions like Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMCH) and AIIMS also have submitted proposals with the administration regarding their requirement of equipment and gadgets for scaling up the infrastructure in anticipation of third wave which may hit after July-August. Dr Dipty Jain, head of the department of the paediatrics, GMCH, and also a task force member, said, “Though the occurrence of MIS is less in count but there are cases coming in. Drugs and means of investigations should not be in short supply.” Dr Meenakshi Girish, head of the department of paediatrics, AIIMS, also member of the task force, said six to eight weeks after the exposure to Covid is crucial period for the children. Parents must approach the paediatricians if there is fever. “Several features of MIS-C could be subtle and may not be identified by the caretakers and hence fever is required to be reported. We have been getting inquiries every week regarding post-Covid complications in children,” she said. Dr Meenakshi also said occurrence of MIS would certainly require IVIG, use of steroids and hospitalization, among other things. “If IVIG cannot be administered to the patients when required, MIS would lead to long term damage especially cardiac complications. Following the second wave, we are seeing many children suffering with MIS in different hospitals,” she said adding AIIMS is building infrastructure for the time of need despite the paucity of skilled manpower. Dr Chandrakant Bokade, head of the department of paediatrics, IGGMCH, and also member of the task force, said a request was also placed before the guardian minister and other senior officials to include MIS in Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana so that the poor would not have to bear the high cost of IVIG which is between Rs 60,000-Rs 80,000. “MIS can affect the heart, the vessels carrying blood to the heart, kidney, liver and other parts and hence IVIG is required without second thought,” he said. Renowned paediatrician Dr Kush Jhunjhunwala, said government could contemplate directly approaching the manufacturers of IVIG and procure stocks so there are no over-pricing or hoarding like malpractices experienced with Remdesivir, Amphotericin B and other drugs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/stock-up-on-ivig-for-kids-before-third-wave-task-force-tells-admn/articleshow/82891449.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Chandigarh||‘Punjab govt stood by you, now stand by us in Covid fight’||CHANDIGARH: Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Sunday urged Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan) not to go ahead with its proposed protest in Patiala, saying that it could turn into a super-spreader for Covid-19. Amarinder added the group’s action was unwarranted, considering the total support the state government had extended to agitating farmers all these months on the issue of the Centre’s three farm laws. “It is time for farmers now to reciprocate by supporting the state government in the fight against the pandemic,” he said, adding that just as the farmers’ interests were inexorably linked with that of Punjab, so was Punjab’s interest dependent on the farmers’ support to his government in the battle against Covid. Refuting the allegations of Punjab government’s failure to effectively tackle the Covid pandemic, Amarinder said his government fought hard to prevent the state going the way of some other states, such as Delhi, Maharashtra and even Uttar Pradesh, where bodies floating in the Ganga river had exposed mismanagement by the BJP-ruled state. He underlined that any event, such as the proposed three-day dharna of the BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) in Patiala, had the potential to negate the gains made by his government in tackling Covid in the state. He also urged the group not to act irresponsibly and jeopardise the lives of their own people, especially when there was a ban on all gatherings and any violation would be highly detrimental to the interests of Punjab and its people. He pointed out that there were no widespread shortages of oxygen in hospitals despite shortfall in supply, as the state government had ensured judicious management of the critical commodity. Amarinder claimed that even availability of medications and beds had been continuously ramped up to keep pace with spiralling cases. This, he pointed out, was in sharp contrast to states like Delhi, Maharashtra and UP, among others. The only serious problem being faced by Punjab was the shortage of vaccines, which was not due to any mismanagement of the state government but that of the central government, he added. The chief minister said because of the concerted efforts of the state government, the number of Covid cases had come down, but there was no scope for any laxity in Covid-appropriate behaviour at the moment, and rallies or dharnas of any kind were unacceptable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pb-govt-stood-by-you-now-stand-by-us-in-covid-fight/articleshow/82891401.cms||---
---||Pune||In Pune rural, small wins against Covid as number of ‘hotspot villages’ drops||PUNE: The number of villages designated as Covid hotspots in Pune rural areas has reduced from 464 to 397 (between April 28 and May 19). Officials said there’s still work to be done as overall, the 397 still make up 28% of the 1,400 villages in the 13 tehsils that make up Pune rural. A village is a 'hotspot' if it has more than 10 active cases. In Daund, Ambegaon and Bhor, the number of 'hotspot' villages have, in fact, increased. Ayush Prasad, CEO of the zilla parishad, said, “In March, we had 226 hotspot villages. The number rose to 465 in one month. We're now seeing a decline for the first time in three months. A village loses its 'hotspot' tag if it reports no new cases. Prasad said, “A village can be a hotspot even if it has one admitted Covid patient. It takes three to four weeks, at least, to achieve the 'no new cases’ status.” Dr Manoj Khomne, tehsil health officer of Baramati — where hotspot villages have dropped from 52 to 48 in a week — said the area was under strict curbs for the last two weeks. “We also continued to test aggressively by deploying rapid test kits and door-to-door surveys. Our focus was on early detection,” he said. Dr BB Gadve, tehsil health officer in Khed, which saw hotspots go from 49 to 40 within a week, said more than 20,000 tests via rapid kits were carried out in three weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/in-pune-rural-small-wins-against-covid-as-number-of-hotspot-villages-drops/articleshow/82891394.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Pune||Maharashtra: 105km eastern ring road to wind through 46 villages in five tehsils||PUNE: The state Public Works Department (PWD) has granted permission to the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) to carry out a joint measurement survey for the proposed 105km eastern ring road, starting from the Urse toll plaza on the Pune-Mumbai expressway. Sandeep Patil, the MSRDC’s sub-divisional engineer told TOI on Friday, “The stretch will pass through areas under Maval, Khed, Haveli, Daund and Purandar tehsils before emerging on the Pune-Satara highway which is part of the Mumbai-Bengaluru national highway. Currently, we are conducting survey for the western ring road and a second team is being set up to conduct the eastern ring road survey work, starting in next two weeks.” The eastern ring road will pass through 46 villages of these tehsils. The MSRDC and district administration will have to acquire a total about 1,585 hectares, including about 859 hectares of private land, totally worth approximately Rs 5,000 crore, said the MSRDC officials. “The land acquisition in these tehsils would be a daunting task considering the value and possible resistance from the farmers and land owners. We will have to conduct a series of meeting with them to convince them to give their lands for the project. We are chalking out our strategy. The district collector has already appointed land acquisition officials from the revenue department. We will be working with the department,” a senior official from the MSRDC said. “The purposed road would reduce traffic congestion significantly in Talegaon Dhabade and Chakan MIDC areas as heavy vehicles would get direct connectivity to state and national highways. Currently, these vehicles ply through towns and cities and are creating traffic issue in these industrial zones,” the official further said. Meanwhile, the MSRDC has completed land survey of 170 hectares of land that is required for purposed 68 km western ring road which, will pass through Maval, Mulshi, Haveli and Bhor. “Five villages, three in Bhor and two in Maval have opposed the survey. We are going to conduct meetings with them,” Patil, who makes presentation to the project affected families in the meeting, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/105km-eastern-ring-road-to-wind-through-46-villages/articleshow/82891422.cms||Sandip Dighe

---||Bareilly||Uttar Pradesh: Groom attacked, chased away from mandap by bride’s relatives, wedding finally solemnized inside thana||BAREILLY: It was quite a wedlock in UP’s Shahjahanpur when a bride and groom had to wed near the lockup. It started off normally and the groom was ready and happy but the bride's family, tipsy and a bit wild, beat up his relatives and chased him away from his own mandap. Police intervened as protection was required from the very guests who had been invited. But the ending wasn't as disastrous. After running around in circles for hours, the one venue that was found to be safe was the thana. The couple got married at the police station, guarded by cops, in Shahjahanpur. It was 2.30 am by then. The groom took the seven steps of promise with the bride around the sacred fire with a fractured limb. Kamlesh Verma, 25, is a postgraduate in computer application and works in Delhi. His father had fixed his marriage with Kranti Verma, 22, who is the daughter of their distant relative Ram Avtaar Verma. The couple had been in touch with each other over the phone for some time. On Saturday, Kamlesh arrived along with a wedding procession but the relatives of the bride kept on misbehaving with the guests. Suddenly, a cousin of the bride smacked Kamlesh’s father Ram Krishna. After Ram Krishna fell on the floor, Kamlesh and his elder brother Vimlesh tried to intervene but a few people started thrashing them with batons. It happened all of a sudden and they had no option but to run away from the venue. The groom’s brother, Vimlesh, told TOI, “We never thought that such a thing could happen. Kranti’s father is very innocent and doesn’t even consume liquor. Later, we came to know that the brother-in-law of Kranti wanted her to marry his relative and he planned all such things to get the wedding cancelled. He almost succeeded, but thanks to the policemen who not only saved us but also saved the marriage.” Kamlesh said, “I was very scared with several drunken people pushing and shoving us around. I don’t have any problem with Kranti’s family as I know that they are innocent, but I will never go to her village. I have a hairline fracture and the doctor has asked me to rest for at least 15 days.” Kranti’s father Ram Avtaar said, “I wanted to marry my daughter in my native village, but I didn’t know that my relatives would create so many problems. I am thankful to the police for ensuring that my daughter’s wedding was solemnised on the same night.” RC Mission police station SHO Sanjay Singh said, “Sub-Inspector Vivek Singh had attended the stress call and he told me that the relatives of the bride are creating problems. I asked them to complete the remaining rituals inside our police station. We have a small temple on the campus where the wedding was finally solemnised at 2.30am. The couple remained at the police station till 6.30am and were sent back home under police security. We will register an FIR if a complaint is filed by the groom or his family.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/groom-attacked-chased-away-from-mandap-by-brides-relatives-wedding-finally-solemnized-inside-thana/articleshow/82887747.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Nagpur||Covid spend led to RTE reimbursement cut: Maharashtra minister Varsha Gaikwad||NAGPUR: The decision to cut RTE reimbursements for schools by more than half was taken due to paucity of funds in state coffers, said school education minister Varsha Gaikwad. Maharashtra government had on Wednesday slashed reimbursements, for free RTE quota admissions, to Rs8,000 per child per year from earlier Rs17,670. Speaking exclusively to TOI, Gaikwad said, “Due to Covid-19, all financial resources have been prioritized to deal with the pandemic.” The minister, who herself is a qualified teacher, said she will push for extra fund allocation. “I will be taking up the issue with finance minister Jayant Patil to see how we can get extra funds for the department. It’s a tough situation and everyone’s trying their best,” said Gaikwad. Non-minority private schools have to provide free admissions to students selected by the state government under 25% RTE quota. In lieu of the free admissions, state reimburses them an amount that’s fixed in advance. RTE costs are borne by both the Centre (65%) and state (35%). But one can’t count on central government’s share, according to education officials. Dattatrey Jagtap, state education director who signed the reimbursement cut circular, said, “The central government share comes to us much later. First, we have to spend out of the state coffers. But this year, we had to resize our allocation to RTE reimbursements.” Schools, however, are unhappy saying this will have an impact on those 75% students who are paying full fees. RTE Foundation, an association of schools, feels the state government is ‘ignoring’ education. Sachin Kalbande, founder-president of the association, said, “Ever since RTE was implemented, reimbursements have been a point of friction because of the poor handling by successive state governments. Crores of rupees are pending with the government and it seems they keep coming up with innovative excuses to either delay or deny payments. The central government gives them Rs28,000 per year per child, but Maharashtra has been paying us far less than that.” Kalbande added that for academic year 2021-22, they have decided not to entertain new RTE admissions. “Enough time has been given to the education department to resolve RTE payment issues. But it’s clear that they want to drag this thing out, hence we have decided to not process any RTE admission this year,” said Kalbande. Independent English Schools Association president Rajendra Dayma said the members will now approach the courts. “This decision will destroy schools financially. As it is, we are facing fee recovery issue from the 75% general quota students. Now, the RTE quota student fee has been halved so there is no way for us to pay teachers or meet administrative expenses. We will move the courts soon against this decision of the government,” said Dayma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-spend-led-to-rte-reimbursement-cut-min/articleshow/82891433.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

This lockdown is aimed at breaking the chain. Explain this to people, that the lockdown was only for a safer society,’’ he urged them.Work with the goal of bringing down Covid in your respective districts, he told them.“Tamil Nadu is facing twin challenges of financial crunch and health crisis at the same time. Hence it is imperative to put an end to Covid as early as possible,’’ he said.Stalin asked the collectors to adopt a multi-pronged approach to make the lockdown yield the desired results.They should take on board local administration and agriculture department to ensure vegetables and fruits was available to every household.Simultaneously, intensify efforts with local bodies to go door to door and identify people with Covid symptoms. Hold Covid detection camps and increase tests, he said.“There should not be any slackness in vaccination either,’’ he said. Though there is a lockdown, ensure that the sick and needy do not face any hurdle in having transportation facility to hospitals.Noting that a lot of NGOs were keen to work for the welfare of people affected by the pandemic, Stalin asked the collectors to coordinate with them and take their service to the people.“`You can nominate a special officer for the purpose,’’ he told them.Appreciating the work of collectors in the pandemic situation, Stalin told them that the objective of his government was to make Tamil Nadu the best state in the country. “It is your responsibility to take the schemes and plans drafted to achieve this objective to the masses,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/make-sure-lockdown-rules-are-followed-stalin-tells-collectors/articleshow/82891452.cms||---

To start with, vegetables and fruits will be sold through 500 vehicles in the corporation limit on Monday.“We have authorized farmer producer organisations and farmers interest groups to collect vegetables and fruits from farmers, and sell at doorsteps. We are issuing the required e-pass and are authorizing their vehicles,” deputy director of horticulture Bhuvaneshwari said. “We will fix prices and assign areas to each group. They will also sell combo packs. We have made arrangements to procure vegetables from other districts,” she said.More such vehicles will be launched in the coming days, the official said. The vehicles will be parked at public places in villages to sell vegetables.Corporation commissioner P Kumaravel Pandian had held a meeting with vegetable traders, and owners of supermarkets and hotels on Saturday evening and allowed them to make home deliveries. He directed them to use own vehicles for procurement and delivery. They need to obtain approval for such vehicles from the corporation and the officials deployed to monitor movement of such vehicles.But traders are still uncertain about doing door delivery, said M Rajendran, president of Coimbatore TK Market Anaithu Motha Vyabarigal Sangam. “Vegetables are procured from other districts and states and only some varieties are produced here. Onions are procured from Maharasthra, potatoes are from Karnataka and Gujarat, tomatoes from Nasik, small onions from Ottanchathiram and carrots and beetroots are sourced from the Nilgiris. Usually, vegetables from across the country is brought to markets where they are unloaded, segregated and sold to retailers and the public. As markets won’t open, I don’t know how it will work. Even if one wants to do door delivery as the corporation suggests, I don’t think it is possible to procure all types of vegetables from several traders. We need to do it as a team, which needs coordination and support,” he told TOI.“We did door delivery last year during the lockdown only because markets were functioning and corporation officials allocated areas to sell,” Rajendran added.Basheer, a trader at the MGR wholesale market in the city, said the government order lacks clarity and does not specify whether wholesale markets are allowed to function. “Due to the confusion, we have not placed regular orders and are planning to wait for a day or two till we receive clarification,” he said. “As most of the people have stocked up on Sunday, there would not be any demand for vegetables on Monday. It will be impossible for the government to procure various types of vegetables from different parts of the country and sell to the public. In the absence of wholesale markets, demand and price will increase drastically.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/500-vehicles-to-sell-veggies-from-today/articleshow/82891429.cms||Nivedha Selvam

The apprehension has prompted Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao and the Pune Paediatric task force to put out an appeal to parents to contact their family doctors, paediatricians, private or civic hospitals and get the children vaccinated at the earliest. Rao has said it was even more important to take immediate steps and not defer them. “In the last year since the Covid-19 outbreak, parents’ apprehension to visit the hospital vaccination centres or clinics with their children for routine vaccination has been noticed. Since the Covid cases surge is now slowly reducing in numbers, it is the right time to create awareness among parents and caretakers to get the children to government or private health facilities for vaccination for those who missed them in the last year,” he said.Rao added, “With the monsoon approaching and the anticipated third surge with a prediction of predominantly children getting affected, it becomes important to vaccinate them to protect them from preventable diseases.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/parents-advised-to-follow-kids-routine-vaccination/articleshow/82891440.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

He said the state expects regular supplies next month. On Saturday, 5.71lakh doses of Covishield from Serum Institute of India were received.  BMC meanwhile said vaccination on Monday will be only through walk-in or on-spot registration, a system it set up two weeks ago to decongest centres. On Monday, everyone eligible for a second dose of Covaxin or Covishield, irrespective of age, can walk into centres and get the shot. Also, citizens above 60 years can walk in and get the first dose of Covishield, said Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer. Around 1,722 senior citizens and 260 people above 45 with co-morbidities, who had taken the vaccine on March 1, will qualify for the second dose on Monday as per the new 84-day span between two doses. BMC said on social media that 239 centres will administer Covishield based on-spot registration. Centres will give first doses to 20% people (above 60) and 80% second dose to all above 45, healthcare workers (HCW) and frontline workers (FLW) 10am to 3pm. People aged between 45 and 59 cannot walk in for the first dose of either vaccine. HCWs and FLWs must get a form signed by their employer to get the first dose. BMC will administer vaccines only through a walk-in system on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, while next three days will only be by online appointments. Dr Gomare said the city got about 37,000 doses of Covishield that should last a day or two. Thackeray on Sunday said the state government is ready to buy 12 crore vaccine doses at one go, paying for the 6 crore beneficiaries (2 doses each) in the age group of 18-44. However, due shortage, the state had to halt the programme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/vax-shot-only-via-walk-in-today-cm-says-drive-to-speed-up-in-jun-in-mumbai/articleshow/82893233.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

The agriculture department is also gearing up for spraying chemicals to kill the insects which gallop acres of crop within hours of landing on them. Directives were issued to all the district agriculture officers soon after the swarms were spotted in Rajasthan’s Jaisalmer district. They are likely to reach UP by the end of May, officials said. District agriculture officer Ram Pravesh said, “In search of food, millions of locusts from Pakistan migrated to Rajasthan earlier this month. Swarms of locusts have been spotted in Jaisalmer district of Rajasthan. They are likely to enter Agra very soon. We are alerting farmers about the locust invasion. Presently, there is no standing crop in the fields. However, vegetables are grown in 30,000 hectares of land in the district. We are updating farmers about suitable proportions of chemicals to be used for killing the locusts.” “An unsettled swarm is highly mobile and can travel as much as 150 km a day if winds are favourable. They fly from 4am to 8pm, consuming large quantities of vegetation and crops. We have made arrangements of tractor-mounted chemical sprayers to kill the pests,” he said. According to the advisory issued by the agriculture department, farmers can bang plates, tin, drums to scare away locusts. They can also start a fire for creating smoke to prevent the produce from being consumed by the pest.

Though the murder happened on May 16, it came to light now after village sarpanch along with locals informed police of Kothakota about the incident. Police immediately rushed to the spot and examined the premises of the house in Ramakrishnapuram village in Kothakota mandal. The 45-year-old widow and her 65-year-old mother, also a widow, have been taken into custody. “The woman killed her 25-year-old son with the help of her mother on May 16 night. After committing the murder, the two women buried the body under a heap of mud and sand,” Wanaparthy deputy superintendent of police (DSP) K M Kiran Kumar said. During preliminary investigation, the widow and her mother confessed to have committed the murder. The two told police that the 25-year-old, who was a car driver, used to come home drunk and reportedly sexually assault his mother. “When he tried to sexually assault her on May 16 night, she and her mother resisted. Subsequently, the car driver, who was under the influence of alcohol, slept and the two women slit his throat with a knife and strangled him using a nylon rope,” the DSP said. After committing the murder, the women shifted the body to an open space adjacent to the house and buried him under a tree. As the victim did not come out of the house for a few days, neighbours and his friends started making enquiries with the family. The grave-like heap next to the house raised more doubts in the minds of the villagers and they informed the sarpanch. “We have registered a murder case. The body will be exhumed on Monday and a post-mortem examination will be conducted,” the DSP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/wanaparthy-woman-kills-abusive-son/articleshow/82891507.cms||---
---||Agra||Woman held for trying to sell daughter, 5, for Rs 500 in Mathura||AGRA: A 35-year-old woman, who seemed mentally unfit, was detained after she was allegedly found trying to sell her five-year-old daughter for Rs 500 in Mathura’s Farah block. The child and her seven-year-old sister were sent to the government child shelter home on Sunday on the orders of the child welfare committee, Mathura. The committee has also marked an inquiry by the anti-human trafficking unit of Mathura after learning that the woman and her elder daughter were allegedly sold to a Punjab resident six years ago. “If anyone is found guilty, legal action will be taken,” said Snehlata Chaturvedi, member of the child welfare committee. District coordinator of Child Line Narendra Parihar told TOI that they received a call on Saturday evening that one Rajveer Kaur was trying to sell her daughter for Rs 500. A three-member team immediately reached the spot and took the trio to Farah police station. Other than giving their names, the trio has said nothing, the team added. The girls were taken to the community health centre for a medical check-up. After getting a negative report for Covid, they were shifted to the government child shelter home. Meanwhile, a mobile number was found in the woman’s bag. On calling the number, one Jassa Singh answered. “Singh told us that he is from Punjab and the woman is his wife who has been missing with the girls for the past four-five months,” said Parihar. Singh told him that he had bought the woman and her daughter, then a year old, almost six years ago for Rs 40,000. The younger child was their daughter. Singh is coming to Mathura to join the investigations. “As the matter seems to be of human trafficking, I have informed the child welfare committee about it,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/woman-held-for-trying-to-sell-daughter-5-for-rs-500-in-mathura/articleshow/82887804.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Doctors keeping strict vigil on renal parameters in mucormycosis patients||NAGPUR: The doctors treating black fungus or mucormycosis patients are keeping a close watch on the renal parameters during the use of conventional Amphotericin B Deoxycholate, which is the cheapest variety of anti-fungal drug, but with the highest nephrotoxicity. The conventional Amphotericin B Deoxycholate is being preferred by patients as it costs merely Rs400 per injection as against Liposomal Amphotericin B, which is priced between Rs6,800 and Rs7,800 per injection. Liposomal Amphotericin B is preferred by many doctors due to it’s least effect on kidneys. Amphotericin B Lipid Emulsion, priced at around Rs1,700, is also preferred by many for it’s lesser detrimental effect on kidneys and easy pricing. The doctors said that due to acute shortage of Liposomal Ampho B, they often have to fall back on conventional variety of Ampho B Deoxycholate. So they follow a strict regime of series of checks on the kidneys so as to ensure there is no subsequent possibility of patients with renal failures and related problems. Doctors start the therapy only after counselling patients about the side effects on the kidney. Dr Harshwardhan Bora, internal medicine and critical care specialist of Kingsway Hospital, said kidney urea level is measured regularly to ascertain functioning among other tests. “We constantly check creatinine, potassium and magnesium level, which affect the kidneys. These are to be monitored every alternate day,” he said. “The drug is started with a lower dose and then escalated to gauge the tolerance level of the patient. If there are any side effects like chill or fever or pressure fluctuations, the doses are regulated,” he said, adding adequate hydration through saline is also important. Renowned physician Dr Nikhil Balankhe said hydration through administering saline plays the main role. “We avoid administering pain killers and also restrict nephrotoxic antibiotics. Often, we reschedule the doses of antibiotics as well as Amphotericin B as per the creatinine clearance, but the renal profiling is to be done routinely,” said Dr Balankhe. Stress is also laid upon maintaining the potassium levels. Ear, nose and throat (ENT) surgeon Dr Shailesh Kothalkar of Seven Star Hospital said there is no harm in using the conventional Ampho B (Deoxycholate) if the patient is well hydrated. “First, put the patient on hydration and then administer the drug so that anything harmful can be flushed out of the kidneys at the earliest,” said Dr Kothalkar, adding if the creatinine level is found increasing with a doubling rate within 48 hours, then it’s a alarming sign, as it indicates an acute kidney injury is taking place. Dr Kamal Bhutada, director of the ICU at Care Hospital, said the conventional Ampho B is being used by top hospitals in Mumbai, who also published their reports about it’s sound outcomes. “With due care and caution, I would like to go for the therapy which is cheapest for my patient,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/docs-keeping-strict-vigil-on-renal-parameters-in-mucor-patients/articleshow/82891521.cms||Soumitra Bose

Former minister Md Ali Shabbir sought to ask KCR whether the TRS government found no Muslim candidate qualified to occupy top posts in TSPSC or the universities. “KCR also did not fulfil his promise of enhancing Muslim reservation from the present 4% to 12%,” he said. KCR came to power in 2014 on the promise of giving 12% reservation to Muslims in jobs and education. Almost 80% of the minority institutions in higher education sector were shut down since TRS came to power, he alleged. The Congress leader also pointed out that many bodies dealing with minorities like the Haj Committee, Minorities Finance Commission, Urdu Academy were either headless or without a full-fledged body.“Muslim leaders associated with TRS must do serious introspection and take a decision on whether or not to continue in the ruling party,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kcr-ignoring-muslims-says-shabbir/articleshow/82891538.cms||---
---||Pune||Residents fume over perennial hyacinth around Holkar bridge||PUNE: Jurisdiction issues have affected the removal of water hyacinth from the surface of the Mula between Bopkhel village and Holkar Bridge in Khadki, posing a health risk to the residents of the Vishrantwadi and Sapras Line areas. While Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation insists its jurisdiction ends at Bopkhel village, the Khadki Cantonment Board says this part of the river falls under the state public works department’s ambit. With no one addressing the issue, the residents say they continue to suffer. “Because of Covid-19, the members of our family say indoors. We can’t even open our door and windows, or stand in our balcony, terrace or even the parking area, as mosquitoes move in swarms, particularly in the evening. All we want is for the authorities concerned to address the situation on priority,” Khadki resident Suma Mathew said. Sudhir Chavan, who lives in Laxmi township-1 near Mula river, said, all residents of their society were suffering. “It gets very hot inside the house during summer. There are many mosquitoes due to the hyacinth, forcing us to keep the doors and windows shut in the evening. We can’t even go onto our terrace,” he said. Mohan Jadhav, a 72-year-old resident of Mula Road, said, they too are forced to keep doors and windows shut after 7pm. “Mosquitoes bite us all night and we have difficulty sleeping,” Jadhav said. Anil Roy, head of PCMC’s health department — which has dealt with the hyacinth issue for the past three years — told TOI that have started removing hyacinth near Harris Bridge in Bopodi. “As our jurisdiction is up to Bopkhel village, we will clean the river till the bank near the village. Thereafter, it should be cleared by the other authorities concerned,” Roy said. He said PCMC had so far removed 1,000 tonnes of hyacinth from Mula, Pavana and Indrayani rivers. Portions of the river in Sangli too have been cleaned, Roy further said. KCB chief executive officer Pramod Kumar Singh said, “The river does not fall under our limits, though it flows through our area. In the past, our staffers and Army personnel had removed hyacinth as it posed a health risk to Khadki and Sapras Line residents. In March, PCMC staffers and ours jointly cleaned a portion of the river. But the problem stems mainly from the PCMC limits. If they clean in their area, we won’t face this issue. Secondly, we can’t spend money on this cleaning project as it will attract an audit objection.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/residents-fume-over-perennial-hyacinth-around-holkar-bridge/articleshow/82889568.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Pune||Website page for aid fails to open for auto drivers||Pune: Autorickshaw unions and permit holders on Sunday said the website link set up by the state transport department for financial relief was not working and many auto drivers were not able to register online. “The Rickshaw Panchayat has set up 12 facilitation centres in the PMC and PCMC areas to help autorickshaw drivers register for financial aid via the link. We have tried many times but there is some error. It seems that the system is faulty,” Nitin Pawar, convenor of the Rickshaw Panchayat, the largest autorickshaw union in Pune, said. The portal on which the drivers could register to avail Rs 1,500 started on Saturday. “The ‘apply for scheme’ tab takes you to another page which does not open and the page says that the site cannot be accessed. Under these circumstances, we don’t feel that any autorickshaw driver could register. It is aggravating considering that the state government has already delayed the plan by more than a month,” Shrikant Acharya, president of Aam Aadmi Rickshaw Chalak Sanghatna, said. The state plans to distribute Rs 107 crore to around 7.15 lakh autorickshaw permit holders in the state. Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad have close to one lakh permit holders.Pune’s deputy RTO Sanjay Sasane said the server had slowed down. “The response has been good but we were told about a slow server around 12.30pm. We will check whether the problem persisted,” he said. The page did not open even at 5.30pm. Sources in the transport department said with a large number of autorickshaw drivers registering, it may have affected the servers and work on resolving the issue was on. “The online system should not have been introduced as many drivers don’t know to use the computer or the internet. This is a hassle when we already face financial woes,” one driver said||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/website-page-for-aid-fails-to-open-for-auto-drivers/articleshow/82889582.cms||Joy Sengupta

---||Nagpur||Tiger is part of nature so we have to protect it: Bombay high court||NAGPUR: In a ruling that could have far-reaching consequences, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court has rejected bail application of an accused from Melghat, who was not involved in tiger poaching but forest officials had seized tiger body parts from his house. On October 17 last year, Melghat Tiger Reserve (MTR) officials had, posing as bona fide buyers, trapped Premlal on Harisal-Semadoh Road and recovered tiger teeth, bones, and nails from him. Based on the information revealed by Premlal, forest officials had nabbed one Parasram Dhande. A preliminary offence report (POR) was registered against the two. During the probe, one Ramlal had confessed to have given one stool (chourang) studded with a piece of tiger skin to Moujilal, father of Premlal. Ramlal had also confessed to have killed one tiger in Melghat a few years back. During search, forest officials seized 5 tiger nails, 2 tiger skins, sandalwood, and other articles kept in a box in the house of Premlal. During the house search of another accused Parasram, they had seized a blade of spear which is used for wild boar hunting. Both the accused were arrested and were unsuccessful in getting bail from Achalpur court. They were booked under sections 2(16), 9, 27, 31, 39, 44, 48, 49, 50, 51(1-C) & 52 of Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. The counsel for the accused Deepak Khushalani argued that Premlal did not know about the box having tiger body parts. APP MA Kadu said Premlal’s ignorance cannot be believed. Justice SM Modak at the HC rejected his bail application saying possessing prohibited articles is also punishable. “When the box is found in his house, I’m not inclined to accept his defence about ignorance of the box. Premlal’s father expired two years back and it is difficult to believe that the box remained unattended and unnoticed for two years. Sub-section 2-B of Section 40 permits declaration of inheritance. If he had inherited prohibited articles, he could have filed a declaration within 90 days, which was not done,” said Justice Modak said in the order. “There is no explanation as to how Premlal got these articles. The offence under Section 51(1-C) is punishable with maximum imprisonment of seven years. Merely on the basis of punishment, court cannot decide whether to grant bail or not. Court has to consider the circumstances also,” said the HC. “Tiger is a protected animal and it is a part of our nature so we have to preserve it. If any offence is committed with a human being, there is someone to make a grievance. When an animal is killed, there is no one to come forward except forest officials. So, the court has to be conscious of these realities,” said Justice Modak. The court rejected Premlal’s bail application, but granted bail to Parasram as prohibited articles were not found with him except the blade of the spear. The HC also directed JMFC, Achalpur, to expedite the hearing of the case and complete it within six months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/tiger-is-part-of-nature-so-we-have-to-protect-it-hc/articleshow/82891539.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Farmer’s son beats disability & penury to log on to dream job in e-commerce giant||LUCKNOW: Whenever his friends demotivated him by saying he won’t achieve success in life as he was differently-abled, Shivam Verma, 22, son of a farmer from a small village in Gosainganj, strove harder to move closer to his goal. Suffering from paraparesis, partial paralysis of the lower limbs that makes walking tough, Shivam made calipers his best friend and pursued computer engineering from Dr Ambedkar Institute of Technology for Handicapped of the Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Technical University. He finally landed his dream job in Amazon on a package of Rs 19 lakh per annum. “There is no such thing like ‘disability’. The word itself has ‘ability’ in it. One can achieve one’s dreams with hard work and positivity,” said Shivam. Shivam, a computer science final year student of AITH in Kanpur, not only faced financial crisis but also physical, mental and emotional challenges to bag a well-paid job amid Covid-19 pandemic. Shivam met an accident when he was just nine which led to the problem of paraparesis but with the support of his family and following inspirational words of former President Dr APJ Abdul Kalam that “if you want to shine like a sun, first burn like sun”, he kept on working hard despite odds. “My father, Rajendra Prasad Verma, borrowed money from relatives and friends to support my education. My three sisters and mothers saved money in every possible way so that I could study. I didn’t have the luxury of coaching to crack the engineering entrance test, it was small internet packs that gave me access to online lectures on YouTube which changed my life,” said Shivam, adding that he faced difficulty in participating in extra-curricular activities and cultural fests during school and college days. “I cracked the entrance test and got admission to AITH on scholarship but since I had problem in walking, I was in two minds on the possibility of living in Kanpur all alone. I didn’t know how I will commute to college to complete the studies,” he said. Shivam said an acquaintance asked me to visit the King George’s Medical University (KGMU) for treatment. “”Doctors at KGMU asked me to get calipers from their limb centre which made my life easier as I was able to walk. I had little money so I left the hostel after one year and lived in a small rented room. I managed things alone, be it washing my clothes, cooking food or any other activity. I never had fast food and saved every single penny earned by my father. My parents burst into tears of joy when they came to know about my package. It was not just my struggle but that of the entire family,” he added. “Now, I have decided to write a blog for students like me on how to achieve success. Differently-abled students are low on confidence. The government should hold awareness programmes and events to motivate such students,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/farmers-son-beats-disability-penury-to-log-on-to-dream-job-in-e-commerce-giant/articleshow/82893328.cms||Mohita Tewari

According to the highway safety patrol (HSP), Pune, the tanker was carrying 30 tonnes of acid from Mumbai. It was heading for Pune around 1am.After reaching a spot in Lonavla, the driver lost control over the wheel and the vehicle turned on its side. It blocked all the three lanes of the Pune corridor. However, there were few vehicles on the expressway because of the strict weekend lockdown, an officer said.Pritam Yavalkar, the deputy superintendent of police, HSP, said, “The tanker covered all the three lanes of the expressway, following which the vehicles heading towards Pune were told to halt a few metres away from the tanker to avoid any risk.”An officer from the Lonavla police station said, “The acid started leaking from the tanker and it caused a burning sensation in the eyes of the other motorists, who were stranded behind the tanker. However, no one suffered any major injuries and the commuters felt better after washing their eyes with water.” Yavalkar said, “A team of experts reached the spot from Mumbai and sealed the leak around 2.30am. A heavy duty crane was pressed into action to move the tanker to the shoulder-lane of the expressway. The vehicular movement restarted around 3am.” The tanker was shifted to a safe spot later in the afternoon.Such incidents occur every few months on the expressway. On November 30 last year, a milk tanker rammed a truck near Adoshi tunnel at Khopoli, causing both vehicles to topple on their sides. The incident blocked two lanes of the expressway towards Mumbai and caused traffic snarl for 5km till Khandala. On September 7 last year, a multi-axle oil-laden tanker toppled on its side near the Khopoli exit on Bhor ghat, which resulted in an oil spill across the three lanes. Traffic towards Mumbai was hit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/eway-traffic-disrupted-for-nearly-2-hrs-as-tanker-carrying-acid-topples-over/articleshow/82889601.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Family gets valuables seized by cops from burglar 25 years ago||NAGPUR: Roy Samuel, his wife Victoria George and her brother Joseph George were elated when Ajni police approached them to hand back valuables stolen from their residence at Joshiwadi in 1996. The family, which had shifted houses after selling off the property, is set to receive the valuables on Monday, 25 years after they were stolen. Ajni police have started proactively searching for complainants, where the courts have asked for return of stolen valuables following the disposal of the cases. City police chief Amitesh Kumar is learnt to have issued an instruction to ensure the recovered property is returned at the earliest after the disposal of cases. In the present case, Joseph said he was surprised after learning the cops had landed up at their old house, now sold to the Nair family, searching for them. “In 1996, there was a burglary at our old house when we had gone out for work. The burglars sneaked into the house from the back side, crossing over the boundary wall,” he said. “There was theft of some gold and cash Rs10,000,” he said. “We had registered an offence at Ajni police station then but never heard anything about the progress of the probe again from the cops until a day back, when we got the intimation that the cops were looking for us to return the stolen valuables,” said Joseph. The family is related to veteran journalist Joseph Rao, who too was astounded after his relatives received a call from the police station two-and-half decade after the burglary was reported. Woman police constable Pooja Bagde of Ajni police station said she had approached at least 15 complainants recently to return their valuables after court orders were found online instructing to do so. “We have been checking court orders online and also on the app to trace disposal orders, and started contacting complainants accordingly,” she said. “A complainant was traced to Kuhi after a lot of effort, as the address was not properly written,” said Bagde.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/family-gets-valuables-seized-by-cops-from-burglar-25-years-ago/articleshow/82891551.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Nagpur||Neeri-led panel to study if plasma therapy led to virus mutations||Nagpur: Divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar has formed a three-member expert committee to conduct a retrospective study on plasma therapy which shall entail genome sequencing of samples of Covid patients who were covered under ‘Project Platina’ conducted at Government Medical College and Nagpur (GMCH). The panel would be looking for possible mutations in the novel coronavirus in samples of plasma recipients which were collected on the first, seventh and 14th day. This is to retrospectively understand if any spontaneous mutations were taking place during the plasma therapy.The medical college had led the state-level project in which nearly 500 patients received the convalescent plasma to assess its efficacy in treating critically-ill Covid patients last year. The project was abandoned after it was found that the therapy doesn’t have any mortality benefit.The ICMR’s PLACID trial too had found no benefit of convalescent plasma to patients. Recently, the ICMR dropped plasma therapy from its Covid treatment guidelines.Following the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court order on May 12, the expert panel was formed to study whether plasma therapy led to acceleration of Covid-19 cases in the city.The panel is led by Dr Krishna Khairnar, head of environmental virology at CSIR-Neeri, Nagpur. Virologist major (retd) Dr Milind Bhursundi, and pulmonologist Dr Ravindra Sarnaik are the other two members.Neeri director S Chandrashekhar did not comment on the development citing court’s order.In his letter dated May 21, the divisional commissioner directed GMCH dean Dr Sudhir Gupta to provide samples collected in the Platina trial to CSIR-Neeri lab for conducting the genome sequencing.The HC seeking CSIR-Neeri lab’s expertise comes in the backdrop of the facility already being part of Indian SARS-CoV2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) on SARS-Cov2 genome sequencing. As per the government of India project, the CSIR-Neeri lab had already found double mutant B.1.617 (including B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2 ) as ‘dominant variant’ in the samples investigated for the Nagpur region.TOI has learnt from administrative officials that the CSIR-Neeri study led by Dr Khairnar has already been conducting genemoic sequencing of samples received from RPTS swab collection centre from November 2020 to May 2021. The study has been done in collaboration with CSIR-CCMB Hyderabad under the aegis of INSACOG. Under the study, it has been found the variant B.1.617 (double mutant) is prevalent in over 70% positive patients. This variant was reported in samples in the last week of January 2021, in the study conducted by CSIR-Neeri for Nagpur region. Whether the new variant is associated with higher mortalities needs to be further investigated, administrative officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/neeri-led-panel-to-study-if-plasma-therapy-led-to-virus-mutations/articleshow/82891571.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Meerut||Meerut cops set up community kitchens to serve free hot meals||Meerut: Daily wagers struggling to make ends meet amid the partial lockdown caused by the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic can now look forward to two free hot meals a day. Playing host are local police who have set up two community kitchens in Partapur and Begumpul area in Meerut. An initiative by district police chief Ajay Sahni, the community kitchens serve meals to the needy twice a day. The kitchens began functioning on Thursday. The long queues outside the kitchens is a testimony to the overwhelming response of the people to the meals. Funded by the police department, there is no fixed menu but till date, the meals comprised taheri (a rice and vegetable preparation), puri-sabzi and dal, roti and rice. The meals are available between 12 noon and 2 pm and from 6 pm to 8 pm. Buoyed by the response, senior officials said SHOs are being directed to start such kitchens in their areas to serve those in need. For those who cannot come to pick up the food packet, arrangements are being made to home deliver it. “We are also delivering food packets to people who can't reach our centres. The home delivery is still not a full fledged operation as police response vehicles, which are presently delivering food packets on request, are already burdened to respond to law and order alerts,” said Suraj Rai, additional superintendent of police. For the beneficiaries, the food is godsend. The partial lockdown since May 1 has left daily wagers without any source of livelihood. “There is hardly any work. My savings are drying up. But now, we don't need to worry about food,” said Bal Kishan, a rickshaw puller who hails from Hathras. Last year, when the pandemic broke out, policemen along with local NGOs , went beyond the call of duty to provide food packets to migrant labourers returning to their native villages in UP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/meerut-cops-set-up-community-kitchens-to-serve-free-hot-meals/articleshow/82887979.cms||---
---||Nagpur||After reluctant start, Melghat has first fully vaccinated village of Maharashtra||NAGPUR: The Meghat hills area, where tribals were once reluctant to get a Covid jab due to their beliefs, now has the first fully vaccinated village of the state for 45+ age category. On May 6, Chichghat village in remote Chikhaldara vaccinated all 110 residents in the age group out of a total population of 482. Three years ago, Harisal, another village in Melghat, had become the first digital village of Maharashtra even as other contradictions remain in the area. Chichghat was followed by two more villages in the vicinity, Bahdarpur and Ruiphata. Here 148 and 88 persons in the 45+ category were vaccinated, covering the entire population in the category. The two villages have a total population of 550 and 339 respectively. From a pocket where vials were going waste due to lack of takers, Melghat now has enthusiastic locals demanding that camps should be held at their villages. The shortage of vaccines, like everywhere else in the country, is hampering the drive in Melghat now when there has been a change of mind among the locals. Much needs to be done as only around 10% of the targeted population in the category has got the jab, said sources. The Melghat pocket in Amravati district has villages with small populations spread over long distances. The locals are predominantly from the Korku tribe. Earlier, when the drive began, the district administration faced strong reluctance among tribal population due to their local beliefs. Various attempts were made to woo the locals. Finally, a number of factors helped, says Dr Chandan Pimpalkar of the primary health centre (PHC) which covers the three villages. “People In other parts of the district knew those in Melghat were not keen on getting vaccinated. So they drove down here and got the jab. We showed this to the locals, and told them how outsiders were taking away their share only because they were reluctant,” said Pimpalkar Along with Korkus, the Balai community also lives in Melghat. They come under nomadic tribes. The Balais, who are relatively open, were vaccinated in front of the Kokrus to instil confidence that nothing happens on getting the shot. Even this helped change minds. Now, youngsters too are eager get vaccinated, he said Sub divisional officer (SDO) Mittali Sethi came up with the initiative of posting videos in the local Korku language, on Youtube. In the clips, doctors and locals discussed benefits of vaccination in the project launched over a month ago. “The attempts are finally showing results. Now we are getting calls for holding camps in villages but the supplies are limited, just like at other places. The priority is to give the second dose,” said Sethi. The health department officials in the hospital that covers the three villages took a number of steps to ensure that the drive succeeded, she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/after-reluctant-start-melghat-has-first-fully-vaccinated-village-of-state/articleshow/82891589.cms||Shishir Arya

These are Buldhana (Rs 101.11) Washim (Rs 100.30), Yavatmal, (Rs 100.79), Gadchiroli (Rs 100.09), and Gondia (Rs 100.72) and Amravati Rs 100.92. In city, it was Rs 99.30 a litre. At Rs 99.88 a litre, Bhandara is closest among the districts of Vidarbha where it has not reached Rs 100 yet. In February this year petrol rates were over Rs 97 a litre in Nagpur and it was expected that it may soon touch Rs 100 but did not. Then it was already Rs 100 in other parts of the region, especially remote pockets. With an average increase of 11 paise a day since May 1, it appears that petrol price may touch Rs 100 within a week in Nagpur too. Since May 1 the rates have increased by Rs2.64. There have been days when the rates have jumped by 20 to 30 paise also. At Rs 89.75, diesel rates in the city are already close to Rs 90 mark. Since May 1, the diesel has got costlier by Rs 3.4. Considering the current rate of hike, diesel may be Rs 90 in a couple of days at Nagpur. In other seven districts, diesel prices have already crossed the Rs 90 mark. These include Amravati, Washim, Yavatmal, Wardha, Bhandara, Gondia, and Gadchiroli. Amravati has the highest rates of Rs 92.76, followed by Buldhana at Rs 91.45 a litre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/petrol-crosses-rs-100-a-litre-in-six-vidarbha-districts/articleshow/82891548.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Drug stock for black fungus dries up||LUCKNOW: As acute shortage of Amphotericin B drug for treatment of black fungus infection or mucormycosis continued in private hospitals on Sunday. Kin of only eight out of 40 patients, who had queued up outside the Indian Red Cross Society-Lucknow (IRCSL) office, got the vials that were sufficient only for a day. Shyam Krishna Panday was one of the 32 persons who went back disappointed. “My wife (51) is in a private hospital. After four days of efforts, I got approval for 18 vials of Amphotericin B, but IRCSL has no stock,” he said. Police had to be deployed outside the IRCSL office when those who were denied the drug started creating a ruckus. When contacted, IRCSL chairperson Om Prakash Pathak said “Attendants of 40 patients came for delivery, but we had only 50 vials. Hence, six each were given to eight applicants, sufficient for a day’s course.” The IRCSL had written to the Lucknow divisional commissioner on Saturday night, stating that the administration had sent them applications of 40 patients. Each one has to be given 18 vials – sufficient for six doses daily for three days. Hence, 720 vials are urgently required, but the chief medical officer’s store allocated only 50. Doctors said that Amphotericin B is the primary treatment for fatal black fungus infection. A patient requires a course of four-six injections daily at least for three days. The course can be extended as per the patient’s condition. Alternative drugs are also there, but their efficacy is not as high as Amphotericin B, they added. The government hospitals have adequate supply, but private ones are facing shortage due to sudden increase in mucormycosis cases. In view of the situation, the government decided to provide the drug through the IRCSL. For it, a patient’s application is verified by a committee and then approved by the LDC. Meanwhile, divisional commissioner Rajan Kumar said, “The drug is being distributed as and when supplied.” CMO Dr Sanjay Bhatnagar said, "The supply is being done by UP Medical Supply Corporation Limited.” However, UPMSCL managing director Kanchan Verma was not available for comments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/drug-stock-for-black-fungus-dries-up/articleshow/82893356.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

The arrested accused, Deepali Mhatre (39), had come to the house of the 75-year-old woman, tied her up and taken the cash at knifepoint, the police said. She had entered the building next door, by posing as a health worker who wanted to survey if people had taken the vaccine for Covid. At that time, the elderly woman’s son and daughter-in-law were away at work. The septuagenarian was at home with her 8-year-old grandson then. The police said they had checked footage of CCTV cameras but could not get any leads as to the identity of the intruder. “We spoke again to the elderly woman and her grandchild. The boy said he had seen a tattoo on the woman’s hand. Also, we learnt that the intruder woman had checked with someone in the building about the time when the elderly woman’s son and daughter-in-law went to office,”said senior inspector of Worli police station, Anil Koli.  From this, the police got an inkling of the woman’s identity. To verify if they had zeroed in on the right person from the neighbouring building, they checked her cellphone location, and then brought her for inquiry. Another official said that Mhatre initially denied any involvement, but later confessed to the crime. “We have recovered almost the entire booty,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/covid-con-1-held-for-rs-5-lakh-gold-robbery-in-mumbai/articleshow/82893400.cms||Mateen Hafeez

The chief medical officer (CMO) has now sought an explanation from the missing doctors and their day's salary has been put on hold. The hospitals and health centres are under constant CCTV surveillance by an integrated Covid control centre monitored by the local administration at the collectorate. "Doctors posted at OPDs in PHCs and CHCs of rural centres - from 8am to 2pm - can ease the workload of the city's health service. So, if they are absent, patients from villages will start travelling to the city. This would put an extra burden on the city's doctors. Therefore, we urge all the doctors to be present at their respective centres during this difficult time," MS Faujdar, the CMO, said. During the DM's visit to the control room as many as 18 doctors posted at OPDs in villages Goela, Bopara, Galibpur, Harsauli, Jaroda, Navla, Pinna, Mansoorpur, Ramraj, Sikhera, Balwakheri, Bhokarhedi, Biralsi, Reawsli Nagla, Sikandarpur, Tejalhera, Rohana and Purkazi were found absent. The Muzaffarnagar DM immediately asked the CMO to take action. An explanation has been sought from all the missing doctors, the CMO said. "Their one-day salary will be deducted if they fail to give a satisfactory reply. A probe will be conducted and action will be taken accordingly," Faujdar added. The latest inspection comes after several complaints about doctors and nursing homes surfaced in the district. In another case, a local nursing home facing multiple complaints and irregularities was raided and shut down by district administration on Saturday. City magistrate Abhishek Kumar had recently approached the nursing home and warned its staff to be more polite and sensitive towards Covid patients and their caretakers. Three Covid deaths and 115 positive cases were reported from the district on Sunday, with 926 patients discharged and 2,605 active ones, so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/18-docs-at-phcs-chcs-in-up-district-found-missing-from-duty/articleshow/82888033.cms||Mohd Dilshad

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Builder booked as partner alleges cheating, forgery||MUMBAI: Pant Nagar police filed an FIR against one of the partners of the construction firm, Silver Group, following a financial dispute among themselves, for cheating and forgery. Police booked builder Kamlesh Shah and his son Raj following a complaint by partner, Mukesh Mehta from Ghatkopar. Mehta alleged that Shah forged the signature of a company director, made his son a director, procured loans of Rs 418 crore from financial institutions without the company’s knowledge in 2014, and misappropriated funds. Police sources said economic offences wing (EOW) of Mumbai Police is likely to take up the probe. Kamlesh Shah denied the allegations and said it was a “bogus case’’. “Mehta is facing EOW and Enforcement Directorate probes in a money-laundering case. His intention is to entrap us by using police to file a baseless complaint against us in Bhilwara, Rajasthan, when our business association is here,’’ Shah told TOI. Shah said that they are challenging the FIR in high court. Mehta claimed Shah cheated him and made Raj a director without his knowledge. Mehta said in 2013, while he was busy with his daughter’s wedding, Shah usurped the company and shifted its office. He alleged that in 2018, when he checked the website of Silver Group, he found the accused had changed the company address and named his son as a director. Mehta said Shah took loans of Rs 418 crore from financial institutions and misappropriated funds. Shah claimed the allegations were made at civil forums and they were pending. “In 2018, Mehta filed a complaint with EOW, which conducted an inquiry and closed the matter as they did not find a cognizable offence. Similar complaints were filed in HC, NCLT and before the arbitrator, which are pending. He was aware of everything that occurred at office since 2014. When Raj was shown as director, documents, including balance-sheets and application letters, were co-signed by Mehta, showing he was aware. On forging his daughter’s signature, the complaint was probed by Nehru Nagar police, which gave me a clean chit,’’ said Shah.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-builder-booked-as-partner-alleges-cheating-forgery/articleshow/82894327.cms||Ahmed Ali

---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Non-Covid patients suffer as focus stays on 2nd wave||LUCKNOW: Surgery of Balaganj resident Visesh Singh, who was diagnosed with stones in urinary bladder in January, was scheduled in KGMU in the last week of March, but was postponed after the outbreak of second wave of Covid-19. “Although, I was in touch with KGMU doctors and managing at home, but two weeks ago following excruciating pain, I had to go to a private hospital in Dubagga. Doctors there found that a stone had blocked the urinary tract and needs to be operated urgently,” said Visesh. He was discharged after three days. This is not the lone case. Many non-Covid patients who require elective surgeries have been waiting for the second wave to subside. In some patients, complications are aggravating and a few like Vishesh had to go for emergency surgeries. Most patients are bearing pain by getting medicines through tele consultancy. However, there is no dearth of people who need physical examinations for treatment, but are not able to get it due to restrictions imposed by hospitals on health management and surgeries of non-Covid patients. These patients include those seeking medical intervention for joint and knee replacement, spine fusion, cataract, hernias, appendix, gall bladder stone, kidney stones and prostate among others. Their surgeries have been postponed and are worried that after reopening, there will be a huge waiting list, which means that they will have to wait even longer for relief. Aasha Devi, Indiranagar resident, is suffering from pancreatitis. She was advised surgery at RMLIMS in March but due to Covid-19, it was deferred. “For the past five days, I have been having a fever with rapid breathing and a swollen abdomen. I consulted a doctor through video conferencing. Medicines have given relief, but I don’t know how long will it go like this,” she said. A resident of Chowk, Shilpi Mishra, took online advice from a KGMU doctor last week after his right toe developed swelling. “It was also very painful. I was not able to put my foot on the ground. Medicines eased pain for a while, but I think physical examination would be better for treatment,” she said. Amar Singh, Mahanagar, tele consulted a doctor after developing a severe headache over the past week. “When I did not subside even after taking medicine, the doctor asked to get a CT Scan. I got the test done and sent photos of the film along with the report on WhatsApp, but the doctor now says that they are not clear. He is not ready for the physical examination” he said. Women in different stages of pregnancy are also facing problems as many gynaecologists are not seeing patients at all or have limited themselves to tele-consultancy. “I had a miscarriage two years ago and am taking extreme precaution this time, but my doctor, whom I visited regularly, has not physically examined me for the past month and a half. Going to a hospital is risky,” said Ruchika Pandey, who is now eight months pregnant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/non-covid-patients-suffer-as-focus-stays-on-2nd-wave/articleshow/82893402.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

The data obtained from the civic body reveals that since January this year, only one malaria case and 39 dengue cases have been reported in the city as against 113 dengue cases that were reported during the same period i.e., January – May last year. Officials attributed the fall in number of vector-borne cases to the multiple initiatives undertaken by the civic body to eradicate mosquitoes and larvae ahead of the monsoon. “Activities by the entomology wing of GHMC to identify disease hotspots, removal of water hyacinth and Musi rejuvenation are all playing a major role in controlling this disease in the city. While there is a drastic reduction in the number of dengue cases from 2019 to 2021, Malaria cases are almost nil,” said Dr A Rambabu, chief entomologist, GHMC. Officials also informed that the ‘Every Sunday 10 Minutes at 10 am’ programme which calls upon people to spend 10 minutes every Sunday at 10 am to empty stagnant water also helped control mosquito breeding. On the other hand, the data collected from Moskeet Traps, which were set up in all the six GHMC zones to capture mosquitoes and provide real-time data, found that there is an increase in the presence of Culex mosquitoes in the city. “The data from all six zones in the last few weeks revealed an increase in presence of Culex mosquitoes. These mosquitoes do not transmit dengue or chikungunya but are the most bothersome as they swarm in large numbers and cause itchy, red spots on your body from their bite,” said Dr Rambabu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/vector-borne-diseases-seeing-a-dip-in-ghmc-limits-officials/articleshow/82891685.cms||Moulika.KV
---||Delhi||Delhi: Covid funerals below 200 for first time in nearly 40 days||NEW DELHI: For the first time since April 15, the daily number of Covid-protocol funerals in the city has gone below 200. According to the reports from the three corporations, 161 Covid funerals took place on Friday. Delhi saw 181 funerals on April 15 and the upward trend continued till the daily figure peaked to 717 on April 29. Since then, the numbers have shown a steady decline. The funeral report from last week showed that 224 Covid-19 funerals took place on Thursday and 208 a day earlier. Interestingly, the daily funeral count has been lower — by anywhere between 10 and 90 — than the official toll announced in the health bulletin through the last week. For instance, the official number of deaths on May 21 was 252 whereas 161 Covid-protocol funerals had taken place on the same day, according to the municipal reports. Similarly, the number of Covid funerals was less than the official death count by 9 on May 20, by 27 on May 19 and by 40 on May 18. The difference was as wide as 86 on May 17. Municipal officials seemed unsure of the reason for this discrepancy. “Either there is a backlog of bodies at the mortuaries or old cases that were earlier not accounted for have been cleared by the death audit committee,” an official said, on the condition of anonymity. And while the Covid-protocol funerals peaked on April 29, the count remained above 700 on April 28 and 30 too. The numbers finally went below 400 on May 11 when 379 such funerals took place. With the number now down to under 200, officials said if the trend continued, they could scale down the number of pyre platforms reserved for Covid-19 patients over the next few days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-funerals-below-200-for-first-time-in-nearly-40-days/articleshow/82889798.cms||Paras Singh
---||Delhi||Road to recovery? Daily admissions in Delhi lowest since April 6||NEW DELHI: The number of hospitalised Covid-19 patients on Sunday, as per Delhi government’s health bulletin, was 9,660 or 38.5% of the total 25,048 beds reserved in the capital. Sunday was also the first time in 40 days that the number of occupied Covid beds dipped below the 10,000 mark. With more than 28,000 Covid-19 cases in a day and a positivity rate of over 36%, the second half of April witnessed the peak of the current wave in Delhi. The numbers, however, have been slowly going south since then and the deceleration has gained pace in the last 10 days with Sunday witnessing 1,649 fresh daily cases and a positivity rate of 2.42%, the lowest in nearly two months. The steady dip is also reflected in the reduction in the occupancy of hospital beds, including ICU ones. As the number of occupied beds came down to 9,660 on Sunday, it went below the 10,000 mark for the first time since April 14, when 8,870 of the 13,437 beds were occupied. On April 1, 294 Covid-19 patients were admitted, while 139 people got discharged. By April 6, fresh admissions had crossed the 500-mark with 541 patients, while 269 were discharged. In a week’s time, on April 13, the number doubled to 1,218, while only 506 patients got discharged. While the gap between fresh admissions and discharge was more than double on April 1, the gulf started widening from the second week as the city witnessed a massive surge in Covid-19 cases. The number of daily hospital admissions reached an all-time high of 1,993 on April 29, while the average was 1,756 in the last week of April. The trend started reversing from May 13, when compared with the 1,366 Covid admissions, 1,384 patients got discharged. Since then, the gap has widened and on May 20, the capital saw 978 patients getting discharged as against 560 daily admissions. The average of daily admissions has dipped to less than 753 this week, with Thursday recording 560 admissions, the lowest since April 6. If the number of daily admissions and that of discharge between April 1 and May 20 are seen in 10-day periods, the first 10 days of April saw more than 500 fresh admissions a day on average, while the average daily discharge was around 216. From April 11 to 20, the average per day figures for both new admissions and patients getting discharged grew three-fold at around 1,430 and 605, respectively. In the last 10 days of April, the number of new admissions grew by 19.4%, with an average per day figure of more than 1,705, while the number of patients getting discharged from hospitals grew by a whopping 86.3%, at an average of 1,127 patients a day. The first 10 days of May saw the average per day figure of patients getting discharged growing by 26.9% to 1,187, while the number of new admissions dipped by 11.7% to 1,506 cases. Between May 11 and 20, the trend reversed with around 1,203 patients getting discharged a day, compared with 1,043 new admissions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/road-to-recovery-daily-admissions-lowest-since-apr-6/articleshow/82889791.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The university has decided to extend the deadline for registration from May 21 to May 25 due to cyclone Tauktae that ravaged parts of Saurashtra earlier this week, cutting off power supplies in several areas. The university had given the option between online and in-person or offline exams for students pursuing various courses including BA, BCom, BBA, BCA, BSc, MEd, M Com and MEd. In addition, mock tests comprising of 50 questions and for a duration of 50 minutes will be held for students who have registered for the exams and are yet to take this online trial. “So far 28,000 students have opted for online exams. This figure is likely to rise in the coming days. The exam dates and schedule will be announced once the registration is over,” said a GU exam department official. The state government has recently announced merit-based progression for students in their second, fourth and sixth intermediate semesters in undergraduate courses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/28000-students-register-for-gu-online-exams/articleshow/82891686.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Private hospitals in 5 districts have vaccine for 18-44 years, none in Nagpur district||NAGPUR: People in age group of 18-44 are getting Covid-19 vaccine in five of the total 35 districts of the state, as some private hospitals there have received doses from the manufacturers. Unfortunately, people of this age group in Nagpur district are unable to get the jab as manufacturers reportedly are yet to supply doses to private hospitals here. The central government had permitted vaccination of 18-44 years age group from May 1. But the centre had handed over responsibility of purchasing doses and inoculating this age group to states and private hospitals. The state government started inoculation of this age group with limited doses and centres. Vaccination was started at six centres in the district on May 1 and increased to 18. On May 12, the government stopped vaccination of this age group citing shortage of doses. Since then, there has been no vaccination for this age group in the district. As per data of state’s public health department (PHD), vaccination of this age group has continued and was never stopped in Mumbai and Thane. Private hospitals have reportedly procured vaccine from manufacturers and started inoculation of 18-44 years from May 12 onwards in these two districts. Similarly, some private hospitals in Pune, Palghar and Raigad have received vaccines from manufacturers and also started inoculation of 18-44 years age group. Vaccination is payable at these centres. Convener of Vidarbha Hospitals Association (VHA) Dr Anup Marar told TOI, “It is surprising to learn that Mumbai, Pune and couple of more districts are conducting vaccination in private centres for 18-44 years age group. Vaccination at the earliest to all people above 12 years holds key to prevent mortalities. Many private hospitals in Nagpur district have already approached vaccine manufacturers in first week of May. Manufacturers have expressed their inability to supply doses. They are yet to complete orders placed by the government. Then, why such disparity amongst districts in the state.” Dr Marar added Covid vaccines should also be regulated by the government and district administration as it was being done for Remdesivir and other medicines on the basis of area’s case load. Founder of HERD Foundation and national coordinator of AICC Research Department Dr Amol Deshmukh said, “Article 14 of the Constitution provides right to quality. And, Article 21 facilitates right to life. Therefore, people should get right to vaccine in this pandemic. Worldwide, central governments are procuring vaccines at uniform price and supplying to the states. Vaccination policy implemented here is unconstitutional. It is resulting in differential pricing, barrier to access and lack of preparation. Centre should provide vaccines to all age groups free of cost.” Number of beneficiaries from 45+ age group has continued to decline in the district. Only 2,247 healthcare workers, frontline workers and 45+ took first and second dose in the district on Sunday. The number was 24,379 on May 15 and dropped to 7,046 on May 16 followed by 9,539 on May 17, 7,439 on May 18, 5,756 on May 19, 5,231 on May 20, 5,449 on May 21 and 4,209 on May 22. NMC and Zilla Parishad (ZP) are operating 221 centres. Around 300 can be vaccinated at each centre in a day. Thus, total capacity of the centres in the district is 66,300. But number of beneficiaries has dropped below 5,000 per day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/private-hospitals-in-5-districts-have-vax-for-18-44-years-none-in-nagpur-dist/articleshow/82891649.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

The incident came to light when the victim’s daughter went to the house to see why her mother was not answering the phone. Lokanatham Albert, a painter from Gandhi Nagar in Trimulgherry, had married Rekha 23 years ago. According to police, Albert was an alcoholic and he used to spend entire earnings on his addiction. “Rekha used to quarrel daily with Albert about his addiction. About six months ago, the couple’s son committed suicide by hanging from a tree near their house due to family problems,” Trimulgherry inspector B Sravan Kumar said. Their daughter Venus, 22, stays with her husband in Bowenpally. Early on Sunday, Venus called her mother, but the latter did not answer. Venus grew suspicious and reached her parent’s home in the morning. “The door was latched from inside and with the help of neighbours, Venus broke the latch. They found Rekha lying dead on the floor of the bedroom with a bleeding head injury. Albert was found hanging from the ceiling hook with a stole,” the inspector said. Police suspect that Albert killed Rekha in a fit of rage and subsequently ended his life. A case was registered under Sections 302 of the IPC and 174 of the CrPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/painter-kills-wife-commits-suicide/articleshow/82891687.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The channel, titled ‘LU walo ka talent’, has videos of dance, vocal and instrumental music, poetry, knowledge-sharing on latest technology by students of the university and its associated colleges. The channel crossed 1,000 subscribers on Sunday. The success of the channel was shared by various students on social media platforms who said it had given them the opportunity to come out with their creativity at the time of Covid 19 pandemic. The channel was launched last year by a BSc student, Ankit Patel, after the university was closed following the rise in Covid-19 cases. “I started this channel in April last year so that all students stay connected during lockdown and get an online stage to perform. Around 50 videos have been uploaded so far and each video has good number of views and appreciation from students,” said Ankit. “We have also created a WhatsApp group on which students drop their videos which are then upload on the channel. The group also has 20 LU faculty members from different departments who guide us on how to make videos better and also suggest how the channel can be made more interactive. The group has a total of 550 members,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lu-talent-beams-on-youtube-big-hit-with-netizens/articleshow/82893412.cms||---

The state government, however, said that various agencies had carried out regular raids to remove any unauthorized boards stuck on trees.However, locals in Gandhinagar say that there are hundreds of such boards rampantly nailed on to trees with impunity. While civic bodies and the forest department occasionally carry out raids to remove boards nailed on to trees, people continue to deface trees by putting up billboards and notices on trees.While the question asked about such billboards was for Gandhinagar city alone, a green activist said there is not one city or town in Gujarat which is free from this menace. This is primarily because nailing billboards on trees ensures zero-cost advertising – even if it is harmful to the trees and spoils the green cover aesthetics.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-claims-no-one-nailed-ads-to-trees-in-gnagar-in-2-years/articleshow/82891709.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Lucknow University’s guidance centre getting more distress calls than job queries||LUCKNOW: The second wave of the novel coronavirus has hit the Counselling and Guidance Cell of Lucknow University too as it is receiving more Covid-19 stress calls than career-related anxieties. The cell, which is otherwise meant for helping students to cope with examination/academics related anxieties, to look after the mental health of the students, providing career guidance and preparation for competitive examinations, has received a number of Covid-19 related SOS calls. A team of 18 LU counsellors spends their entire day consoling students who have lost their friends, relatives and parents to the second Covid wave. “We have received a number of calls from students who complain of anxiety triggered due to Covid 19 pandemic. Also, an SOS call like a girl who lost both parents due to Covid calling for financial support to raise her brother,” said director counselling and guidance cell Madhurima Pradhan. She said earlier we use to get calls from students who were stressed about getting jobs or were confused about the academic choices they should make but this year the second wave has immensely taken the toll on the mental health of students who are stressed due to uncertainties caused by the pandemic. Another counsellor from the cell, a faculty of business administration Ritu Narang said, “I got a call from a student who pleaded to help her friend who lost her mother to pandemic, and whose body was still in the house as her father was in a state of shock. She herself was infected and no relative was coming for help.” Narang said worried about the uncertain times, students ask questions like when the pandemic will subside and life will be back to normal and when they will not wake up or sleep over the news of someone passing away due to Covid 19. She said students complained about feelings of fear, anger, sadness, worry, numbness, or frustration. “We have asked students to engage themselves, they can call us and talk whenever they feel low. I have also sorted out some motivational videos for students who feel low and have asked them to involve themselves in things they enjoy and to stay connected with people in online mode and speak their heart out,” she added. A team of 20 counsellors of Lucknow University and its associated colleges will be taking calls from people to help them handle stress and anxiety.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lus-guidance-centre-getting-more-distress-calls-than-job-queries/articleshow/82893422.cms||Mohita Tewari
---||Lucknow||How the ‘Kashi model’ flattened Covid curve||LUCKNOW: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s repeated praise of the Covid containment strategy in his parliamentary constituency, Varanasi, has trained the spotlight on the Kashi model, which helped flatten the spiralling pandemic curve in district after the second Corona wave struck. The model envisages smooth and comprehensive steps to provide immediate medical attention to people contracting the virus through creation of micro-containment zones, stated Modi’s trusted aide and former Gujarat cadre IAS officer, Arvind Kumar Sharma, who has been camping in Varanasi for over a month. “The mantra of treating patients at their doorstep (jahan bimaar, wahin upchaar) should be replicated in other districts too,” Sharma said in a tweet. The first point of contact for those seeking immediate medical attention is the Kashi Covid Response Centre, which operates round-the-clock and has 20 telephone lines attended by a 20-member staff who work in three shifts, Sharma tweeted. The centre categorizes people into two categories – asymptomatic and symptomatic. While asymptomatic and those with mild symptoms are given requisite treatment at home, those with high viral load are suggested mandatory admission in a Covid hospital. In both cases, doctors are consulted. The model further stresses on strengthening medical infrastructure to deal with the deluge of patients. At the same time, Covid patients in home isolation are provided 24x7 medical support by respective primary health centre and community health centres and Covid response team regularly takes updates. The model also provides constitution of mobile units, which are required to fan out to rural areas to conduct testing and provide medicine to infected people. The move comes amid reports of Covid spurt in villages after the four-phase panchayat elections were held last month. Sharma is learnt to have met PM Narendra Modi and CM Yogi Adityanath to brief them about the model adopted in Varanasi, which registered a record 2,786 fresh cases on April 24. Sharma, who got elected to UP legislative council as a BJP candidate, soon after taking VRS from the civil services early this year, took vantage position in relief operations in at least 21 east UP districts. A native of a small hamlet in Mau, Sharma has been in touch with the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) while managing to mobilise funds with help of the private sector under Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/how-the-kashi-model-flattened-covid-curve/articleshow/82893432.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||India||Stop sharing TOI e-paper, Delhi HC tells WhatsApp, Telegram||NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court has restrained WhatsApp and Telegram from illegally circulating e-papers of The Times of India and sister publication Navbharat Times on their platform. It issued notice to the two apps along with certain individuals who are administrators of groups on their platforms while barring them from circulating e-papers for alleged copyright violations. Justice Jayant Nath said “prima facie” the act of illegally circulating the e-papers of plaintiff on the defendants’ platforms is violative of its copyright and ad-interim injunction is granted in the favour of Bennett, Coleman and Company Ltd. Circulation of e-paper violates copyright, HC toldThe court asked them to respond to the suit and comply with the order, listing the matter for further hearing on August 18. In its order, the HC has also issued notice to the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology for its response on the suit. In its plea, BCCL contended that epapers of Times of India and Navbharat Times are being circulated on various WhatsApp groups and Telegram without any authority and this amounts to infringement of its copyright. “That despite the various measures taken by the Plaintiff to protect its proprietary site content, it has been recently observed that under the garb of providing online services, various web portals, mobile applications, intermediaries, social media platforms and their users, are misusing and perpetuating the misuse of the e-newspapers and e- magazines of the Plaintiff, by sharing unauthorized and illegal copies of the same in PDF format to/ among their own users or subscribers on different platforms such as websites and mobile applications, etc. The foregoing actions by such web portals, mobile applications, social media platforms and their users necessitate the filing of the instant suit so as to protect against and prevent the infringement of its proprietary information/content,” it added. The court was informed that ever since lockdown was imposed in 2020 to contain the spread of Covid-19, several individuals started downloading the e-papers and circulated it on other groups, which is a violation of Copyright law. BCCL said in June 2020, the media house came to know about illegal usage of its copyright on WhatsApp which was providing free usage of its e-papers and notice was issued to the platform but to no avail. “The cause of action further arose when despite various cease and desist notices being issued to offending websites, no action was taken and the said websites continued to circulate the Plaintiffs e-papers. The cause of action is still continuing and is accruing day by day and shall continue to so accrue till the Defendants cease with their impugned activities,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/stop-sharing-toi-e-paper-delhi-hc-tells-wa-telegram/articleshow/82896792.cms||---
---||Lucknow||32 days on, corona clouds constitution of Shia Waqf Board||Ayodhya: More than a month after elections were held to UP Shia Waqf Board on directives of Allahabad High Court, the Board is yet to be constituted. The chairman hasn’t been elected nor has the government nominated five members to complete the quorum. And the delay is being attributed to the lethal run of the Covid second wave. Election of members from mutawalli quota was held on April 20, which witnessed the return of controversial former Shia Waqf Board chairman Waseem Rizvi, despite an uproar in the community over his writ in Supreme Court against some Quranic verses. Shia Waqf Board CEO Naseer Hasan told TOI the pandemic has deferred constitution of the new board or election of the chairman. “The state is battling the pandemic and chief minister is busy in Covid control. We hope the government will nominate members to the Board when the second wave ebbs,” he said. Talking to TOI, minister for minorities affairs Mohsin Raza said, “Constitution of the Shia Waqf Board is priority for the state government. We respect the feelings of the community, who are demanding a transparent, corruption-free Board. We hope to elect a non-controversial and efficient chairman and constitute a Board that will work for the welfare of the community. Those embroiled in corruption are already facing CBI inquiry. We must give a chance to people with a clean image to govern the Board.” On March 24, the Uttar Pradesh government announced the schedule for the Shia Waqf Board elections in compliance with orders of the high court, which had asked the UP government “under which authority of law it appointed an administrator” in the Shia Waqf Board.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/32-days-on-corona-clouds-constitution-of-shia-waqf-board/articleshow/82893450.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

In August last year, the high court had ordered Dahod superintendent of police to lodge an FIR against a traffic cop in Vadodara for abducting his ex-wife, detaining her at a farmhouse and committing illegality with her. This happened after the police sub-inspector was accused of abducting his ex-wife with help of his contacts in Dahod district and placed her at his friend’s farmhouse. The woman’s mother approached police, but nothing happened. She filed a habeas corpus petition in the HC. The cops got into action, freed the woman from the farmhouse and produced her before the court. Upon court’s query, the woman, who is a pharmacist, told the HC that she had married the cop but later realized her mistake and decided to get divorce. However,even after legal divorce and though she did not want to maintain any relationship with him, the cop continued to interfere in her and her parents’ lives. His high-handedness continued. The woman had begged before the court for her life and her parents’ safety. Furious judges had ordered an FIR against the cop and directed Vadodara police commissioner to launch a departmental inquiry against him. Following the FIR, the police official was arrested on charges of rape, illegal confinement and criminal intimidation. He approached the HC for bail and argued that they were married and there was cohabitation for considerable period. The marriage was registered in Ahmedabad in 2018. He submitted that it was a second marriage for both the parties. The cop submitted that his wife had filed the complaint with intention to harass him because of the matrimonial dispute between them. Moreover, the FIR was lodged on basis of the HC order. After hearing him, the high court earlier this month granted him bail on executing personal bond of Rs 15,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-grants-bail-to-cop-held-on-his-ex-wifes-rape-plaint/articleshow/82891723.cms||---

Among the eight districts from the region, Parbhani and Nanded continue to have costliest petrol at Rs 101.87 per litre and Rs 101.71 per litre, respectively with relatively larger transportation cost of fuel is attributed to stiff retail prices in these two districts. Non-premium petrol was sold in Aurangabad for Rs 100.78 per litre, Rs 100.65 in Jalna, Rs 100.54 in Beed, Rs 100.56 in Latur and Rs 100.49 in Hingoli. The price of diesel is also moving up. On Sunday, diesel was sold at Rs 92.19 per litre and Rs 92.06 per litre in Parbhani and Nanded, respectively. In Aurangabad, diesel was priced at Rs 92.6 per litre. Suhas Patil, a professional, said rise in fuel prices would compound the crisis arising out Covid-19. “The market is bound to witness inflation when Covid-related curbs are be lifted. Rise in prices of petrol and diesel will have a cascading effect on the economy,” he said. Aqeel Abbas, president of local fuel retailers in Aurangabad, said hike in fuel prices leads to more investment cost for retailers. “The investment amount goes up without any increase in profit margin. Also, there is no account for evaporation losses of fuel and the same has to be borne by the petrol pump owner,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/petrol-breaches-rs100-mark-across-mwada/articleshow/82891752.cms||Prasad Joshi

They accuse him of abusing them, while he threatens to smash their heads with their own bat.When the video reached joint commissioner of police (rural) Sachin Gupta, he marked an inquiry to the additional deputy commissioner of police (I) and sought an action-taken report. It has come out that ASI Balwinder Singh was on patrol duty in the area when he saw this bunch of 20-odd cricketers on the ground near the Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) telephone exchange of Phase-II, Urban Estate, Dugri, during the weekend curfew. The ASI’s squad of three went over to them and objected to their being outside.ASI Balwinder Singh said: "Of those more than 20 men on the ground, nobody had a mask on. When I objected to it, they started misbehaving with us cops in uniform. They counter-questioning me why three cops were out in one car, and if the social distancing rule didn’t apply to us. This instigated me and I got angry." In the video, the men are seen saying that the cop started abusing them instantly upon reaching the ground, and even as they asked him to be polite, he kept arguing. In the video ASI Balwinder Singh is also captured, saying: "I will smash your head with your own bat." It is said that he also tried to snatch the mobile phone on which this video was being shot.When contacted, ADCP Teja said that in this matter, the Dugri police had registered a case against some unidentified people under sections 188 (defying public servant’s orders) and 269 (negligent act likely to spread a dangerous disease) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

---||Lucknow||Five bypolls soon as corona claims MLAs||Lucknow: Byelections are set to be held in at least five seats that fell vacant following deaths of BJP lawmakers in the lethal second Corona wave. The five BJP MLAs who passed away after contracting Covid include Ramesh Chandra Diwakar (Auraiya), Suresh Chandra Srivastava (Lucknow-west), Kesar Singh (Nawabganj, Bareilly), Dal Bahadur Kori (Salon, Rae Bareli) and Vijay Kashyap (Charthawal, Muzaffarnagar). A sixth assembly seat headed for bypoll is Suar, following disqualification of SP legislator Abdullah Azam, son of senior SP leader Azam Khan on charges of discrepancy in declaration of his date of birth. The matter has been pending in court even though Vidhan Sabha records show the seat is vacant. Official sources in UP assembly told TOI that Speaker Hriday Narayan Dixit would soon intimate Election Commission of India (ECI) on the six vacant seats. As a rule, election must be held in a vacant seat within six months. This means that byelections will have to be held by November — less than four months before the high-stakes Uttar Pradesh assembly elections next year. The development comes amid whirling speculation about a possible cabinet expansion soon after the state government manages to blunt the Covid second wave. Speculations gained momentum on Sunday, a day after PM Narendra Modi’s trusted aide and former Gujarat cadre IAS officer, Arvind Kjumar Sharma, met chief minister Yogi Adityanath. As per reports, Sharma has been at the helm of Covid management in Modi’s parliamentary seat of Varanasi. Sharma, who has been camping in Varanasi since April, has been attending regular review meetings with Varanasi and other district officials to oversee Covid management. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanth went for a cabinet expansion in August 2019 to accommodate 18 ministers, including Ghatampur MLA Kamal Rani Varun and Vijay Kashyap. While Kamal Rani Varun succumbed to Covid during the first wave in August last year, Kashyap fell victim to the virus last week. Uttar Pradesh also lost senior BJP leader and cabinet minister Chetan Chauhan to Covid last year. This way, there is room for accommodation of three legislators in the state cabinet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/five-bypolls-soon-as-corona-claims-mlas/articleshow/82893478.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Pune||Pimpri Chinchwad: People buying liquor online fall prey to crooks||PUNE: Ordering liquor online during the lockdown cost four persons in Pimpri Chinchwad dearly over the last one month when cybercrooks siphoned off amounts ranging from Rs50,000 to Rs3 lakh from their bank accounts by making them click on dubious links to obtain their personal details. These customers came across the geo-tagged link mentioning contact numbers of the liquor shops. The person on the other end promised to deliver the liquor at their doorsteps. The customers transferred money by using UPI applications and also shared their UPI passwords with these fraudsters and ended up in losing huge amounts from their bank accounts. As liquor shops are closed during the lockdown, only home delivery of alcohol has been permitted. People to make online payments during such purchases. Senior inspector Sanjay Tungar of the cybercrime cell of the Pimpri Chinchwad police told TOI, “The cybercrooks are luring people by posting fake numbers and links on different websites. They are even dangling baits like buyone-get-one offers,” the officer said. Cyber expert Dattatreya Dhainje told TOI, “The cybercrooks misuse a technology called ‘Web Crawling”. With its help, they can access the website and make changes on it by using a software program. People should not blindly search on the internet. They should verify before contacting any number mentioned on any website.” Modus operandiThe fraudsters are asking their victims to pay in advance. They are asking for one-time passwords (OTPs) received by the account-holders by indulging in sweet talk. After obtaining the OTPs, the suspects siphon off the amounts from bank accounts, the officer said. He said, “People fell prey to these glib talkers and share their OTPs without thinking twice.” In some cases, these fraudsters send QR codes or links to the people for making payments. When the unsuspecting people click on the links or scan the QR codes, their bank details become accessible to the fraudsters, after which they siphon off the amount from the bank accounts. A resident of Pimpri Chinchwad, who lost Rs2.7 lakh to the fraudsters, said he had searched the liquor shop number on the internet and had ordered liquor worth over Rs2,000. “The person on the other end sent a QR code. After I scanned the code, the amount was siphoned from my bank account,” he said. A liquor shop owner from Bavdhan told TOI, “I have put up a board outside my shop with my contact number on it. People who frequently visit my shop have now saved my contact number. They place their orders and make payments online using that number only. A few months ago, a woman had lost her money after she ordered liquor online from a liquor shop in Bavdhan.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/people-seeking-liquor-online-fall-prey-to-fraudsters/articleshow/82891801.cms||Mihir Tanksale

The officials are worried if the internet connectivity gets disrupted during the next few days while the interview sessions are being planned as the cyclone is expected to hit the coast of Bengal by midweek. They might reschedule interviews so that no one misses a chance, an official said. Due to the pandemic the PSC has shifted to the online mode of interview since last year as the examinees were facing problem to reach the PSC office in south Kolkata. “We are interviewing around 20 candidates daily. In this online mode, we are almost getting full attendance. However, some of the candidates cannot be contacted. So if they contact us and provide an alternative number they can be interviewed,” said Debashis Bose, chairman of PSC. “Initially candidates had to appear at the DM’s office from where the officials would be at the PSC office to interview. It was a bit difficult for many to reach the DM’s office.

The recovery rate too has touched 93%,” Yogi said, while speaking to reporters in Jhansi. The CM, who was on a visit to Jhansi and Banda to take stock of measures to stem the second wave and prepare for a potential third wave, maintained that the partial curfew, which has been extended till May 31, helped the state to break the chain of infection. “Not only lives, but also livelihood was top priority of the state government,” he said, stressing that the exercise of conducting door-to-door surveys was showing good results with the positivity rate plunging. Yogi admitted an oxygen crisis during the second wave and attributed this to a sudden rise in demand. “But that was met with the support from the Centre,” Yogi said, while announcing that the state government would set up 15 oxygen plants in Jhansi division, which also comprises districts of Jalaun and Lalitpur. Of this, six plants will come up in Jhansi alone. He also announced a 500-bed hospital, which was stopped mid-way on the medical college campus, will be completed in next 4-6 months. He directed officials to set up 100 more beds for post-Covid patients.Lauding the district administration, Yogi directed officials to ensure adequate beds along with availability of gynaecologists and paediatricians to tackle a probable third wave.

While a constable was injured when the accused, Pawan, opened fire, he was overpowered after he fell in the thickets after taking three bullets in his leg in retaliatory fire. Police attributed crime motive to a festering land dispute. Pawan and three accomplices had stormed the house of Horilal under Inyatpur police station area in the cover of darkness just minutes before Saturday midnight, overpowered the family members and slit their throats with a sharp-edged weapon. Besides Horilal and his wife, Pawan’s victims included three children, including a girl — all below 10 years of age. The assailant was known to the family, said police.

---||Kolkata||Gated complexes form emergency teams, take pre-emptive measures||Kolkata: Residents’ welfare associations of housing complexes in the city on Sunday met to finalize measures to counter cyclone Yaas. The cyclone warnings have overtaken Covid concerns as residents fear major damage and destruction as was the case with Amphan last year. However, lessons have been learnt and efforts are on to avoid the same mistakes. One such complex is South City Residency where big trees have already been secured with ropes to prevent them from getting uprooted. On Sunday the security in each tower called residents on the intercom, advising them to remove potted plants and all items from the balcony. “We will keep all the lifts stationed on the top floor to avoid any water damage, though we are checking and closing the windows in each lobby and staircase to prevent water from coming in and running into the shaft,” said Manoj Gupta, secretary of the society. The gardening committee at Silver Spring is also securing trees, said secretary, Indranil Chowdhury. In some complexes that have enough underground parking spaces like Urbana, all residents have been told to park there. “We have removed all items from the park and open spaces. All residents have been advised to keep windows, sliding doors and toilet doors locked to avoid cross ventilation during the storm. We have ensured that typhoon locks are in place in windows in all apartments,” said Archana Sinha, president of Urbana. At Utalika complex, Amphan had destroyed the LED screen, so this time the screen has been removed before hand. In some complexes like Upohar the maintenance team has been inspecting all the lobbies, common areas, doors and windows leading to weather exposed areas to ensure that there are no gaps through which water can gush in, said vice president of the committee, Sudeep Ganguly. Maintenance work to plug all gaps are also on at Siddha Pines, New Town. From Tuesday until Thursday all terraces will be locked up at Siddha Pines and notices have been put up, said president Manav Mehera.  Most complexes have formed emergency task forces and they have been equipped with battery operated loudspeakers since power cuts are anticipated and mobile phones will be used sparingly to keep them alive for as long as possible. All generators are being checked and made operational for emergency power supply. Extra diesel has also been procured in most complexes since no one is sure about the damage that the cyclone might cause and the duration of power cuts.  Some complexes removed dish antennae from their perches or got the service providers to secure them firmly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/gated-complexes-form-emergency-teams-take-pre-emptive-measures/articleshow/82890070.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

A case in point is the mass testing conducted by the district administration in two panchayats — Nirsari and Ghaghra — under Bishunpur block , a Maoist and tribal hotbed, where out of 473 total samples, only 14 tested positive. The administration sent special teams to conduct rapid antigen tests (RAT) in these two places on Saturday following reports of a few deaths in the recent days going unreported. Dr Ashutosh Singh, head of community health centre in Bishunpur said, “It was reported in the local dailies that a large number of people were suffering from fever, cough and cold and some died a few days back. We carried out special drives by engaging 14 medical teams for 17 revenue villages in the two panchayats on Saturday. Only 14 tested positive for Covid-19 which was an indication of their good immunity to the virus.” He added that about nine deaths in the recent times were due to other ailments and not Covid-19. In the whole of Bishunpur block, about 8,000 tests have been conducted across 10 panchayats in which 500 tested positive. “Of them, 310 have recovered and 190 are currently under treatment in home isolation. Only seven are in Covid Care Centres. Patients are rarely requiring oxygen support,” he said. Notably, RAT isn’t considered a foolproof test if a person turns negative but following central government’s directives for mass screening, state health department has currently launched massive testing drives across rural areas as a part of early testing, tracking and detection of suspected Covid cases to break the transmission chain. According to local doctors, immunity among villagers is stronger than among those of the urban areas. Singh said owing to the district administration’s intensive drive, villagers are also following Covid appropriate behaviour. Doctors also maintained that the lifestyle in rural areas is also the cause for greater immunity. “Rural tribal people lead a simple life. They eat spinach and green vegetables and simple rice and every day undergo hard labour. Women in particular are laborious. They are very close to nature and have imbibed the trait from their ancestors. So they enjoy strong immunity,” Singh said. Echoing the same reasons, Dr Vijay Lakra, in-charge of CHC in Basia block, said, “Villagers, mainly tribals, lead a tension-free life and take sound sleep at night. Tension pushes immunity down. Also, their houses are hygienic and while dining, they maintain social distance. That’s their way of life. So their immunity is higher,” Lakra said citing that Dumardih hamlet in Basia, which has 109 tribal families, is totally free of Covid. Dr Rajesh Toppo of Gumla sadar hospital, however, said a clearer picture of Covid among villagers will only emerge after proper survey of all the rural areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/mass-testing-drive-shows-rural-people-in-gumla-dist-have-greater-immunity/articleshow/82889602.cms||K A Gupta

Five of them, who tested positive for Covid-19, were brought back separately in an ambulance. On May 21, these labourers had put up a video clip from Nepal highlighting their woes and they appealed to the Jharkhand government to facilitate their return home. As the video went viral, the state government swung into action and arranged for their safe return by sending a bus to the Nepal border. The workers heaved a sigh of relief upon their return and many of them vowed never to return to the Himalayan nation where they were working in a hydel power project but were abandoned by their employer when the Covid crisis worsened there. Congress Mandal, one of the rescued labourers, thanked the Dumka administration and the government for rescuing them and said, “We had to migrate to faraway places to eke out a living but after going through a harrowing experience there, we don’t want to go back and risk our lives again. Many of us fell sick during the lockdown imposed by the Nepalese government and our employer abandoned us.” A few of the rescued labourers have been admitted to Phulo Jhano Medical College and Hospital. Anup Kumar Verma, a local administrative official, who was part of the team that ferried them back to the country, said, “Five out of the 26 labourers have tested positive for Covid-19 and are symptomatic and they were brought back separately in an ambulance.” The remaining labourers have been shifted to a quarantine centre in Dumka as a precautionary measure where they will have to wait for seven more days before undergoing another round of Covid tests and then they would be allowed to go back home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/26-migrants-stranded-in-nepal-reach-dumka-5-test-covid-ve/articleshow/82889570.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh saves Rs 2,350 crore in power purchases in 2 years||VISAKHAPATNAM: Andhra Pradesh has saved around Rs 2,350 crore by purchasing electricity in spot markets at cost effective prices in the last two years, i.e., 2019–20 and 2020–21. The power utilities procured 3,393 million units in 2019-20 and 8,890 MU in 2020-21 from the open market at cheaper prices. The average cost of procurement, including transmission charges, was Rs 3.12 per unit against the approved weighted average procurement cost of Rs 4.55/unit. Apart from depending on power purchases in the spot market, for the first time in India, the state power utilities deployed day-ahead electricity forecasting model using artificial intelligence and machine learning. This could forecast the next day’s electricity consumption on every 15-minute basis. This would in turn enable taking right decisions on electricity demand and supply, grid management, and minimising power purchase cost. The state government had persuaded the Union ministry of power to surrender the 625 MW thermal power, which helped the AP discoms to reduce their financial burden to the tune of Rs 1,007 crore. The central power grid used to collect central transmission utility point of connection charges from the discoms on the anticipated usage on a quarterly basis in the past. Due to the same, the utilities had to pay higher charges to the central grid. In response to the protest of the AP energy department, the CERC has changed the methodology, resulting in savings of Rs 350 crore in last two years. Andhra Pradesh energy minister Balineni Srinivasa Reddy said that the state has emerged as a champion of cost effective power at the national level. “No state in the country has achieved such a great success in saving huge public money in power purchases. Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy has categorically instructed the power utilities to go for cost effective power only to protect the interests of the consumers and save public money,” said Srinivasa Reddy. State energy secretary Srikant Nagulapalli said that the cost-effective power would benefit every consumer in the state and boost industrial and economic development. “Our state has set an example to the entire country in terms of cost effective power,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/ap-saves-rs-2350cr-in-power-purchases-in-2-years/articleshow/82888326.cms||---

The state education council apologised for the human error and said the photograph has been taken down. The central president of JMM’s minority cell, Hidayatullah Khan, said circulating the photograph of Prophet Mohammad tantamounts to blasphemy and aimed at disrupting the religious harmony in the state. The cell has also filed an FIR with the Kotwali police station here to identify those responsible and to take action against them. He said the study material for history is meant for Class VII students of state government schools and circulated on May 21. It contained details of Islam religion and a photograph of Prophet Mohammad. Jharkhand head of Edara-e-Shariah, Maulana Qutubuddin Rizwi, said, “It is well known that there are around 1.24 lakh prophets in Islam but none is identified by photographs because they are forbidden.” He pointed out that it could have been a deliberate attempt to hurt religious sentiments because the person or people arranging the study material must have taken extra pain to attach a photograph as nowhere a photograph of the Prophet can be found. The group has written letters to chief minister Hemant Soren, several of his cabinet colleagues and the director of the Jharkhand Education Project Council (JEPC) to take action against those responsible in Digi-Sath. Digi Sath, run in association with JEPC for government schools, provides online study material and is the project of a Delhi-based company named Eckovation. Commenting on the issue JEPC director Sailesh Chaurasia said the matter was brought to his notice and the study material has already been taken off the online platform. “It must have been a human error and I don’t see any deliberate attempt. There is a huge pressure to prepare online material by curating information available online and in that pressure someone must have done it mistakenly,” he said. Khan added, “Even if the content is removed, there are mischievous elements in society who are circulating it further on social media to disrupt communal harmony. So, police must identify and arrest the culprits.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/take-action-against-online-study-platform-for-blasphemy/articleshow/82889664.cms||Jaideep Deogharia
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: Don’t rush to fix dates of Class XII exams, CM to Centre & CBSE||RANCHI: Chief Minister Hemant Soren on Sunday requested the Union education ministry and the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) not to rush in finalising the dates of the Class XII examinations and appealed to them to consider the Covid-19 situation and the mental health of the situations before taking a decision. Soren was speaking during the online consultation meeting organised by the ministry and the CBSE for the board and other competitive/professional examinations which are postponed or deferred because of the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. The CBSE officials said they have two options for the Class XII exams. First, the exams can be conducted only for the major subjects at designated examination centres from around July 15. Secondly, the board proposes to hold examinations in two phases spread over 45 days from the first week of August. The exams will be for 90 minutes instead of three hours and students will be allowed to sit in their schools. The examinees will be provided OMR sheets for quick evaluation. After going through the presentation of the CBSE during the meeting, Soren said, “Examinations are an important aspect of a student's life for their future but we are currently passing through an unprecedented crisis. Unlike the first wave, the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic proved to be far more dangerous and there is fear of an outbreak of a third wave. Moreover, many students have lost their parents during the second wave while parents of many others are recuperating from the infection or battling challenges on the domestic front. We must consider all these factors, particularly the mental health of the students before deciding to hold the examinations.” Soren further said he has initiated a feedback collection drive from his end in the state on the examination will soon send the details to the Union government. The central panel also asked the states to send their feedback by May 25. Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal, defence minister Rajnath Singh and women and child development minister Smriti Irani were present from the government side during the meeting while the states were represented by their chief ministers and education ministers along with bureaucrats of the respective education departments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/dont-rush-to-fix-dates-of-class-xii-exams-cm-to-centre-cbse/articleshow/82898881.cms||ASRP Mukesh

Eggs selling for Rs 60 a dozen on Saturday went for Rs 80–90 per dozen. The GVMC decided to keep all meat and fish shops shut on Sunday after observing heavy crowding at such shops. Despite the GVMC orders, some people went to meat shops on Sunday morning. But they had to return disappointed as all shops remained shut. Meanwhile, egg traders allegedly created an artificial shortage citing low supply and sold eggs at over 30 per cent of normal price. Country eggs sold for nearly 50 per cent more the price, said T Anil, a resident of MVP Colony in Vizag. K Siva, who was out to buy eggs on Sunday morning, said, “Eggs are considered the most basic of non-vegetarian foods when vegetables become dearer. But even eggs became dearer on Sunday.

The organization rejected the appeal, saying not just the central government but the state government, too, is equally responsible for miseries of farmers, including the inability to contain the impact of the pandemic. In his appeal, Amarinder said the farm group’s action was unwarranted, considering the total support the state government had extended to the agitating farmers all these months against the Centre’s three farm laws. “It is time for farmers now to reciprocate by supporting the state government in the fight against the pandemic,” he said. The organisation’s president, Joginder Singh Ugrahan, said: “We will hold the protest for sure by adopting the Covid precautions from May 28 to 30. We are more concerned about the health of our own people,” he said. adding that both central and state governments had failed to save the farmers from the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bku-rejects-amarinders-appeal-to-call-off-three-day-patiala-protest-in-covid-times/articleshow/82896931.cms||---

While BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) chief Joginder Singh Ugrahan led a convoy from Punjab’s Khanouri border to Tikri, BKU (Charuni) president Gurnam Singh Charuni marshalled protesters from Haryana’s Karnal for Singhu. The farm organisations have settled on a relay strategy that involves sending convoys of farmers every Sunday, coinciding with the return of the previous groups after spending a week at the protest sites. The plan has been in place to strengthen the fight against the farm laws despite the Covid surge. The agitation on the Delhi border will complete six months on May 26, which will be marked as a “black day.” “Even though the impact of pandemic is being felt in rural areas, our volunteers are eager to reach the protest sites to further strengthen the protest.

Police recovered a huge cache of arms and ammunition from the militants after the gunfight with a joint team of the paramilitary Assam rifles and the state police. Based on inputs about the presence of terrorists, a joint team of Karbi Anglong and Dima Hasao district police and Assam Rifles personnel launched an operation on Saturday night, which continued till Sunday morning. A senior Karbi Anglong police officer said when the troops reached the jungle, the militants fired at them, following which the security forces retaliated. “About 15 members of the group were there. While six of them were killed, some of them fled to Nagaland, taking advantage of the darkness. We have sought help from Nagaland Police. The operation is still going on in the area,” the officer said. He further said the slain militants have been identified and one of them is a dreaded DNLA cadre, Tamil. “He was involved in the killing of one Sanjay Ronghang on May 19 and one Amit Nunisa ahead of the just-concluded elections for the 126-member Assam legislative assembly,” the officer added. Director general of police Bhaskar Jyoti Mahanta confirmed the development. “Six DNLA cadres were killed. DNLA has been involved in kidnapping, extortion, killings, etc., which will not be tolerated in Assam. We remained strict against terrorists and terror activities. Nobody will be allowed to create unrest.” One security force personnel suffered injuries during the operation. However, the DGP said, the personnel was out of danger. Chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said that the Assam Police have almost “neutralized” the DNLA on Sunday by launching the anti-terror operation.

It is also in keeping with the advice of the paediatric task force to create graded healthcare facilities for management of moderate and severe Covid cases in children on the lines of dedicated Covid health centres and dedicated Covid hospitals created for adults last year. In Mumbai, BMC plans to create 500 beds for kids that will be gradually augmented. Uddhav calls for judicious use of meds in childrenA week after conducting an online session with family physicians, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday interacted with around 6,300 paediatricians and urged them to judiciously use medicines while treating children. He added there were no guidelines on vaccination for children. Members of the paediatric taskforce recommended that designated paediatric Covid care hospitals (PCCH) and paediatric high dependency units (HDU) must be created at district and sub-centre levels, while the existing paediatric ICUs should be augmented with manpower and beds. Up to 95% children have been found to suffer from asymptomatic or mild Covid, 5% from moderate and only 1-2% have severe Covid. Dr T P Lahane, head of medical education department, said plans have been drawn up to increase beds by nearly three-fold by August-September. Every medical college that sees a minimum of 150 admissions has been asked to create 50-bed paediatric Covid wards, while those who have a higher inflow will create 100-bed wards. “NICU and PICU beds that are usually 10-20 will be doubled in the bigger medical colleges across Maharashtra,” he said, adding of the 2,250 beds they intend to increase, around 1,000 will be PICUs and NICUs. Beds in Sick Newborn Care Units will be increased from 8-10 to 20 in each of the district civil hospitals. “The augmentation will need 300 paediatricians at the least and another 700 staffers that we plan to recruit,” Dr Lahane said. In Mumbai, the NESCO jumbo facility will house 400 paediatric beds, including PICU, NICU and a creche, said dean of the facility, Dr Neelam Andrade.Besides the creation of PCCH, HDU and PICUs beds, doctors at every level have to be trained to know when to refer a child to a higher facility, said Dr Suhas Prabhu, head of the paediatric taskforce. “A doctor in a fever clinic is the first point of contact. He has to recognise that a child needs referral, besides understanding the social and practical circumstances where a child can be home quarantined or sent to an isolation facility,” he said. In Maharashtra, 30% of the population is in the paediatric category. “There is nothing to say the third wave will hit children badly, but since they remain unvaccinated, preparations have to be made,” said Dr Vijay Yewale, another paediatric taskforce member. The doctors said reinfections are rare in children, while no child has been known to suffer from mucormycosis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maharashtra-plans-for-third-wave-with-3-fold-addition-to-paediatric-beds/articleshow/82902019.cms||Sumitra Debroy

An aerial video posted on social media of the partly reclaimed water body in the concealed area — with some mangroves also cleared during the curfew period — sparked off angry reactions. The site is in Mandovi river’s flood plain, along the northern side of Margao highway in Morombi-O-Pequeno comunidade. Prompted by the outcry on social media, the comunidade office-bearers and tenants association members visited the site on Sunday evening. “Part of the water body has been buried by the reclamation to the extent of more than a football field or more than 10,000 sq mt. A nullah that interlinks other rain water outlets from Merces village has also been blocked,” a communidade office-bearer said. The newly reclaimed land - an extension of an earlier parcel - already has a few concrete structures, which could be rooms for leasing or commercial activity. Activists are irked by the authorities passive attitude towards the illegal activity. “This has been going on (at this site) for many years. While the authorities turn a blind eye, the wanton destruction of priceless natural heritage continues. All the acts related to coastal regulations zone, mangroves, environment and other aspects are only on paper,” Prajal Sakhardande, a heritage activist said. The comunidade sources said they are looking into the matter from various aspects, including tenancy matter related to the land. “We will file a complaint after studying the issue,” the source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/merces-water-body-in-khazan-land-reclaimed-under-cover-of-curfew/articleshow/82891416.cms||---

Advocate general Devidas Pangam told TOI that the matter is under examination. Recently, the directorate of mines and geology had approached the apex court to get the dump handling matter to be listed at the earliest as the dump handling policy is ready. The policy has been prepared by the monitoring committee as per the SC’s directives. Twenty-six village panchayats have approached the Supreme Court with an interlocutory application (IA) seeking impleadment in the Goa mining case. In February 2018, the SC had quashed the second renewal of 88 mining leases, bringing the entire industry to a halt in the state. Last year, the state government had filed a review petition against the order. It also sought to tag the petition with the one filed by mining companies seeking to extend their leases till 2037. The mining companies had filed a special leave petition (SLP) in the apex court after the high court of Bombay at Goa dismissed their petitions challenging the Goa, Daman and Diu (Abolition and Declaration of Mining Leases) Act, 1987. During the Portuguese rule, the appellants (mining companies) were granted mining concessions, which were then converted into mining leases under the act. The SLP had stated that the act should be made applicable from 1987 instead of 1961.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mining-matter-goa-likely-to-approach-sc-for-early-hearing/articleshow/82891467.cms||---

Keeping in mind the delay in resumption of mining activities in the state, chief minister Pramod Sawant had decided to form a mining corporation to identify new mineral blocks to restart the industry. With the signing of the MoU, Mineral Exploration Corporation Ltd, which is in the process of being formed, will identify new mineral blocks in the state for e-auctioning. The state government has set May 30 as the deadline to get the corporation functional. A senior government officer said that Mineral Exploration Corporation Ltd will prepare the mineral index for the state. Mining in Goa came to a halt in March 2018, following the decision of the Supreme Court to quash the second renewal of 88 mining leases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/now-law-dept-nod-for-new-mines-mou/articleshow/82891515.cms||---

Pernem police said that the girl has died while undergoing treatment. The girl, a Class X student and a resident of Morjim, Pernem, had entered the sea late evening on Saturday along with three of her cousins. Pernem PI Jivba Dalvi said that due to the impact of Cyclone Tauktae, the sea conditions are still rough and dangerous. Dalvi said the group entered the sea around 6.30pm, possibly to avoid being spotted by police and life guards patrolling the shore. “All the cousins were pulled into the sea by high current of tides, but they were rescued. The deceased girl was rescued and found in an unconscious state and immediately shifted to Goa Medical College, Bambolim where she expired while undergoing treatment. Her cousins are under treatment,” said Dalvi. “We requests public not to venture into the sea, especially during rough weather and when we are facing such a serious Covid-19 pandemic and state curfew period is on. Police cannot force public inside their houses, they must willingly follow curfew. The precious life of minor girl has been lost,” he said. Pernem police have registered a case of unnatural death.

As per the plan, 2,600 minivans and tricycles will supply about 1,160 tonnes of vegetables and fruits in Chennai. In rest of Tamil Nadu, 2,770 vehicles will be deployed to sell 2,228 tonnes of vegetables and fruits. Nearly 3,400 tonnes of vegetables and fruits would be procured from farmers every day, a statement from the government said. The state agriculture department has set up a helpline - 044 2225 3884 - which can be contacted by people to know about the vegetable supply schedule in their localities. Special team constituted to ensure delivery of veggiesThe decision was taken at a meeting held by agriculture and farmers welfare minister M R K Panneerselvam with senior agriculture department officials in Chennai on Sunday in the wake of the total lockdown from Monday. The government has planned to source these vegetables from local farmers to be sold to people in those respective areas. This quantity, however, is only one-sixth of the total requirement of 18,000 tonnes, but officials said they would take steps to increase the supply in the coming days. Chennai alone requires 1,500 tonnes daily. Aseparate team of officials from horticulture, agriculture and agri – marketing departments has been constituted to ensure that the system works seamlessly. Local administration officials and those from the cooperative department have also been roped in to supply vegetables through local bodies. Besides selling through vehicles, the government has taken steps to expand the sales by tying up with entities like Ninja Cart, Way Cool, Pazhamudhir Nilayam, Tamil Nadu Plantain Growers Union and Ahimsa Farmer Producers Company for procuring and selling vegetables. State agriculture officials have appealed to farmers to store their produce in cold storage units. Of the total storage capacity of 18,527 tonnes in194 cold storage units, only 3,000 tonnes were stocked now. Farmers can utilize the remaining15,527-tonne capacity to store their produce, the statement said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/2600-vehicles-in-chennai-to-supply-fruits-and-vegetables/articleshow/82897175.cms||---
---||India||Why you shouldn’t stop wearing a mask even after 2 vaccine doses||NEW DELHI: The measles virus is a champion spreader. One person with measles can infect 12-18 others. On average, one coronavirus patient infects fewer than three. Both measles and Covid spread through the air, so why don’t we wear masks to keep measles at bay? There are two reasons. The measles vaccine (MMR) is extremely effective. After two doses, you have 97% protection, which is equal to the best of Covid vaccines. More important: Everyone around you is vaccinated for measles. Chances of running into it are dim. Does that mean we won’t need to wear masks when most people are vaccinated for Covid? In the US, for example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) now says, “Anyone who is fully vaccinated can participate in indoor and outdoor activities, large or small, without wearing a mask or physical distancing.” US President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser Dr Anthony Fauci is more cautious. He says fully vaccinated Americans don’t need to wear masks outdoors unless “people are essentially falling over each other.” In the US, 45% of adults are fully vaccinated while about 60% have got at least one dose. It’s aiming for 70% coverage by July 4. Also, most Americans have taken mRNA vaccines with efficacy scores of 95%. The picture in India looks very different. Roughly 15% of the adult population (95 crore) has got at least one dose, and 4% both doses. Of the entire 130-crore population, just 3% is fully vaccinated. Our vaccines, Covishield and Covaxin, have lower efficacy rates of about 80%. We are also grappling with new variants at the peak of a deadly second wave. So, going maskless could be risky even for the fully vaccinated in India. As AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria said recently, “This virus is very clever and keeps mutating, we cannot say what will be the protection from vaccines as far as new emerging variants are concerned.” But masks and distancing work against all variants, he added. Lesson from SeychellesA vaccine’s efficacy score shows how well it protects you from falling ill. While all vaccines are good at preventing severe disease, the best ones also ward off the milder sym ptoms better. The Seychelles is learning this the hard way. By April, it was the “world’s most vaccinated country.” More than 60% of its 1 lakh population had got two doses. Yet, the first week of May left it grappling with a big outbreak. A Washington Post report says the country’s main treatment centre filled up, and doctors and nurses also fell ill. While most new patients in the Seychelles had not been vaccinated, 35% had got both shots – and there’s a lesson for India in this. Like India, the Seychelles uses two vaccines. About 40% doses are of made-in-India Covishield, and the rest are madein-China Sinopharm shots. The Sinopharm vaccine is an “inactivated vaccine with an adjuvant” – similar to India’s Covaxin. WHO says it has 78% efficacy against symptomatic infection. If the Seychelles could have an outbreak after 60% coverage with these vaccines, India should not let its guard down. There, the population-wide immunity was estimated at less than 50% (60% population, multiplied by 80% efficacy). In India, it would be just over 2% (3% population, multiplied by 80% efficacy). Risk from new variantsA new virus variant called B.1.617 and its offshoots are suspected to have fuelled India’s second wave. B.1.617 has spread to over 40 countries, and in the UK, cases caused by one of these offshoots – B.1.617.2 – doubled in a week. On May 11, B.1.617.2 became only the fourth global ‘variant of concern’. Germany is so worried about its spread that it has put Britain on a list of “risk areas.” It’s still not clear if the B.1.617 virus family is more dangerous but UK scientists are confident B.1.617.2 is a fast spreader and will “eventually ‘dominate’ cases in the UK,” a BBC report says. By one estimate, it could spread 50% faster than the current reigning variant. The Economist mentions 15 cases of B.1.617.2 in a London care-home among people who had taken both doses of the AstraZeneca (Covishield) vaccine. The good news is, the vaccine worked well and nobody died. So yes, vaccination will protect you from severe disease, but if you catch the virus you could pass it on to someone who is not vaccinated. That’s why, for your own sake and for others, continue wearing a mask after vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/why-you-shouldnt-stop-wearing-a-mask-even-after-2-vaccine-doses/articleshow/82897145.cms||Abhilash Gaur

There will, however, be a slight increase in rainfall over the state due to the weather system. “It will not have any wind impact like Cyclone Tauktae did when it was passing near the Goa coast. This event (Cyclone Yaas) may simply make the winds westerly over Goa, owing to which we are expecting light rainfall activity on May 25 and 26 with a comparatively higher spatial distribution compared to the past 48 hours,” IMD scientist, Rahul M said. The IMD forecast on Sunday satted that the well-marked low-pressure area over east central Bay of Bengal and the associated cyclonic circulation extending up to mid-tropospheric levels would concentrate into a depression. “It is very likely to move north-Northwestwards, intensify into a cyclonic storm by May 24 and further into a very severe cyclonic storm during subsequent 24 hours. It would continue to move north-northwestwards, intensify further and reach north Bay of Bengal near West Bengal and adjoining north Odisha and Bangladesh coasts around May 26. It is very likely to cross West Bengal and adjoining north Odisha and Bangladesh coasts around evening of May 26,” the India meteorological department said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-significant-impact-of-cyclone-yaas-on-goa-imd/articleshow/82891561.cms||---

The municipality is facing difficulties due to mismatch of annual income and expenditure. “Our budget is in deficit and since the revenue raised through tax collection is only Rs 2 crore, we have spoken to chief minister Pramod Sawant to provide financial assistance and he has agreed to it,” said the Sakhali municipality chairperson .

It has a trove of her and family photos and videos.” The girl, from Kushalnagar in Kodagu district of Karnataka, has made the appeal through a letter and video message to the deputy commissioner, superintendent of police, lawmakers and the hospital where her 37-yearold mother died. Hrutiksha, set to enter Class V next month, is the only child of her parents. The phone also has online school videos she attended last year during the first wave of the pandemic. Moved by her plight, Congress workers from the district on Sunday donated a smartphone to the girl so that she could continue her online classes. Coming to terms with the twin blows of having lost her mother and now recovering from Covid, Hrutiksha is keen on cherishing memories of her family from happier times. Police said the girl and her parents, Prabha and Naveen Kumar, a painting labourer, tested positive for Covid in early May. While Hrutiksha and her father were quarantined, Prabha was rushed to a Covid hospital on May 6, and she died on May 16. After she was cremated as per Covid guidelines, the distraught family received the valuables, but not her cellphone, from the hospital. Deputy commissioner Charlulatha Somal said she had spoken to police officers to find out the location where the cellphone was last active. Naveen said his wife’s phone had a lot of valuable content and added that his handset is basic and cannot support his daughter’s online education. Prabha’s brother said they complained to hospital authorities when her phone was not returned and added that she called him two days before she died.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/girl-appeals-for-late-moms-lost-phone-gets-a-new-one/articleshow/82897161.cms||G RAJENDRA

GVMC will conduct decentralised activities at the ward level involving ward corporators, secretariats, the community and other stakeholders under the initiative. GVMC mayor G Hari Venkata Kumari has requested corporators to get involved with the programme which may help them deal with the present or future emergencies. Civic body officials say that the activities will include: preparation of staff communication plan, capacity building among ward secretariat staff and health workers, and institutional strengthening. Standard operating procedures for the city operations centre and the smart city mission would be reviewed and revised and hygiene initiatives will be taken up at the community level. Community resilience will be a priority and awareness would be created through information, education and communication (IEC) activities. To carry out the UNDP-GoI (USAID) project’s activities and city initiatives for long-term, ‘Sustainability and Resilience Program’ (SRP) has been started by the establishment of ‘Sustainability and Resilience Unit’ (SRU) in December 2020. This would serve as an autonomous and self-sustained entity under the GVMC commissioner. The purpose of SRP is to support the city as well as the state to achieve sustainable development and improve resilience. The main components of SRP are environment management, disaster management, climate risk management, human resource development, knowledge management, research and innovation, partnerships, collaborations and convergence. Work plans for SRU are prepared annually or as deemed necessary. The unit works in close association with all relevant sections of the city administration as well as state and central governments under the supervision of the GVMC commissioner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/vizag-civic-body-to-leverage-undp-prog-for-covid-control/articleshow/82888064.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

As per the government bed management details, as of 6am on Sunday, city hospitals had 7,702 patients occupying all types of beds under the government quota — in both private and public facilities — of whom 5,415, or 70.3%, were on high dependency units, ICU, or ICU-ventilator beds. These three categories are considered critical-care beds by doctors. Those in HDUs have moderately severe conditions and those in ICUs are critical. General beds are for those with mild symptoms. By 6pm on Sunday, some 7,680 patients occupied beds of all types. Coronavirus live updatesB’luru’s overall bed occupancy is 58%Again, 5,361 were in HDU, ICU or ICU-ventilator beds — accounting for around 70%. At least 136 beds had been blocked by authorities, of which 70% or 95 were in the critical care beds. Overall, 13,231 beds have been dedicated for Covid under government quota across medical facilities, excluding CCCs. Of these, 45% or 6,048 are critical-care beds: 4,864 HDUs, 587 ICU and 597 ICU-ventilators.

A break-up shows that while 86.5% of the 4,864 HDU beds were occupied, 96.9% of ICU and 97.4% of ICU-ventilator beds were occupied. May has been the deadliest month so far as deaths go in the city, and a high percentage of hospitalised patients being critical is not a good sign. As of May 23, Bengaluru has 4,843 reported deaths, which is around 50% that the state has seen. This is the highest for any month since the outbreak.

However, the burden of such cases continues to remain the highest in the country.Listing out efforts undertaken to tackle the pandemic, health minister K Sudhakar said: “The state has the capacity to test 1.5 lakh to 2 lakh samples per day, and has an allocation of 1,015 tonnes of oxygen/day, more than 22,000 oxygen beds and adequate supply of remdesivir across the state.” Officials pointed out that most of these facilities and capacities are concentrated in Bengaluru. The BBMP, on its part, has also been working on prioritising patients through triaging. While an elaborate plan for a ward-level patient prioritisation has been rolled out, its on-ground implementation has not happened fully yet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/7-of-10-patients-in-bengaluru-hospitals-are-moderately-severe-critical/articleshow/82897143.cms||Chethan Kumar
---||Goa||Sanguem MLA: CM supportive of my devpt proposals||Margao: Seven months after he parted ways with the BJP government following an acrimonious war of words between him and the chief minister, independent Sanguem MLA Prasad Gaonkar publicly acknowledged that CM Pramod Sawant has been always supportive of all the development projects in his constituency and that he has always been prompt in clearing his files just the way his predecessor Manohar Parrikar did. The chief minister simply grinned behind the protective mask as Gaonkar made the comments. While political observers said that it was too early to read between the lines, Gaonkar’s public adulation of Sawant is being seen in political circles as a thawing of relations between the two. Gaonkar’s comments came as Sawant was fielding a question posed to him if the differences between him and the former were hampering development works in Sanguem. Sawant and Gaonkar were speaking to reporters after a review meeting at Sanguem over cyclone disaster relief and Covid-19 management in the taluka. Replying to the query, Sawant said that he didn’t discriminate between constituencies as “I am focused on the development of the entire state as a whole.” At this point, Gaonkar came to Sawant’s aid and eased his discomfort. “I have never made any allegations against the chief minister; the chief minister may counter me if I am wrong. Whatever I had said was with regards to local politics,” Gaonkar said to a query about the accusations he had made against Sawant some months ago. In October 2020, Gaonkar withdrew his support to the Sawant-led government following a slanging match between him and Sawant over allocation of land for the IIT project in the state. He then also accused the government of not managing the affairs of Sanjeevani sugar co-operative and “allowing its slow death”. Sawant had retorted by accusing Gaonkar of having made “settings” over the lands identified by the government for the proposed IIT campus project. Following the break-up with the government, Gaonkar was perceived to be cosying up to GFP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sanguem-mla-cm-supportive-of-my-devpt-proposals/articleshow/82891704.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Goa||Goa: Cyclone Tauktae causes sand erosion at Polem beach||POINGUINIM: Over the years, Polem beach stretch in Canacona has suffered significant sand erosion and the situation has worsened now by the impact of Cyclone Tauktae last week. Several casuarina trees, which help hold the sand together, have been uprooted. With monsoon fast-approaching, the locals now fear flooding. The fishermen from Polem area, who exclusively depend on fishing for their livelihood, said that their fishing boats and fishing nets have been left vulnerable to damage from natural systems like cyclones. Fishermen Ankush Pagi said the government should assist them with a shelter to house their fishing boats and fishing nets, in absence of which they have to leave the equipment on the beach. Locals said that a simple look at the state of the beach at present is telling of how, if some protective measures are not taken on priority, there will be tough days ahead not only for the fishermen but also for those residing near the beach too. Residents shiver at the memory of the flash floods that affected Canacona in October 2, 2009. Another fishermen Themo Pagi said they do not have a fishnets mending shed. In absence of this, their livelihood is at stake, he said, adding that the government should take some measures for their welfare. Ulhas Chandrekar, a social activist, said that the concerned department should visit and see the extent of damage caused to the beach and the fishing articles like fishing boats and fishing nets which have been washed away by last weekend’s rough waves. Loliem-Polem sarpanch Sachin Naik said he is aware of the damage caused and losses suffered by the Pagi Samaj.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cyclone-causes-sand-erosion-at-polem-beach/articleshow/82891734.cms||Albert Fernandes
---||Goa||Goa: Arambol animal shelter rebuilt after Cyclone Tauktae damage||PANAJI: After Cyclone Tauktae left an animal shelter at Arambol damaged from the heavy rain and strong winds, Mission Rabies Goa put together its manpower to help rebuild the collapsed shelter within a few days. “We got hit really hard because trees around the shelter were uprooted and the roof fell leaving us absolutely devastated,” said one of the volunteers who manages the ‘I Love Goa Dogs’ animal shelter. It usually has 40-50 dogs under its care who are brought in for sterilisation after being rescued and are taken care of and then released. Last Sunday the shelter had only 14 dogs under its thatched roof, a few of whom got trapped under the debris following the damage and were rescued after an SOS was sent out to Mission Rabies. “Luckily there weren’t any rescue pups or kittens at the time,” the volunteer said. “After the animal shelter collapsed our team rushed and rescued the dogs trapped that day and in the following days they returned to the location to rebuild the shelter. Although only temporary, the animals now have somewhere dry to shelter themselves,” said Mission Rabies Goa, education director, Dr Murugan Appupillai.  The destruction caused by the cyclonic storm is slowly being cleared to help the animals and their shelter get back on its feet. “We have managed to cut all the trees that have smashed the shelter. People we have never met before but know us by reputation have offered to help us,” the volunteer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/arambol-animal-shelter-rebuilt-after-cyclone-damage/articleshow/82891808.cms||Nida Sayed
---||Bengaluru||Home care scrapped, Karnataka government now struggles to fill Covid Care Centres||BENGALURU: Having done away with the policy of home isolation in urban slums and rural areas, the state government appears to have bit off more than it can chew as it is facing a daunting task in getting infected people into Covid Care Centres (CCC). Officials say although the state government has upgraded infrastructure in CCCs and has even created a section with oxygenated beds, people testing positive are reluctant to move to these centres. Taking serious note of reports that many patients in home isolation are routinely flouting rules, resulting in infections spreading and fatalities, the government on Saturday decided not to allow people to recover at home in urban slums and villages. The government also made it mandatory for asymptomatic patients and people with mild symptoms to get admitted to CCCs, which also serve as triage centres. CN Ashwath Narayan, deputy chief minister and chairman of the Covid task force, who chaired a review meeting in Hassan on Saturday, directed deputy commissioners of all districts to ensure patients in home isolation are moved to CCCs. The decision was prompted by health department data which shows 70 patients either died at home or were brought dead to hospital in the period between May 14 and 22. The issue was even raised by Hassan district MLAs who urged Narayan to do away with home isolation completely. “The spread of infection and deaths in certain geographical areas are yet to come under control even as the overall pandemic situation in the state is improving,” Narayan said. “We can get rid of this problem by making use of CCCs instead of encouraging home isolation.” He said home isolation has been limited to urban homes which have separate rooms with attached toilets. In a bid to ensure compliance with isolation rules, the government is planning to affix red tape on houses with infected people. The Covid Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) had advised the government to ensure CCCs are equipped with medical facilities, doctor and nursing service, and proper amenities including good quality food and clean toilets so that patients can walk in confidently into these centres. “CCCs will play a crucial role in controlling the present surge as well as the impending third wave. So, we advised the government to upgrade them and retain them for the future. I am glad that the government acted on it promptly,” said TAC chairman Dr MK Sudarshan. The government has set up 58 CCC-triage centres in Bengaluru, with a cumulative strength of 3,218 beds. Of this, 1,253 are oxygenated beds, but close to 90% of them were vacant as of Saturday. Only 366 patients walked in, of which 46 were sent to hospital and 172 were referred to HDU. As many as 148 were admitted to CCCs. This, despite the city recording 8,214 fresh cases on Saturday and the 1912 call centre received about 4,000 calls from patients. The scenario was no different in the rest of Karnataka with only 30% of 19,300 beds occupied in 289 newly set up CCCs in 227 taluks. “The main reason for this is the lack of awareness about the upgraded facilities at CCCs,” said Sarfraz Khan, BBMP joint commissioner and in-charge of CCCs in Bengaluru. “What patients should know is that they get cured quickly if they are admitted to CCCs. They should also know that if their health condition worsens, they can easily be shifted to hospitals from CCCs.” He said the situation is improving and more people are getting admitted to care centres after the BBMP announced on Saturday that patients can directly walk-in for admission without having the hassle of calling war rooms or the rigmarole of blocking a bed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/home-care-scrapped-karnataka-government-now-struggles-to-fill-covid-care-centres/articleshow/82897182.cms||B V Shiva Shankar

Now Khanpur has 9 oximeters, 100 thermometers, masks, santitisers, zinc and vitamin C tablets as well as other medicines that are being distributed freely to villagers. Over 200 boys and girls have formed social media groups to coordinate efforts towards finding hospital beds, oxygen, ambulances. Local residents said 20-25 people have fallen to Covid in the village in the last one month, but it was the death of Santosh Sharma, 66, a disabled English teacher that hit the youngsters hard. Sharma, who taught at a private school and took tuition, fell ill towards April-end and died within a week, gasping for breath as she was turned away by several private hospitals. Sharma had spent her life teaching village kids and helping shape careers of many of her students. “She is a revered figure here. Other than her English tutorials, her life itself was a lesson for us, and so was her death,” said her former student Abhishek Chikara, 27, an engineer with an automobile company in Gurgaon who coordinated with other village youngsters to set up a Covid self-help team. The youngsters now not only clean the village daily, but have also converted the local school into a six-bed isolation ward. “Almost 99% of students from our village have learnt whatever English they know from her,” said Shawal Choudhary, 30, a primary school teacher. A few originally from Khanpur but now settled overseas have also pitched in now. “These kids have now taken things in their own hands as they help people around them who do not have access to proper healthcare,” said Amit Chikara, 40, a native from Khanpur who now lives in London.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/teachers-death-spurs-village-youths-to-wage-covid-war/articleshow/82897213.cms||Piyush Rai

As of May 22, Maharashtra, which has more than twice the number of total infections compared to Karnataka, has 3.5 lakh active cases compared to 4.8 lakh in Karnataka. No other state has more than 3 lakh active cases. Fresh cases in Maharashtra had begun to surge earlier than Karnataka in the second wave, which means its recoveries also saw a surge before the state’s, resulting in that state having fewer active cases. 57% in 5 StatesKerala, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh are the other states with most active cases. Together, these five states had 16.2 lakh of the more than 28.1 lakh active cases in India.

The last time active cases were under 5 lakh was on May 5, when it was slightly higher than the May 22 figure. Between May 6 and 22, the state consistently had more than 5 lakh cases. While experts have repeatedly pointed to the kind of impact such high active cases have on the medical infrastructure, health minister K Sudhakar on Sunday said: “Significant transformation in health infrastructure has been achieved during this pandemic.” He added the government is working towards a comprehensive plan to ensure vaccination for every citizen in the state by November-December. As on May 22, more than 1.2 crore doses have been administered in the state, while 1.13 crore doses of vaccines have been supplied by the Centre so far.

Four others are admitted in private hospitals in the district. The rising figures of black fungus cases and deaths have left hospitals and district authorities jittery as demand for Amphotericin-B injection, used to treat mucormycosis, has shot up and supply is expected to normalise in a week. The total black fungus toll at BHU hospital has increased to six, while surgery of nine patients has been conducted. Till Sunday, the total number of patients had reached 84, of which six died. The district administration had provided 100 vials of Amphotericin-B on May 19 and the entire stock is over, Gupta said. “We are expecting more supply in next three days,” DM Kaushal Raj Sharma said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/black-fungus-kills-4-more-in-varanasi-82-others-infected/articleshow/82897219.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

On Sunday, 35,483 people tested positive for Covid-19 in the state. With 422 deaths in the last 24 hours, the state’s Covid toll increased to 20,468 — the fourth highest in the country. Among them, 114 (27%) had no comorbidities such as diabetes or hypertension. However, the daily recovery count continues to hover around the 25,000-mark. Hence the number of active cases has been on the rise. Currently, 2,94,193 patients are undergoing treatment in health centres or homes. As a result, finding an oxygen-supported or ICU bed remains difficult in Tamil Nadu. Of the 52,030 such beds in Tamil Nadu, only 4.3% were vacant on Sunday evening. Though official data suggests that the bed situation is better in Chennai with vis-a-vis last week as 6% O2 and ICU beds are vacant, waiting time at ambulances outside government hospitals was getting longer. Patients now wait for a minimum of four hours to get admission at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital in Chennai. Chennai recorded 5,169 new cases on Sunday and 81 deaths. Cases have dropped in the neighbouring districts of Chengalpet (1,982 new cases), Thiruvallur (1,259) and Kancheepuram (897) too compared to Saturday. Coimbatore continues to remain the second-worst affected district in TN with 3,944 new cases. There has been a 42% increase in the number of active cases during the last one week because the discharge count outpaced the infection figure by a big margin. Except for Madurai (1,139 new cases), cases have increased in Trichy (1,407), Salem (966) and other major TN cities. As far as vaccination is concerned, a total of 28,149 got the jab on Sunday, taking the cumulative total to 72,40,508 across the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/salem/over-35000-new-covid-19-cases-in-tamil-nadu-422-deaths/articleshow/82897225.cms||---

All activities relating to agriculture, horticulture and floriculture — including transport, storage and sale of seeds, fertilizers, pesticides and agricultural machines and equipment — will not be under the ambit of restrictions. The state government will also allow rural development work, including emergency, flood control and essential pre-monsoon activities. “The agriculture sector must now work on a war footing to reap the harvest to save the grain they have produced with so much labour and care. Last year, Amphan wreaked havoc with standing crops in fields. Thus, this exemption will be of great help,” said state agriculture minister Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay. The Merchants’ Chamber of Commerce & Industry (MCCI) had appealed to chief minister Mamata Banerjee to notify agriculture and related industries as essential services allowed to operate even under strict Covid restrictions. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-eases-farm-curbs-for-yaas/articleshow/82892909.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||Caste abuse: Case against IIT-Kgp prof||Kharagpur: Police in Kharagpur have filed a suo motu case against an IIT Kharagpur professor accused of abusing Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe students during two classes in April. IIT authorities are currently conducting a probe into her misbehaviour, the video of which has gone viral, leading to condemnation from student bodies across the country and a stricture from the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST). A case (no 253/2021) under the SC & ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, was registered at Kharagpur Town PS following an email it received from NCST, which had written to the state chief secretary seeking a report on the alleged misconduct by Seema Singh. According to NCST, Singh had made derogatory and abusive remarks to preparatory students and 1st year UG students, inclusive of SC/ST students, during online classes on April 16 and 23. The police complaint mentions that an inquiry by the IIT Kharagpur registrar had confirmed the alleged remarks after a preliminary probe. The institute had thereafter placed Singh under suspension pending a full inquiry. ASP Kharagpur Rana Mukherjee said: “A case has been lodged. Inquiries are being conducted.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/caste-abuse-case-against-iit-kgp-prof/articleshow/82892945.cms||Sujoy Khanra
---||Ranchi||Set up ICUs for children, vaccinate young parents, experts tell Hemant Soren||RANCHI: A few of the country’s top paediatricians urged chief minister Hemant Soren and his senior bureaucrats to vaccinate the state's young parents on priority, train doctors and paramedics on the treatment of Covid-infected children and set up ICU wards for children and minors below 18 years of age ahead of the third wave which could hit the country soon. In Jharkhand, there are 1.93 crore children aged under 18 years. On the contrary, there are only 125 paediatricians in the state. Concerned with reports that the third wave will affect the children most as they are yet to be vaccinated, the state government reached out to the WHO's India representative Dr Rodrico H Orfin, AIIMS New Delhi paediatrics department head Dr Ashok Deorari, prominent paediatric liver specialist Dr Neelam Mohan and NIHMS Bengaluru physician Dr Pradeep Banandur virtually on Sunday afternoon to seek their suggestions on the state's preparation for the third wave. During the meeting, the experts pointed out that Jharkhand has a high proportion of anaemic children (43%) and such children are likely to develop problems related to blood oxygen levels fast if they are infected. Hence, the government must set up ICUs equipped with high-flow nasal cannulas, CPAP machines and ventilators in these units apart from ensuring that they are linked to the piped oxygen supply. Dr Deorari cited various medical research to highlight that though only 12% of the total infected persons in the country were below 18 years, their mortality rate was minuscule. “Mostly, the children who died of Covid-19 were having comorbid conditions,” he said. Dr Deorari, however, underscored the need to bolster better care for children in home isolation and their proper nourishment. “Very few Covid-19 infected children will need hospitalisation as most of them are likely to be asymptomatic or with mild symptoms,” he predicted. Dr Mohan predicted that chances are high that as many as 1.9 lakh-3.8 lakh children can contract the viral infection in the state and about 3,800 will have severe infections. The Jharkhand government, however, estimates that close to 9,000 children can be severely affected by the virus. “Awareness needs to be created on Covid-19 symptoms among the children and the most common symptoms among kids above eight years are fever, cough, pneumonia, diarrhoea, dehydration, loss of appetite, headache and loss of smell. Among infants, if they refused to breastfeeding, the parents must not ignore it,” Dr Mohan said. She further said Covid-infected children also report multi-inflammatory syndrome and suggested that the ICUs should have facilities to accommodate parents of the infected children. Dr Banandur advocated the mobilisation of NCC cadets to create awareness among children and setting up mental health assistance programs at districts and school levels.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/set-up-icus-for-children-vaccinate-young-parents-on-priority-paediatricians-tell-hemant/articleshow/82889536.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Kolkata||Two more TMC defectors appeal for ‘ghar wapsi’||MALDA: After former Bengal deputy speaker Sonali Guha on Saturday, two more Trinamool leaders have expressed interest for “ghar wapsi”. While Malda zilla parishad member Sarala Murmu said she “realized” her “mistake”, former North Dinajpur MLA Amol Acharya cited the recent harassment of TMC veterans by CBI as the immediate reason for leaving BJP. Murmu was named the TMC candidate from Habibpur in the assembly election. But she, along with zilla parishad sabhadipati Gour Mandal, joined BJP at the behest of Suvendu Adhikari. After TMC won 8 out of 12 seats in the district, Murmu re-established contact with her old party. “It was a mistake for me to join BJP. Now, when the CM has appealed to defectors to return, I want to come back,” she said on Sunday. Two-time Itahar MLA and former North Dinajpur district TMC president Acharya was denied nomination this time. A miffed Acharya joined BJP, but was not given a ticket either. “I have always considered Mamata Banerjee my leader. But I never thought I would be denied a nomination. I was upset and joined BJP. It was a mistake. Now, the BJP’s vindictive politics against leaders like Subrata Mukherjee, Firhad Hakim and others is exposed. I’ve written a letter of apology to the CM. I hope they will forgive me,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/2-more-tmc-defectors-appeal-for-ghar-wapsi/articleshow/82893014.cms||Subhro Maitra
---||Ranchi||‘Take action against online study platform for blasphemy’||Ranchi: The socio-religious body of Muslims, Edara-e-Shariah, and the minority cell of the ruling Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) took strong exception to the circulation of a Prophet Mohammad photograph in the study material distributed by Digi Sath — a platform that operates the online education system among school students. The state education council apologised for the human error and said the photograph has been taken down. The central president of JMM’s minority cell, Hidayatullah Khan, said circulating the photograph of Prophet Mohammad tantamounts to blasphemy and aimed at disrupting the religious harmony in the state. The cell has also filed an FIR with the Kotwali police station here to identify those responsible and to take action against them. He said the study material for history is meant for Class VII students of state government schools and circulated on May 21. It contained details of Islam religion and a photograph of Prophet Mohammad. Jharkhand head of Edara-e-Shariah, Maulana Qutubuddin Rizwi, said, “It is well known that there are around 1.24 lakh prophets in Islam but none is identified by photographs because they are forbidden.” He pointed out that it could have been a deliberate attempt to hurt religious sentiments because the person or people arranging the study material must have taken extra pain to attach a photograph as nowhere a photograph of the Prophet can be found. The group has written letters to chief minister Hemant Soren, several of his cabinet colleagues and the director of the Jharkhand Education Project Council (JEPC) to take action against those responsible in Digi-Sath. Digi Sath, run in association with JEPC for government schools, provides online study material and is the project of a Delhi-based company named Eckovation. Commenting on the issue JEPC director Sailesh Chaurasia said the matter was brought to his notice and the study material has already been taken off the online platform. “It must have been a human error and I don’t see any deliberate attempt. There is a huge pressure to prepare online material by curating information available online and in that pressure someone must have done it mistakenly,” he said. Khan added, “Even if the content is removed, there are mischievous elements in society who are circulating it further on social media to disrupt communal harmony. So, police must identify and arrest the culprits.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/take-action-against-online-study-platform-for-blasphemy/articleshow/82889702.cms||Jaideep Deogharia
---||Kolkata||Kolkata families grapple with multiple Covid-19 deaths||KOLKATA: There is scarcely any family that Covid-19 has not touched in some way or the other; after all, it has killed more than 3,00,000 people in the country. But some families have endured that loss multiple times over — with the death of parents, siblings, children, grandparents and extended family. Park Circus resident Atiya Mushtaq is always on edge these days. She lives with a constant fear that the next phone call would bring devastating news. The virus hit her family a few months ago, and she lost her brother and two brothers-in-law in quick succession. She had not even been able to reconcile the three deaths when the husbands of her two young nieces also died. “I didn’t even get the time to mourn any of the deaths properly because everything happened so suddenly,” said Mushtaq. “It is such a huge blow to our family. I never thought this pandemic will claim so many dear ones.” The pandemic has also left a deep impact on the family of the last of the famed ‘Pancha Pandavas’ of modern Bengali literature, Shankha Ghosh. The 89-year-old breathed his last on April 21. He had been in home isolation after testing positive on April 14. Exactly eight days later, his wife, too, succumbed to the virus. Family sources said Pratima Ghosh (89), too, had been isolating at home after testing positive around April 14. “The death of her husband left her shattered. Her condition deteriorated all of a sudden, giving us little time to rush her to hospital,” said a family member. Surviving family members, some of whom were battling Covid themselves as they lost or mourned their loved ones, are often left with very little time to come to terms with the deaths. Many also suffer from a lingering sense of grief. Amit Dutta, 35, lost his grandmother and father to the virus in the second week of April, all in a span of 24 hours. His mother, Shila Dutta, had to be hospitalised but she returned home after a week of battle. When Ajay Chakraborty went for a trip to Puri with his wife and son in the first week of April, he had no inkling that this would be their last trip as a family. Just after coming back, his wife, Ananya Nandy Chakraborty, started showing Covid symptoms and was admitted to a city hospital, where her condition rapidly deteriorated and she slipped into coma. She breathed her last in the first week of May. But losing his wife was not the only tragedy for the 44-year-old Karunamayee resident. In between, he and his 12-year-old son returned with positive tests and his in-laws, who lived with him, passed away. His father-in-law died due to prolonged illness and mother-in-law lost her battle against the virus. The world turned upside down in no time for this family. Before Ajay could properly mourn his wife, he had to gather himself to take care of his son, who still cannot accept the that his mother is gone forever. On May 1, sitarist Prateek Chaudhuri announced his father’s demise on Facebook. The 84-year-old Padma Bhushan, Pt Debu Chaudhuri, had been admitted to a Delhi hospital, when he got infected. Prateek announced that his father suffered a heart attack, from which he could not be revived. Six days later, the 49-year-old Prateek himself passed away. He is survived by his wife, daughter and son. Families facing multiple tragedies is increasingly typical in India and Bengal. According to healthcare experts, it’s more common in joint families. “In our country, it is common for multiple generations of a family to live under one roof. But, during a pandemic, such arrangements pose a challenge for younger people trying to protect their elders and more vulnerable relatives from exposure to the virus,” said Sourabh Choudhury, an intensive care specialist.

---||Kolkata||Bengal governor ‘stunned’ after Trinamool MP Kalyan Banerjee urges cop complaint against him||KOLKATA: The face-off between Trinamool Congress and governor Jagdeep Dhankhar escalated further on Sunday with Trinamool MP Kalyan Banerjee alleging it was at the governor’s behest that three senior party leaders were arrested in the Narada case, and asked party supporters to lodge complaints against the governor. Dhankhar said he was stunned by the MP’s comments but left the matter to the “sound discretion of cultured people of West Bengal and media”. Banerjee later told TOI that according to the Constitution, no criminal proceedings can be initiated against the governor till he remits his post. “So, I have urged all people of Bengal to lodge complaints with their respective police stations, so that the complaint can be converted into an FIR later when he is no more a governor and then the former governor can be sent to Presidency Jail for disturbing the secular fabric of Bengal.” The MP alleged that the governor was going to differ- ent parts of the state and spreading provocative messages and instigating violence. Addressing Banerjee as a senior Trinamool functionary, parliamentarian and advocate, Dhankhar tweeted: “Just stunned but leave the matter to sound discretion of cultured people of West Bengal and media.” Bengal BJP spokesperson Shamik Bhattacharya slammed Banerjee for his comments. “He is a Lok Sabha MP and a lawyer. In attacking a constitutional head, he is attacking the Constitution itself. And since he is a senior party leader, we must believe that Trinamool endorses attempts to denigrate the Constitution,” Bhattacharya said. According to Banerjee, “the governor had organised the arrest of the four leaders in the Narada case, as he gave his sanction on May 7 to the CBI directly. The governor took the initiative to arrest the four. In January 2021, CBI sought sanction and the matter was supposed to be discussed in the cabinet and it was supposed to be routed through the state government but with ulterior motives it was sent to the governor.” The MP described Dhankhar as a “bloodsucker”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/guv-stunned-after-kalyan-urges-cop-plaint-against-him/articleshow/82892959.cms||---
---||Ranchi||In a first in India, Jharkhand to start mobile Covid-19 vax drive||RANCHI: The state government is gearing up to launch a mobile Covid-19 vaccination programme for the beneficiaries who are living in urban as well as rural areas by the end of May. If implemented, the programme will be the first in India, sources in the state health department told TOI. Under the programme, custom-made mobile vaccination vans will be dispatched to localities in a city or in block headquarters in rural areas. The beneficiaries will be able to register themselves on the spot and take their jabs. While beneficiaries above 45 years can avail on-the-spot registration, the state government has filed a plea before the Supreme Court on May 16 seeking the removal of mandatory prior registration through Co-WIN portal, Arogya Setu and Umang application for eligible beneficiaries aged between 18-44 years. The programme will be launched on a pilot basis in Ranchi district, which has reported the most number of Covid-19 cases and mortalities during the ongoing second wave of the pandemic in the state. Chief minister Hemant Soren is likely to inaugurate the programme once the decks are cleared. “Besides facilitating vaccination drives in rural parts of Jharkhand, it will also help to reduce the waiting time and congestion in the designated session sites,” Anjanyelu Dodde, the nodal officer for Covid-19 vaccination in Jharkhand, said. Customised vans carrying vials of Covid-19 vaccines in ice-lined refrigerator boxes will roll into different localities of Ranchi. On-board doctors and medical staff will register the beneficiaries on the spot, administer them vaccines and watch out for adverse effects following immunisation. As on Sunday evening, Jharkhand had a little over 1,200 vaccination centres. Government-run session sites are witnessing a surge in beneficiaries since a Centre order halted vaccination in private session sites across the state. Out of the 1.57 crore beneficiaries aged between 18-44 years, 3.34 lakh people took their first doses since the drive began on May 1. “We are currently experiencing a shortage of vaccines. Once the stocks arrive, we are likely to start the programme,” Dodde said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/in-a-first-in-india-jharkhand-to-start-mobile-covid-19-vax-drive/articleshow/82889629.cms||Dhritiman Ray

Deputy commissioner Suraj Kumar issued a directive in this regard to the district health department which in turn decided to take the help of the PDS shopkeepers to monitor the health status of their respective customers as they deal with them on a regular basis. Under the plan, the PDS shopkeepers in the rural areas have to keep a note of the cardholders whether they are suffering from cough, cold, fever and other symptoms of Covid-19 and report to the health officials concerned. The health officials will then track the patient and provide him or her with the necessary treatment. Sources said if any person dies of Covid in rural areas, the respective PDS shopkeeper would be questioned for lapses. The move was also prompted by unnatural deaths of villagers recently. Notably, a youth from Chakuliya area of East Singhbhum district, who villages said had Covid symptoms, died on Saturday. The villagers said the deceased was neither tested nor efforts were taken up by the administration to an isolation centre. There were also instances when the villagers were not tested and get any medical help in their respective areas. Health experts said efforts should be taken up to check the spread of the virus in the rural areas as many daily wagers returned to their villages daily.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/pds-shopkeepers-to-keep-tab-on-villagers-health-status-in-e-sbhum/articleshow/82889719.cms||Debasish Chatterjee

K Kumar, a resident of Madagupatti in Sivaganga union, said they had decided to keep the disease at bay by imposing some strict measures. "It is a tradition to hang neem leaves outside houses when someone is infected with a contagious disease, but this time we decided to use it to send out a clear message to the people and outsiders," he said. Panchayat president M Saraswathy said the two Madagupattis - the other one in Singampunari union - were "closely related" and decided to follow strict measures. Apart from the neem-fence, she said they had blocked the roads leading to their village with thorns. Every day, a huge cauldron of concoction made of herbs, pepper, dry ginger, zeera, guava leaf and turmeric is put to boil on wood fire at night. In the morning, this drink is distributed to all villagers in the 2,650 houses. People coming to visit their families from outside have to compulsorily wash their hands and feet with soap and water. "It causes some discomfort, but it is also the reason why we have not had any Covid death from our village,'' said Muthukumar, a villager.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/villages-near-madurai-fenced-with-neem-leaves/articleshow/82897268.cms||---

In several neighbourhoods, salons had customers coming in from Saturday evening until Sunday noon. "It is not clear whether the government allowed opening of salons and spas in this brief window, but authorities turned a blind eye towards it and most salons in my neighourhood were crowded," said T Santhosh, a resident of Adambakkam. According to M Murugan, who runs a home appliances repair shop near Madipakkam bus terminus, he got many work orders to repair mixie or grinders since Saturday. At some larger service centers, there were even queues outside. "Home appliances in kitchens are essentials. I came (to a repair shop) for regular servicing as next week is a complete lockdown period," said G Subha of Nanganallur. People were seen queuing up outside pawn shops in areas such as Madipakkam, Adambakkam to pledge jewellery to meet living expenses in the coming days as daily wagers, roadside vegetable and fruit vendors would be out of business for a week. "It would be helpful if the government identifies such vendors in each neighbourhood and provides them with carts to sell vegetables during the lockdown, their livelihoods are also at stake here," said P Balamurugan, an activist. Electricians, plumbers, carpenters and other skilled workers too flocked to hardware stores to stock up on tools and spares. "We usually buy tools and required items on the day of work using customer's money. But due to the complete lockdown, we had to get money and buy tools in advance. It is not clear whether we will be allowed to move around for work. Some of us take up work in government buildings too. So, it is better to be prepared," said S Karthikeyan, an electrician from Keelkattalai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/salons-appliance-repair-shops-in-chennai-see-crowds/articleshow/82897277.cms||---

She drags a yoga mat out of the cupboard and turns her computer on while humming a tune in broken Español. Last week, Rhea's grandfather had to be rushed to hospital after he developed Covid related complications. And even though her mother puts a brave face on, anxiety is palpable in their cramped Wadala apartment. As the song 'Quema Quema' booms through the computer speakers and her Zumba instructor pops up on screen, 10-year-old Rhea is transported to a different world for the next hour. Fuelled by the need to keep anxiety at bay and engage children in meaningful activities indoors, parents have taken recourse to a variety of tutorials that have mushroomed online. From baking sessions and brush calligraphy to reciting shlokas and even dressing dolls, children are discovering hobbies that are a welcome break from the monotony of the idiot box. "Most housing societies have prohibited children from playing downstairs due to concerns about a paediatric wave in the coming months. In such times, getting involved in a physical activity indoors and having fun with music at the same time appeals to many," says licensed Zumba instructor Prachi Jatania, who takes tutorials for children as well as mother-child joint sessions. "I get the kids to do jumping jacks or squat Namastes. At the end of an hour, they are sweating. Enjoying the music releases all pressure or worry," Jatania says. Making thick and thin strokes on paper can be equally therapeutic. "We always teach children to inhale while they are making upstrokes and exhale when they are making downstrokes," says designer Sanjana Chatlani, who has been teaching brush calligraphy to two dozen kids between 8 and 13 years every weekend. Chatlani, who uses a second camera facing her paper for kids to grasp concepts well, says that when breath and hand movements are in sync, strokes are a lot more precise and accurate. Educators say that the lower brain reacts to stress and anything that creates a calm mindfulness in children is good. "Yoga, music or spirituality classes are a good idea, but anything that increases the focus on academic performance wouldnt be good at a time like this. At a young age, the right brain is developing first and that part of the brain is very fond of dance, songs, stories, anything that is a fun or play based activity. The lower brain reacts to stress, so, any activity that soothes the lower brain is the right activity for children," says Swati Popat Vats, President of the Early Childhood Association. When Pune based Ananya Nair cooked a continental breakfast for her father for the first time, he had no idea that the eight-year-old had spent the previous week practising with her Bangalore based instructor virtually. The advantage of virtual learning is that classes are no longer confined to geographical boundaries. Chatlani's calligraphy classes have children from Singapore and Hong Kong participating. "But while classes may be online, we still get students to run around for some activities and get their hands dirty," says Darshini Shah of The Square, a Powai based centre that is running summer camps that include experimentation in the kitchen and environmentalism in the balcony.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/zumba-baking-e-tutorials-help-kids-beat-covid-blues/articleshow/82897267.cms||Nitasha Natu

They rushed out of the Jagiroad railway station, around 60 km from Guwahati, soon after the train arrived at around 10:30am on Sunday. Mostly migrant workers, including women and children, they had travelled by the train that had set off from Kanyakumari in Tamil Nadu and traversed Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, and West Bengal over five days, covering for over 4,000kms. A video of the event is now doing the rounds on social media. An official of Jagiroad railway station said, “Over 400 people arrived here. Around 20 were tested, when the passengers suddenly created an uproar, manhandled the health workers and rushed out skipping the test. They also threw away the swab taken for rapid antigen tests, tables and chairs. Now, we cannot detect which RAT kit was positive or negative.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/400-on-train-carrying-migrants-rush-out-of-assam-station-to-avoid-covid-test/articleshow/82897274.cms||Mukut Das
---||Bengaluru||New vaccination plan: Slum dwellers, auto drivers to get priority in Karnataka||BENGALURU: With supply of Covid-19 vaccine doses being too meagre for the state government to launch a mass vaccination drive to inoculate those aged between 18 and 44 years, Karnataka instead intends to ‘rationalise’ existing stock by targeting slum dwellers, auto and cab drivers, e-commerce delivery agents and construction workers. The drive is likely to be launched in the first week of June. Claiming that these categories of workers are the most vulnerable – besides designated frontline workers – the government will use existing stock of doses to inoculate this segment of the population on priority. In its latest vaccination policy announced on Saturday, the government said it will continue with inoculating those above 45 years but admitted vaccinations for those between 18 and 44 years is “currently unavailable”. However, it added that vulnerable and priority groups of people will be inoculated on designated dates and time. CN Ashwath Narayan, deputy chief minister and Covid-19 task force chairman said as part of this strategy, the government has decided to reach out to people in slums, Metro construction sites and other congested and first-contact locations to vaccinate people. “While our main aim will be those over 45 years who have still not gotten vaccinated in these locations, we will also use current vaccine stocks to jab those under 44 years,” Narayan said. Apart from targeting auto and cab drivers, Narayan said the government will set up camps at Metro construction sites, slums and other construction sites. While locations for vaccination camps in slums and construction sites would be obvious, for auto and cab drivers, who are constantly on the move, the drive will be held at a set point and SMS messages sent to their phones. “We are exploring the possibility of tracking auto and cab drivers through their contact details submitted to the transport department in 2020, when each of them was paid Rs 5,000 as a one- time relief during the nationwide lockdown,” said one government official. However, officials say, given the current stock of doses, the government may not be able to even inoculate designated frontline workers, leave alone priority groups. “We are managing the best we can with what’s available,” an official said. As of Saturday, Karnataka had a total stock of 4 lakh doses (both Covishield and Covaxin). Meanwhile, the decision to shift vaccination centres to schools and colleges has begun in 143 locations in Bengaluru and the outskirts. Neither BBMP chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta nor National Health Mission director Arundhati Chandrashekar were available for comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/new-vaccination-plan-slum-dwellers-auto-drivers-to-get-priority-in-karnataka/articleshow/82897234.cms||Sandeep Moudgal

In over 20 wards, the TPR was over 40%. Now, there is only one ward with TPR over 50 and five wards which have over 40% TPR. This is also a result of the well-planned enforcement by the police,” Rural police said in the statement. Rural police said that over 2,000 policemen were deployed in the district for the fight against Covid and as many as 136 checkpoints were set up within the district, apart from over 15 border checkpoints. “In hilly areas and by the rivers, drone surveillance is going on. Policemen in plainclothes have been deployed to avoid any kind of crowding,” police said. During the triple lockdown 1,344 cases were registered and 393 persons were arrested in the district. As many as 1,035 vehicles were seized and action was taken against over 11,000 persons for not following social distancing and for not wearing face masks, police said. “If we follow the basic rules of social distancing, mask compliance and proper quarantine, we can surely overcome this deadly pandemic,” district police chief (Ernakulam Rural) K Kathick said.

During an interaction with TOI’s Surojit Gupta , he explains the process and how technology has been leveraged to make it transparent. Excerpts:There is criticism that needy hospitals and institutions are not getting part of the aid?There are three channels through which aid is received — government to government (G2G), private to government (P2G) and also through states, NGOs and civil society organizations (CSOs) directly to those impacted by Covid-19. In P2G, the Niti Aayog coordinates with prospective donors through the CovAID platform which allows individual and private donors to fill in their intent to donate and track the status of their shipments. Given the limited quantity of aid received, we cannot afford to spread it too thinly, hence, an optimal allocation must be made. Priority is accorded to medical hubs and states and UTs which have high caseloads. We also give importance to states/UTs which have scarce resources as well as those which may have physical connectivity issues which would result in slow movement of logistics. What is the scale of the operation?It is massive. We have received over two crore individual units of various items. Technology is at the core of this whole process of international aid received and distributed. We have developed robust and efficient portals for P2G and G2G. The portals have been developed in partnership with private technology companies like Flipkart, Microsoft, Nagarro, Cloudstrats, MapMyIndia, Freshworks, Amazon and Microsoft. They set up the platform for us in three-four days and we really appreciate their efforts. We have on boarded logistics service providers, IAF, airlines onto the platforms so that the end-mile delivery of the aid is done smoothly and transparently. We have completely eliminated the need for manual intervention and paperwork required during handovers. This mechanism also allows for real-time tracking of consignments through the GPS tracking system present in all the trucks carrying the assignments. Utilization of consignments can also be tracked and a nodal officer from each state indicates the final destination of all aid being allocated to a particular state, which is fed into the platform. The platform tracks the location and delivery of the items and also sends reminders to states in case an allocated item has not been delivered to a particular location. How are you convincing foreign countries and private companies which have donated about the transparent process being followed in allocation?We have an extremely robust monitoring system, which has the provision of not just tracking the location and status of their consignments but also checking utilization. This is done by means of geo-tagged photos and videos, which have to be uploaded by final destination institutions. This feature ensures that all items reach target destinations and it is in operation and has been introduced to ensure that life-saving equipment is immediately put to use after delivery. The utilization information can be shared with donor countries and private donors to reassure them about the full use of aid provided. Why are there complaints of delay and difficulty despite the steps that have been taken?We do encounter some challenges in the entire process. At times, we receive items which do not meet the medical specifications or voltage specifications. At times the arriving flights or consignments differ from the pre-informed timings, which does present some logistical challenges. We also have to ensure a continuous cold chain for some drugs such as Tocilizumab. Despite challenges, we have ensured that all items received are immediately dispatched. No item remains pending or is delayed, either by customs or for any other reason.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/tech-at-core-of-receiving-distributing-foreign-aid/articleshow/82897313.cms||Surojit Gupta

In a letter to the health ministry on May 22, Prakash Kumar Singh, director of government and regulatory affairs at the Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII), clarified that the statement by its executive director Suresh Jadav at a recent event is not the view of the company, sources said. “On behalf of our CEO Adar C Poonawalla, I want to inform you that this statement is not issued on behalf of SIIPL (Serum Institute of India Pvt Ltd) and the company completely dissociates itself from this statement... this is not the view of the company at all. “SIIPL is committed to maximise its Covishield production and it stands shoulder to shoulder to strengthen the government’s fight against Covid19,” he said. SII clarified that Poonawalla is the only official spokesperson of the company. Amid an acute shortage of Covid-19 vaccines in the country, SII executive director Suresh Jadhav on Friday alleged that the government began inoculating people from multiple age groups without taking into account the available stock of vaccines and WHO guidelines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/vacciine-drive-sii-distances-itself-from-statement-of-executive-director/articleshow/82897359.cms||---
---||India||Pre-orders no factor, local vaccine production is for own use: Government||NEW DELHI: Orders placed ahead of approved use of vaccines is not the correct matrix to judge the availability of anti-Covid shots in India which, unlike many other nations, has a strong production base and can use domestic production irrespective of any advance contracts, the government has said. Responding to criticism that India did not place large orders early enough and this hurt efforts to vaccinate its population, an official aware of the national vaccine strategy and planning said estimates such as India’s vaccine orders covering only 4% of its population were misleading and inaccurate. Some estimates, the official said, held that India has only ordered 116 million doses so far but pointed out that “orders” are important mainly for countries that do not produce their own shots. India is in a position to utilise all the jabs it produces and the Centre has said it has a plan to access two billion does between August and December. Emphasising that access to production was the key issue, the official pointed to Canada which ordered more than 330 million shots, enough to cover its population several times, but was still seeking vaccines through the global Covax initiative for poor countries — the only G7 nation to do so. This was because of hold-ups in supplies. Data sites showed Canada has administered more than 20 million doses while India has managed 190 million, which is more than what initial orders may indicate. Pointing to the uncertainties on vaccine development and launch glitches of Covishield and Moderna, it would have been a risk to invest in production before authorisation, the official said. Government sources said efforts were made in March, before the second wave, to liaise with vaccine maker Bharat Biotech to increase production. This resulted in additional facilities. With no exports allowed, the production will be for domestic use. Any orders placed last year would not be able to alter the production by much.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pre-orders-no-factor-local-vaccine-production-is-for-own-use-government/articleshow/82897396.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Not many takers for Rajasthan’s Covid helpline due to sluggish response||JAIPUR: The state’s sluggish response to the cries of Covid-infected persons is adding to the woes of the already suffering patients and their families in the state. It has taken over a year since the first Covid-19 case and over 2 lakh active cases in the ongoing second wave for the state government to finally come up with a onestop helpline, which was announced recently and which is far from enough. Times ViewAt a time when citizens depend entirely on the government for medicines and oxygen to combat Covid, the response by Rajasthan government is disheartening. The recent launch of a helpline for senior patients is a welcome move, but far from enough. The response mechanism has technical and managerial flaws, which have led to under-utilisation of available resources. A robust system with a single helpline for all patients should replace the multiple layers in the current system. Resources available with civil society should also be integrated with the state apparatus. The state should adopt the best workable solutions from other states. The response system must also be developed and strengthened keeping in mind all future challenges.The assistance provided by the government, in terms of ensuring hospital beds, medicines, isolation facilities is pathetic and the role of municipal and local bodies, which in other cities play a much greater role, is almost negligible in the state. Most other states like Delhi and Maharashtra have a centralised system where a positive patient can register and the state will help in getting him or her hospital bed. In Rajasthan, the state helpline’s main role was largely restricted to providing the phone numbers of the dedicated Covid hospitals. No assistance is being provided in securing admission, except for serious patients. The trouble comes with those looking for an emergency response like beds, ambulance, oxygen and plasma. The helpline numbers provide information on the beds available at the government hospitals, which is rarely vacant. The counsellor can provide you with the number of the dedicated private hospital, but can’t help you finding a vacant bed. Ambulance service is available to any hospital only when beds are available. The dashboard updates information three times a day – 9am, 2pm and 8pm or during the day. The information from 8pm remains unchanged till 9am in the morning, giving jitters to those facing emergency situations during the night. “We cannot tell you which hospital to take your patient to. We can give you contact numbers, you have to call the hospitals yourself,” this reporter was informed when called up for assistance. In other states like Maharashtra, Gujarat and Karnataka, the government health teams keep a tab over the patients not just in the hospitals, but also on those who are home quarantined. A close watch and guided assistance is provided on call and patients are monitored till they do not complete their isolation period and recover. “When I tested positive, all I received was a call from an Aayush doctor. He verified my age and address and asked about the other health factors. Then he gave me the control room’s number and asked to check the government website for hospital beds. That is it. There was no follow up and no medicines provided. I was forced to go to a private doctor,” said Saurabh Sharma, a 39-year-old resident of Nirman Nagar. Like in other states, the infected person is not supplied with a medical kit, his house is not sanitised and garbage from his/her house is not singled out by the local authorities. The visit by any health worker to assess the situation of the patient and his surroundings is not being done, which is a standard practice in other states. “The mandatory visit to an infected person for his health check-up, counselling the family members, assessing if that person needs a home quarantine or institutional quarantine is very important to save lives,” said Chayya Pancholi, a healthcare expert, adding that this system has been adopted by some states like Maharashtra in a professional manner. She argued that the patient’s family is left to fend for themselves from arranging medicines to sanitising the house.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/not-many-takers-for-rajasthans-covid-helpline-due-to-sluggish-response/articleshow/82897370.cms||Shoeb Khan
---||India||India, US may tie up to push global vaccine capacity||NEW DELHI: Supply chains for vaccines is the biggest challenge being faced by India at present. India and the US, which is indispensable for vaccine production are contemplating a partnership that could swiftly ramp up global vaccine capacity. This covers both India-made vaccines Covishield and Covaxin, as well as a bunch of others which are being produced in India. S Jaishankar will resume a conversation with his counterpart Anthony Blinken on putting the resources, capacities and skills of India, US, with some European participation, to swiftly ramp up production of vaccines for global use. The Jaishankar-Blinken conversation will take up from where the two men left off in London. According to high level sources, the 45-minute meeting was largely consumed by talk on vaccines. That conversation will be carried forward in this coming week. The frantic search for vaccine components began recently — Indian diplomats are currently scouring the world for components from countries in Europe, Japan, etc. At the Quad summit on March 12, India made a big pitch to the US for easing up exports of vaccine components. The Jaishankar-Blinken conversation in London succeeded in the US shipping components for 20 million Covishield doses to Serum Institute. About 80 per cent of these components come from the US — companies like Cytiva, Irvine Scientific, Life Technologies, Corning, Therma Fisher, these are the leaders in specialty manufacturing. India comes to the partnership with strong credentials — India is unique in terms of productivity in the vaccines and pharmaceuticals fields. For example, sources said, of all the 15 production centres for the Astra Zeneca vaccine, Serum Institute is the most productive. Currently, India manufactures about 70 million doses of Covid vaccines a month — these numbers can be increased substantially, the government feels, if the supply of components remains uninterrupted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-us-may-tie-up-to-push-global-vaccine-capacity/articleshow/82897433.cms||Indrani Bagchi

Chief minister Amarinder Singh is facing fire from volatile MLA Navjot Singh Sidhu as well as some other legislators over different subjects, with the provocation being the recent clean chit to the former Akali government on the issue of desecration that happened during the Badal regime. In a retaliatory fire, CM Singh slammed Sidhu while also suggesting that he may jump ship. Sources said the Congress leadership is mulling the idea of a committee to discuss the problems with local leaders. The panel may be headed by AICC state in-charge Harish Rawat. Punjab goes to polls in February, 2022 and the infighting is seen as attempt by local leaders to position themselves for future leadership in the state unit. Sidhu is learnt to be keen that he be made the Punjab Congress president but he is facing resistance not just from the chief minister but also other hopefuls from his age group as well as younger leaders. On Saturday, in a tweet, Sidhu denied that he was thinking of leaving the party and said the high command has intervened in the issue and he will wait for their decision.

He had said that around “1.27 lakh bodies” had reached the cremation grounds and graveyards in the state during the months of March and April this year and his guess was that 80% of those deaths were due to Covid. An FIR against Nath was registered under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by a public servant) of the IPC and Section 54 (making or circulating a false alarm or warning as to disaster or its severity or magnitude, leading to panic) of National Disaster Management Act 2005.

Top ministers, Piyush Goyal, Dharmendra Pradhan and Mansukh Mandaviya are due to meet industry representatives as well as IMD and National Disaster Management Authority officials to discuss ways to have a proper back up plan in place, including the need to evacuate industry, wherever required. Although the current information suggests that the cyclone Yaas will be less severe than cyclone Tauktae, the government doesn’t want to take any chances given the accident involving ONGC executives. Besides, the area of impact in West Bengal and Odisha will require a plan to secure coal assets and evacuation apart from ensuring that oxygen supplies are not disrupted, although the demand has come down. The eastern states, including Odisha and West Bengal, have been supplying liquid medical oxygen to Covid-19 patients in other parts of the country and any major disruption at source can have a problem. “We had worked out a plan under which operations at the Jamnagar refinery would have at best been affected for four hours. So even in this case it should not be a problem,” said a government source. Apart from coal and steel, the government is also watchful as Odisha is home to other mineral resources as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/government-to-assess-yaas-impact-on-ports-o2-supply/articleshow/82897528.cms||Sidhartha

He asked party supporters to individually lodge complaints against the governor, whom he had previously referred to as a “bloodsucker”. A “stunned” Dhankhar took to Twitter to respond to the MP’s comments. Addressing Banerjee as a senior Trinamool Congress functionary, parliamentarian and advocate, he wrote, “...Leave the matter to sound discretion of cultured people of West Bengal and media.” Banerjee later told TOI that according to the Constitution, no criminal proceedings could be initiated against the governor till he remits his post. “So, I have urged all people of Bengal to lodge complaints with their respective police stations. These complaints can be converted into an FIR later, when he (Dhankhar) is no more a governor. The former governor can then be sent to Presidency Jail for disturbing the secular fabric of Bengal.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/tmc-mp-alleges-politicians-held-in-narada-case-at-governors-behest/articleshow/82897569.cms||Debashish Konar
---||Kolkata||One week of restrictions puts a check on Covid surge in West Bengal||KOLKATA: After a week-long restrictions across the state, new Covid-19 cases have plateaued with the rapid surge slowing down. The number of positive cases has stabilised for now. Even labs are also seeing a decline in positivity rate. These, experts warn, are very initial indications and should not lead to any let down in the efforts to fight Covid. The single day new cases had touched 20,000-mark on May 12 for the first time during the entire pandemic. From 20,337 on that day it rose 20,839 and 20,846 in the next two days, respectively. It fell to 19,511 on May 15 and remained in the 19,000-bracket for the next few days before the state reported 18,422 cases on Sunday. Doctors said that restrictions are meant to contain the rapid spread of the infection temporarily while decongesting hospital beds. But the restrictions have to be imposed for at least three more weeks for better result. “These restrictions help in delaying the transmission temporarily. But it is too early to say that we have achieved a plateau. We need to observe this trend for a longer period. Such restrictions have to be carried out stringently in places, including in rural areas for at least two more weeks,” said Anirban Dalui, public health specialist associated with Swasthya Bhawan. In the week from May 16-23, both Bengal and Kolkata have reported lesser new cases than the preceding week of May 9-16. While Kolkata reported 24,659 new cases from May 16 to 23, Bengal reported 1,33,660 cases. The week before, it was 27,221 for Kolkata and 1,40,271 for Bengal. Even laboratories testing Covid samples said that they were seeing a fall in positivity rate as well as number of samples tested. But what worries doctors is that due to the restrictions many symptomatic patients are unable to travel to labs or hospitals for testing. “We had the highest positivity rate of 63% being recorded in our lab two weeks ago, it was around 50% a week ago and now it is about 35%. The rate is coming down due to the break in contagion being achieved by the fresh curbs. But, due to the curbs, I fear many symptomatic patients are not being able to travel to hospitals or labs to get tested,” said microbiologist Bhaskar Narayan Chaudhuri of Peerless Hospital. Even as positive cases are coming down high fatality is still a concern. For five consecutive days number of daily death toll has been above 150. “While curbs can ease pressure on hospitals and help in bringing cases down temporarily, our focus should also be on reducing deaths,” said Yogiraj Ray infectious diseases specialist at ID Hospital Beliaghata.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/one-week-of-restrictions-puts-a-check-on-covid-surge-in-west-bengal/articleshow/82897554.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

An FIR against Nath was registered under section 188 of the IPC and section 54 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005. Police said more sections can be added in the FIR as the investigation proceeds. BJP leaders and its MLAs from Bhopal lodged a complaint against the senior Congress leader who made the statements at Ujjain during his recent visit last week. BJP leaders complained against Nath for his three recent remarks in the past few days during his Ujjain visit and while addressing a virtual meeting. BJP leaders also submitted a pen drive containing Nath’s speeches as evidence. Nath while addressing a digital conference on Friday, said last year the world was saying that the Covid-19 pandemic was caused by the Chinese virus, but now our country has become infamous due to Indian Corona or Indian variant. Presidents and Prime Ministers of many nations are talking about Indian variant, now, Nath had said. Nath had also said around 1.27 lakh bodies reached the cremation grounds and graveyards in the state during the months of March and April this year and his guess was that 80% of those deaths were due to Covid. Kamal Nath doing politics in pandemic: BJP In a virtual meeting, former chief minister Kamal Nath was heard telling the Congress workers that it was the right opportunity to ‘aag laga do’ (set on fire) so that the farmers would get justice. BJP alleged former chief minister Kamal Nath is doing politics in the coronavirus pandemic and misleading people to create an atmosphere of fear. Calling coronavirus as Indian variant has maligned the country's image in the world, the complaint said .

The Union government on Saturday has made available 50 more vials of the drug to West Bengal. The demand for Liposomal Amphotericine-B started increasing after rising number of cases of black fungus were registered across states. “Till May 4-5, there was not much demand of Amphotericine-B. Companies manufacturing the anti-fungal drug had a low production. But demand started to rise from May 5. We hope that supply will increase in a week,” said Rajiv Singhal, general secretary of the All India Organisation of Chemists and Druggists. After the increase in demand , the Centre restricted its supply to retail shops and like several other medicines, Amphotericine-B, too, was supplied directly to hospitals on need basis. According to Pinaki Dey, consultant with the ILS Hospital, Amphotericine-B has been used in cases of kala azar earlier.

The list of those missing may get a lot shorter if it is confirmed that the 14 bodies recovered along the Maharashtra and Gujarat coasts in the last few days are those of the barge and tugboat personnel, an official said. “Those found ashore are yet to be identified,” the official said. While eight bodies were recovered on Raigad coast in Maharashtra, six were found on Valsad coast in Gujarat. Navy divers on Saturday located the wreckage of P305. The barge which had 261 personnel on board, sank on Monday. While 70 are dead and 186 rescued so far, there is no trace yet of five personnel. There is also no trace yet of 11 of the 13 personnel who were on board tugboat Varaprada, which also went adrift due to the cyclonic storm. Two persons on Varaprada have been rescued so far. Barge P305 was located on the seabed after systematic search by INS Makar employing advanced side scan sonar. The search for the missing personnel will continue through the night, the official said. The Navy also deployed specialised diving teams to boost the search and rescue (SAR) operations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/barge-p305-toll-rises-to-70-navy-divers-search-for-16-missing/articleshow/82897671.cms||---

It started off normally and the groom was ready and happy but the bride’s family, tipsy and a bit wild, beat up his relatives and chased him away from his own mandap. Police intervened as protection was required from the very guests who had been invited. But the ending wasn’t as disastrous. After running around in circles for hours, the one venue that was found to be safe was the thana. The couple got married at the police station, guarded by cops, in Shahjahanpur. It was 2.30 am by then.

Agencies dig deep||BHOPAL/INDORE: Four days after two sisters in the military town of Mhow were detained and questioned over exchange of calls and messages with Pakistani nationals, Madhya Pradesh police, its cyber cell, anti-terrorist squad (ATS) and multiple central agencies are trying to figure out whether the siblings had fallen prey to the ISI’s socalled ‘spy groom’ strategy. Their location — next to the 200-year-old Army cantonment of Mhow — made them ideal targets for the Pakistani intelligence agency’s new strategy of luring Indian women living around security establishments. It’s a shift from ‘honey-traps’ used to target Armymen. According to sources, the women, aged 27 and 32, have claimed that their communication with the Pakistanis revolved around marriage, but investigators aren’t convinced. Why they tried to seek out cross-border matches needs to be answered, they point out. Call detail records have revealed calls and messages to Pakistan. “Talking to a Pakistani is no crime, but you never know who the person on the other side is and what are his intentions,” said an officer who was part of the interrogation team. He said one of the Pakistani youths had said that he wanted to visit Mhow, and the women were ready to travel to Islamabad. During quizzing, the sisters have maintained that their only aim was marriage.

He said one of the Pakistani youths had said that he wanted to visit Mhow, and the women were ready to travel to Islamabad. During several rounds of questioning, the sisters have maintained that their only aim was marriage. Investigators from a central intelligence agency and Military Intelligence (MI) are awaiting forensic extraction of data from three cellphones. The younger woman has a master’s degree in military science and an NCC ‘C’ certificate from girls’ battalion of Indore in 2016-2017. Their father is an ex-Armyman. The women are suspected of communicating with their contacts in Pakistan over VOIP calls, and apparently used multiple SIM cards on their phones. Investigators are also checking if any money was sent to the women from foreign shores. Opinion is divided among Indore police officers on how the matter was handled. Some believe the two women should have been kept under watch longer to check if it was a genuine cross-border love story, while others say quick interception was necessary to foil the traps of enemy intelligence. The sisters came on ISI’s radar because they had disclosed their location as Mhow on social media, say sources. They later deleted their social media identities, which only heightened suspicion, said an officer. Sources involved in investigations said that the women were being questioned at their own home. Their food is being checked and officers are even going through their garbage. On Sunday, they were apparently taken to another location to break the monotony during questioning. Mhow, about 25km from Indore, has always been of interest to Pakistan’s ISI. In 2019, an Indian Army jawan posted there was arrested by Madhya Pradesh ATS after he was allegedly honeytrapped by Pakistan-based ISI operatives on social media. He was allegedly lured into sex chats in exchange for passing critical military information. Interrogation revealed that a woman struck up a friendship with him on WhatsApp by spoofing her caller ID as ‘Prisha Agrawal’. Army clerk Avinash wasn’t the only soldier honey-trapped by ‘Prisha Agrawal’. Videos of her ‘strip shows’ have been retrieved from cellphones of some other Armymen who are facing inquiry in Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Rajasthan, say sources. The clerk was hooked by ‘Prisha Agrawal’ after taking a call that was forwarded by the telephone exchange of Army headquarters in 2018. It was made by someone posing as a member of Army Wives’ Welfare Association. Since the officer she was looking for wasn’t in, Avinash took the call, and fell into the trap. It’s alleged that Rs 50,000 was deposited in his account by his Pakistani handler through a local agent. Madhya Pradesh ATS, which arrested Avinash in a joint operation with a central intelligence agency, unearthed links with a Delhiite, Mohammad Parvez, who was in NIA custody. Parvez, an alleged ISI operative, was chargesheeted by NIA in 2018 for trying to blackmail a woman Army officer with her morphed pictures, say sources. Investigators have found that he visited Pakistan 17 times in 18 years. He was taken on production warrant by Rajasthan Police last month in a case involving the honeytrap of Army jawan Sombir Singh.

In the video, the cubs can be seen playing on rocks and making themselves comfortable as the tiger moves among them. “The cubs are the offspring of P-243. It has been taking care of four cubs who are six to eight months old now. Due to this paternal care, we will not have to shift the cubs elsewhere. The situation is being monitored as the tiger has been collared a couple of days ago,” said PTR field director Uttam Kumar Sharma.

The number of reported deaths are more than double when compared with month long surge which started in mid-September last year. Active cases in October of last year peaked to nearly 2,000 cases in Bhopal. During the current surge, the number of people undergoing treatment for Covid-19 in Bhopal crossed 16,000 in the last forthnight. Since then, people undergoing treatment for the infection have nearly halfed. On Sunday, there were about 9,000 people undergoing for the infection in various hospitals. However, despite the decline in hospital bed occupany, the number of deaths continue to be high. “It boils down the stress on health infrastructure, witnessed during the current surge in Covid-19 infection. If we look at the percentage of people who died, after the infection in the current surge, it is lower than the corresponding figure of last year,” said a health department official. 1.2% of the infected died during September and October in Bhopal last year. However, in the current surge, going by health department reporting, the death percentage for 42000 plus people diagnosed for the infection is 0.5%. Health experts point out that on calculated by a seven day moving average, in the past week, there is an upward movement in death rate in Madhya Pradesh.

After a nod from the Prasar Bharati Board earlier this year, the government has decided to move ahead on its plans to set up DD International, a platform that will give voice to “India’s point of view” across the global. Prasar Bharati officials told TOI the idea behind launching a new channel was to make up for the fact that India does not have a global presence on broadcast networks, and most news and programming content is currently tailored for an Indian audience. “With DD International, we plan to change that. There will be dedicated streams catering to different geographies, round-the-clock services and multi-lingual content. We will also have to strike a balance between how much content to put on the broadcast platform and how much digital content to push, since broadcast platforms are expensive to set up and run,” a senior Prasar Bharati functionary said.

Officials sources clarified on Sunday that the move won’t affect farmers’ income citing the total availability of tur or arhar and urad overseas is barely 12 lakh tonnes. Even with free import, the quantity of these pulses shipped to India is unlikely to see a major jump. Sources said the entire availability of tur and urad in foreign countries is not going to be shipped in. Farmers have been getting better prices than minimum support price in past couple of years as domestic production has been less than demand. As per estimates, India’s tur production is estimated at close to 39 lakh tonnes in 2021, while urad production is pegged at 24.5 lakh tonnes. The import of tur and urad is estimated at 4.4 lakh tones and 3.3 lakh tonnes, respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/only-limited-import-of-pulses-wont-hit-tillers/articleshow/82897849.cms||---
