Currently, work has started to set up nearly 300 such plants and the necessary construction works by three major government-owned construction agencies – NHAI, CPWD and NBCC – has started at several locations. Sources said so far only government hospitals are taking interest in setting up such plants and rope in private hospitals in tier-2 and tier-3 towns are going to be a key issue. The government has an ambitious plan to set up nearly 1,600 such plants in the next 3-4 months. Sources said while carrying out civil construction works for the plants is not that big task, procurement and installation of the plants is far more critical.  “But you need to have a mission to achieve this target in a time-bound manner. You cannot meet the oxygen demand by bringing this from plants located 1,000-,1500 km away from the hospitals. This needs to be done to meet any future requirement,” said a source. TOI has also learnt that a sub-committee under an empowered group on oxygen is prioritizing the setting up of pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) Medical Oxygen Generation Plants in different parts of the country based on the high number of Covid cases and distance of these locations from the already existing oxygen generation plants. Officials also said that the focus has to be more on areas that are more than 300-400 km away from the existing oxygen generation plants while creating new facilities so that the turnaround time of the existing fleet of tankers increases.  “If we will focus more on high caseload centres, then by the time the new facilities start functioning, the peak might be over. So, every aspect is being considered while fast-tracking these set up in specific locations on priority,” said one of the officials involved in this task.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/will-government-start-a-mission-to-expedite-setting-up-of-oxygen-plants-at-hospitals/articleshow/82985034.cms||Dipak K Dash

At least one person was killed and the three others were unaccounted for, officials said.  The helicopter crashed into a marsh near Leesburg International Airport around 4 pm Tuesday, the Federal Aviation Administration said in a news release.  One body was recovered Tuesday night and no survivors have been found, Leesburg Fire Rescue said in a Facebook post.  "The crash appears to be a total loss," the post said.  A search and rescue effort began immediately after the crash, but the crash site couldn't be cleared because of hazards in the area, the Leesburg Police Department said in a news release Wednesday.  "We are deeply saddened by this tragedy within our wildland firefighting family," said Florida Forest Service director Erin Albury. "These firefighters put themselves on the line to serve and protect the lives of others."  The FAA and National Transportation Safety Board issued separate news releases saying they will investigate.  The aircraft belonged to Brainerd Helicopters Inc./Firehawk Helicopters, located at Leesburg International Airport, the police department release said.  The company's aircraft support efforts to fight wildfires and participate in other commercial activities, according to its website. An unidentified woman who answered the phone at the company on Wednesday said the company had no immediate comment.  Florida Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried said flags will be lowered to half-staff at all Florida Forest Service facilities in memory of the crash victims.  "We extend our deepest condolences to the loved ones and colleagues affected by this immeasurable loss," Fried said. "These brave souls training to protect our communities will not be forgotten."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/florida-firefighting-helicopter-crashes-no-survivors-found/articleshow/82986524.cms||---
---||World||London court refuses to release Rs 8 crore to Vijay Mallya to pay his Indian legal fees||LONDON: A London court has refused to release more than £758,000 (Rs 7.8 crore) from the court funds office to liquor baron Vijay Mallya to enable him to pay his legal fees in India. Justice Miles, in the Chancery Appeals division of the London high court, dismissed on Wednesday the 65-year-old’s appeal against a lower court decision on February 8 not to release cash to pay for his Indian litigation out of the Rs 29 crore deposited in the court following the €3.2 million sales of his property Le Grand Jardin in Cannes, France. The judge said there was no breakdown and no invoices in support of the amounts being sought. “The banks have repeatedly asked for this information and Mallya has had numerous opportunities to provide it. Mallya has not provided any details of steps that might be taken in the Indian proceedings in the foreseeable future that might have a bearing on the bankruptcy petition,” the judge said. Mallya’s lawyer, Philip Marshal, had argued that the Indian lawyers would not continue to work unless paid. He said the cases in India were closely connected to the bankruptcy petition and if Mallya was successful in India he would potentially have defences to the bankruptcy proceedings in the UK. A consortium of state-owned Indian banks to whom Mallya owes £1 billion (Rs 10,800 crore), as of June 2020, are seeking to make Mallya bankrupt in Britain. The court heard that Mallya was seeking £554,000 (Rs 5.7 crore) to pay historic legal costs to Mumbai law firm Bachubhai Munim & Co and senior counsel Amit Desai, a further £1,000 (Rs 1 lakh) to pay another Indian law firm and £203,000 (Rs 2 crore) for his estimated future legal fees in various court cases in India. The judge said paying the Indian lawyers would mean “preferring Indian lawyers as creditors in event of Mallya being made bankrupt” whereas any proposed expenditure should be “for the benefit of the creditors as a whole”. Marshall had provided a letter from Bachubhai Munim & Co dated February 26, 2021, proposing a method in which their costs could be checked and disputed by the banks that involved an Indian judge acting as costs expert. Justice Miles said the letter was “not satisfactory as it would involve putting the Indian legal costs into the hands of an Indian expert over which the UK court would have no control” and that it was an “inappropriate attempt to include material to bolster an application which lacked evidential basis when made”. The bankruptcy case had initially been adjourned for six months to give time for the cases in India to proceed and for Mallya to settle his debt. Now a hearing will take place on July 26 when a judge will decide whether to make an immediate bankruptcy order against the beleaguered businessman. “The pandemic in India has had a serious impact on the progress of cases through the Indian courts and there is no material which would enable the court to conclude that any steps that might be taken in Indian hearings between now and July 2021 would have any material bearing on the bankruptcy petition. Most of the amounts being sought are historical sums,” Miles said, pointing out the Indian lawyers “were prepared to do work they did without validation”. Mallya was ordered to pay 95% of the bank’s costs in this case. Marshall indicated he would take the matter to the court of appeal. However, Miles did allow Mallya’s appeal against a costs order in the February 8 hearing. Mallya had been ordered to pay 50% of the banks’ costs and Miles ruled that instead, it should be the costs in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/london-court-refuses-to-release-rs-8-crore-to-vijay-mallya-to-pay-his-indian-legal-fees/articleshow/82986516.cms||NAOMI CANTON

---||World||Iowa murder suspect blames mystery men for runner's slaying||IOWA CITY: The man on trial for the 2018 abduction and stabbing death of a University of Iowa student claimed for the first time in dramatic testimony Wednesday that two masked men were responsible for the crime but forced him to take part at gunpoint.  In a surprise development, the defense called Cristhian Bahena Rivera as a witness at his first-degree murder trial. He admitted that his black car was the one seen on surveillance video circling Mollie Tibbetts while she was jogging in Brooklyn, Iowa, on July 18, 2018. He also acknowledged that she ended up in his car's trunk, that he hid her body in a cornfield and told investigators where to find it a month later.  But the farm laborer presented a far different narrative about what happened than investigators and prosecutors have alleged, denying that he was responsible for the stab wounds to Tibbetts' head, neck and chest that caused her death.  Bahena Rivera said two armed men who were wearing black and had their faces covered by stocking caps showed up at his trailer after he finished showering that evening. The men directed him to get in his car and drive, and they passed Tibbetts as she ran several times before directing him to stop, he said.  Bahena Rivera, 26, said a man with a knife got out of the car and walked down the rural road. The man was gone for about 10 minutes as the second man in the back seat of the car grew nervous, saying, "Come on, Jack," he claimed.  The defendant said he didn't know the men's identities, but his lawyers have tried to raise suspicions about Tibbetts' boyfriend, Dalton Jack, who admitted to an affair with another woman and past anger problems. Police said they cleared Jack as a suspect after establishing he was out of town for work that day.  Bahena Rivera said the men loaded something into his trunk, directed him to drive several miles to a rural area, to turn off the car, wait a few minutes and leave. They said they knew his ex-girlfriend and young daughter, and that they would harm them if he ever told anyone what happened, he said.  Bahena Rivera said the men took off on foot down the road and he never saw them again. He said he opened the trunk a few minutes later and found Tibbetts' body, which he said was heavy as he carried it to the cornfield.  He said he covered her body with corn stalks because "I didn't want her to be too exposed to the sun," and that he then left and never planned to discuss what had happened again. Bahena Rivera said he left Tibbetts' phone, Fitbit and earbuds on the side of the road.  Bahena Rivera said that he wasn't truthful when detectives began questioning him about Tibbetts' disappearance on Aug. 20, 2018, because he was worried about his daughter's safety. He said then that he had approached Tibbetts as she ran, fought with her after she threatened to call police and then "blacked out" before hiding her body.  He said he agreed to lead investigators to Tibbetts' body early on Aug. 21 because he was tired and wanted the interrogation to end. And he said police had urged him to "put myself in the family's position and to think of" how he would feel if his daughter was missing.  Bahena Rivera recounted growing up in southern Mexico and illegally coming to the U.S. after he turned 17, crossing a river into Texas on an inflatable raft with about 10 other people. He immediately went to live in Iowa, where his father's brothers had settled, and got a job within days milking cows at a dairy farm, he said.  Bahena Rivera said he worked 12-hour days and was careful to avoid police for fear of deportation. He said never had contact with law enforcement until investigators looking into Tibbetts' disappearance identified his vehicle on a homeowner's surveillance video on her running route.  Most legal experts didn't expect Bahena Rivera to testify, and his defense gave no indication that he would. His lawyer Chad Frese said during jury selection that he was torn on whether to call his client as a witness. He said that if Bahena Rivera didn't testify, it would look like he had something to hide, but that if he did, he might be seen as trying to save himself.  Jurors perked up in their seats as Bahena Rivera took the witness stand, and prosecutors furiously took notes during his testimony. Bahena Rivera showed little emotion but his voice dropped and slightly trembled as he discussed the men's alleged threats to his daughter.  The trial, which started last week, is being held at the Scott County Courthouse in Davenport. Bahena Rivera faces life in prison if he's convicted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/iowa-murder-suspect-blames-mystery-men-for-runners-slaying/articleshow/82987517.cms||---
---||World||Covid-19 global developments: Biden orders report on Covid origin in 3 months, Pfizer vaccine effective against Indian strain||NEW DELHI: The Covid-19 pandemic has killed at least 3,475,079 people worldwide since the virus first emerged in December 2019, according to an AFP compilation of official data. The US is the worst-affected country with 590,574 deaths, followed by Brazil with 449,858, India with 307,231, Mexico with 221,695 and Britain with 127,724. The World Health Organization says up to three times more people have died directly or indirectly due to the pandemic than official figures suggest. Here are the latest developments: * US President Joe Biden on Wednesday ordered US intelligence agencies to report to him in the next three months on whether the Covid-19 virus first emerged in China from an animal source or from a laboratory accident. Biden's order signals an escalation in mounting controversy over how the virus first emerged. * British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's inept handling of the pandemic led to tens of thousands of unnecessary deaths, and officials even feared he would ask to be injected with the virus on television to show it was benign, his former chief adviser said on Wednesday. Johnson rejected the criticisms. * A lawyer for the European Union accused AstraZeneca of failing to respect its contract with the bloc for the supply of vaccines and asked a Belgian court to impose a large fine. * The European Union's drug regulator said it is reviewing the death of a woman in Belgium who suffered a blood clot and low platelets after receiving Johnson & Johnson's vaccine, the first report of a fatality following the vaccine. Belgium is suspending vaccinations with Johnson & Johnson's shot for under 41s after the death. * US major Pfizer told Indian authorities that its jab has shown "high effectiveness" against the SARS-CoV-2 variant prevalent in India and on people of Indian ethnicity or nationality, while it is suitable for everyone aged 12 years or above and can be stored for a month at 2-8 degrees. * The Pan American Health Organization said cases and deaths have plateaued at an alarmingly high level in Latin America, with countries in the region representing the top five highest mortality rates worldwide last week. * Brazil has identified the coronavirus strain from India in a traveller through Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro airports. * Following almost a month of widespread demonstrations, Colombian protesters are set to march on provincial capitals cities to demand government concessions on economic support for the poor and other issues, amid emergency measures that protest leaders say worsened working conditions during the pandemic. * Taiwan directly accused China of blocking a deal with Germany's BioNTech for Covid-19 vaccines. * Vietnam will set up a special fund to drive a vaccination programme as it battles its largest outbreak. * Zambian President Edgar Lungu banned campaign rallies ahead of elections scheduled for August 12. * Bahrain will close shopping malls, restaurants and coffee shops for two weeks starting from Thursday, state TV reported. * Qatar said leisure and education centres and restaurants can reopen at limited capacity as of Friday.

Shell said it was "disappointed" by the ruling which it plans to appeal. Here are some key points about the ruling:* WHAT WAS THE RULING? The district court ordered Shell to cut its absolute carbon emissions by 45% by 2030 compared to 2019 levels. Shell currently aims to reduce the carbon intensity of products it sells by 20% over the same period from a 2016 baseline. * DOES THE RULING AFFECT SHELL'S GLOBAL OPERATIONS? Yes. The reduction relates to Shell's global operations and is not limited to the Netherlands, the court ruling said. * WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR SHELL? The ruling said that "it is up to RDS (Royal Dutch Shell) to design the reduction obligation, taking account of its current obligations and other relevant circumstances." Shell earlier this year announced a strategy to become a net-zero emissions company by 2050, meaning its absolute emissions will also be net-zero at that point. It has stated that it believes its emissions peaked in 2018. * ABSOLUTE TARGETS VS INTENSITY TARGETS? The court ordered Shell to reduce absolute emissions by 45%. Shell's short and medium-term targets are intensity-based. Intensity-based targets measure the amount of greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy produced. That means that absolute emissions can rise with growing production, even if the headline intensity metric falls. At its annual general meeting this month, Shell CEO Ben van Beurden rejected setting absolute reduction targets, saying: "Reducing absolute emissions at this point in time is predominantly possible by shrinking the business." * HOW BIG ARE SHELL'S GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS? Shell, the world's largest oil and gas trader, produced 1.38 billion tonnes of CO2 in 2020, roughly 4.5% of global energy-related emissions that year, based on International Energy Agency figures https://www.iea.org/articles/global-energy-review-co2-emissions-in-2020. Shell's 2020 emissions were down from 1.65 billion tonnes the previous year, largely as a result of a fall in oil and gas demand due to the coronavirus pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/explainer-what-the-dutch-court-carbon-emissions-ruling-means-for-shell/articleshow/82988390.cms||---

Wastage of doses in Jharkhand rose to 6.4% as on Wednesday morning, double the 3.1% reported on April 22. Chhattisgarh has a wastage of 7.4%, up from 2.9%. Madhya Pradesh reported wastage of 3.3% of doses against 1.4% till about a month ago, official data of 15 states, that currently have maximum doses of anti-Covid shots available, showed. “The overall national average for wastage of Covid vaccine doses has come down significantly to about 5% from 10% a month ago. However, some states still have higher wastage which is getting reflected in the cumulative figure,” a senior official told TOI. The Centre has been pressing states and UTs for optimum utilisation of available shots and bring down wastage to below 1%.

---||World||Antony Blinken claims progress in effort to boost Gaza truce||CAIRO: US Secretary of State Antony Blinken wrapped up a two-day Mideast mission on Wednesday, winning valuable diplomatic support and hundreds of millions of dollars of pledges from Arab allies as he moved to shore up the cease-fire that ended an 11-day war between Israel and the Gaza Strip's militant Hamas rulers.  But the mission made little headway in resolving the deeper issues at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, including the tensions in the contested holy city of Jerusalem that played a key role in the latest war.  After two days of talks with Israeli, Palestinian and Arab allies, Blinken acknowledged that any resumption of peace talks remained far off. In the meantime, he said he had made progress toward the more modest goals of cementing the cease-fire and rebuilding hard-hit Gaza.  "We see the ceasefire, not as an end, but as a beginning, something to build on," Blinken told reporters in the Jordanian capital of Amman, where he met King Abdullah II.  He said the first priority was to meet the immediate needs of Gaza's 2 million people and then aim to "create better conditions in which we can try to move forward."  Earlier, he was in Egypt for talks with President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi. The visits came a day after intensive talks with Israeli and Palestinian leaders.  Blinken has vowed to "rally international support" to rebuild hard-hit Gaza while promising to make sure that none of the aid reaches Hamas. He also is trying to bolster Hamas' rival, the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority.  In a boost to those efforts, the energy-rich Gulf country of Qatar pledged $500 million to postwar reconstruction in Gaza. Qatar often serves as a mediator between Israel and Hamas and it has contributed hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to support past cease-fires.  In Cairo, Blinken met with el-Sissi for nearly two hours. Meeting with American diplomatic staff afterwards, he described Egypt as a "real and effective partner" that helped end the Gaza war.  El-Sissi spoke to President Joe Biden last week before and after the ceasefire was announced, and his government has also pledged $500 milllion in assistance to Gaza.  "I think we both believe strongly that Palestinians and Israelis deserve equally to, to live in safety and security to enjoy equal measures of freedom, opportunity and dignity. And we're working on that together," Blinken said.  El-Sissi said the latest round of violence showed the urgency of resuming direct negotiations. In a statement, he called for "active American engagement" to bring Israel and the Palestinians back to the negotiating table.  Jordan's king echoed that call, noting "the pivotal role of the United States in pushing for the re-launch of series and effective negotiations." Abdullah, who serves as custodian of Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem, also warned against "provocative Israeli violations" in the holy city.  Both Egypt and Jordan are key US allies that have peace agreements with Israel and frequently serve as mediators between Israel and the Palestinians. Egypt maintains ties with Hamas, but also enforces a tight blockade on Gaza, along with Israel, with a shared goal of preventing the Islamic group from arming.  The stop in Cairo, along with Biden's phone talks with el-Sissi, signal a closer relationship between the countries after a cooler beginning, when the US expressed concern over el-Sissi's human rights record.  The Gaza reconstruction effort will be an important test. The 11-day war killed more than 250 people, mostly Palestinians, and caused heavy destruction in the impoverished coastal territory. Preliminary estimates have put the damage in the hundreds of millions of dollars.  One of the US goals is to ensure that any assistance be kept out of the hands of Hamas, which opposes Israel's right to exist and which Israel and the US consider a terrorist group.  In Gaza, Hamas leader Yehiyeh Sinwar told journalists Wednesday that the group welcomed reconstruction aid, as long as it did not come from Israel, and had no objections to international oversight.  "I emphasize our commitment in Hamas that we will not take a single penny earmarked for rebuilding or humanitarian issues," he said.  Sinwar, who has close ties with the group's armed wing, said Hamas receives ample military assistance from outside sources - led by Israel's archenemy, Iran. "When I said we do not take money destined for aid, this is because we have comfortable sources of funds covering our activities," he said.  He also lashed out at Blinken for trying to strengthen the Palestinian Authority at Hamas' expense. "They are trying to add more fuel to the fire of Palestinian division," Sinwar said.  Blinken said Tuesday the US is trying to bolster the rival government of President Mahmoud Abbas, whose forces were ousted from Gaza by Hamas in 2007.  Abbas' Palestinian Authority now administers autonomous areas in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Abbas has been largely sidelined by recent events, is deeply unpopular at home and has little influence in Gaza.  Abbas hopes to establish an independent state in all of the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem - areas captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war. The Biden administration, along with most of the international community, supports a "two-state solution" as the best way for resolving the conflict.  In a gesture to the Palestinians, Blinken on Tuesday announced plans to reopen a diplomatic office in Jerusalem that oversees outreach to the Palestinians. He also pledged nearly $40 million in additional aid to the Palestinians.  In all, the Biden administration has pledged some $360 million to the Palestinians, restoring badly needed aid that the Trump administration had cut off.  The truce that ended the Gaza war on Friday has so far held, but it did not address any of the deeper issues plaguing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Those challenges include a hawkish Israeli leadership that seems unwilling to make major concessions, Palestinian divisions, years of mistrust and deeply rooted tensions surrounding Jerusalem and its holy sites.  The war was triggered by weeks of clashes in Jerusalem between Israeli police and Palestinian protesters in and around the Al-Aqsa Mosque, built on a hilltop compound revered by Jews and Muslims that has seen several outbreaks of Israeli-Palestinian violence over the years. The protests were directed at Israel's policing of the area during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and the threatened eviction of dozens of Palestinian families by Jewish settlers.  The truce remains tenuous since tensions are still high in Jerusalem and the fate of the Palestinian families is not yet resolved.  In his remarks after his meeting with Blinken on Tuesday, Netanyahu hardly mentioned the Palestinians, warning of a "very powerful" response if Hamas breaks the cease-fire while expressing support for economic development in the West Bank.  As he closed his trip, Blinken said repairing Gaza would take cooperation from all of the key players.  "It's really incumbent on on all sides to, again, avoid taking steps that could potentially reignite this cycle of violence," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/antony-blinken-claims-progress-in-effort-to-boost-gaza-truce/articleshow/82988618.cms||---

A municipal court judge in Galloway Township is scheduled on Thursday to examine the case of Michael Smurro, vice principal of Neptune Middle School in Monmouth County, as well as those he accuses of harassing him and his wife, Lisa.  Video filmed by patrons at an outdoor restaurant April 24 in Galloway shows him tossing a cup of beer at a table of people when he and his wife realized they were being recorded.  In an email to The Associated Press days after the incident, Smurro apologized for his actions, and said he should have just walked away from the situation. He did not respond to a message seeking comment Wednesday.  Gina Brunner, administrator of Galloway's municipal court, said Smurro filed harassment complaints against Debra and Robert Harris, and Elaine Nelson, whose hometowns were not immediately available.  Those people have also filed harassment charges against Smurro; all the claims will be the subject of a hearing on Thursday, Brunner said.  A complaint filed by two other people who say they were hit by the beer thrown by Smurro, Carolyn DiPietro and Christopher Benino, was rejected after Municipal Court Judge Howard Freed determined there was not probable cause to sustain the charge.  "This case is about standing up against bigotry, bullying and violence," said attorney David Shanies, who represents the Harrises, DiPietro and Benino. "My clients rejected transphobic hate speech, and in response, Michael Smurro doused them in beer, challenged them to a fight and filed false and frivolous criminal charges against them. My clients are not intimidated and they will hold Michael Smurro fully accountable for his actions."  The footage from the outdoor restaurant shows Lisa Smurro complaining at length about a person she said was a transgender woman using the women's bathroom. New Jersey law prohibits discrimination based on gender identify and permits people to use public restrooms that correspond to their gender identity.  The footage shows that when the couple became aware someone was filming, they got up and walked over. Lisa Smurro continued to complain and a woman at the table replied: "Please take your hate elsewhere."  Michael Smurro then tossed the contents of a cup of beer at occupants of the table.  "Here you go, pal," he says on the video. "There you go."  Michael Smurro then takes several steps back and, gesturing toward himself, says, "Now you can come out.

The attacker was identified as 57-year-old Sam Cassidy, according to two law enforcement officials, and the district attorney said Cassidy also killed himself. Authorities were also at a San Jose home owned by Cassidy where firefighters responded to a blaze around the same time as the shooting. The bloodshed comes in a year that has seen a sharp increase in mass killings as the nation emerges from pandemic restrictions that closed many public places and kept people confined to their homes. A database compiled by The Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University that tracks every mass killing over the last 15 years shows that San Jose is the 15th mass killing so far in 2021, all of the shootings. Eighty-six people have died in the shootings, compared with 106 for all of 2020. The database defines mass killings as four or more people dead, not including the shooter, meaning the overall toll of gun violence is much higher when adding in smaller incidents. Here are a few recent mass shootings:ATLANTAEight people were killed by a gunman at three Atlanta-area massage businesses in attacks that began the evening of March 16. Seven of the slain were women, and six were of Asian descent. Police charged a 21-year-old white man with the killings. There was deep scepticism over the shooter's claim his motive was sex addiction. There was public clamouring for hate crime charges, especially among the Asian American community, which has faced rising numbers of attacks since the coronavirus pandemic took hold. BOULDER, COLORADOAbout a week later, on March 22, a shooter at a supermarket in Boulder, Colorado, killed 10 people, including a police officer who was the first to respond to the scene. The suspect bought a firearm at a local gun store after passing a background check. Investigators are working to determine the motive for the shooting and why the suspect chose the King Soopers grocery store. ORANGE, CALIFORNIAOn March 31, a gunman killed four people and critically wounded a fifth at a Southern California office building. He knew all the victims. Apparently, before opening fire, he chained shut the gates to two entrances, delaying police from getting inside. Among the victims was a 9-year-old boy who was found cradled in the arms of a woman believed to be his mother. The woman was the only survivor among those shot. The others killed were a man and two women. ROCK HILL, SOUTH CAROLINAA week later, on April 7, former NFL player Phillip Adams shot six people. Robert Lesslie, a prominent doctor, was killed along with his wife, two of their grandchildren and two air conditioning technicians who were working at their home. Adams also killed himself. His brain is now being examined for possible degenerative disease that has been shown to cause violent mood swings and other cognitive disorders in some athletes and members of the military. INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANAOn April 15, eight people were shot and killed at a FedEx facility by a former employee, Brandon Scott Hole, 19, of Indianapolis, who fired randomly before dying by suicide. Four of the victims were members of Indianapolis' Sikh community, and the deaths were another blow to the Asian American community. Agents with the FBI's Indianapolis field office questioned Hole last year after his mother called police to say that her son might commit ``suicide by cop.''||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/san-francisco-area-deaths-add-to-us-mass-shootings-in-2021/articleshow/82988803.cms||---
---||World||Feds take down Medicare scams that preyed on virus fears||WASHINGTON: The Justice Department announced criminal charges Wednesday against more than a dozen people from Florida to California in a series of Medicare scams that exploited coronavirus fears to bill tens of millions of dollars in bogus claims.  A common hook involved a pandemic variant of identity theft: Fraudsters allegedly offered Covid-19 tests to get the Medicare numbers of unsuspecting patients, and then used that information to bill for lucrative but unneeded genetic tests that can cost thousands of dollars.  "These schemes, we constantly see them evolve to another level," said Chris Schrank, assistant inspector general for investigations with the Department of Health and Human Services. "At a time when most American pulled together ... a small percentage of individuals have decided to steal from programs valuable to those who are most in need."  The law enforcement actions involved the Justice Department's criminal division, the FBI, seven U.S. attorney's offices in six states, as well as the HHS inspector general's office and other agencies. Bogus billings exceeded $140 million before the schemes were blocked. Attorney General Merrick Garland recently announced the establishment of a special task force to pursue pandemic-related fraud across all government programs, not just health care.  Wednesday's charges look back to the early months of the pandemic, when there was a high demand for COVID tests still in short supply. Also, Medicare had loosened its restrictive policies on telemedicine consultations, to keep older patients out of medical offices where the virus might spread. And the government had begun pumping out billions in special "provider relief" payments to help hospitals and doctors' offices remain solvent. Scam artists, big and small, allegedly took advantage of all those situations.  Lately the schemes have shifted, and many that are popping up involve fake vaccination cards bearing a likeness of the official HHS logo, Schrank said.  Among those charged: - Michael Stein and Leonel Palatnik of Palm Beach County, Florida, who were charged in connection with a $73 million conspiracy to defraud the government and pay and receive kickbacks. Stein owns a consulting company. Palatnik owns a Texas company that in turn owned and operated testing labs in Dallas and elsewhere. Federal prosecutors alleged the conspiracy involved offering telehealth clinicians access to Medicare recipients for whom they could bill consultations. In exchange, the clinicians would allegedly refer patients to labs owned by Palatnik's company for costly and unneeded genetic tests for cancer and heart problems. - Dr. Alexander Baldonado of Queens, New York, who authorities alleged got access to Medicare recipients at an event that advertised virus testing. Baldonado is accused of using the patients' Medicare information to order unneeded genetic tests for cancer. The Justice Department said about $2 million was billed to Medicare as a result.  - Petros Hannesyan of Burbank, California, owner of a Los Angeles home health agency. He is accused of stealing more than $200,000 from government programs by spending provider relief payments and disaster loans for his own uses. The money was supposed to go for patient care and to support small businesses struggling with pandemic disruptions.  It was unclear whether the people charged had attorneys who could comment on their behalf.  Related to the fraud investigations, Medicare was taking action against some 50 clinicians involved in an assortment of schemes.  Fraud against government health care programs is a pervasive problem that costs taxpayers tens of billions of dollars a year. The true extent is unknown.  Experts say part of the problem is that Medicare is required to pay medical bills promptly, which means money often goes out before potential frauds get flagged. Investigators call that "pay and chase."  In recent years, Medicare has tried to adapt techniques used by credit card companies to head off fraud. Law enforcement coordination has grown, with strike forces of federal prosecutors and agents, along with state counterparts, specializing in health care investigations.  Wednesday's charges come a little more than a week after Attorney General Garland ordered the establishment of a special task force dedicated to countering Covid-19 fraud broadly. The task force was designed to bring together the Justice Department's resources with other government agencies against pandemic-related fraud, Garland said in a memo to senior department officials.  The department has brought several cases in recent months focusing on Covid-19 fraud, including one earlier this month against eight people in New York City accused of running a scheme to obtain millions in unemployment insurance benefits that were founded through pandemic assistance programs.  The new task force, being led by Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, will look for trends and examine past enforcement actions, in addition to bolstering efforts to investigate and prosecute criminals both in the U.S. and internationally.  "The multiple health care fraud schemes charged today describe theft from American taxpayers through the exploitation of the national emergency," Monaco said. "We are determined to hold those who exploit such programs accountable to the fullest extent of the law."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/feds-take-down-medicare-scams-that-preyed-on-virus-fears/articleshow/82989079.cms||---
---||India||Google and Facebook may comply, but stand of Twitter not clear||NEW DELHI: Amid growing controversy over the new IT rules, the government on Wednesday asked large social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Google, Instagram, and WhatsApp to immediately report their status of compliance with the new mandate. In a note to 'significant social media intermediaries' or those having more than 50 million users, the IT ministry said the additional due diligence required from such large digital platforms has come into effect from Wednesday. The ministry sought details and contact information of chief compliance officer, resident grievance officer and nodal contact person who have been appointed by digital platforms under the new social media rules. It asked the large social media companies to confirm and share their response at the earliest “and preferably today itself”. The demand came amid signals that companies may be taking steps to fall in line with some of the provisions. While the stand of Twitter is still not clear, Facebook and Google have indicated to the government that they will be designating the required officers to comply with the new directives. While Google has gone ahead and is implementing some of the changes, such as taking down sexually explicit content or requisition for action by law enforcement agencies, it has cited difficulties in recruiting officers as mandated by the government. On its part the Centre has suggested to the internet giant that it could designate some of its existing executives as the grievance, compliance and nodal officers, while it looks for full-time recruits. Sources said that Twitter is also seeking the help of lobby groups such as US India Business Council and US India Strategic Partnership Forum to back its case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/google-and-facebook-may-comply-but-stand-of-twitter-not-clear/articleshow/82989814.cms||---
---||World||Syrians vote in election certain to give Assad new mandate||DAMASCUS: Thousands of Syrians lined up outside polling stations in parts of their war-torn country to cast votes on Wednesday, in elections dismissed as a sham and guaranteed to give longtime President Bashar Assad a fourth seven-year term.  The vote's legitimacy was challenged by throngs of Syrians living outside of government-controlled areas, who rallied to denounce what they called a "farcical play" that ignores the country's reality.  Torn by a decade-old conflict, Syria is divided into areas controlled by the government, rebel fighters and foreign troops, all competing for influence and resources.  Half of Syria's pre-war population of 23 million has been displaced - mostly living outside of government-controlled areas where they won't vote. Over 5 million were driven out and live in neighboring countries where the vote is not held. The fighting has left nearly half a million dead and hundreds of thousands detained or missing.  Western countries also dismissed the election as illegitimate, saying it violates UN resolutions adopted to resolve the crisis through negotiations between the government and opposition groups, and the drafting of a new charter.  "The Assad regime's so-called presidential election is neither free nor fair," US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said in a Twitter post Wednesday. "The US joins France, Germany, Italy, and the UK in calling for the rejection of the regime's attempts to regain legitimacy without respecting the Syrian people's human rights and freedoms."  Assad blasted the criticism saying those who dismiss the vote as illegitimate have "colonial history."  "We as a state are not concerned about such statements," Assad said after casting his ballot in the Damascus suburb of Douma where he arrived with his wife Asma, driving his own car.  The area was one of the main rebel strongholds until it was retaken by government forces in 2018. It was the scene of an alleged poison gas attack in April 2018 that triggered strikes by the US, Britain and France.  The vote is the second presidential election since the country's conflict began 10 years ago.  This time, it comes after the 55-year-old Assad weathered what at one point appeared to be an imminent threat from western and regional-backed armed rebels within miles of the capital.  Since the 2014 vote, Russia and Iran have thrown their military and financial capabilities behind Assad's government and troops- pushing back military threats and propping up his cash-strapped government facing western sanctions.  Assad took over in 2000 from his father Hafez, who ruled before that for 30 years. The civil war broke out in 2011 when Arab Spring-inspired protests against Assad family rule turned into an armed insurgency in response to a brutal military crackdown.  Wednesday's vote is held under Syria's current constitution, disregarding U.N. Security Council Resolution 2254 from 2015, which unanimously endorsed a political process and road map to peace that begins with drafting a new constitution and ends with U.N.-supervised elections.  Two other little-known figures, Abdullah Salloum Abdullah and Mahmoud Marie, are also running for the country's top post. But competition with Assad is largely seen as symbolic.  Starting at 7 a.m., thousands began arriving at polling stations in Damascus, thronging streets festooned with giant posters of Assad and banners praising his rule. Most were not wearing masks, despite a coronavirus outbreak.  "We choose the future. We choose Bashar Assad," read one of thousands of banners raised in the capital Damascus.  "I am here to vote because it is a national duty to choose a president who will lead us in the coming period," said civil servant Muhannad Helou, 38, who said he voted for Assad.  Voting was extended until midnight in 12,102 polling stations.  No vote will be held in northeast Syria, controlled by US-backed Kurdish-led fighters, or in the northwestern province of Idlib - the last major rebel stronghold.  In rebel-held Idlib city, thousands took to the streets in a boisterous rally, chanting against Assad and reviving slogans used in the early days of the uprising against him.  "I woke up this morning to find Bashar Assad electing himself. What a farce!" said Salwa Abdel-Rahman, who wore a revolution flag around her neck and a headband that read: "No to racism and tyranny." She was displaced from Aleppo in 2012.  Challenges facing Assad remain tremendous.  The vote this year comes as Syria's economy is in free fall as a result of a decade of war, Western sanctions, government corruption and the financial crisis in Lebanon, Syria's main link with the outside world.  Edward Denhert, Middle Eastern research analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit, said in a note that the election will deepen the rift between Syria and the West and that consequently, Assad will pivot further toward its Russian and Iranian backers as well as China.  The Biden administration has said it will not recognize the result of the election unless the voting is free, fair, supervised by the United Nations, and representative of Syrian society.  "The U.N. is not involved in this election and has no mandate to be," UN special envoy for Syria Geir Pedersen told the U.N. Security Council in a briefing Wednesday. "It is a source of regret that, despite our best efforts, there has been little progress this month, and indeed at all, in advancing the different dimensions of resolution 2254," he added.  Pedersen had previously singled out the Syrian government for blocking progress in the constitutional committee established to draft a new constitution.  Even in government-held areas, there was opposition to the vote. Many residents of the restive southern province of Daraa and nearby Sweida called the vote illegitimate.  Activists and opposition media platforms reported a general strike for the second day Wednesday in villages and towns in Daraa province to protest the elections and the ballot boxes in their area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/syrians-vote-in-election-certain-to-give-assad-new-mandate/articleshow/82989957.cms||---

In Punjab, protesting farmers burnt effigies at many places, including Amritsar, Muktsar, Moga, Tarn Taran, Sangrur and Bathinda. Shiromani Akali Dal chief Sukhbir Singh Badal also raised a black flag at his house in Muktsar district and urged the Centre to accept the demand of protesting farmers. In Haryana, state Bharatiya Kisan Union chief Gurnam Singh Chaduni said farmers at many places hoisted black flags as a mark of protest. Several parties including Congress, SAD and AAP extended support to the farmers’ call of observing the day as ‘Black Day.’ The Samkyukt Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of protesting unions, had announced that farmers will observe May 26 as ‘Black Day’ to mark the completion of six months of protest. Farmers, especially youth, put up black flags on their vehicles including tractors, cars and two-wheelers. Punjab AAP leaders held a protest outside Punjab Raj Bhawan in Chandigarh in support of farmers. Holding black flags, they shouted slogans against the Centre and sought that the laws be repealed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/farmers-in-punjab-haryana-hoist-black-flags-to-protest-farm-laws/articleshow/82990169.cms||---

---||World||Stephen Hawking's archive, office acquired for UK public||LONDON: The Cambridge University library and London's Science Museum said Wednesday they have acquired a large collection of items belonging to late physicist Stephen Hawking, from his personalized wheelchairs to landmark papers on theoretical physics and his scripts from his appearance on "The Simpsons."  The entire contents of Hawking's office at Cambridge - including his communications equipment, memorabilia, bets he made on scientific debates and office furniture - will be preserved as part of the collection belonging to the Science Museum Group.  Hawking occupied the office at the university's department of applied mathematics and theoretical physics from 2002 until shortly before his death in 2018.  Highlights will go on display at the London museum early next year. Museum officials are also hoping to create a touring exhibition in the UK before setting up a permanent display in London.  Meanwhile, his vast archive of scientific and personal papers, including a first draft of his bestselling "A Brief History of Time" and his correspondence with leading scientists, will remain at Cambridge University's library.  The institutions' acceptance of Hawking's archive and office meant that his estate settled 4.2 million pounds ($5.9 million) in inheritance tax.  This was done through a UK government plan which allows those who have such tax bills to pay by transferring important cultural, scientific or historic objects to the nation. Artefacts accepted under the plan are allocated to public collections and available for all.  Hawking studied for his PhD at Cambridge and later became the university's Lucasian Professor of Mathematics, the same post that Isaac Newton held from 1669 to 1702.  Cambridge's acquisition of the 10,000-page archive means that Hawking's papers will join those of Newton and Charles Darwin at the university library, where they will soon be free for the public to access.  "The archive allows us to step inside Stephen's mind and to travel with him round the cosmos to, as he said, 'better understand our place in the universe,'" said Jessica Gardner, the university's librarian.  "This vast archive gives extraordinary insight into the evolution of Stephen's scientific life, from childhood to research student, from disability activist to ground-breaking, world-renowned scientist," she added.  Diagnosed with motor neuron disease at 22 and given just a few years to live, Hawking survived for decades, dying in 2018 at 76. His work on the mysteries of space, time and black holes captured the imagination of millions, and his popular science books made him a celebrity beyond the preserves of academia. Hollywood celebrated his life in the 2014 biopic "The Theory of Everything."  Hawking's children, Lucy, Tim and Robert, said they were pleased that their father's work will be preserved for the public for generations to come.  "My father would be so pleased and I think maybe at the same time, just a tiny bit overwhelmed that he was going to form part of the ... history of science, that he was going to be alongside the great scientists, the people whose work he really admired," Lucy Hawking said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/stephen-hawkings-archive-office-acquired-for-uk-public/articleshow/82990727.cms||---

Filing a petition in the Delhi high court on the first day of the implementation of the new IT guidelines and rules which mandate top social media companies (such as WhatsApp, Facebook, Google and Twitter) to identify the source of an unlawful message within 72 hours, the top instant messenger said the guidelines are a violation of its rights under Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution, and also the rights of its more than 400 million users in the country. Read AlsoGoogle and Facebook may comply, but stand of Twitter not clearAmid growing controversy over the new IT rules, the government on Wednesday asked large social media platforms to immediately report their status of compliance with the new mandate. While the stand of Twitter is still not clear, Facebook and Google have indicated to the government that they will bePetitioner (WhatsApp) respectfully submits that this requirement forces the petitioner to break end-to-end encryption on its messaging service, as well as the privacy principles underlying it, and infringes upon the fundamental rights to privacy and free speech of the hundreds of millions of citizens using WhatsApp to communicate privately and securely,” it said. It said that end-to-end encryption ensures that every communication sent on WhatsApp, both messages and calls, can only be decrypted by the recipient. No one else, including the company, can read or listen to encrypted communications or determine their contents. Mandating the identification of the first originator of information undermines the privacy and security provided by end-to-end encryption. “For example, journalists could be at risk of retaliation for investigating issues that may be unpopular; civil or political activists could be at risk of retaliation for discussing certain rights and criticising or advocating for politicians or policies; and clients and attorneys could become reluctant to share confidential information for fear that the privacy and security of their communications are no longer ensured.” Read AlsoExperts laud WhatsApp move, say all companies must unite for user privacyNEW DELHI: Digital rights experts have said that WhatsApp’s move to legally challenge the recently introduced intermediary rules is “most significant” adding that every company which cares about user privacy should stand together to protect encrypted chats. Technology website Medianama founderIt argued that since there is no way to predict which message will be the subject of a tracing order, companies will need to build the ability to identify the first originator of every communication sent in India on their platforms for all time, infringing upon the privacy of even lawful users. “Enabling the identification of the first originator of information in India breaks end-to-end encryption and the privacy principles underlying it… (it) violates the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression, as it chills even lawful speech. Citizens will not speak freely for fear that their private communications will be traced and used against them, which is antithetical to the very purpose of end-to-end encryption.”WhatsApp said that Rule 4(2) of the new guidelines for IT intermediaries, which mandates tracing the origins of messages flagged as unlawful, infringes upon the fundamental right to privacy without satisfying the three-part test set forth by the Supreme Court — legality, necessity and proportionality.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/whatsapp-moves-high-court-against-new-it-rules-terms-them-unconstitutional/articleshow/82991131.cms||Pankaj Doval

Anand Kishor, principal secretary of the department, has asked officials of ULBs to ensure that operators, engineers and sanitation workers are deputed at water pumping stations and machines remain activated round-the-clock to clear accumulated rainwater in submerged areas in maximum four hours. The officials concerned have also been asked to stock up diesel for uninterrupted operation of the pump sets. “The Indian Metrological Department has predicted heavy rainfall in Bihar till May 30 under the influence of the cyclone Yaas. To tackle waterlogging, it is important to run the pumping stations round-the-clock. If the pump sets are out of order, it should be maintained. Spare pump sets should also be there in case of replacement. Workers should be deputed at sump houses on roster,” Kishor said. During a virtual meeting with the DMs and municipal commissioners of civic bodies on Tuesday evening, he said if there would be any obstruction in drainage connectivity with the pumping station, temporary raw sewers should be constructed immediately with the help of JCB and other machines to pump out water from localities. “The illegal structures on big drains need to be razed,” the principal secretary said while instructing the officials to review the status of the drains. Kishor asked the officials to procure portable pump sets on rent if the number of pumping stations was not sufficient. “Arrangements should be made for generators at sump houses as there are chances of power disruption owing to the inclement weather conditions. The civic body should immediately create teams in every ward of their respective municipal areas to drain out water from localities and clean drains if they gets clogged during heavy rainfall,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ulbs-asked-to-clear-rainwater-in-four-hours/articleshow/82985333.cms||Faryal Rumi

Officials said villagers are following curfew norms and the sudden spike in Covid-19 cases is due to lack of proper space for isolation of patients with Covid-19 symptoms. Health wing authorities in a recent meeting had proposed to establish isolation wards in every village. District collector A Md Imtiaz directed revenue and panchayat raj authorities to arrange isolation wards with beds and basic healthcare facilities. ANMs and staff nurses will monitor the wards. “Covid-19 cases in urban areas have come down. Around 70% of new cases are being registered in rural areas now. Poor facilities for isolation is resulting in a spike. We have focused on this problem and isolation wards will be constructed soon at villages,” Imtiaz said. — Venu Lanka||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/krishna-district-to-set-up-isolation-centres-in-villages/articleshow/82985095.cms||Venu Lanka

Yamaha, which is currently on an extended shutdown of around 15 days, will open on June 1, said a plant employee. When contacted, the company spokesperson said: “We will take all the adequate measures to firstly ensure that our employees are safe in the current situation. The company has always followed the government's lockdown guidelines and we will abide by it. We are closely monitoring the situation.” Apollo Tyres and JK are currently functioning with bare minimum hands, say union sources. “Both factories will only start functioning fully from June 1 onwards,” said CITU state president A Soundararajan. When contacted, the Apollo Tyre spokesman said: “The Oragadam plant is operational with less than 50% workforce and following all safety protocols.” JK did not comment.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Eat only khichdi, bathe once in four days||AHMEDABAD/RAJKOT: Mota Samadhiyala village near Una hogged the spotlight in July 2016 when four Dalit men were flogged by self-styled ‘gau rakshaks’ while they were skinning a dead cow. After cyclone Tauktae ravaged this village, four men of Sarvaiya family — Ashok, Bechar, Vashram and Ramesh — and all villagers here are picking up the pieces. To cope with the crisis, village sarpanch Lakhman Korat issued a diktat restricting food intake and daily habits, to at least 500 villagers to consume only khichdi. “We directed villagers to eat khichdi as most people don’t have enough wheat or bajra flour at home and mills are not running due to lack of electricity,” said Korat.The diktat also says people should bathe only once in four days . Vashram Sarvaiya said their house was damaged and they have been living in darkness since May 17. Gir-Gadhada taluka development officer Amrut Parmar said it may take 15 days more to restore power as all electric poles have been flattened. The situation is no different in other villages of coastal Saurashtra, where basic amenities like water continues to be a daily drudgery for thousands in the worst-affected districts of Gir-Somnath and Amreli. The destruction to power infrastructure is so enormous that restoring electricity seems a distant dream. As a result local flour mills (ghantis) are rendered useless, thus leaving people to survive on in both meals. In Bhundani village of Amreli’s Khambha taluka, sarpanch Amru Kotila has been arranging water with difficulty for the population of around 2,500. “I arranged water through a tractor from a nearby village where there is a diesel-operated motor. People stand in queue since morning. There is no electricity in the village so they can’t fetch groundwater. Flour mills are not working, so people are forced to eat pulses,” he said. Most villages of Khambha, Rajula and Jafrabad, which were badly battered, large number of villages are still living in the dark. But there are a few villages where people got diesel flour mill. Virbhadra Dabhiya, sarpanch of Chhatadiya village near Rajula said, “We don’t have electricity but we have arranged floor mills running on diesel, so people of surrounding villages also come here.” Such flour mill also started in Nageshree village of Amreli district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/eat-only-khichdi-bathe-once-in-four-days/articleshow/82986042.cms||Ashish Chauhan

While all flights from Kolkata and one each from Guwahati and Ranchi were cancelled, two were diverted due to inclement weather in the state capital. According to officials of Airports Authority of India (AAI)- Patna, altogether 17 flights operated on Wednesday against 48 scheduled flights. Patna airport director Bhupesh CH Negi said most of the aircraft were cancelled due to low passenger traffic load and other operational reasons. “All incoming and outgoing flights to Kolkata were cancelled due to closure of Kolkata airport on Wednesday,” he said. One GoAir flight Ranchi-Patna flight (G8-388) was sent back to Ranchi due to bad weather conditions in the city around 7.17pm. “The airlines further cancelled the trip as the weather turned bad in Ranchi also. Another flight G8-352 between Patna and Mumbai was arranged for the passengers. One flight of Air India from Delhi to Patna was also diverted, however, it landed in the second attempt,” Negi said. As per the information provided by AAI-Patna, two flights of IndiGo from Kolkata (6E-6926 and 6E-599) were cancelled, while SpiceJet’s Guwahati flight (SG-3723) and IndiGo’s Ranchi flight (6E-925) were cancelled due to bad weather in Patna. Of the17 flights operated at Patna airport, nine of them were of IndiGo airlines, three each of GoAir and SpiceJet and two of Air India. The airlines executives at Patna airport have claimed that passengers travelling from the city airport did not face any problem due to cancellations as they were already informed about the status of their flights.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/only-17-flights-operate-from-patna-airport/articleshow/82985306.cms||Faryal Rumi

During a virtual interaction on ‘The Impact of Covid-19 on Children and Adolescents’ organised by the United Nations Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) on Wednesday, paediatrician and former national vice-president of the Indian Academy of Pediatrics, Dr Nigam Prakash Narain, urged the government to step up surveillance with the help of gram panchayats and strengthen the child-centred health services in order to protect the kids in rural areas. “According to three successive serosurveys conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research, 5%, 12% and 40% of the children below 18 years were Covid positive respectively. All of them subsequently developed antibodies. Considering that the remaining 33% have no such antibodies, the possibility of them being severely affected is pretty high,” Dr Nigam said. The chief of UNICEF-Bihar, Nafisa Binte Shafique, talked about the need to spread correct information amid the pandemic and stay away from videos that create fear. UNICEF’s nutrition officer, Shivani Dar, busted the myth that breastfeeding causes Covid. She said, “Covid positive moms should be encouraged to breastfeed their kids. A mother’s milk has antibodies to fight any infection and is called the first vaccination.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/adopt-covid-appropriate-behaviour-to-protect-kids/articleshow/82984020.cms||---
---||Business||Low rates: Borrowers prefer home loans of shorter terms||MUMBAI: The fall in interest rates has increased the eligibility of borrowers as it reduces their monthly outgo. Borrowers are, however, choosing to use the lower cost to repay loans faster and opting for shorter durations. According to a survey by Magicbricks, the period of up to 10 years is the most preferred duration of homebuyers with 26% of the respondents giving the nod for it. It was followed by 10-15 years (25%) and 15-20 years (23%) as the next most preferred tenures for home loans. About 16% respondents said that they would like to take a loan for more than 25 years, while only 10% said that they would wish to take a home loan for 20-25 years. Property site Magicbricks, which also enables borrowers to avail home loans, is a part of the Times Group. “With average home loan interest rates hovering between 6.65% and 6.9%, borrowers are now wanting to repay their mortgages as fast as possible. Thus, around 50% of the borrowers now prefer to have a loan tenure of up to 10 years or 10-15 years and close their financial liability as quickly as possible,” said Magicbricks CEO Sudhir Pai. He added that there is demand revival for mid- and high-range homes due to reasons like need for an extra room due to work from home, reduction in circle rates, stamp duty and low interest rates. Consumer behaviour on Magicbricks Home Loans suggests that most of the demand for home loans is being generated from the key residential markets of Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Delhi, Mumbai and Pune.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/low-rates-borrowers-prefer-home-loans-of-shorter-terms/articleshow/82987499.cms||---

Even National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) had earlier this week asked the Centre to ramp up preparations ahead of the third wave, keeping in mind the prediction that children would be affected. It had also written to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), asking it to issue guidelines for the treatment of Covid-affected children. In Bihar, nearly 45,000 children and adolescents were affected from mid-March to mid-May during the second wave. A senior official in the health department said they are now devising ways to prevent the third wave of the pandemic. “All the medical colleges and hospitals have been asked to increase the number of beds in paediatric units, including in paediatric intensive care units and neonatal intensive care units,” the official added. Health department special secretary Manoj Kumar said keeping in mind the third wave, training of doctors has already been started at AIIMS-Patna and a special training of paediatricians will also be organised. Noted paediatrician and former president of Indian Academy of Paediatrics (Bihar), Dr Arun Shah, said, “In the first wave of pandemic, senior citizens and those with comorbidities were the worst sufferers. The second wave, on the other hand, affected young people. The third wave is likely to strike the country after four to five months. By that time, most of the young population will develop antibodies to fight the virus. At least 50% of adult population be vaccinated by then. Hence, children are likely to suffer the most in the third wave.” Dr Shah said young parents should get themselves vaccinated on priority. “In case a child needs to be admitted and parents are vaccinated, one of them can stay with the child at the hospital.” “Parents should not let their children go out and discourage outsiders from visiting their homes. Children above two years of age should follow Covid-appropriate behaviour,” Dr Shah said, adding Covaxin, which has been given permission for emergency trials on children, will be successful.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/impending-third-covid-wave-worries-young-parents-in-patna/articleshow/82983990.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Chairing a high-level review meeting on AES, Japanese Encephalitis (JE), kala-azar and heatwave through videoconferencing from ‘Samvad’ hall at his residence, Nitish said, “Whatever works are being done in the five AES-affected blocks in Muzaffarpur district on the basis of socio-economic survey should be implemented in all AES-affected districts across the state.” In 2019, the state government had conducted a thorough socio-economic survey in five worst AES-affected blocks of Muzaffarpur district. The blocks were Kanti, Bochaha, Meenapur, Musahri and Paroo. At the directive of the CM, the volunteers of Jeevika had conducted a socio-economic survey of 538 families in the five blocks. On the basis of the findings of the survey, the state government made several positive interventions and implemented certain schemes among the below poverty line (BPL) families in the five blocks. “As part of the positive interventions, all children up to the age of 5 years (of these five blocks) were enrolled with anganwadi centres and provided nutritious meals. New anganwadi centres were also opened. All AES-affected families were provided ration cards. Toilets were also made in their houses,” an official of the Jeevika, who was part of the socio-economic survey, told TOI on Wednesday. “Then, it was also decided to provide ‘pucca’ houses to all those AES-affected families who were not included on the list of beneficiaries of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana or the Mukhya Mantri Awas Yojana,” the official said. While reviewing the actions taken by different districts for prevention of children from the AES or JE, the CM further asked the DMs to provide a ‘pucca’ house to all eligible beneficiaries in the AES-affected areas so that their children could be protected from this deadly disease. During the review meeting, Nitish also asked the health officials to make a robust arrangement in all the AES-affected districts to ensure proper treatment of children as per the AES treatment protocol. He also asked the DMs to begin an awareness campaign in the affected areas and inform people that no children should be allowed to go to sleep without having a meal in the evening. The CM also asked the health officials and the DMs to take all necessary steps to ensure that no AES-affected families face any kind of inconvenience. “There will be no dearth of funds for providing facilities to the AES-affected families,” he said. Nitish also ordered completion of the remaining work for JE vaccination in Kaimur, Khagaria and Begusarai districts. He asked the health officials and the DMs to make necessary arrangements in hospitals for treatment of people suffering from heatwave and kala-azar. Additional chief secretary (health) Pratyaya Amrit made a detailed presentation before the CM on the district-wise current status of AES, JE, heatwave and kala-azar and the steps being taken by the state government to save people from the diseases. Former DM of Muzaffarpur Chandrashekhar Singh, who is currently posted as Patna DM, gave detailed information about the works started in Muzaffarpur district to save the children from AES. The district magistrates of Muzaffarpur, East Champaran, West Champaran, Vaishali, Darbhanga, Samastipur, Saran, Siwan, Gopalganj, Sitamarhi, Sheohar, Gaya, Aurangabad, Nawada, Jehanabad and Nalanda informed the CM about the latest status of AES, JE, heatwave and kala-azar in their respective districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/follow-muzaffarpur-model-to-curb-aes-nitish-tells-districts/articleshow/82984905.cms||Madan Kumar
---||Patna||South Bihar districts receive light to moderate rainfall||ARA/GAYA: Districts in south-central and northeast Bihar were the first to get rainfall under the influence of cyclone Yaas which made landfall in Odisha coast on Wednesday. Weathermen said the outer band of the cyclone had already led to cloudy skies from Tuesday and advancement of the cyclone towards Jharkhand and south Bihar resulted in light to moderate rainfall in districts like Gaya, Bhagalpur, Purnia and Begusarai. In Bhojpur district, only light rain was witnessed since the morning and gusty winds started blowing in the afternoon at an average speed of around 20kmph. The weather turned very cloudy by the evening and downpour started at 5.15pm. The water resources department has deputed assistant engineers and junior engineers in Bhojpur for constant patrolling at various watch points. An executive engineer in charge at a barrage in the district said water to the agricultural fields for sowing of paddy seedlings would be released only after the cyclone threat is over. Paddy cultivation is done on a large scale in Bhojpur district. Senior scientist and head of Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Bhojpur, Pravin Kumar Dwivedi said the old Shahabad region, comprising Bhojpur, Buxar, Kaimur and Rohtas is called ‘dhan ka katora (rice bowl)’ as paddy cultivation is done on more than 4 lakh hectares (one million acres) of land. “This time of the year is very crucial for paddy farmers in the district. They are waiting for the cyclone to pass over as rice seedlings will be prone to decaying or floating away if the rainwater floods the fields,” Dwivedi said. Gaya received 29.4mm of rainfall between 8.30am and 5.30pm as the showers occurred in intermittent manner. In view of the yellow warning for thunderstorm with lightning by India Meteorological Department, several teams of State Disaster Response Force were kept on standby. To ensure uninterrupted power supply in the hospitals, engineers and staff of energy department were ready to repair any technical fault due to the cyclone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/south-bihar-districts-receive-light-to-moderate-rainfall/articleshow/82985313.cms||---
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: '59% found to have Covid antibodies in sero-survey'||VISAKHAPATNAM: The recent sero-survey conducted by the Andhra Pradesh health department in April has found that nearly 59% of those surveyed had developed antibodies against Covid-19. Of the 46,991 Covid-19 samples extracted from the general population, 27,869 samples turned out to be positive for antibodies. According to experts, this can be corroborated by the fact that the state recorded a 25-30% case positivity rate for several days in the second wave. The urban population was found to be more exposed to the disease than their rural counterparts. While the survey projected antibodies against the Sars-CoV-2 virus in about 62% urban males and 66% urban females, it was 56.1% in rural males and 57.6% in rural females. The sero conversion rate in the three different vaccinated groups is over 77%. The officials conducted the survey on nearly 6,300 people who have already received two vaccine doses. Altogether, 78.8% of the samples taken from rural females in West Godavari turned to be positive for the novel coronavirus. Similarly, 78.5% of the urban female study subjects were found to have developed antibodies against the disease in Chittoor district. Visakhapatnam and East Godavari are an exception with no category – either rural male/female or urban male/female – showing more than 50% sero-prevalence. The earlier state-wide sero survey conducted by the AP health department, in two phases, found that about 20% of the 5.4 crore population of the state developed antibodies for the SARS-CoV-2, the Covid-19 causing virus. A startling fisnding of the survey was that at least 90% people, who tested positive for the virus in the survey, did not show any signs and symptoms of Covid-19. Later, the ICMR survey found exposure to 27% of the population in Krishna, Nellore and Vizianagaram districts. After reporting about 20,000 cases a day for the last three weeks, the case count in the state has been coming down in the last few days.

It is alleged that many laboratories are encashing on patients’ anxiety to get results early and increasing the cost of the test. In a bid to facilitate Covid-19 patients, the government allowed a few private clinical laboratories to perform RT-PCR and rapid antigen tests for Covid-19. The state government initially fixed the RT-PCR test price at Rs 1,400 but later reduced it to Rs 499. Though the state government is performing RT-PCR Covid-19 tests free of cost, delay in delivering results is dragging many to private labs. A few private labs in the city have come up with various packages for Covid-19 tests; with Rs 1,000 as fast-track charges along with a regular test fee of Rs 499 to get the test result by evening. Results will be delivered the next day if the patient pays a fast-track fee of Rs 500 along with regular test fee. “Private labs are cheating patients. We got tested at a government lab 20 days ago. Though they didn’t charge anything, they gave the result after four days. Now we recovered and wanted to submit the Covid-19 negative report to join the office. We went to a private lab on Tikkle Road and they offered different packages. We didn’t have enough money and asked for a normal test and they replied that it will take three to four days for test results. This is deceiving the poor,” said P N Mallikarjuna, a private employee. “When the same lab can deliver Covid-19 test results by the same evening if we pay extra money, why should it delay the result of the poor who are not able to pay extra money? Health wing authorities should take action regarding this,” he added. Meanwhile, health wing authorities have said they will carry out enquiries.

Deputy director of the Sahyadri Tiger reserve Uttam Sawant said, “Our range forest officer Snehal Magar and forest guard Santosh Chalke spotted the bird while patrolling the fort area of Jungli Jaigad of the Koyna wildlife sanctuary, which is a part of the Sahyadri Tiger Reserve. Chalke clicked a few photographs of the bird and contacted ornithologist Rohan Bhate for more information. Later, we got to know that it was a rare bird that had been spotted for the first time in the tiger reserve”. Bhate, who is also an honorary wildlife warden, said, “Griffon vultures (Gyls fulvus) are rare birds that breed and lay one egg in nests usually on the high cliffs in Southern Europe and North Asian countries. These birds have white feathers on the head, rufous (reddish brown) colour on the back and the tail feathers are dark brown/black. The birds can travel thousands of kilometres and are scavengers. The height of these birds can be around 125 cm and they have a 8-9 feet wingspan. They can weigh 8-10 kg.” He added, “The Griffon vulture sighted now has an orange tag on its wing. We have contacted vulture researchers in different countries and at the Birdlife International and the Indian Bird Conservation Network. A Griffon vulture was also found in Kannur, Kerala. This is the same bird that was ringed at the Wayanad sanctuary and later released. TOI had reported this on February 1, 2021,” he added. Chief conservator of forests (Kolhapur territorial) Clement Ben said, “Our frontline staff were able to make a rare record. The bird was tagged in Kannur and it was released in the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary in January. We need to set up a monitoring protocol for the bird after holding discussions with the Kerala forest department.” Narendra Babu, the deputy conservator of forest and wildlife warden at the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary said, “This bird was found on December 28, 2020, by the Malabar Awareness and Rescue Centre for Wildlife (MARC) in Kannur in an exhausted condition. It was kept under observation for about a month. It was both ring-tagged and wing-tagged and then released on January 31, 2021. The bird sighted at the Sahyadri Tiger Reserve seems to be the same one but it has a tag only on the right wing. The image is unclear. It may be said that the Griffon vulture released from Wayanad is on its way back home via the Sahyadri Tiger Reserve.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/rare-griffon-vulture-spotted-in-sahyadri-reserve/articleshow/82980087.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

The owner of the dog had earlier blamed the Gadvasu vet and four unknown persons. They have been booked under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act. Phillaur police registered a case under sections 428 (killing, poisoning, maiming or rendering useless any animal or animals of the value of ten rupees or upwards), 34 (common intention) of IPC, and section 11 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act. The officials claimed that the dog belonged to high-ranking government official. Gadvasu vet had refuted the charges and claimed that the dog died due to the mishandling of the owner’s staff. Gadvasu Teachers’ Association (GADVASUTA) took strong note against the FIR and initiated protest by suspending OPD services. Police officials investigated the case and finally the FIR was quashed in the court. GADVASUTA said despite lockdown, veterinary faculty is providing services to the livestock owners and pet lovers of the state.

ASI employee Salim Patel found them while doing pre-monsoon cleanliness work at the complex. “We recently reported three new caves on a layer above the existing Pandav Leni caves. The age of the new caves may be determined after their study is completed and documentation/drawing is carried out by a team of ASI experts,” Rakesh Shende, senior conservation assistant of ASI, Nashik, said. The officer said these caves are currently out of bounds for visitors. Work on creating pathways and installation of safety railings needs to be carried out first. It may be noted that a group of 24 caves, on the Trirashmi hills and dated between 1BC and 6th or 7th century AD, were first documented in 1823 by Captain James Delamaine. Some of the earlier caves were altered, reconditioned and embellished with the figures of Buddha and Bodhisattvas. The Satavahanas and Kshaharatas patronized them. They excavated two of the largest monasteries (caves 3 and 8) while the common people aided in the remaining caves, the ASI said. Atul Bhosekar, the director of city-based Trirashmi Research Institute of Buddhism, Indic Language and Scripts, said: “These are Buddhist caves carved for the monks and are very small in size. One cell has a rock-cut bed for two monks and another cell has a rock-cut bed for a single monk.” Bhosekar, who has been working on the Buddhist caves in Maharashtra for the past 25 years, said, “These caves seem to be early excavations. Based on archaeological studies so far, they would probably predate the present cave complex.” “The discovery could alter the chronological sequence of Buddhist caves in India” said Maitreyee Bhosekar, an archaeologist who is documenting the newly found caves.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/3-new-small-caves-discovered-at-pandav-leni-complex-in-nashik/articleshow/82980052.cms||Abhilash Botekar

---||Ahmedabad||Covid on downward spiral in Gujarat: 90% drop in 108 calls||AHMEDABAD: Take some heart, the cruel second wave of Covid-19 which enveloped the state in a morbid grip of death and disease is finally ebbing, as indicated by multiple parameters of the coronavirus pandemic. It is not just the drop in daily cases of Covid-19 in Gujarat – on Wednesday, the state recorded 52-day low daily cases and 48-day lowest daily mortality in the pandemic. Other indicators like bed occupancy, oxygen and medication requirement, calls to ambulance and testing for Covid-19 also showed a significant decline. It was perhaps the reason that the government of Gujarat on Wednesday allowed one-hour extension in the relaxation from night curfew. Compared to earlier restrictions after 8 pm, now the restrictions would be imposed from 9 pm to 6 am daily. There is no change in the timings for commercial establishments. Jashvant Prajapati, COO of EMRI Gujarat, said that in mid-April, the daily call volume had gone down from 65,000 at the peak to 6,500 calls a day. “Today it has fallen by 90% and has come down to about 6,500 calls a day. Moreover, earlier 90% of the calls were related to Covid-19. The number has also gone down to about 40%,” he said. “Likewise, 104 fever helpline has also recorded an 80% drop in daily call volume for Gujarat.” On Wednesday, Gujarat recorded the highest-ever daily discharges of Covid-19 patients at 10,007. The discharges more than the daily cases have reduced the active patients. On May 26, the active patients were 55,548, which were 54% down from 1.21 lakh on April 26. It has reduced the bed occupancy. Dr Bharat Gadhvi, president of Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (AHNA), said that the bed occupancy in the city is down to 24% compared to 98% in the second half of April. “Even ventilator and ICU bed availability hovers around 20-25%. The oxygen consumption has gone down accordingly.” Alpesh Patel, president of Federation of Gujarat State Chemists and Druggists Associations (FGSCDA), said that there is an estimated 80% drop in sale Covid-related medicines. “Against sale of about 70,000 strips of Fabiflu in April, we are selling 2,000 daily. Against 1 lakh strips of Azithromycin, the sale is down to 20,000. Along with drop in case, we believe that there is less hoarding now,” he said. Dr Mukesh Maheshwari, a city-based senior pathologist, said that there is approximately a 70% drop of 70% in daily RT-PCR tests conducted in citybased labs. “Even the specialized tests for ferritin, CRP, etc. have also dropped by 70-80%,” he said. The experts however warned against any leniency. “We have again started seeing movement on the roads, and crowding on highways by youngsters. Even after vaccination, we must not let our guards down to prevent the third wave. It’s time for us to prepare, and not be complacent,” said Dr Gadhvi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-on-downward-spiral-in-guj-90-drop-in-108-calls/articleshow/82985973.cms||---

Wildlife experts suggest that the cyclone is a blessing in disguise for the lions in the long run. Some experts are of the view that due to better protection, the forests of Gir are becoming denser and turning into non typical lion habitat, as lions are believed to prefer savanna habitat or open forests. A senior forest department official said that opening up of spaces in Gir is beneficial for lion population. Gujarat is home to 674 lions as per the latest census held in 2019. Of these about 350 are in the Gir sanctuary, spread in over 1,412 square kilometers and others are outside. The sanctuary covers 258 sq kms of Gir National Park area. Uday Vora, former chief conservator of forests (wildlife), said the state forest department had submitted a proposal to the government to thin parts of Gir sanctuary for opening spaces will make more conducive for lions and may lead to larger pride size. “Some work in this direction had begun in 2018 and 2019 as per the approved management plan prescription. The natural trimming of the forest area by the cyclone may lead to increase in their population in the sanctuary area,” according to Vora. Bhushan Pandya, member, State Board for Wildlife also held a similar view. He said there has been talks of thinning the over dense areas at Gir Protected Area since more than three decades but very little work has been done. Teak is a dominant tree species in Gir west. “It is a vigorous species because its large leaves prevent sunlight and restrict the growth of vegetation beneath. The leaves fall every year and "build" a thick layer to prevent the regeneration/growth of palatable grass. Sometimes disasters such as cyclone or fire could result in habitat improvement,” said Bhushan Pandya, member, State Board for Wildlife. On November 8, 1982 when a cyclone hit Gujarat, about 28.10 lakh trees were damaged in Gir sanctuary. “At that time, only about two third of the damaged trees were cleared while the remaining are still lying as they were. At some places they have regrown naturally. The falling of trees could make way for more sunlight and for more grassland patches. Although it is too early to say what will be the impact of the recent cyclone, I think it will benefit the lion population in the long term," said H S Singh, former forester and member of the National Board for Wildlife (NBWL). These initial estimates of 25 lakhs to 30 lakhs trees damaged in Gir have been recently submitted to the government, said a top forest official. He said had it not been for the sanctuary, the severity of the cyclone would not have weakened substantially before going further up to human populated areas of Amreli, Botad and even Ahmedabad. “There are three major factors behind growth in lion population – prey base, shade and water. After the 1982 cyclone, the prey base has increased. One of the main reasons behind this was that the lion prey base consists of browsers and not grazers. They could easily find food from prostrate trees that also offer shade to lions. The recent cyclone will have a benevolent effect on the Gir ecosystem,” said Y V Jhala, a senior scientist with Wildlife Institute of India. He said that there was a misconception that lions are more conducive to open forests as against dense habitats and that there has been research to indicate this.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cyclone-felled-30l-trees-in-gir-path-cleared-for-lions-to-prosper/articleshow/82986122.cms||Maulik Pathak

Gujarat high court to state government||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Wednesday insisted that the state government should give priority in vaccination to people awaiting their second dose. It also asked the state to consider setting aside 10-20% of Covid-19 vaccines for beneficiaries availing spot registration, especially in rural areas, where people have no access to online registration for getting the shot. The division bench of Justices Bela Trivedi and Bhargav Karia was hearing a PIL filed suo motu on the Covid-19 pandemic and related issues. During the hearing, advocate general (AG) Kamal Trivedi apprised the court of the `plight' of the state government in procuring vaccines. The AG informed the court that out of 6.5 crore doses of Covid-19 vaccines required for beneficiaries in the 18-44 age group, orders have been placed for three crore doses with two domestic manufacturers, who have told the government that they are unable to maintain consistent supply. The manufacturers won't commit to supplying the entire order, Trivedi said. The state government informed the HC that in May, it received 13,68,650 vials of vaccine from Serum Institute of India (SII) and 2,49,240 from Bharat Biotech, a total 16,17,890, which can take care of vaccination till the beginning of June. Next month, it expects delivery of 8,13,140 vials from SII and 2,46,880 vials from BB. It will get 10,77,020 vials. This made Justice Karia comment, “It means you have a five-year plan?” In terms of global tender for procuring vaccines, Trivedi said none of the state governments has been able to finalise tender for the same, and furthermore, money for 3 crore vials has already been paid to the two domestic companies. “We are not doubting the bona fides of the government, but there has to be some more action taken, you will have to find out some other sources,” the court said. On the issue of vaccine wastage, the government told the court that the process is being supervised.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/is-vaccination-a-5-year-plan-hc-to-guj-govt/articleshow/82986208.cms||---

Although the jury is still out on this issue, there are signs that gold loans may be losing some shine after the RBI reverted to its pre-Covid loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of 75% from 90% level (which it had announced in August 2020). RBI data showed that at the end of FY21, total value of gold loans outstanding was nearly Rs 60,500 crore — up 82% on the year. In FY22, this growth rate could slow down substantially, industry players said. According to the presentation by Manappuram Finance, one of the leaders in the gold loan segment, its standalone gross non-performing assets (GNPAs) and net NPAs were both up by the end of the Q4FY21 at nearly the same levels recorded soon after demonetisation in November 2016. However, it said it has maintained delinquencies with the GNPA at less than 2%. According to industry experts, the stress in the gold loan segment could be seen in the lower levels of the market and mainly with NBFCs, but not so much in those advanced by banks. “We did not see any sharp increase in the delinquency in our books this quarter compared to previous one. There is a slight increase because last quarter was a moratorium quarter,” said Shripad Jadhav, president & business head of tractor finance, crop finance & gold loans at Kotak Mahindra Bank. “Robust risk practices, good collection processes and profile check during on-boarding help us maintain the quality of the pool and also low delinquency.” Financial stress is also forcing people to sell gold to realise its full value, rather than pledge the same to get loans that would not be more than 75% of its value. This is after the RBI reverted to 75% of the LTV from 90% earlier. “With the LTV coming back to 75%, there is a drop in demand for gold loans. People are keen to sell gold jewellery to get the full value, as they do not have the repayment capacity if they pledge it. And for existing customers who want to renew their gold loan, we see LTV sliding to 68-70% after deductions,” said IIFL VP Mohan Sharma. The combined impact of stress in the economy at the lower level and the increase in the LTV could lead to slowdown in the gold loan business. A senior official from City Union Bank said that demand for gold loans has been sluggish in the last few months. “Poor people are selling the pledged gold jewellery to pawn brokers and taking back the difference. There is a huge impact on fresh lending, especially with the current lockdown. Customers are not able to redeem the jewellery with lack of income in this lockdown and poor business,” the banker said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/fin-stress-lower-loan-to-value-rule-may-slow-gold-loan-biz/articleshow/82985352.cms||Mamtha Asokan

---||Vijayawada||Vijayawada division sees 46% dip in passenger earnings||VIJAYAWADA: Owing to the second wave of Covid-19, Vijayawada railway division saw a drastic reduction in passenger ticket purchase by 46% during the last two months. Addressing a virtual press conference, divisional railway manager P Srinivas said the total earnings for April 2021 is Rs 214.47 crore, out of which Rs 178.99 crore came from freight services. Railway officials explained that normally during the summer season, April and May, the average passenger earnings used to be around Rs 2.5 crore per day within the division. Now, daily passenger earnings have come down to Rs 60 lakh per day due to limited trains and occupancy rate. When it comes to freight, there has been a 22% increase in earnings compared to 2020. Overall, the railway division saw around Rs 100 crore loss when it came to passenger earnings. Explaining the Covid-19 situation within the division, the DRM said that 50 railway employees succumbed to the disease during the second wave since April 2021, which is a two-fold increase compared to the first wave that claimed 20 lives. On the bright side, Srinivas said there was no dearth when it came to availability of beds and oxygen in the railway hospital. “We have increased the number of oxygen beds from 45 to 130 and overall occupancy rate in the hospital stands only at around 75%. Hence, we have beds available for Covid-19 patients anytime,” Srinivas said. Around 1,350 railway employees who contracted the disease have managed to recover while 250 patients are still recovering. In total, around 1,600 employees from the division were affected by Covid-19 since the pandemic broke out last year. In terms of vaccination, 16,496 employees were administered the first dose and 3,493 second doses were administered. This is the highest among all divisions within the South Central Railway (SCR) zone. In a bid to vaccinate its employees, the division has run two vaccine specials with a team of doctors and nursing staff on April 25 and 29, 2021 from Ongole to Gudur and Vijayawada-Gudur, to vaccinate operating staff at all 33 stations between Vijayawada and Gudur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/vij-division-sees-46-dip-in-passenger-earnings/articleshow/82985302.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

---||Patna||Bihar: Risking life and limb, doctors continue battle against Covid||PATNA: Hundreds of doctors have been responding to Covid-19, a global health crisis for over a year, and leaving no stone unturned to protect the lives of patients despite an acute shortage of medical resources. Many of them have even lost their family members, friends and colleagues, but not stepped back. Talking to this reporter, Dr Ajay Kumar, who is the acting president of the Bihar chapter of the Indian Medical Association, recalled how his faith was shaken when Covid claimed the lives of his friends and colleagues. He, however, continued the battle against the deadly virus. “Although 60% of the doctors have been vaccinated in the state, those working in Covid special wards are at a high risk of getting infected,” Dr Ajay said. He also advised young doctors to keep abreast of the new developments and stay strong. Dr Sanjeev Kumar, the nodal officer for Covid at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna (AIIMS-P), pointed out that Bihar lacked good doctors and healthcare workers. “Every new doctor wishes to have a perfect work environment, but most hospitals in Bihar lack basic health infrastructure, as a result of which they prefer to move out,” Dr Sanjeev, who is a cardiologist and vascular surgeon, claimed. Another AIIMS-P doctor, Kritika Singh, has been working tirelessly to save the lives of Covid patients since last year. There are days when the anesthesiologist and critical care expert is unable to return home, but “the happy faces of my patients after they recover from Covid keep me going”. “I did not stop working even after my entire family tested Covid positive last month,” Dr Kritika said. A gynaecologist, Dr Kavya Abhilashi, who is infected with Covid at present, has not been able to see her family and four-year-old son for the last 20 days. She pointed out, “Corona patients are dying, but hundreds of shoppers still flock to vegetable markets with no precautions every morning.” Risking life and limb, Dr Vivek Kumar, an ENT specialist at the Patna Medical College and Hospital, has also been treating Covid patients. “Whenever I return home, I shut myself in a room in order to keep my wife and three kids safe. Although I am working relentlessly, I wonder what they will do if something happens to me?” he asked. Covid claims life of AIIMS-P doctor: Covid-19 claimed the life of Dr Pradeep Kumar, a junior resident doctor in the urology department of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna, on Tuesday night. The 32-year-old was admitted to the hospital’s intensive care unit 10 days ago. “He had shown signs of recovery in the beginning, but his condition deteriorated once his lungs got infected. He breathed his last at 1am on Tuesday night,” Dr Sanjeev Kumar, the nodal officer for Covid at the hospital, told this newspaper on Wednesday. With this, the total number of doctors, who have died of Covid in Bihar, has gone up to 102.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/risking-life-and-limb-doctors-continue-battle-against-covid/articleshow/82983987.cms||---

The state government has also urged the Centre to provide an additional cryogenic tank of 20-kilolitre liquid oxygen capacity for the hospital so that piped oxygen supply capacity could be tripled. According to the letter written by chief secretary Tripurari Sharan to MHA secretary Ajay Bhalla on May 17, installation of the additional tank would decrease the refilling frequency and risk factor. These facts came to light from a counter affidavit of building construction department secretary-cum-health department OSD Kumar Ravi submitted before the Patna high court on Tuesday. At present, ESIC-Bihta has a 10-kilolitre capacity liquid oxygen tank capable of running 100 Covid beds.

Due to some technical reasons live streaming of the symbolic activities performed at Mahabodhi temple to commemorate the birth anniversary of Lord Buddha could not take place. A post on the Facebook page of Mahabodhi temple read, “Due to technical problem and weather condition, live streaming of the puja prayer has been interrupted.” Prime minister Narendra Modi was also scheduled to connect online for the Buddha Jayanti programme. “The PM addressed a programme of International Buddhist Federation in New Delhi and it had nothing to do with the Mahabodhi temple,” district magistrate-cum-Bodh Gaya Temple Management Committee (BTMC) chairman Abhishek Singh said. The DM added: “The Mahabodhi temple is closed due to lockdown and thus no special programme was organized for the public on the occasion of Buddha Jayanti this year.” Only a special chanting by the resident monks of BTMC under the sacred Bodhi tree marked the programme. At another symbolic activity performed on this occasion, the monks led by Mahabodhi Mahavihara chief monk Bhikkhu Chalinda offered ‘kheer’ near the statue of Buddha at the sanctum sanctorum. The monks also offered a new civara (robe) on the statue. Later, following the physical distancing guideline, the monks chanted sutras under the Bodhi tree and held prayers for world peace and safety of human lives from the devastating effect of Covid–19.

The incident took place on Sunday morning but came to light on Wednesday after alleged photos of their injuries surfaced. Patna SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma said he is looking into the allegations and will seek a report from the SDPO concerned. “The allegation is that the probationer DSP and other police personnel assaulted the father-son duo after taking them to Paliganj police station. Action will be taken after receiving the report,” he added. Paliganj SDPO Tanvir Ahmed said the victims are residents of Baba Boring road in Paliganj. “Assault allegations have been labelled against the probationer DSP, a sub-inspector Pradeep Kumar and constables in the police team. A written complaint has been submitted with photographs and medical documents of the injuries,” he said, adding photographs depict they were brutally assaulted. Ahmed said the probationer DSP got posted as station house officer of Paliganj police station barely two days before the incident. “Vikash was scheduled to catch a train to Delhi on Sunday evening. They had gone to purchase necessary medicines in the morning. Bhushan went inside the shop while Vikash waited for roadside along with the bike,” the SDPO said, quoting the complaint. He said a speeding SUV dashed their bike after which Vikash started banging on the driver’s window to make him come out. By then the police team reached the spot and after an altercation brought the duo away to the police station. “They were set free after a few hours on personal bond,” he said. “The probationer DSP said both father and son had misbehaved with the police after which they were brought to the police station. He said some constables might have assaulted them while bringing them,” SDPO said. Ahmed, quoting the complaint, said the youth could not travel to Delhi because of the assault.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/police-team-accused-of-assaulting-man-son-at-paliganj-ssp-fumes/articleshow/82983973.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Various teams of the central government will be in Gujarat for a couple of days from Thursday, to assess the cyclone damage. Teams of the ministries of home affairs, agriculture, industry and others will visit the affected areas to assess the damage on the ground. After their field visit, officials of various central government departments will hold a meeting with the CM and top government officials. The Gujarat government is expected to submit a memorandum to the central teams, listing the damage to various sectors because of the cyclone. Key sources involved in preparing the memorandum said that various departments have submitted details of damage and a few departments are still in the process of compiling the information. “Losses are highest in the agriculture and co-operation, energy and housing departments. A few other departments are still compiling date, but we expect the total damage figure to be close to Rs 10,000 crore,” one of the sources said. The government of India has already made an allocation Rs 1,000 crore in the form of immediate assistance, soon after the PM’s visit. “After submission of the memorandum, we expect more financial assistance. The state government is also preparing a detailed scheme for assistance to cyclone-affected citizens. Within a week’s time, the state government will announce a relief package for various sections of society,” the source said. During and after the cyclone, a total of 64 deaths were reported. Several thousand animal deaths and major damage to personal and government property have also been reported.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/tauktae-caused-damage-worth-rs-10000-crore-in-gujarat/articleshow/82987212.cms||Kapil Dave
---||Patna||Fuel prices continue northward march amid lockdown in Patna||PATNA: Fuel prices have once again surged in Patna with speed petrol price crossing Rs 100 per litre-mark in the last 24 hours. The oil marketing companies have blamed global market trend and taxes imposed by the government for the daily rise in fuel prices. Indian Oil Corporation’s premium grade petrol, the superior version of auto fuel which improves the vehicle’s performance, is being sold at Rs 100.19 per litre. Other two oil companies – Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum – are selling their premium grade petrol at Rs 99.5 and Rs 99.15 per litre, respectively. Petrol prices touched Rs 95.76 per litre in Patna on Wednesday. Diesel, on the other hand, was being sold at Rs 89.74 per litre. The fuel prices started to rise from June last year after Unlock 1.0. Since then, petrol prices went up by Rs 19 per litre and diesel Rs 20 per litre. Ajay Kumar, manager of a fuel station of Bharat Petroleum at Dak Bungalow crossing, said the prices of petrol and diesel started rising since June last year. “The sales were badly hit due to rise in fuel prices and Covid-induced lockdown. We sold only 14 kilolitres of fuel per day,” he said. Vijay Kumar, sales executive at a fuel station near Gandhi Maidan, said premium petrol is sold at higher prices because of its ability to improve the vehicle’s performance, but it had not crossed Rs 100-mark in the last few years. “The prices of petrol have increased by Rs 2.90 and diesel by Rs 3.62 since May 1,” he said. K B Gandhi, manager of another fuel station on Budh Marg, said only emergency vehicles and private cars of medical staff are refilling fuel thse days due to the lockdown. “Less than 5% of public vehicles are moving in the city,” he added. Raj Kumar Jha, general secretary of Bihar State Auto Chalak Sangh, said only 20-25% autorickshaws are plying on roads in the state and most of them are CNG-run. “It makes no sense in operating autorickshaws and buying petrol at Rs 100 per litre in return of nothing. Passenger footfall has sharply declined due to the lockdown. Even if the lockdown is lifted, the autorickshaw drivers have to think twice because of continuous rise in fuel prices,” he said. D M Diwakar, an economist and former director of A N Sinha Institute of Social Studies, said, “As several states have imposed lockdown, the economy has further slumped in the country. To recover the losses, the government is imposing taxes on fuel prices even though the international rates are not that high,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/fuel-prices-continue-northward-march-amid-lockdown/articleshow/82984044.cms||Faryal Rumi

The GWLP is part of Nitish Kumar’s ‘Jal Jivan Hariyali Abhiyan’ which is aimed at minimising the bad effects of climate change. Under the multi-crore project, the state government has planned to lift water from the Ganga near Hathidah in Patna district and supply it to Gaya, Bodh Gaya, Rajgir and Nawada towns through pipeline. The Ganga water will be thoroughly processed for drinking purposes within the supply chain system before reaching the consumers’ tap. The first phase of the GWLP is estimated to cost around Rs 2,836 crore and it was earlier estimated to be completed by June 2021. Holding a high-level meeting to review different schemes of the WRD through videoconferencing from ‘Samvad’ hall of his official residence, Nitish asked the WRD officials to complete the remaining work of the GWLP at a fast pace to provide drinking water to people as early as possible. “After the Covid-19 pandemic normalises, I will visit the construction sites of all the ongoing projects to make an on-the-spot assessment. I will also do ground level assessment of the projects which have already been completed,” the CM told the officials. Nitish asked WRD minister Sanjay Kumar Jha and the department secretary Sanjeev Hans to do regular monitoring of important schemes in flood-affected areas so that the remaining works could be completed soon. The CM asked the WRD engineers to complete the heightening and strengthening work of different embankments on a priority basis. Nitish also said he wanted to develop Valmiki Nagar forest as the “centre of ecotourism”. “River flows from one side of Valmiki Nagar, while its other side has mountains and dense forest. It has very eye-catching scenes,” the CM said. Earlier, Hans made a detailed presentation about different ongoing projects before the CM and the state’s top officials, including chief secretary Tripurari Sharan and development commissioner Amir Subhani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/expedite-ganga-water-lift-project-nitish-tells-officials/articleshow/82985282.cms||---

This was on a particular day when the Cyclone Yaas crossed the coast in Odisha. As per weather forecast, there was no major impact of the very severe cyclonic storm on north-coastal Andhra Pradesh, even in the Odisha-bordering Ichchapuram area. But almost all parts of the state recorded above normal temperatures for the season on Wednesday. The sudden spurt in temperatures was mainly attributed to Cyclone Yaas sapping moisture in the region. The highest maximum temperatures of coastal Andhra Pradesh, which had hovered around 40 degrees Celsius for the last several days, shot up to new record temperatures. Gajuwaka in Visakhapatnam for the first time recorded about 42 degrees Celsius this season, which was said to be the highest in the last 43 years. The last time the city crossed 42 degrees Celsius was on May 19, 1978. Officials heaved a sigh of relief with no impact of the cyclone on the state. District officials had made alternative arrangements for power and oxygen supply in view of the pandemic. Special commissioner, state disaster management authority, K Kannababu said above normal temperatures would continue for the next four days. “A total of 68 mandals in East Godavari, Vizianagaram, West Godavari and Krishna districts may experience heat wave conditions on Thursday. Some places in Srikakulam, Vizianagaram, Visakhapatnam, East Godavari, West Godavari and Krishna may record 45-46 degrees Celsius on Thursday,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/record-high-42oc-in-vizag-after-43-years/articleshow/82985278.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Business||Calibrate opening-up of economy with vax, says Uday Kotak||NEW DELHI: Kotak Mahindra Bank vice-chairman and MD Uday Kotak, who is also the outgoing president of industry body CII, believes that states must calibrate opening up while bolstering health infrastructure and vaccinations. He calls for fiscal support to help small businesses and the corporate sector tide over the fresh financial challenge. Excerpts: How should states calibrate the opening up? How are companies planning to resume operations?Our decision-making has to be based on experts, knowledge and science. The factors that will work in the next three-four months is the level of vaccination. One of the lessons that Covid 2.0 has taught us is that even if there is wastage, we must create capacity in hospital beds, oxygen and medication, rather than run helter-skelter as many Indians did. We are three-four months away from a level of confidence where we can take a bold call that we have vaccinated a lot of people. By August, we should be vaccinating around 15 crore doses a month. On opening up, states are going to be in a very challenging position between July and September. It will also depend on how effective the vaccine is against the variants. What kind of support will businesses require in three-four months?Besides a calibrated opening up, we need a review of the vaccination policy. We should have two vaccine quotas — one for the Centre, which should be around 75%, and the remaining for the private sector. The Centre should allocate equitably to the states, otherwise, states competing with each other is creating some confusion. What is your prescription to help businesses getting hit financially?The time has come for the fisc to step up and there is good news on that. The Budget was very conservative on revenues. For instance, there is Rs 50,000 crore more from the RBI. There is room for the government to provide support to those at the bottom of the pyramid who need food and some amount of cash for their livelihood. I would strongly recommend the ECLGS (Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme), which was for Rs 3 lakh crore, should be expanded to Rs 5 lakh crore and the guarantee can enable financing of small businesses and stressed sectors. Should government give more in the form of direct benefits as relief package?This time, we should be bolder as the impact was more on rural areas. The RBI should expand its balance sheet so that the additional market borrowing does not hit the bond markets. Some lenders have called for a moratorium...The direct transfers will take care of weaker sectors and government support to MSMEs and extension of ECLGS will protect jobs and make it possible for banks to lend to them. If a stressed borrower does not have fiscal support, the bank can restructure the loan if it recognises the loan as an NPA (non-performing asset) and provides for it. In the last year, banks have raised significant capital, which gives them room to restructure loans, take the provisioning hit and move on. A back-to-back forbearance from the RBI will turn moratorium and restructuring into ‘extend and pretend’. From 2009 to 2016, we have seen the ‘extend and pretend’ culture weaken the financial system. Let not history repeat itself. Will the lockdown hurt banks by increasing bad loans?April was okay. May is showing stress and some of it will spill over to June. The NPA impact will be felt only in the second quarter. The good news is that equity markets are functioning and willing to provide capital. This will give banks that need capital the ability to raise it, take a knock and support the system. Is there reluctance among corporates to invest?If capacity utilisation in the economy is 63%, there will be no expansion. The moment capital utilisation will go to 75-80%, you will see fresh investment. My personal view is capital investment cycle is a FY22-23 phenomenon. Will demand be hit with banks turning cautious on unsecured consumer loans?Consumer demand is getting affected because people are hoarding cash for medical and other emergencies. If you give an unsecured consumer loan to leveraged players and that includes microfinance, it is a vulnerable segment and the risk of default is high. Does anything need to be done on loan recovery/resolution?We need to significantly increase the capacity of NCLT and NCLAT benches. We need to focus on time. If there is one thing, I would like to see India get better at it is ROTI — return on time invested. Do you see the GDP target being achieved?This is a moving target, you have to see each month as it goes. My view is that at the end of FY22, the size of the economy will be the same as FY20. Any expectations from credit policy?The RBI has been proactive throughout the period since April 2020. The time has come for some of the heavy liftings to be done by the fisc. The RBI can support the government by expanding its government security (G-sec) purchase programme. Our analysis shows inflation will be under control in 2021 and the RBI will be at an accommodative stance and support the economy. Will GST cut help to spur demand?Whatever the government can do from its fisc to support consumers and the broader economy is welcome.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/calibrate-opening-up-of-eco-with-vax-says-kotak/articleshow/82987449.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Kolkata||Tackling link issues in Kolkata: E-classes suspended, power backed up to ensure smooth WFH||KOLKATA: Several schools, colleges and universities across the city and its outskirts on Wednesday suspended online classes and postponed end-semester examinations, anticipating disruption in cellphone and internet connectivity due to Yaas. Those working from home, too, made arrangements, having learnt a lesson from the challenges they faced after Amphan. Although some schools have gone into summer vacation, institutes, including South Point School, Vivekananda Mission School and Jadavpur University, called off virtual classes on Wednesday and deferred examinations slated for Wednesday and Thursday. “Since the disruption caused by Yaas could have hampered online classes, we decided to declare a holiday on Wednesday,” said Krishna Damani, spokesperson of South Point School. The school will adjust the missed classes on other dates, he added. Sarmistha Banerjee, principal of Vivekananda Mission School, said there was a massive disturbance in internet connectivity. “We had received complaints from teachers and students about erratic connection. There was no point in continuing classes on Wednesday. The scheduled classes and topics will be taught on another date,” she said. Abhirup Sengupta, a second-year UG student at Adamas University, thanked his institution for pushing back end-semester exams scheduled on Wednesday and Thursday. The JU authorities on Wednesday sent a note to its engineering department heads, requesting them to “consider” cases of students who were unable to appear online for Wednesday’s examinations. At JU, examinations in the engineering faculty had to be cancelled at the last minute on Tuesday as a holiday was announced for Buddha Purnima. Partha Pratim Ray of the physics department said online classes in the faculty have been suspended till Thursday due to network issues across Yaas-hit districts. Debnil Paul, a student of Presidency University, confirmed that while some UG and PG departments had suspended classes due to the cyclone, others had announced a holiday due to Buddha Purnima. WFH executives like Santanu Mitra had taken requisite measures in advance. Mitra, who works as a senior data analyst at MOL-IT India, hired a mini-generator to avoid interruption in broadband connection at his Behala home. However, none of the cellular service providers in the city and adjacent districts has reported any significant disruption across their networks. Questions sent to the Cellular Operators’ Association of India (COAI) and its members didn’t elicit any response. Reliance Jio has sent a precautionary update saying, “In view of cyclone Yaas, your JioFiber services might get impacted.” “Till evening, only a small percentage of our sites were reported to have been affected, thanks to our preparedness. Our teams are working on them and the network in these pockets will be restored at the earliest,” said Palash Paul, a network engineer working for a telecom infrastructure provider.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tackling-link-issues-e-classes-suspended-power-backed-up-to-ensure-smooth-wfh/articleshow/82984889.cms||Somdatta Basu

Demand revival in value added products post the pandemic effect last financial year, lower restrictions as compared with the earlier Covid wave and steady demand for liquid milk will support overall growth in the current fiscal, the agency added. With demand for most value-added products such as ghee, butter, cheese and milk powder is expected to remain healthy, the value added products’ sales are likely to grow 7% in fiscal 2021-22 as compared to 3% in the previous fiscal. Local restrictions could delay demand recovery in certain value-added products such as flavoured milk, buttermilk, lassi and ice cream, where sales had rebounded to 70-80% of pre-pandemic levels in March 2021. Sales of these products, are likely to be affected if restrictions are prolonged the way it was last fiscal, it said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/dairy-sector-to-grow-5-6-this-fiscal-crisil/articleshow/82987244.cms||---

In the urban areas, where there are a high number of people who are due for the follow-up, over 30 sites offering the vaccine saw large crowds gather. In Pune rural, only two Covaxin sites were operational. A total of 385 people were administered the shot. However, the region desperately needs a resupply of the Bharat Biotech vaccine. On Thursday, the PCMC will not hold Covaxin drives. The PMC will administer the vaccine at 15 sites with each centre offering only 100 doses. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical) Pune circle, said more Covaxin doses are likely to arrive later this week. “All doses in the new batch will be used to cover those due for the second dose. We hope the supply streamlines soon,” he said. An official from District Hospital Aundh said on Wednesday, they gave second doses to around 370 people. Another 330 doses will be given on Thursday. He said, “Those due for the second dose are being reminded via calls or text. Token distribution starts from 7am.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/more-than-2000-get-2nd-dose-but-covaxin-stock-low-in-region/articleshow/82987237.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Pune||Many in Pune still find post-vaccine certificates difficult to get||PUNE: Post-vaccination glitches continue to trouble citizens four months into the Covid inoculation programme. First, it was finding a vaccine slot. Now, it’s securing a vaccination certificate. Suresh Shivdasani, a 77-year-old who got his second dose a month ago, said he’s still waiting for the confirmation SMS and a certificate confirming the second dose. He said, “When we got our first dose, my wife and I got a certificate after logging into CoWIN. But after the second dose (on April 26), we did not receive the message that confirms the jab. And when I checked the CoWIN website, I could only see the provisional certificate issued after the first dose. I think our details haven’t been fed into CoWIN as our names were entered into a register at the vaccination site.” Pimple Saudagar resident Uday Dere said, “My wife and I went to a government site in Dhayari for the first dose on May 7. Our trouble started when I noticed my wife's certificate was not visible on the CoWIN website.” Dere said when he visited the centre the next day, he was told to book an appointment so that staff there could ‘fake’ a shot. “They said it’s the only way to enter missing data into CoWIN. I refused. We’re now at the mercy of the system,” he said. Seema Thaware from Aundh, who got a Covaxin jab over a month ago, said her records on CoWIN showed she hadn’t received the shot. “So I could not show a certificate for my second dose. I had to visit my hospital site three or four times to get the error resolved. The vaccination centre had not entered my details on CoWIN.” A central official from the CoWIN team said names have to be fed into the system immediately after a person is vaccinated. “But some hospitals record names in registers or Excel sheets. In such cases, vaccinators may miss names due to human error or if there’s a shift change. The system will then show a person has not been vaccinated,” he said. He added that the only workaround for recipients is to visit sites again and ensure their details are entered on CoWIN. “Ideally, vaccinators at sites should be updating beneficiary details on CoWIN as soon as a jab is administered,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/many-still-find-post-vaccine-certificates-difficult-to-get/articleshow/82987225.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Ludhiana||Cong stages protest over lack of proper vaccination strategy||Ludhiana: Congress workers, led by senior leader Parminder Mehta, staged a protest against the central government, accusing it of failing to handle the vaccination process of people in the age group of 18 to 45 years. Sitting near the statue of Mahatma Gandhi outside municipal corporation office, Mehta and others shouted slogans against the Centre. Mehta said, “Prime Minister has misguided the public about manufacturing the vaccine in India. This is evident from the fact that already several courts in the country have pulled up the Centre over the poor arrangements made by it in handling Covid crisis. Till date, millions of people, including children and those who are in the 18-45 years age group are deprived of the vaccine, but crores of vials of vaccine were gifted for free to other countries. PM Modi is still fooling people by making tall claims, but doing nothing on ground to vaccinate the masses at the earliest.” Mehta also added, “It is very disturbing that in the second wave, which is very deadly than the earlier one, small children and youngsters are being infected in large numbers. Government’s plan to vaccinate people above the age of 18 years has already flopped. Earlier, Centre had taken total control over the vaccination procurement and allocation, but when the system started collapsing, states were asked to deal with it. We urge the central government, and specially PM, to not play politics but wake up and take some concrete measures to vaccinate the 18-45 years age group and children as early as possible.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/cong-stages-protest-over-lack-of-proper-vaccination-strategy/articleshow/82988961.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Corporators push for maximum jabs for locals||Mumbai: Several corporators who have got the BMC to start vaccination centres in their respective wards are ensuring maximum local residents get the jabs on the three days when walk-in is allowed. Currently, the BMC allows walk-in vaccination on three days of the week—Monday to Wednesday—only for senior citizens, lactating mothers and those aged above 45 years who have to be administered the second vaccine dose. Kalina corporator Tulip Miranda said the purpose of pursuing the BMC to start a vaccination centre within their ward was solely to benefit local residents. “I daily send out detailed messages on the number of vaccine doses that the BMC allocates to the centre. I am also following up with the BMC to allocate a session, if possible, for any infirm person who may be above 18 years old,” said Miranda. Atul Shah, BJP corporator, too, said for the Madhav Baug vaccination centre at C P Tank, he sends out a detailed message on WhatsApp mentioning the timing, number of doses allocated for senior citizens and 45-plus and informs them on how the second dose can be taken only after completion of 84 days of the first dose. “This ensures that residents of my area are well informed about the centre and whether they can walk in or not,” said Shah. Meanwhile, Mumbadevi MLA Amin Patel said they have been sending volunteers to homes of local residents, telling them to come to the vaccination centre on days when walk-in vaccinations are allowed. “The BMC, though, should keep its rules the same for at least a week on who is eligible to be vaccinated. Frequent changes in rules create confusion. Currently, as the gap between the first and second dose has been extended, the number of those who are awaiting their second dose has reduced considerably,” said Patel. Matunga corporator Nehal Shah said the BMC should now open up vaccination for all age groups due to the extended gap. “There are fewer people who are currently eligible for the second dose. In such a case, why waste man and machinery at a centre? Instead, allow anyone wanting to take the vaccine to walk in,” said Shah, adding she is currently extending all help to locals in the ward so that they benefit at least during the three walk-in days. The corporators said while they are still seeing those from other areas walk in during the three days, though the numbers have considerably reduced.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/corporators-push-for-maximum-jabs-for-locals/articleshow/82985142.cms||Richa Pinto

However, those who are still poor and needy must get quota on the line of other socially and educationally backward people from other communities,” the royal descendant of 16th century Maratha warrior king Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj said.

---||Delhi||Republic Day mob aimed to make Red Fort new agri protest site: Delhi Police||NEW DELHI: The mob at Red Fort on January 26 intended to not only capture the historic monument and hoist the Nishan Sahib and the ‘kisan’ flag on top but also aimed to make it the new protest site for the agitation against the new farm laws, Delhi Police has said in its chargesheet filed in connection with the violence witnessed there. While elaborating on the alleged conspiracy behind the violence, the chargesheet has cited the figures for purchase of tractors in Haryana and Punjab in December 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019.  Interestingly, the figure is claimed to be 95% more than the previous year in Punjab when the protests were at their peak in December 2020. In the 3,232-page chargesheet, which has been vetted by the prosecution and police commissioner S N Shrivastava, Delhi Police has explained in detail how a “deep-rooted and premeditated conspiracy” was hatched and executed. TOI was the first to report on May 22 that the crime branch chargesheet said the violence was premeditated. “The episode is a larger conspiracy hatched in the garb of (protests against the) newly-enacted farmers’ act. It was the intention and one of the main/key objective of the unruly mob to enter Delhi, make Red Fort a new site for their morcha/dharna and then to take the protest further,” the police have said on the violence in which over 500 police personnel were injured. “The arrested accused persons, along with their absconding associates, leaders and instigators, had deliberately chosen the very auspicious occasion of the country, viz. Republic Day 2021, to hoist Nishan Sahib and kisan flag, in order to cause embarrassment and humiliation at the national and international levels to the people of this country,” the police have said. The police have claimed that their investigations have revealed that the purchase of tractors spiralled rapidly in a well-orchestrated conspiracy and with the sole objective and intent to take the tractors to Delhi for the protest. The cops had written to Tractor and Mechanization Association for providing the state-wise and month-wise data for sale of tractors. In Punjab, there was an increase of 43.53% in tractor sales in November 2020 compared to the same month in 2019. Similarly, in January 2021 (when the violence happened), the sales increased by 85.13% compared to January 2020. In Haryana, there was an increase of 31.81% and 50.32% in the months of November and December 2020, respectively, compared to the same months in 2019 when there were no protests. In January 2021, tractor sales increased by 48% in Haryana compared to January 2020. The chargesheet also alleges that money was a driving factor in the execution of this conspiracy. An accused named Iqbal Singh had disclosed during interrogation that he had been promised a cash reward by Sikhs for Justice group if he succeeded in getting Nishan Sahib hoisted on the ramparts of Red Fort. The police have cited an audio of a conversation wherein the daughter of Iqbal Singh is allegedly conversing with one of his relatives and mentioning that they will be getting an amount of Rs 50 lakhs. Iqbal Singh, the cops have claimed, visited Tarn Taran, Punjab, on January 19 for a meeting. “A majority of the accused persons who hoisted Nishan Sahib at…Red Fort also hail from Tarn Taran and all of them are identified but still at large,” said the cops. Accused Deep Sidhu, the police said, acted like an influencer and instigator who actively provoked the crowd to indulge in violence on that day and even before that. In several videos, according to the police, Sidhu is seen to be claiming that he knew very well that the Sangat will not take the government approved route for its tractor rally but will instead go to Red Fort. There are other videos available on record in which different leaders of the farmers’ unions are claiming that the tractor rally will not follow the route that had been agreed upon, and if they were stopped by the police, they will breach the barricades and enter Delhi at any cost, the police have said. The chargesheet also claims that there are videos available on record which show the farmers’ leaders instigating their supporters to modify their tractors and get heavy metal accessories installed so that the barricades put up by the police can be breached. “All these videos were recorded prior to January 6,” say the cops. “The arrested accused persons and other members of the mob with a common intent took to active rioting, ransacking public property, attacking and robbing public servants and damaging the monument, causing huge financial losses to the government,” the police added. They said a probe is being conducted into how one protester, Akashpreet, sustained a minor gunshot wound in the foot. He was arrested after being given first aid. Another man, his family says, has gone missing since that day and a probe is being conducted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/republic-day-mob-aimed-to-make-red-fort-new-agri-protest-site-cops/articleshow/82991553.cms||Rajshekhar Jha

More patients will start receiving the drug for free from June 7 as the state’s plan to import the drug through global tender is set to get materialised early next month,” Sudhakar Shinde, the chief executive officer (CEO) of the Mahatma Phule Jan Arogya Yojana told TOI.Officials requested non-designated private hubs to refer the economically weak patients to the designated facilities for free treatment.Mucormycosis treatment is hugely expensive and can last weeks or even months. The cost of injections (liposomal amphotericin B) alone can be as high as Rs25,000 to Rs60,000 per day. Doctors have reported instances of families mortgaging belongings to pay for patient care.The scheme offers free treatment to every patient of mucormycosis in Maharashtra at the designated facilities. Anyone having a ration card can avail of the free treatment benefit.Besides the MPJAY, the government has created a corpus of Rs30 crore if treatment costs in certain patients with advanced disease run into lakhs, crossing the limits fixed under the health cover.“We also found that a sizable number of patients are from the affording class and have private medical insurance through which they can foot the treatment expenses. These are also the patients who want to take treatment at their choice of hospitals,” Shinde said.The treatment includes medical management, repeated clearance (debridement) of affected sinus tissues, ICU stay and radical surgeries.The scheme is meant only for patients in whom the diagnosis of mucormycosis has been confirmed. It does not include suspect cases. “Unlike treatment, diagnosis of mucormycosis is not an expensive affair,” Shinde said.Health activists urged the state government to use mass media tools like newspaper, radio and television to create awareness about the scheme and popularise its benefits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/44-mucormycosis-patients-availing-free-care-under-mpjay-scheme-ceo/articleshow/82987262.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Telangana Chemists and Druggists Association demanded that its members are inoculated on priority as they run medical shops despite being in a lockdown and despite a significant number of them have died or fallen sick due to Covid-19. Ch Janardhan Rao, president of the association, said 25,000 chemists from Telangana will also join the lockdown to protect themselves and save their lives. “We have been ignored by the government while considering several others as vaccination priority group,” he said. The All India Organisation of Chemists and Druggists has already given a call demanding vaccination for all its 9.4 lakh members. Association in-charge honorary general secretary Pendem Krishna Kumar said dispensing and distribution of medicines is nothing less important than the duty of doctors and paramedical staff. “Despite repeated appeals, we have been sidelined for the vaccination drive. Since March 2020, more than 650 chemists and pharmacists have lost their lives due to Covid-19 infection,” he said. Krishna Kumar said they are most vulnerable to infection as they closely interact with patients and their family members. “Injections like remdesivir or tocilizumab are governed under the government control but Covid-19 drugs are not made available for us. The next drug expected to come under government control will be amphotericin B,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/inoculate-us-or-will-close-med-shops-warn-pharmacists/articleshow/82987254.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

The local BJP leaders claimed the citizens and traders are going through severe financial crisis due to the strict lockdown that was in place for eight days along with Covid restrictions which are in place for the last one-and-a-half months. Many people have lost their jobs and non-essential shop owners too are facing difficulties due to the restrictions imposed by the government. Mahesh Jadhav, BJP leader who led the delegation to meet civic officials, said, “All types of taxes imposed by the KMC such as property tax, water tax and fees collected from traders must be waived from the month of April to July this year. We expect the civic administration to give relief to the citizens and traders who are not in any position to pay the tax. We expect a decision in this regard should be taken at the earliest.” A senior civic official said no such relief can be given owing to the KMC’s poor financial condition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/waive-taxes-of-citizens-traders-bjp-to-kmc/articleshow/82980232.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Scores of isolation beds now vacant across civic-run Covid-19 centres||PUNE: Most Covid-19 beds at PMC and PCMC-run isolation facilities are now vacant due to a drop in new cases. The PMC has set aside 2,300 isolation beds at Covid care centres. Only 450 of these are currently occupied. The civic body has clarified that institutional isolation is not mandatory for those testing positive in PMC limits. “We are ready with the infrastructure. Capacity can be taken up to 9,000 beds if needed,” said Rajendra Muthe, a senior PMC official. In Pimpri Chinchwad, PCMC officials said 2,383 out of 3,595 beds are currently unoccupied at their care centres. This is an improvement considering that on April 13, they had only 223 vacant beds. Vikas Dhakane, PCMC additional commissioner, said they have shut down five private care centres because of zero admissions. “If there’s need, we can restart these centres within two days,” he said. Muthe said demand for institutional isolation in PMC limits has been low as many people sickened during the second wave have had space at home to isolate. Compared to 2020, when cases were high in slums, it’s the housing societies that have been impacted more this year. Patients with mild symptoms who don't have space to isolate at home are admitted at these isolation centres. As of May 26, six more PMC-run centres, with a capacity of 2,400 beds, have been readied. Officials said 10 more centres can be commissioned, with a capacity to house 4,000 patients. The PMC has plans to provide 9,000 beds overall. The PMC had also started 15 post Covid care centres last year. Due to demand, the number had risen to 31, with a capacity to also quarantine 16,000 people. Patients are quarantined for 14 days and discharged after a negative test.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/scores-of-isolation-beds-now-vacant-across-civic-run-covid-19-centres/articleshow/82987282.cms||---
---||Pune||Mucormycosis: Six big hospitals in Pune likely to offer treatment at zero cost||PUNE: Six big trust hospitals in the city are likely to start offering free medical care to patients with mucormycosis under the state-sponsored public health scheme. A total of 10 healthcare units — mainly private/deemed and state-run medical colleges — started offering cost-free treatment to the patients after these set-ups were designated as mucormycosis care hubs under the scheme last week. The addition of six big trust hospitals will take the number of free-treatment centres to 16 in the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR). Pune district has 26% (650 patients) of the state’s 2,500 mucormycosis patients. Almost 50% of them are presently undergoing treatment at the six big trust hospitals — Deenananth Mangeshkar Hospital (DMH), Ruby Hall Clinic, Jehangir Hospital, Inlaks and Budhrani Hospital, KEM Hospital and Poona Hospital. “The Pune district collectorate has been asked to involve the charity commissioner's office to hold discussions with these six big hospitals so that they start offering free treatment to patients with mucormycosis under the state government's Mahatma Phule Jan Arogya Yojana (MPJAY),” said Sudhakar Shinde, chief executive officer (CEO), MPJAY. The officials with the charity commissioner's office will be holding a meeting with these six hospitals on May 27 to discuss their concerns and doubts regarding the scheme. Bomi Bhote, CEO, Ruby Hall Clinic said, “We shall take a decision regarding our participation in the MPJAY after the meeting with the officials.” Vindo Sawantwadkar, CEO, Jehangir Hospital, said, “There is no clarity about various packages offered under the scheme. We need to first clear doubts.” Senior surgeon Dhananjay Kelkar, medical director, Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, said, “The month-long treatment with the injection alone costs over Rs15-18 lakh. We doubt that the government will take up this onus under the MPJAY.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/six-big-hospitals-likely-to-offer-treatment-at-zero-cost/articleshow/82987274.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Confusion, however, prevailed over vaccination of pregnant women that BMC had announced two days ago, in deviation from the Centre’s policy. From Thursday to Saturday, vaccination will be only through online appointments, BMC said. Centres have been told to reserve 80% of slots for first doses of Covishield to be given to all above 45 years. The remaining 20% slots have been kept for second dose. Dr Mangala Gomare said centres could allocate a time slot for lactating mothers so that they can promptly get vaccinated once they come to the facility. Of 493 vaccinations, 479 were in public vaccination centres. On Wednesday, the last day of walk-in vaccinations, 34,257 took the shots. They included 12,309 aged 18-44. This age group has crossed 1,11,515 vaccinations since it was opened for them on May 1. But booking slots on Co-Win continues to be difficult.

Adhering to the lockdown norms, the cooking part was handed over to the jail authorities where space and manpower are available to cook in larger quantities. They are sending it to various food distribution centres near hospitals, Covid care centres, etc where the patients and their attendants are struggling to stay alive. This effort, according to Nalgonda district legal services authority (DLSA) secretary G Venu, is saving several people from starvation. Nalgonda NRI.org NGO is helping the authorities with this task. They also came out with a new idea to request all those families in the city who can afford to prepare and give one food packet a day to do so. These packets would be collected and sent to various distribution centres. Similar food distribution centres were set up in Miryalaguda, Suryapet, etc also by the DLSA . Recalling the order passed by the high court, asking the state and civic bodies to tie up with NGOs to set up community kitchen, the DLSA secretary said their appeal to people and authorities to come forward to fulfill this directive has become fruitful with many people coming forward to help the poor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/nalgonda-dlsa-feeds-poor-through-community-kitchens/articleshow/82987293.cms||---

---||Varanasi||ITIs to supply skilled manpower for handling medical equipment||Varanasi: As the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic has led to a massive rise in the number of oxygen plants, concentrators, ventilators as well as advanced medical equipment at hospitals, the challenge of their maintenance and repair has also gone up, thereby opening up immense job opportunities in this sector. In view of the unavailability of skilled hands, the district administration has asked the government as well as private Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) to begin efforts at a war-footing to prepare a batch of at least 100 skilled technicians by training them for the job in a month. Talking to TOI on Wednesday, district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma said, “I have assigned the task to the ITI principal, who is also the nodal officer for skill development programme in the district, to ensure that government and private institutes prepare a batch of 75 and 25 skilled technicians, respectively, by giving them training of repair and maintenance of oxygen plants, concentrators, oxygen supply pipelines in hospitals, ventilators, high flow nasal cannula and other advanced medical equipment.” “These number of such machines has increased manifold within a period of 45 days,” he said adding, “even the company which has installed most of the oxygen plants in this period has only one engineer to tackle technical issues in Varanasi and surrounding region. “ “The ITI principal will finalise the structure of training programme after which state government’s approval will be sought to run it very soon. The training will be conducted in seven modules, in which all the newly installed medical equipment and oxygen plants will be covered,” he told TOI on Wednesday. “The ITI principal will invite applications for the first batch of 100 aspirants, who will be given training for a month after which they will be engaged at government hospitals and establishments for experience,” he said adding, “it is expected that most of the trained technicians in the first batch will be consumed in government hospitals while others will also get job opportunities as freelancer as demand for them in private hospitals and companies is also going to increase massively.” The district administration records indicate that only in a period of 45 days, five oxygen plants have been installed wile installation process for 15 others is in progress in government hospitals of the district. The DM said that a total of 17 government hospitals are getting equipped with 20 oxygen plants. “Private hospitals are also being mobilised to install their own plants to end dependency on cylinders. The industrial plants for refilling medical oxygen cylinders are also increasing. With the arrival of oxygen plants, auxiliary work like laying its pipelines has also increased massively,” the DM added. “We now have 488 ventilators in government hospitals. The number of oxygen concentrators in government hospitals has gone up to 220 while 400 more are coming. Also, 150 are available in private hospitals,” he said adding, “apart from these, advanced medical equipment like HFNC and others have also increased massively, which has created new avenues. The job opportunities will increase in this sector as not only Varanasi, but almost all districts are faced with this situation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/itis-to-supply-skilled-manpower-for-handling-medical-equipment/articleshow/82986041.cms||Rajeev Dikshit
---||Allahabad||Allahabad high court junks pre-arrest bail to Uttar Pradesh professor||PRAYAGRAJ: The Allahabad high court on Tuesday denied pre-arrest bail to a professor for allegedly putting an objectionable and obscene post on Facebook regarding Union cabinet minister for textiles and women and child development Smriti Zubin Irani. Rejecting the anticipatory bail application filed by Dr Shaharyar Ali, Justice JJ Munir said, “The contents of the post are indeed such which may in fact promote or in all likelihood promote ill-will or hatred between different communities.” “In the prima facie opinion of this court, looking to the fact that the applicant is a senior teacher in a college and a head of department, conduct of this kind prima facie does not entitle him to the indulgence of anticipatory bail,” the court added. An application for anticipatory bail was filed on behalf of the applicant, Dr Ali, in connection with case crime no. 124 of 2021, under Section 505(2) of Indian Penal Code (IPC) and section 67A I.T. Act at Ramgarh police station in Firozabad district. Section 505 (2) provides punishment for statement creating or promoting enmity, hatred or ill-will between classes. It was submitted by the counsel for the applicant that he had been falsely implicated in the instant crime, at the instance of the informant, who is a zila mantri of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), on account of animosity. It is urged that the applicant is a professor in a degree college and head of the history department. It was further argued that the objectionable and obscene post regarding the Union cabinet minister had been done through a hacking of his Facebook ID, regarding which, he has expressed his apologies and also disowned the post. It was also argued that the applicant is a respectable man with no criminal history and is, therefore, entitled to be enlarged on anticipatory bail, in the event of arrest. On the other hand, the state counsel vehemently opposed the prayer for bail. He submitted that the post carried an obscene comment about a minister in the Central government and a senior leader of a political party, which is a statement made and circulated on the social media containing a rumour likely to promote hatred or ill will behaviour between different religious groups, an act punishable under Section 505(2) IPC. Further, the applicant, being a responsible and a senior teacher in a college and a head of department ought to have been cautious in writing a comment of the kind under consideration. It was also submitted by the state counsel that the applicant is not entitled to anticipatory bail, considering his conduct. Rejecting the plea of the applicant, the court said, “The question whether the applicant did actually post the offending and obscene post regarding the minister is to be prima facie accepted at this stage, as there is no material to show that the applicant’s account was, in fact, hacked. Rather, the applicant has posted his apology on that account, which shows that the account is prima facie still being operated by him. It is also apparent that this post was shared by co-accused in the crime, one Huma Naqvi.” However, the court made it clear that it is not an expression of opinion on the merits of the case. The court directed that the applicant is entitled to surrender and seek regular bail, which shall be considered in accordance with law. “In the entirety of the circumstances, this court does not find it to be a fit case to grant anticipatory bail,” said the court adding, that if the applicant surrenders before the court concerned, his bail application shall be considered expeditiously and in accordance with law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-denies-pre-arrest-bail-toprof-for-fb-slur-against-irani/articleshow/82986966.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey

Now, he is free to come and perform puja at the mutt.” Talking to TOI, Narendra Giri said, “I would talk to the Panch Parmeshwar of the Niranjani Akhara to forgive him (Anand Giri) and take him back.” Earlier this month, Anand Giri was expelled from the Panchayati akhara for keeping close contact with his family against traditions of a sanyasi as well as for alleged misuse of funds of the Baghambari Mutt and Bade Hanuman temple. The dispute between the guru and disciple escalated and their differences grew as Anand Giri levelled several serious allegations against Narendra Giri. He also wrote to the Prime Minister, Home Minister and CMr seeking a CBI probe into the death of secretary of the akhara, Ashish Giri whose bloodstained body with gunshot injury was found in the ashram at Daraganj in November 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/day-after-expelling-yoga-guru-pardons-disciple-anand/articleshow/82986901.cms||---

Maharashtra has registered less than 25,000 for three consecutive days, but smaller districts and non-metro areas continue to drive the Covid graph of the state. Maharashtra reported 24,752 cases and 453 deaths on Wednesday taking total caseload to 56.5 lakh. Total toll rose to 91,341 with 539 previous deaths added to the cumulative number. In Mumbai, total caseload breached the seven-lakh mark. Daily detections shot up to 1,352 on Wednesday, from 1,029 on Tuesday and 1,049 on Monday, on increased testing. While 29,589 tests were done for Wednesday's tally, the numbers were 20,990 and 21,947 on Tuesday and Monday respectively. Mumbai's Dharavi area reported three cases on Wednesday, the lowest since February 11, when two were reported. On April 8, Dharavi had reported 99 on a single day which was the highest. Total cases reported from Dharavi so far have been 6,798. “As the tests went up, the cases rose. The problem with Mumbai is its thick tail (incidence at the end of the wave). Due to high population density in Mumbai, the number of cases will take a long time to drop below 500 a day,” said Dr Rahul Pandit, who heads the ICU wing in Fortis Hospital and is a member of the state government's task force on Covid-19. Dr Ramesh Bharmal, dean of BMC-run Nair Hospital, said there are roughly 200 patients in the hospital, with over half in the ICU. “We have had to add another ward for post-Covid patients coming in with fungal infection mucormycosis from other parts of the state,” said Dr Bharmal. There are roughly 2,000 mucormycosis cases in Maharashtra. Districts like Ahmednagar, Solapur, Satara, Kolhapur, Buldhana and Pune are adding more cases than Mumbai.

Municipal commissioner Dr Vipin Sharma said TMC has administered around 3.5 lakh doses of Covaxin and Covishield, although the government had supplied 3.4 lakh doses since January 2021.

Abhishek is son of SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav’s younger brother Rajpal Yadav. His mother Prem Lata had also been Zila Panchayat chairperson of Etawah. In 2015, Abhishek was elected Zila Panchayat chairman of Etawah unopposed. “After Anshul won district development council (DDC) member election from Saifai ward II in Etawah recently, a proposal in this connection was mooted in the meeting of district office-bearers. On Tuesday, the party high command gave its final nod in this regard,” Yadav added. There are a total 24 DDC members in Etawah who will elect the chairman of Zila Panchayat. The seat has remained with the Yadav family since the past 20 years. Mulayam’s cousin and sitting Rajya Sabha MP Ramgopal Yadav also held this seat in the past. “We are contacting other elected DDC members to support Abhishek,” a senior office-bearer said. In the recently concluded panchayat elections, Abhishek had defeated his nearest rival, BJP-backed Avneesh Yadav with a margin of 16,254 votes. While Abhishek had secured 22,610 votes, Avneesh polled 6,356 votes. Abhishek, a management graduate, had worked for the party in several assembly and Lok Sabha elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/sp-to-field-mulayams-nephew-for-zila-panchayat-chairman-post/articleshow/82985971.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

Hindalco is the world’s largest aluminium rolling company and among the biggest producers of primary aluminium in Asia. CEO of Hindalco-Renukoot N Nagesh and HR head Satish Anand handed over the oxygen concentrators to district magistrate Abhishek Singh and CMO Dr. Nem Singh on Tuesday. While 10 oxygen concentrators will be given to the Sonbhadra district hospital, Myorpur and Dudhi CHCs each will get five concentrators. Besides, Babhani CHC will get three concentrators and the rural hospital will get two oxygen concentrators. Nagesh said that Hindalco had already established an oxygen generation plant at the district hospital, which started production on May 4 and is producing 45 litres of oxygen per minute. With the revival of the Karahiya plant now 300 cylinders of oxygen are being refilled and supplied to public and private hospitals in different corners of southern UP, such as Mirzapur, Shaktinagar and Robertsganj. It is also sending oxygen to hospitals and industrial units based in Singrauli (MP). The 140-bedded Sonbhadra district hospital is being able to use the oxygen generated at its own plant. As the second wave of Covid-19 hit the country, the Sonbhadra district administration requested Hindalco to come forward to help in this battle. Hindalco responded by first setting up an oxygen generation plant in the district hospital and then ensuring the revival of the oxygen plant at Karahiya. At Renukoot, Hindalco is continuously working to stem the tide of Covid. The 150-bed Hindalco Hospital at Renukoot, staffed by 35 doctors and 140 paramedical staff, has 60 beds to treat Covid-19 patients. The hospital has provision for six ICU beds and 15 centralised oxygen beds. The plant administration has also set up a 56-bed Covid Isolation Centre and there are four ambulances to ferry patients. He said that the Hindalco management is also distributing food packets and ration packets to the needy on regular basis. Responding to the request of the district administration, the management will provide 2,000 medicine kits for the distribution in rural areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/under-csr-hindalco-gifts-25-oxygen-concentrators-to-sonbhadra-admin/articleshow/82986016.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Paediatricians emphasize on training staff, infra ahead of Covid third wave||Prayagraj: Predicting that the third wave of Covid-19 is likely to attack children mainly, paediatricians have started taking up measures in advance and are preparing to face the challenge of providing timely care to children in case the third wave does harm kids predominantly. Paediatricians, however, added that the possible predominant childhood diseases in children are likely due to the unvaccinated status of children less than 18 years of age and hence their naive immunity, highly mutagenic nature of the virus is the next big area of exploration in aetiology (study of the cause of diseases). Noted paediatrician, Dr Surabhi Chandra told TOI that there are certain unique features when it comes to the care of children due to which building or boosting infrastructure alone might not alone suffice. She added that there are subtle signs in children accompanied by the major symptoms of any disease and given the inability in infants and younger children in articulating the issues they are facing, prescribing medicines becomes a task. Dependency on parents for feeding, emotional support and care, makes it mandatory to have at least one attendant who can stay with the patient throughout, besides medical and paramedical staff. Besides, the limited number of faculties and residents trained in assessing and managing the children (including writing prescriptions which mandate each drug, each infusion to be made in terms of per kg body weight and ensuring adequate drug delivery over a specified period. The key to successful management of the third wave will hence depend not only on the availability of adequate infrastructure but also on well-trained doctors and staff. This is the need of the hour and for that training programs should be aimed at teaching recognition of subtle signs and their interpretation is a must. Dr Chandra, who is also an associate professor, further said that procedural skill-based training of residents and nursing staff should also be done. Charts mentioning vital signs in different age groups, doses of common drugs and their administration, as well as paediatric basic (BLS) and Advanced Life Support (PALS) algorithms should be prepared and kept handy in the paediatric wards and ICUs. Infrastructure should be tailored keeping in mind the care of the paediatric patients. She claimed that just giving half the adult dose does not always work. There is also the requirement of a large number of consumables since even a moderately sick child may require 2-3 infusions ongoing at a time. Round the clock meticulous clinical monitoring, which might not be possible just by placing a child on monitors, different age-wise cut-offs, management norms and ventilator settings. "Prevention is the mainstay and parents should be very cautious. They should get themselves vaccinated and avoid even casual exposure to children," said Dr Chandra. In the second wave, paediatric cases are 1 per cent to 5 per cent of the total affected population across the country. Though most of them are asymptomatic or have mild illness and mortality is low, illness can take more serious forms as well. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome-Covid-19 (MISC) seen almost exclusively in the paediatric age group, may not necessarily present in the acute phase of Covid-19 illness. It may occur even after the child has become Covid negative and can have potentially fatal outcomes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/paediatricians-emphasize-on-training-staff-infra-ahead-of-covid-third-wave/articleshow/82986400.cms||---

Under this drive, the men in khaki will visit the places of each and every criminal to verify their details. The policemen will carry the digital dossier of criminals in their smartphone by downloading the app which is being developed. The commissioner of police A Satish Ganesh said, “We have digitised the records of 157 killers, 51 dacoits, 380 looters, five kidnappers, 518 burglars, 1,164 vehicle lifters, 153 chain snatchers and 338 gangsters. These are the records of those criminals who have remained active in crime world in past five years. Their entire criminal history and personal details have been uploaded with their latest photographs in digital form.” The verification of all these criminals has been started by the police stations concerned by sending police teams at the places of each of the criminals, he said adding that, with the beginning of verification of criminals the process of developing an app is also in progress. This app will be downloaded by the policemen on their phones with given login ID and password, he added. The CP said that as the criminals are changing their style of operation with technological developments, new system for tracking them is also being developed accordingly. This ‘Operation Dastak’ will be conducted in three phases. In initial phase, policemen will reach the place of each criminal for documentation, he said mentioning, this move will build psychological pressure on them. It will be followed by effective action against them, he said adding that with the progress in this operation further details on more professional criminals will be included and updated on this app.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/kashi-cops-launch-operation-dastak-to-keep-check-on-criminals/articleshow/82986113.cms||---

Demand is being made to rehabilitate the animals.Call it lockdown effect, passers-by have been frequently sighting deer during the night on Katol Road and inside the Kamptee Cantonment military land firing range, which has turned into a dense forest over the years.Stray dogs have attacked these deer on several occasions. On some occasions, the herbivores have ventured into nearby apartments causing a flutter. On July 4, 2020, a male spotted deer which had strayed into Manjira Colony, Gittikhadan, died of shock during a rescue operation.Social activist Shashank Gattewar was surprised to spot a big herd of animals crossing the Katol road at 2.30am on Wednesday. “Of late, a flock of deer has been sighted frequently during the night. The military area is not fenced. Stray cattle graze inside and feral dogs are lurking danger to the herbivores,” said Gattewar.“The deer is listed under Schedule-III of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, and is the property of the forest department. There is an urgent need to rehabilitate them either in the adjoining Gorewada reserve forest. These animals can be also displayed at the newly-opened Balasaheb Thackeray International Zoological Park,” said Gattewar.Former divisional manager of Gorewada Rescue Centre Nandkishore Kale said, “The deer have been residents of the military landscape for long. We have rescued injured deer on some occasions. The area outside has good tree cover and bushes and there is a nullah too. It has become a good breeding ground for these deer.”According to Gorewada RFO Pandurang Pakhale, it is quite possible that when the work on Gorewada compound wall was completed in 2013, this small population that strayed out of the forest must have remained out and have bred there. “Deer straying out of Gorewada forest to another side during the night is very common,” he said.P Kalyan Kumar, chief conservator of forest (CCF), Nagpur Circle, told TOI that neither the issue was brought to his notice nor there were any complaints from people. “When any area is inhibited by wild animals, jurisdiction is not an issue. Our team will keep a watch and see how to go about it,” he said.“The first step will be to enumerate the population and see whether the deer can be safely driven away towards Gorewada forest. If not we will need to translocate the deer as a last resort,” said Kumar. The top official said deserted roads due to lockdown and local habitat must have driven the big herd of chitals to the city limits.Residents told TOI that the deer are residents of the military land for long and now their numbers have increased.

The state has surpassed last year’s case tally of 19.32 lakh to reach 36.69lakh, but overall confirmed deaths so far this year (39,691) continue to be less than last year’s 49,521. Of the 21 districts that bucked this trend, 11 had more than 100% rise in deaths. Chandrapur in the Vidarbha region registered a near three-fold rise in deaths as cases rose from 23,245 last year to 61,390 this year. From 389, deaths this year increased to 949. Case fatality rate has dipped though from 1.55%. Not too far away in Amravati, believed to be the starting point of the second wave, deaths rose from 381 to 951 in the second wave as positive cases trebled to touch 66,351. Other districts with similar rise in fatality numbers are Sindhudurg, Washim, Gondia, Wardha, Nanded, Hingoli, Parbhani. Former dean of KEM Hospital Dr Avinash Supe, who heads the MMR’s death audit committee, said numbers do indicate that some districts have been hit hard as deaths continue to mount. “Many districts like Amravati are seeing two waves, one of cases followed by a wave of deaths. There is a gap of 2-3 weeks between the two. Worryingly, some of the districts are still simmering,” he said. A senior BMC doctor told TOI that the state must not rejoice a lower CFR since the virus has not yet run its course. The state’s CFR in the second wave is 1.08% compared to 2020’s 2.56%. “The drop in deaths in the mega cities such as Mumbai, Pune, Thane and Nagpur has pulled down the state CFR, but smaller and neglected districts have been hit hard,” he said. In Mumbai, where cases have grown from 2.93lakh to 4.04lakh, deaths have dropped from 11,116 to 3,497. Similarly, in Thane, deaths dropped from 5,577 to 2,385 and Pune from 7,767 to 3,730. A Gadchiroli official said medical knowhow in cities has not percolated to the rest of the state. For the third wave, Dr Bang has suggested that communities and villages should be empowered to manage coronavirus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/11-districts-in-maharashtra-record-over-100-rise-in-deaths/articleshow/82992518.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The collection was high as many defaulters cleared their outstanding dues under the one-time settle scheme launched in December, said an official. Of the total 3.77 lakh registered water consumers in the city, 2,91,604 paid their bills in 2020-21. Residents of Satranjipura, Lakadganj and Ashi Nagar zones had the highest number of water tax defaulters. As many as 18,492 consumers in Satranjipura zone have defaulted on their water dues, followed by Ashi Nagar (16,324) and Lakadganj (10,190).The statistics revealed that as against the demand of Rs10.70 crore, Laxmi Nagar zone mopped up Rs10.93 crore while the Dharampeth mopped up Rs11.02 crore against a demand of Rs10.93 crore.Yet, 3,198 of the total 34,944 consumers from Laxmi Nagar zone and 7,164 of 37,703 consumers from Dharampeth zone defaulted on their water bills in the last financial year, as per the data.Recovery of water bills was also on the higher side in Dhantoli, Nehru Nagar and Gandhibagh zones. In all the three zones, the civic body recovered more than 100% of the demand. As against Rs 4.17 crore demand, the Dhantoli zone recovered Rs4.34 crore. Similarly, Nehru Nagar zone recovered Rs8.52 crore and Gandhibagh zone Rs 5.25 crore against the demand of Rs8.35 crore and Rs4.23 crore, respectively. Here too the recoveries increased due to one-time settlement scheme, as per the official.The recovery from bulk consumers was also satisfactory. Against Rs 80.87 crore demand from 19,061 consumers, the NMC generated Rs 77.10 crore from 16,730 consumers.The official claimed that the NMC will be launching a disconnection drive against the consumers who have defaulted on their water bills from the last fiscal year. The official expressed hope that the drive will increase the NMC’s revenue from the water bills.Sources, however, pointed out that the non-revenue water is also high in the city. It is almost 50% of the total 650 MLD water the city pumps from Kanhan river and Pench reservoir.ZONE-WISE DATAZone--——————-Defaulters--———Demand ————PaymentLaxmi Nagar--- ———-3,198--—————-10.7 ---———-10.9Dharampeth--————-7,164--—————-10.9--————-11Hanuman Nagar--———2,769--—————8.8--————8.8Dhantoli--——————-2,655--————4.17--————4.34Nehru Nagar--————7,478--————-8.35--————8.52Gandhibagh--————8,761--—————4.93--————5.25Satranjipura--————18,492--—————6.54--———-6.32Lakadganj--————-10,190--—————8.24--————8.98Ashi Nagar--————16,324--—————6.57--————7.34Mangalwari--————-6,701--—————7.15--————7.44Bulk consumers--———2,331--————-80.8--————77.10(Demand and payment in Rs crore)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ots-scheme-spurs-water-bills-collection-to-rs156cr/articleshow/82985325.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Milk of compassion overflows for newborn who never saw his mum||MUMBAI: The recent birth of a premature baby seconds before his Covid-positive mother died of a cardiac arrest at Kingsway Hospital in Nagpur is seen as a miracle in more ways than one. The birth was a medical feat as doctors performed an emergency special perimortem Cesarean section on the mother, Minal Vernekar (32), to save the baby. This was followed by a wave of compassion from lactating women who reached out to offer their breast milk as the baby Ivaan—a name chosen by Minal—is allergic to infant formula. The father, Thane resident Chetan Vernekar (32) who is employed with a private firm, told TOI he and his family had no words to express for this selfless gesture of strangers. “My family and I are filled with immense gratitude for the new mothers who contacted us in Nagpur after they learned of the death of my wife in the 32nd week of her pregnancy on April 8. Since our baby is allergic to formula milk, the ladies regularly supplied us with their own breast milk. It is only because of this humane act that our child survived and has now been discharged from hospital,” said Chetan. Minal, an HR consultant, was in Nagpur to be with her parents during her pregnancy when she contracted Covid-19 and had to be hospitalised. Chetan’s sister, Shanoo Prasad, said, “After the baby came home with his dad to Thane, we had to again search for milk. A Facebook group called Breastfeeding Support for Indian Women, founded by Adhunika Prakash, came forward to help us. Lactation consultant Camilla Conti selflessly guided me on how to use the received mother’s milk for the baby. Someone had also posted about our situation on Twitter, following which we received several calls from people who wanted to help the premature baby. We are overwhelmed by this milk of compassion.” Insurance employee Nayaah Bedi took to Twitter to seek breast milk for Ivaan. Bedi told TOI: “A contact from Delhi had first called to inform me about this premature baby who has been shifted to Thane and requires mother’s milk as his own mom had passed away. The moment I put up this message online, I was profoundly shocked to receive over 100 replies within minutes from those wanting to help out. I realised then that social networking sites can make a big difference in a good way.” Prasad said, “In Nagpur, a kind man, Sunit Narayane, picked up the milk from donor mothers and transported it daily for the baby for more than a month. Advocate Bhumika and mothers Aashi Gupta, Aswari Ratnaparki and Niddhi Hiranandani Parmar there helped us immensely without bothering about their own safety during these tough Covid times. We can never forget this,” said Prasad. Prasad said Minal loved children. “It is ironic that she could not see her own baby as coronavirus destroyed her, as it has across the globe. We have also seen kindness and compassion emerge from this situation,” she added. Currently, the family is busy arranging for milk from various donors in Mumbai and Thane. “There is one lady in Borivli, another, Neha from Mahim, and Shagun, mother of a one-month-old from Jogeshwari, who have been sending us milk. Experts say when a mother pumps out more milk, an equal amount is soon produced in her, which is a marvel of the human body. We thank everyone who has supported us in recent days,” said Prasad. The family has requested milk donors to contact them on 9137902749.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/milk-of-compassion-overflows-for-thane-newborn-who-never-saw-his-mum/articleshow/82989271.cms||Vijay Singh
---||Mumbai||Raze century-old shaky Fort bldg if needed in Mumbai: HC to BMC||Mumbai: The Bombay high court on Tuesday directed the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to take necessary steps for “immediate demolition, if necessary” of a more than a century-old dilapidated building in Fort, where a wall crashed during the recent Cyclone Tauktae. A single-judge bench of Justice M S Karnik, at the virtual hearing, was shown a ‘mishap’ report of the BMC, dated May 18, which said that the third floor front wall of the ground-plus three-storey Sarosh building, a non-cessed property, had collapsed on May 17. The building is located on D N Road under which the underground Metro Line 3 passes. Counsel Karl Tamboly with advocate Tushar Goradia for the landlord, Pravin Jain, submitted that the entire building has been vacated. Tamboly also said Jain was willing to bear expenses for the demolition. The BMC’s mishap report said that a call was received on May 17 and “immediately the site was jointly inspected by BMC and MMRCL staff’’. “To avoid any possible loss of human life, the front side of D N Road is closed for vehicular movement,” the report added. On Monday, the BMC wrote to the court receiver, who had been appointed in 2019 in a dispute between one of the commercial occupants Advance Commercial Co Ltd and the landlord, to look into the matter urgently given the “precarious condition” of the building. The BMC asked the receiver to consider public safety by directing Jain to take “precautionary measures and safeguard the building within 48 hours”. Mamta Sadh, counsel for Advance Commercial, submitted that despite repair permissions granted earlier, the “landlord did not take steps to carry out any repairs and purposely allowed things to come to a situation where the building requires demolition’’. The HC said it had liberty to take steps for this aspect in law. The HC further said that in view of the mishap report filed in court and considering the landlord’s willingness to foot the demolition bill, the BMC is directed to take necessary steps, including immediate demolition if necessary. The lawyers submitted and the HC accepted that if the BMC requires any assistance from the landlord and occupants, necessary cooperation would be extended.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/raze-century-old-shaky-fort-bldg-if-needed-in-mumbai-hc-to-bmc/articleshow/82989244.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Corporators push for maximum jabs for locals||MUMBAI: Several corporators who have got the BMC to start vaccination centres in their respective wards are ensuring maximum local residents get the jabs on the three days when walk-in is allowed. Currently, the BMC allows walk-in vaccination on three days of the week—Monday to Wednesday—only for senior citizens, lactating mothers and those aged above 45 years who have to be administered the second vaccine dose. Kalina corporator Tulip Miranda said the purpose of pursuing the BMC to start a vaccination centre within their ward was solely to benefit local residents. “I daily send out detailed messages on the number of vaccine doses that the BMC allocates to the centre. I am also following up with the BMC to allocate a session, if possible, for any infirm person who may be above 18 years old,” said Miranda. Atul Shah, BJP corporator, too, said for the Madhav Baug vaccination centre at C P Tank, he sends out a detailed message on WhatsApp mentioning the timing, number of doses allocated for senior citizens and 45-plus and informs them on how the second dose can be taken only after completion of 84 days of the first dose. “This ensures that residents of my area are well informed about the centre and whether they can walk in or not,” said Shah. Meanwhile, Mumbadevi MLA Amin Patel said they have been sending volunteers to homes of local residents, telling them to come to the vaccination centre on days when walk-in vaccinations are allowed. “The BMC, though, should keep its rules the same for at least a week on who is eligible to be vaccinated. Frequent changes in rules create confusion. Currently, as the gap between the first and second dose has been extended, the number of those who are awaiting their second dose has reduced considerably,” said Patel. Matunga corporator Nehal Shah said the BMC should now open up vaccination for all age groups due to the extended gap. “There are fewer people who are currently eligible for the second dose. In such a case, why waste man and machinery at a centre? Instead, allow anyone wanting to take the vaccine to walk in,” said Shah, adding she is currently extending all help to locals in the ward so that they benefit at least during the three walk-in days. The corporators said while they are still seeing those from other areas walk in during the three days, though the numbers have considerably reduced.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-corporators-push-for-maximum-jabs-for-locals/articleshow/82987429.cms||Richa Pinto

Also, according to sources, the weapon recovered from the accused might have been used in a day light robbery of Rs 1.33 crore from a cash van by six armed robbers near a private university on Banur Rajpura Road in 2017. Police had identified the four gangsters as Jaipal Singh Bhullar of Ferozepur, Baljinder Singh Babbi of Mahlla Khurd in Moga, Jaspreet Singh alias Jassi Kharar of Civil Hospital Road in Kharar and Darshan Singh of Sahauli village in Ludhiana. They had also arreseted six — Gurpreet Singh of Dhaleke in Moga, his wife Ramanpreet Kaur Raman, Satpal Kaur Noni wife of the accused Darshan Singh, Gagandeep Singh Nanna of Sahauli, Nanakchand Singh Nanak of same area and Jaspreet Singh of Abuwal currently living in Atam Nagar Jagraon — for allegedly harbouring offenders.Crime investigating agency (CIA) officials of Ludhiana rural police said based on the information given by Noni, wife of Darshan, while questioning her, they found opium hidden in the fodder room of a cattle shed.

---||Goa||Goa is past peak, but can’t slack off: State epidemiologist||PANAJI: The state epidemiologist has said that Goa has crossed the peak of the second wave of Covid-19, but that there’s no place for complacency till cases dip below 200 a day. While daily new infections have fallen from the 4,195 cases recorded on May 7, the positivity rate remains high, at 32%. “Cases have definitely come down and the second wave is falling. We have crossed the peak but at this stage, people should not get complacent,” Dr Utkarsh Betodkar told TOI. During the first peak last September, the state touched a peak of 740 cases in a day, but from that point, it took more than a month for the graph to show a substantial descent, and for the daily average of new infections to fall below 200. Betodkar said that although the wave is falling, he does not see cases dropping below 200 so soon. While cases have dipped, a marked drop in mortalities is yet to be seen. “Even during the first wave, a while after cases started decreasing, fatalities (also) began reducing.” “It was two to three weeks after the cases started dropping that the casualties started reducing. So, we will see critical cases coming down two to three weeks later,” he said. Goa continues to report 30-40 Covid mortalities daily. May has been the deadliest month for Goa. More than half of the total 2,500 deaths since the pandemic started have happened this month. May 12 saw 75 deaths, the highest ever recorded in a single day. As the number of cases remains high as do the fatalities, Betodkar said that people will have to continue to follow all the precautions they are taking now. Measures such as restrictions on movement of people and closure of non-essential services are in force till the end of this month. So far, the government hasn’t given any hint if non-essential services will be allowed to re-open after May 31. “We don’t know what activities will be allowed after May 31,” he said. “But looking at the number of infections, we cannot ignore precautions. Currently, people are indoors and stepping out only if needed and in emergencies. We should continue this for longer even if restrictions are lifted.” He also said that gatherings shouldn’t be allowed for some time. More importantly, by the end of this year, 60-70% of the state’s population will have to get vaccinated. The 45-plus population and all those who have comorbidities should get vaccinated without delay, he said. “If you see the death chart, 70-75% of people who die after contracting the virus had diabetes. Anyone who has diabetes should get vaccinated immediately,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-is-past-peak-but-cant-slack-off-state-epidemiologist/articleshow/82987432.cms||Bindiya Chari
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Timelines set for oxygen makers’ sops||Mumbai: The state government has set timelines for manufacturers of liquid medical oxygen to avail of its incentives. With a third wave of Covid expected in 4-5 months and experts warning it is likely to be worse than the second, government is aiming to ramp up production by 1,000MT per day within a year. The state manufactures 1,300MT, while the requirement is 1,800MT, and demand is likely to go up by 500MT. A GR on May 21, but uploaded on the government website on May 25, said those interested must submit applications to the development commissioner by June 30. MSME manufacturing units with fixed capital investment of Rs 50 crore are eligible for the incentives, provided it goes into production prior to March 31, 2022. Similarly, a 25MT plant will need to go into production prior to December 31, 2021, whereas those planning to generate 50MT and more will need to go into production by June next year.

US biotech company Dyadic has tied up with Bangalore-based Syngene, a subsidiary of Biocon, to develop a Covid vaccine that can protect against the emerging variants of concern, and be manufactured affordably at a large scale. The vaccine will be developed using Dyadic’s proprietary C1-cell protein production platform. Dyadic is developing what it believes will be a potentially significant biopharmaceutical gene expression platform, based on the fungus Thermothelomyces heterothallica or C1. The C1 microorganism has the potential to be further developed into a safe and efficient expression system that may help speed up the development, lower production costs and improve the performance of biologic vaccines and drugs at flexible commercial scales. Mark Emalfarb, Dyadic’s founder and chief executive officer, said “If successful, such vaccines can be manufactured rapidly and affordably, in very large quantities. Our collaboration with Syngene is an appropriate follow-up to our partnership with Medytox in Korea and southeast Asia, and we continue to explore similar arrangements in other geographies to help bring high volume, low-cost, next generation vaccine and drug manufacturing to parts of the world that need these resources most urgently.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/us-desi-company-tie-up-to-develop-vaaccine-that-can-fight-emerging-variants/articleshow/82991757.cms||Rupali Mukherjee

---||Goa||Goa: Use Rs 100 crore of Liberation Day bounty to compensate kin of Covid victims, ask Mauvin Godinho||PANAJI: Transport minister Mauvin Godinho said that he has asked chief minister Pramod Sawant to provide compensation to the kin of Goans who have succumbed to Covid-19. Godinho said he has suggested that at least Rs 100 crore should be utilised from the Rs 300 crore granted to Goa by the Centre to celebrate the 60th year of Goa’s Liberation. “This is my personal opinion. The government should adopt this suggestion,” Godinho said. “A majority of the people who have lost their lives to Covid are from the poor segment. Some ex-gratia payment should be given to the victims. At times, the economic position may seem good, but in reality their families may be suffering from financial issues. So the government has to reach out to them. I have informed this to the chief minister,” said Godinho. He said Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has granted the state Rs 300 crore to celebrate Goa’s 60th Liberation year, when the state had only sought and was expecting to receive Rs 100 crore. “To our surprise, we received Rs 300 crore. We can spend at least Rs 100 crore of the amount on providing compensation. Those who have become victim have to get compensation. I have told this to the chief minister. I am sure that the cabinet will make the money available to the people,” said Godinho. Godinho said he would be attending the 43rd meeting of the GST council under Sitharaman via video conferencing on May 28. He said he would be raising the issue of compensation to kin of Covid victims at the GST council meet as well. “I have been fighting for one thing which till date has not been rectified that smaller states like Goa, Himchal Pradesh and North Eastern states should be getting quicker relief than bigger states. There is hardly any avenue for smaller states to increase taxes or broaden the base of taxation,” said Godinho. The state transport minister also said that he is in favour of allowing taxi operators in Goa to increase their fare as there has been an increase in fuel prices. “Some are saying we will fix the meters only after fares are increased, but both things are not related. I am happy that they have taken a stand publically to not oppose the fitment of digital meters. It is the decision of the high court and they cannot oppose it either,” said Godinho. He said he is in favour of allowing taxis to allow dynamic pricing. “Hotels are also increasing pricing during peak season. We should see if we can allow dynamic pricing to taxi operators. Dynamic pricing is followed all over the world. It is done even by airlines by increasing fares during peak season,” said Godinho.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/use-rs-100-crore-of-l-day-bounty-to-compensate-kin-of-covid-victims-mauvin/articleshow/82987437.cms||---

The commission, which has issued modalities for receiving complaints, reply/comments, inquiry reports, etc via email, said that it would also not entertain any complaint if it was addressed/sent to some other authority and marked a copy to TSHRC. It said that only signed complaints (scanned and uploaded) should be sent to the commission. Every complaint should state the full facts relating to the matter complained against, specify particulars of the complainant, victim, and respondent, officials responsible, and authorities to redress the grievance, the commission added. Further, it said that the complainant should declare that the subject matter of the complaint or grievance was not sub judice before any court or tribunal, nor pending before a commission, and not covered by a judicial verdict or decision of any commission. The relief sought should also be mentioned clearly in the mail. While submitting a reply/comments, a signed reply by the complainant should be submitted along with point-to-point comments (admission or denial) along with documentary evidence, if any. For presenting enquiry reports/adjourning letters, an authority, from whom the report was called for, should submit a report, signed and sealed, and state full facts with supporting attested documents. During the pandemic, the commission started accepting, complaints, reply/comments, and reports via email apart from existing modes — in person and post. However, as modalities were not prescribed, complaints, reply/comments, and reports were sent without seal and signature, and at times it was used as a common chatting platform. To address these issues, modalities have been released.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/shrc-wont-accept-anonymous-plaints/articleshow/82987453.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Chief minister Vijay Rupani announced the revised curfew timings after a cabinet meeting in Gandhinagar on Wednesday. From Friday, the night curfew will be effective from 9pm to 6am in the 36 notified cities in the state, the CM said. The night curfew is presently from 8pm to 6am. “Covid-19 cases are decreasing in Gujarat. From nearly 14,600 new cases, the daily peak registered on April 30, about 3,200 cases are emerging every day now. Hence, we have decided to relax the night curfew. It will now be from 9pm to 6am,” Rupani said. A notification in this regard will be issued on Thursday, he said. Night curfew is currently enforced in 36 cities in the state, including Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara and Rajkot.

---||Ahmedabad||We cross all lines in the name of democracy, says Gujarat high court||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Wednesday said the state government should ramp up health infrastructure keeping in mind that there could be a third or even a fourth wave of coronavirus because people are not going to follow the rules regarding face mask, social distancing and sanitization. The division bench of Justices Bela Trivedi and Bhargav D Karia, while hearing a suo motu PIL on Covid-19 situation and other related issues in Gujarat, commented that all lines are crossed, and ‘everything is pardoned in the name of democracy’. It said that discipline like China is not possible here to curb Covid-19 spread. Therefore, the court said, the state government should ramp up its health infrastructure to deal with possible future waves. The court’s comment came while it was discussing the need to strengthen health infrastructure in rural areas keeping in mind longterm requirements and the need to inculcate discipline about following Covid protocols by public. Advocate general Kamal Trivedi tried to compare the situation in India and seven advanced countries combined, and pointed at the higher Covid casualties and suffering there. At this juncture the bench of Justice Bela Trivedi and Justice Bhargav Karia said, “You will have to compare with China only. It is incomparable. The discipline implemented in China cannot be implemented here.” The bench suggested ramping up health infrastructure. Advocate Trivedi then submitted, “Somebody has rightly said that we are paying the price for democracy.” He said communism in China could deal with the issue. The judges responded by saying, “In the name of democracy, we cross all lines, everything is pardoned.” At the end of the hearing, senior counsel Percy Kavina , who appears for the Gujarat High Court Advocates Association, raised the issue and said, “The cures for the ills of democracy is more democracy, not less. If democracy were not there, none of us would be here. We are here because of a democratic constitution. There should not be belittling of democracy.” To this the court clarified, “In the name of democracy also, things should not be misused.” Kavina further said, “Let us try to err on the side of freedom rather than totalitarianism.” Justice Trivedi ended the discussion saying, “Nobody is belittling it (democracy).” After hearing about the reduction in Covid-19 cases, the HC said, “There is a glimmer of hope seen that the situation has improved, however, it is too early to say anything on the trend of Covid-19 wave…the State should not remain complacent and should continue its endeavour to do its best to fight with the third wave as apprehended by the medical experts.” The court further said that in rural areas, there is a need to equip sub-centres, PHCs and CHCs with machines and manpower by appointing doctors and nursing staff on permanent basis. The court said, “It is expected that the state government shall take all necessary actions immediately with regard to the improvement of the health infrastructure in the rural areas as also for creating awareness amongst public at large of the mucormycosis disease and for making the policy of distribution of liposomal amphotericin B injections more transparent, specific and effective.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/we-cross-all-lines-in-the-name-of-democracy-hc/articleshow/82987481.cms||---

Not a single Covid orphan was identified from Mumbai and Aurangabad town, both of which have seen a large number of fatalities. Six were identified in Thane, 4 in Pune, 7 in Nagpur and 8 in Nashik. The highest of 12 was reported in Solapur. When asked about the low figure in Mumbai, a senior official said: “We are in the process of pooling cases from multiple sources.” In May, the Supreme Court’s Juvenile Justice Committee had discussed the need to form task forces in states for the care of Covid orphans, given the risks of exploitation, trafficking or child labour. The state has set up a task force headed by district collectors and including members from civic bodies, police, district law officer, health official and child welfare officials to identify orphans and monitor their care. “The Maharashtra government has always been sensitive to the needs of orphans and has schemes for reservations for them and non-institutional care. The task force for Covid-19 orphans will not only help in providing a care facility but will also address their legal rights over their parent’s property and mental health concerns,” said I A Kundan, principal secretary, women and child development department. Information on orphans and children who have lost one parent are being collated from multiple sources, including hospitals, police, gram panchayats, anganwadi workers and helplines. “Hospitals treating Covid patients are now recording who will take guardianship of their children,” said Kundan. The state checks if a relative comes forward to claim guardianship of the orphan before going through the child welfare committee to access institutional care. Officials have issued a strict warning against messages being circulated on social media for adoption of Covid orphans. “This carries the threat of trafficking. There is a well laid out legal procedure for adoption. Anyone who knows of a child in need of adoption should contact the Childline Helpline 1098 or the helpline of the state’s women and child development department, 7400015518 or 8308992222,” said Kundan. At the village level, anganwadi workers and state child welfare officials can be approached.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/mumbai-covid-orphaned-82-children-in-state-1964-lost-1-parent/articleshow/82996242.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

---||Ahmedabad||Diabetics form 59% of mucormycosis patients in Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: Analysis of the mucormycosis patients in Gujarat carried out by the state health department revealed that 59% of the total patients were diabetics, whereas 22% were immuno-compromised and 15% had co-morbid conditions. The number of diabetics out of 658 patients at Civil Hospital in Ahmedabad on the other hand was about 95%, said experts. The state government released the analysis of the cases – but did not reveal the numbers of total cases so far, or of deaths. The central government on Monday had declared 2,165 cases – the highest in the country – to be from Gujarat. The state government claimed deaths of 4% patients, putting the approximate figure of deaths at 87, which is much lower than the experts’ conservative estimate of 250-odd deaths due to the black fungus in Gujarat. Analysis by the state government claimed that 14.3% of the total patients have got discharged, whereas 81.6% of the total cases are currently hospitalized. The male to female ratio is 2:1, said officials, whereas 71% of the patients are above 45 years of age. Only 0.5% were below 18 years of age, 28.4% in 18-45 years and 46.3% 45-60 years age group. About half of the patients (49.5%) had taken steroid treatment whereas one-third were put on oxygen or assistive breathing during their Covid infection. Civil Hospital authorities said that out of 658 patients so far, 241 or 37% were from Ahmedabad, whereas all others were from other districts of Gujarat. “We have also got 15 patients from Madhya Pradesh, 12 from Maharashtra and eight from Rajasthan. We have also got patients with pre-existing conditions such as cancer, cardiac issues and renal failure, which are given both the treatments simultaneously,” said a senior official, adding that about 95% of the patients at the hospitals are diabetics. “An entire floor of surgical wards is dedicated to the mucormycosis patients as the hospital is carrying out over 20 surgeries daily. Early intervention can surely save lives. We are witnessing downward trend – but many patients operated at the private hospitals are now getting admitted due to shortage of medicines,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/diabetics-form-59-of-mm-patients-in-the-state/articleshow/82987485.cms||---

---||Delhi||Charkha stops spinning as Covid claims Delhi Gandhian Musaddilal Gupta||NEW DELHI: One of the last surviving Gandhians in the city, Musaddilal Gupta, 78, known for his passion for spinning yarn on the charkha and only wearing homespun clothes, lost his battle with the coronavirus on Monday. Influenced by Mahatma Gandhi's thoughts as early as his school days, Gupta, however, had to wait till after his retirement from government service to pursue his passion for spinning yarn on the charkha. A portable, box-type Bardoli charkha that Gandhi himself is said to have devised was a must anywhere Gupta went. Till just a few days before the lockdown was announced mid-April, Gupta could be seen regularly going to the Deer Park near his residence in south Delhi’s Safdarjung Enclave to spend a quiet time spinning yarn. “After making the cotton yarn, he sent them to Gram Sewa Mandal in Nalwadi village near Wardha, Maharashtra, set up by Vinoba Bhave in 1934. There it was woven. He got the woven cloth cut into kurtas that he himself was sewed by hand. He wished to weave cloth from the yarn he spun, but this desire could not be fulfilled,” said Kalpana Khandelwal, Gupta’s younger daughter-in-law. According to the family, Gupta had fever on May 1, but an RT-PCR test returned a negative result for Covid-19. “Some time later, he started developing Covid symptoms, but we were unable to find a bed in the city so took him to a private hospital in Alwar. There he was diagnosed positive for Covid with mild symptoms. He, whoever, suffered pneumonia and on May 24, lost his battle for life a day before his birthday on May 25,” said Khandelwal. Gupta had participated in various movements in the city over the years, including Anna Hazare’s India Against Corruption protests at Ramlila Maidan in 2011. At such rallies, Gupta used to make a statement not by shouting slogans but by silently turning the charkha. From 2011 to 2018, he also sat on a dharna at Jantar Mantar to stop cow slaughter and to stop the trade in beef, all the while spinning the charkha. “But after the government restricted protests at Jantar Mantar, he started going to Deer Park,” said his daughter-in-law. Gupta’s son, Umesh Khandelwal, said his father was a self-sufficient person and till his last days had been doing all work on his own. “He was a person with an influential and charismatic personality. As a member of a joint family of three sons, their spouses and six grandchildren, he loved the time he spent with each one,” said the son.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/charkha-stops-spinning-as-covid-claims-city-gandhian/articleshow/82985407.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Mulund housing society starts first Covishield vaccine drive||MUMBAI: Vaccination drives in housing societies is well and truly off the blocks with Mulund’s Atmosphere, one of the city’s largest housing complexes with around 720 flats, commencing the first one in the city with Covishield on Wednesday in association with Fortis Hospital. “We have vaccinated around 250 residents on the first day and the doorstep vaccination drive will continue on Thursday. We had informed all members in advance and the vaccination took place in a very smooth and hassle-free manner. We have charged each resident Rs 1,050 per dose for the doorstep vaccination,” said Raj Kulkarni, a resident who was coordinating the vaccination initiative. The vaccination drive is happening at an allocated space on the campus following BMC rules on setting up vaccine camps. Jabs are not being given going door-to-door as it has still not been allowed. “There are many senior citizens who would have struggled to stand in line for getting shots at crowded BMC vaccination centres or hospitals. With doorstep vaccination, these senior citizens got hassle-free vaccines,” said Kulkarni. Last Friday, Goregaon’s Gokuldham RBI Officers Quarters became the first housing society in Mumbai to hold a drive on campus, again with Fortis Hospital. Around 400 residents got Covaxin jabs. Next day, a Mulund society also got Covaxin shots. The drive was launched by Manoj Kotak, BJP MP from Mumbai North East. “We had demanded that the BMC allow doorstep vaccination campaign. Following our demand, a policy of doorstep vaccination was formulated and now it has started for Mumbaikars. It has already begun for people from clusters and in housing societies. We thank municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal for continuous cooperation and Fortis Hospital for extending support. Doorstep vaccination will not only benefit Mumbaikars with hassle-free vaccination but will also reduce the load on city vaccination centres,” said Kotak. “We have around 3,000 residents, many of them have already been vaccinated. We have registered around 650 residents so far for doorstep vaccination. We will finish this in two or three days. If there are more residents who sign up, we will have another round,” said Kulkarni. The Mumbai Central and Agripada Advanced Locality Management (ALM) will next week roll out the city’s first citizen-driven cluster vaccination for residents of their area. The ALM has tied up with Dr Reddy’s Laboratories who will supply the Russian-made Sputnik V vaccine. For administering the doses, the ALM has tied up with Wockhardt Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mulund-housing-society-starts-first-covishield-vaccine-drive-in-mumbai/articleshow/82989364.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Delhi||620 black fungus cases in Delhi, need more drugs: CM Arvind Kejriwal||NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday said the number of black fungus cases had increased to 620 in Delhi, but the medicine needed to treat the rare infection was not available. The rise in the number of mucormycosis cases in many parts of the country, including Delhi-NCR, has led to a spike in the demand of Amphortericin B injection, a key drug used in the treatment of this fungal infection. Health minister Satyendar Jain had earlier said the Centre was controlling the medicine of black fungus and giving it according to the state-wise quota. Times ViewThe shortage of a life-saving drug should not be the subject of another round of unhealthy squabbling between the Centre and the Delhi government. With so many lives at stake, a solution must be found immediately.“Day before yesterday and yesterday, we received around 400 doses, whereas in a day, one patient alone needs to be administered at least six injections of the medicine. So, if there are 600 patients, we need 3,500 injections daily, but are receiving only 400, which is leading to immense problems in its treatment,” Kejriwal said on Wednesday at the launch of the city’s first drive-through vaccination centre at Vegas Mall in Dwarka. In a press briefing, Jain said that on Sunday, more than 200 cases were reported, but on both Monday and Tuesday, less than 100 new cases were reported. Out of the around 600 black cases reported till now, nearly one-third patients are from outside Delhi, he added. “The quota of medicine allocated to Delhi is not enough, the number of patients is too high,” Jain said. “There is a huge shortage of medicine and we appeal that Delhi is given more medicines.” The minister said that getting around 400 doses meant 50 to 70 patients could be administered the injections. “The biggest problem is that the injection is not available at all.” All patients with the infection have battled Covid-19, too, and though in many cases, they have diabetes and were prescribed steroids for Covid treatment, it is not necessary that all of them have all three of these, Jain pointed out. The health minister said not all patients with black fungus had used steroids but all of them had Covid-19 and also had high blood sugar levels. He said uncontrolled blood sugar levels and low immunity were factors behind the fungal infection and it was important for Covid-19 patients to keep blood sugar under control. “Steroids do bring immunity down and most cases are of those who have been given steroids, too,” the minister said. Black fungus has emerged as a potentially life-threatening Covid complication that has prompted the Centre to ask states to declare the disease notifiable under the Epidemic Diseases Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/620-black-fungus-cases-in-delhi-need-more-drugs-cm/articleshow/82985426.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Delhi||Delhi: Differently-abled find helping hand in their struggle to book vaccination slots||NEW DELHI: For many disabled people, accessing the CoWin website is not an easy task. Those willing to get vaccinated have posted complaints on social media about how the website is not disabled-friendly and no assistance is provided to them. To provide them relief, an organisation called Rising Flame has come forward to not only help the disabled register, but also book slots on the website for them to get vaccinated. The initiative was launched on May 26 when the organisation realised that the CoWin website and app were not following accessibility guidelines. “Many visually challenged people posted on social media their bad experience of registering for the vaccine. Even if they managed to register, they had difficulty in finding the location of the vaccine centre. They faced problems at the centres too,” said Nidhi Goyal, founder and executive director of Rising Flame. The organisation has so far assisted over 50 people with disabilities with registration and getting them vaccination slots. “Many wanted their caregivers to accompany them, so we registered for them too,” added Goyal. The project was conceptualised on Global Accessibility Day, May 20. “We are facilitating access that the website should have provided. In fact, for the elderly and disabled they should have a different system. Several officials and organisations have written to the health ministry regarding this,” Goyal said. As the literacy rate of the disabled is low, the organisation has formed teams in Delhi, Mumbai, Thane and Navi Mumbai to help them. “We receive many queries and requests. Many also complain about lack of information. For example, when chief minister Arvind Kejriwal makes an announcement, there is no sign language interpreter for the disabled to get information. They also can’t read the documents published by the government,” said Goyal. The organisation has a helpline on which the disabled can call and send messages. Goyal said, “While it is easy to register, booking vaccination slots is difficult. The slots are usually available at bizarre timings. Moreover, the venue at times is far away and many people with disabilities are not comfortable travelling the distance.” Rising Flame started working during the pandemic last year where they focused on and surveyed domestic violence in India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/differently-abled-find-helping-hand-in-their-struggle-to-book-vaccination-slots/articleshow/82985449.cms||Mohammad Ibrar
---||Delhi||LGBTQ counsellor helps people fight the war with their minds||NEW DELHI: Kushal Roy is a member of the LGBTQ community, and like many others in the country, saw many deaths during the raging pandemic. He decided to provide free mental health counselling to those in distress, like people coping with a Covid death or a Covid warrior, even a Covid survivor. The 24-year-old’s work was recently recognised by former United States of America president Bill Clinton and his wife, the former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton. Roy had decided very early in life that he would become a mental health activist. He especially wanted to assist people with suicidal thoughts, to prevent the sort of pain he himself suffered when his best friend took his own life.  The lockdown has been a stressful time for many, and he has counselled many. He wishes to reach out to more and is holding more counselling sessions for those with mental health issues. “As an LGBTQ youth counsellor and a mental health activist, I have been trying to raise awareness about suicide prevention. This is especially important at a time when the coronavirus pandemic is accelerating, impacting lives and livelihoods and causing fear and anxiety among people,” said the youth. “Our non-profit organisation, You Are Enough, wants to break the stigma of mental health in society and shine a light on the positivity and support that can be available for everyone, such as sexual and gender minorities, women, ethnic minorities and individuals with disabilities, no matter their situation.” He smiled when he added, “I find no better time than this to be of help to others, May being the Mental Health Awareness Month and June being the Pride Month.” He is sure that epidemic of mental health will follow Covid-19. “This lockdown is going to be very hard for people who’re suffering from depression, suicidal thoughts and other mental health issues. It has caused people to enter a war with their own minds. Negative emotions like anxiety and depression can weaken the immune system,” he said. Roy said that now more than ever, it was time to wake up and realise that kindness cost nothing. “I was threatened, bullied and lived in anguish. I want none of that to happen with someone else. One shouldn’t ever be ashamed to see help. I can’t believe having regular therapist sessions/psychiatric check-ups isn’t as normalised as doctor’s visits. Is the mind not a part of your body?” he asked. The young man pointed out that in Indian society, there was a stigma attached to male mental health and emotional health. “The suicide rates among men is much higher due to the shame of seeking mental health support. Most men who kill themselves don't talk about their depression,” said Roy. "But mental illness and mental wellness don’t discriminate between genders. As a society we must make it easier for people to seek help. Remember it is okay to reach out for help. We all need support — some of us need it more".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lgbtq-counsellor-helps-people-fight-the-war-with-their-minds/articleshow/82985441.cms||Pankhuri Yadav
---||Ahmedabad||Make injection distribution more transparent, says Gujarat high court||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Wednesday asked the state government to spread awareness among people about mucormycosis and for “making the policy of distribution of liposomal amphotericin B injections more transparent, specific and effective”. The bench of Justice Bela Trivedi and Justice Bhargav Karia found the state government’s notification issued on May 19 about distribution of medicine for black fungus disease as not “very clear and specific”, and it insisted on forming an expert committee in every district for this purpose. To HC’s query on policy for distribution of remdesivir, teh state government informed the court that the policy adopted in this case is the same that was adopted for distribution of remdesivir - on basis of criticality of the case. The judges said that the notification issued on May 19 for distribution of medicine for black fungus was not specific and precise as to how distribution will take place in public hospitals. It talked about distribution to private hospitals only. "According to us, (the notification) is quite vague and defective," the court said and pointed out that the system has been devised for seven districts only where government hospitals have been named for distribution, and there was no clarity on formation of expert committee as well. The judges opined that that in order to systematize the distribution and to establish efficient and timebound system of distribution of Liposomal Amphotericin B injections to the needy during the time of shortage, “the policy must notify the authority/expert body constituted in each district, as also the procedure to be followed by the hospitals i.e. Government/Corporation/Private hospitals for the procurement of the said Liposomal Amphotericin B injections”. The HC also insisted, “The allocation made to the said hospitals and the usage of the said injections made by the hospitals also should be displayed on the website of the Health department. The concerned hospitals also should be made responsible to submit the reports regarding the usage of the said injections.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/make-injection-distribution-more-transparent-hc/articleshow/82987587.cms||---
---||Delhi||‘Lack of funds delays books for primary kids’||New Delhi: To help students at its primary schools pursue their studies, North Delhi Municipal Corporation claimed to have ordered textbooks worth Rs 4.5 crore. These will be distributed as soon as the lockdown is lifted.Mayor Jai Prakash said the order had been placed with Delhi Bureau of Text Books (DBTB) on April 6 along with an advance payment of Rs 4.4 crore after the Centre released Rs 6.9 crore.“After Delhi government failed to release even a single penny for education facilities such as textbooks, uniforms, school bags, notebooks under the plan head even last year, we approached the Union human resource ministry to release funds under Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan,” said the mayor.The books couldn’t be transported due to the lockdown, he added. “As soon as lockdown is lifted, we will streamline the distribution exercise. We are not getting out legitimate grants-in-aid leading to cash crunch, non-payment of salaries and delay in pending works in the health, sanitation and education sectors.The clarification came after an AAP leader on Tuesday blamed BJP-run corporations of depriving seven lakh primary students of books. AAP’s MCD in-charge, Durgesh Pathak, alleged that the corporations had not yet started the tendering process or begun procuring books for the 2021-22 session. “In 2020, the corporations had provided books after a delay of nine months and in 2019, after a delay of eight months,” he claimed.South Delhi Municipal Corporation also claimed to have pursued Delhi government for releasing funds related to education long time ago, but there had been no reply. “Delay in book distribution among school children studying in SDMC schools is not because of the civic body, but because of Delhi government as it has not released funds to DBTB,” said leader of house Narendra Chawla. A requisition was sent to DBTB on time but it has expressed inability citing delay in funds release by Delhi government, Chawla added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lack-of-funds-delays-books-for-primary-kids/articleshow/82985452.cms||---

A few locals, who noticed the encroachment, brought it to the notice of the Kapra corporator S Swarna Raj. Responding to the complaint, the corporator approached Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) Kapra officials along with photos and videos of the illegal construction and urged them to demolish it. “The century-old Kapra Lake, which is spread over nearly 100 acres, has already shrunk to nearly 80 acres due to encroachments. As a result, nearby colonies get inundated due to during rainy season. I asked the civic officials to inspect the lake and remove illegal structures,” the corporator told TOI. A representation was also sent to the civic body to protect the lake from encroachments, he added. When contacted, Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) deputy commissioner, Kapra circle, Shankar said, “It is true that an illegal structure has come up on the nala of Kapra Lake and local corporator alerted me. We will soon take up inspection, issues notices to the parties concerned and then demolish the compound wall.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/wall-comes-up-on-nala-of-kapra-lake/articleshow/82987507.cms||---

That is a critical drug to treat mucormycosis or black fungus. Under the terms of the agreement, TLC will manufacture and supply liposomal amphotericin B (AmphoTLC) on a non-exclusive basis to Zydus Cadila. The Ahmedabad-based pharmaceutical company will market this critical drug in India.

---||Patna||Unplanned pregnancies, unsafe abortions on the rise in Bihar||PATNA: Covid-19 pandemic has hit women hard when it comes to their reproductive health. The pandemic has led to rise in number of unplanned pregnancy and unsafe abortion cases, putting health of women at risk. A study has also revealed that several women had to compromise abortion due to the pandemic. City-based obstetricians and gynaecologists too said some patients approached them after trying unsafe abortions at home. Consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at Arvind Hospital, Dr Neelam, said the number of such cases increased manifold during the pandemic. “We used to get such cases even before the pandemic. However, the number increased during pandemic,” Dr Neelam said, adding pills for terminating pregnancy are easily available at medicine shops. “In most cases, men buy these pills from medicine shops without consulting doctors and give the same to their wives,” she added. Dr Neelam said cases of unplanned pregnancy have also increased as several couples are staying together due to the pandemic. “Use of contraceptives and other methods to prevent pregnancy is still considered a myth and male partner does not care for these,” she said. Patna Menopause Society president Dr Usha Didwania cautioned people against terminating pregnancy at home without consulting doctors. She said in many cases, women come to the hospitals in critical condition after trying abortion at home. Dr Didwania said she used to get four to five such patients per week before the pandemic, but the figure has now jumped by nearly 25%. “In some cases, it was found that the egg got stuck in the tube and the condition of the woman concerned turned serious after consumption of abortion pills. The condition of such patients becomes very serious if the tube bursts,” Dr Didwania added. A non-profit organisation had found in 2020 that nearly 1.85 million women could not terminate unwanted pregnancy in the first three months of the Covid-induced lockdown. Travel restrictions and focus of the hospitals on Covid care have led to people trying unsafe abortion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/unplanned-pregnancies-unsafe-abortions-on-the-rise-in-bihar/articleshow/82984232.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Patna||Yaas Cyclone: Light rain in Patna, northwest Bihar braces for downpour||PATNA: As cyclone Yaas battered Odisha and Bengal coasts on Wednesday and neighbouring Jharkhand was on high alert, a statewide alert for widespread rainfall has been issued for two days with northwest Bihar likely to experience higher intensity. The India Meteorological Department (IMD), in its bulletin issued at 8:30 pm, issued a warning for "isolated heavy to very heavy with extremely heavy" falls in Bihar on Thursday. An alert for "heavy to very heavy rainfall" at isolated places was issued for Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh for Friday. The state started feeling the impact of the weather system from the evening on Wednesday when the cyclone completed the landfall process. Patna, Gaya, Bhagalpur and Purnia, among other places, experienced recurring spells of light to moderate showers in the evening. The rainfall in Patna increased in intensity by the evening, and rain with thunderstorm is expected on Thursday and Friday as well. An orange warning, which stipulates the authorities to be prepared for emergencies, has been issued by the Patna Meteorological Centre for heavy rainfall in districts, including West Champaran, East Champaran, Sitamarhi, Madhubani, Darbhanga, Kishanganj, Purnia, Buxar, Bhojpur, Aurangabad and Gaya on Thursday. A similar heavy rainfall alert has been issued for north-western districts, including West Champaran, East Champaran, Sitamarhi, Muzaffarpur, Siwan and Saran among others on Friday. Weathermen said though widespread rainfall and thunderstorm is likely across the state till May 29, the impact of the cyclone will be more over the next two days with higher intensity in the north-western parts. "The impact of Yaas will be seen more in the form of rain than windy conditions. Widespread rainfall is expected across the state over the next two days though average wind speed is likely to be around 20-25kmph," Shailendra Kumar Patel, a meteorologist at the Patna Meteorological Centre, said. Satellite images showed cloud cover across almost the entire state by 7 pm. A yellow-code warning by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) for thunderstorms with lightning is already in effect for the north-western parts of the state for the coming two days. Flight and train operations started getting affected as well, owing to the impact of the cyclone Yaas. Only 19 of the 48 scheduled flights operated from the Jayaprakash Narayan International Airport here on Wednesday. Two flights to Kolkata and one flight each to Ranchi and Guwahati had to be cancelled. Also, East Central Railways (ECR) on Wednesday cancelled 15 special trains till May 29. Deputy CM Renu Devi, who is also the in-charge minister of the disaster management department, said all necessary preparations are done to tackle the impact of the cyclone. "15 teams each of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) have been deployed in 12 districts. All hospitals have been alerted to ensure that no patient faces any hassle. All departments, including health, energy and road are also on alert," she said. Anand Shankar, a meteorologist at Patna meteorological centre told a news channel in the afternoon that light to moderate rainfall is expected in most districts in the state on May 27 and 28. "Only a few districts in the south-west and north Bihar are likely to witness heavy rainfall on 27 and few places in central Bihar on May 28. The impact of the cyclone is likely to be seen mainly in the form of rainfall," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/yaas-light-rain-in-patna-nw-bihar-braces-for-downpour/articleshow/82984172.cms||Piyush Tripathi
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat high court insists on prioritising those waiting for second jab||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Wednesday insisted that the state government should give priority in vaccination to those people who are waiting for their second dose even as it is facing acute shortage of Covid-19 vaccines. When advocate general Kamal Trivedi apprised the division bench about the “plight” of the state government in procuring vaccines, Justice Bhargav Karia pointed out that nearly 89 lakh people have been administered first dose and the second dose was given to only 28 lakh people. “This is very shocking. Why?” he inquired and suggested that the government should identify such people and call them for vaccination instead of waiting for them to come on their own. The court also suggested that the state government can coordinate with the Centre for vaccination of the population who is above 60 years. The judges inquired about the expanding time gap between two doses of Covishield from four weeks to12 to16 weeks, and said that people get an impression that the decision is forced due to shortage of vaccine stock. The state government and the Centre made it clear that the gap was changed on basis of scientific evidence. When the HC inquired about the delivery of vaccine that has already been ordered, the government submitted that it has placed an order of 3 crore doses before two manufacturers – Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech. It said that the state has to procure for vaccinating population between age group18-44, and 6.5 crore doses are required. Though the state government was ready to pay in advance, the manufacturer refused to accept entire order and insisted that the government should wait for other manufacturers like Dr Reddy’s for Sputnik V and Zydus to is developing a vaccine. It was also submitted that manufacturers said they are unable to ensure consistent supply and hence do not assure delivery. They are issuing 1 to 3 lakh doses daily. On hearing this, Justice Bela Trivedi said, “Then there is no point in placing orders. When you place an order an do not get delivery. What is the point?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-insists-on-prioritising-those-waiting-for-2nd-jab/articleshow/82987575.cms||---

Delays are being observed in fumigation and fogging, he said.Pathak also alleged that procurement of drugs for fogging and spraying had been delayed by two months. He said that municipal corporations should purchase the drugs at the earliest and give them to DBC workers so that they can do fogging and spraying. BJP-led municipal corporations have called the allegations baseless. North Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Jai Prakash said that contrary to Pathak’s allegation, 25 dengue cases were reported from January till May. “There has been no delay in fogging drives. The drives are carried out in monsoon season. In pre-monsoon seasons, focus remains on using larvicide drugs in potential mosquito breeding sites like water coolers. We have enough drugs and chemicals for anti-mosquito drives,” Prakash added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-bjp-spar-over-delay-in-fogging-drive/articleshow/82985463.cms||---
---||Pune||Cops crack Rs 7.25L cheating case, nab trickster from Goa||Pune: The city cyber police have traced and arrested a Hadapsar resident from a plush hotel in Goa on the charge of cheating a Vishrantwadi man of Rs7.25 lakh on May 13 on the pretext of issuing him a Rs7 crore demand draft (DD) towards the maturity of his investments in mutual funds. Cyber police inspector D S Hake told TOI, “We arrested Rajkumar Hindraj Wani (38) from the Goa hotel and recovered gold and cash, collectively worth Rs4 lakh, from his possession. We are also searching for his two aides.” The victim, who works with a private company, had invested in trade/mutual funds in the past. Wani called him posing as a representative of the finance firm, through which the victim had made the investments and convinced the latter that a Rs7 crore DD towards the maturity of his investment was ready. Wani told the victim to pay Rs7.25 lakh towards processing and issuance of the demand draft, the police said. “We have frozen Wani’s bank accounts and seized his smartphone. Based on our investigation of the contents on his phone, we suspect that he has cheated many people in the past few months in a similar way. Our probe is on,” Hake said. “Wani claims that he is a resident of Ahmednagar, but never goes there. He puts up at a lodge or hotel in Pune. He also travels by air between Mumbai and Kolkata, and stays in luxurious hotels in both the cities. We are probing why he regularly visits the two cities regularly. He follows a fancy lifestyle and attends parties at clubs in Goa and Mumbai. This is how he spends the money that he makes by cheating people,” he said. The police said Wani convinced the man from Vishrantwadi that he would help him in claiming the Rs7 crore lying with the finance firm. “Wani then forwarded a fake image of the demand draft to the victim to win his confidence,” the officer said. “The victim then transferred the amount to Wani’s bank accounts. However, the victim never received the demand draft. After waiting for a few days, the victim went to the bank to verify the image of the demand draft. But bank officials told him that they had never processed such a demand draft. The victim then approached us,” Hake said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cops-crack-rs-7-25l-cheating-case-nab-trickster-from-goa/articleshow/82985471.cms||---

From Thursday onwards, anyone above 18 years of age will be able to register on the spot at GMDC Ground and get vaccinated in their car or vehicle itself. However, the luxury of a spot-registration and drive-through vaccination will come at a cost. This time around, the civic authorities have set up the drive-through vaccination on a public-private partnership with the private hospital and therefore, anyone willing to get vaccinated will have to pay Rs 1,000 per person. The vaccination drive will continue from 9am to 5pm at GMDC Ground. At present, Covishield vaccine will be administered at the drivethrough vaccination centre. Vaccination at other locations by registering through CoWin application will however, continue as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/pay-register-drive-through-for-vax-at-gmdc-from-today/articleshow/82987577.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Volunteer groups across U’khand step in to feed stray animals amid Covid curbs||Dehradun: It’s tough times for stray animals as a majority of them have lost their sole source of food due to the shutting down of food joints across the state in the wake of Covid-induced curfew. Acknowledging this shortage of food sources, several social organisations and Good Samaritans have taken it upon themselves to keep the stray animals well-fed during the statewide curfew. Aditi Vishwas Saxena, who runs an NGO, ‘Care of Animals’, in Haridwar with her brother Aditya, told TOI, “Usually street animals depend on area locals who feed them and look after them. However, people are not able to come forward to help these animals as they are confined to their homes due to the lockdown. Many families have been affected due to the pandemic and several people have lost their jobs. This is a difficult time for all of us, including the helpless animals. Therefore, we urge all those who can, to feed the strays.” She added that the volunteers of ‘Care of Animals’ not only feed street animals but also put together a makeshift shelter for them. “We make use of old truck tyres by cutting them open and placing blankets inside them. This makes for a comfortable space for the animals,” Aditi said. Another such group ‘We Care’, based in Rishikesh, feeds around 100 stray animals daily and provides medical aid to injured street dogs. The social organisation is run by Suyogya Mishra and Arjun Gaur, both Rishikesh residents. Similarly, Ashu Arora, an event manager by profession, runs Doon Animal Welfare. He says that he has been looking after 700 animals in three shelters across Uttarakhand. “We take care of animals like injured donkeys, mules and abandoned cows.” In Roorkee, Kuldeep Suryavansi, president of People for Animals, is running an awareness drive for stray animals. “We are encouraging households to put water in bowls for these animals so that they have enough to drink during summers.” In Roorkee, Kuldeep Suryavansi, founder of People for Animals, is running an awareness drive for stray animals. “We are encouraging households to put water in bowls for these animals. As the summer peaks, we’re ensuring that the stray animals have enough water and food,” said Suryavansi. In Pauri Garhwal, Sushma Jakhmola, founder of the Akriti Seva Samiti, has been relentlessly working to ensure the well-being of stray animals. Taking cognisance of her efforts, the Uttarakhand animal husbandry department has been providing five quintals of fodder to the NGO every month. “Besides food and other amenities, we ensure that an animal gets proper burial after death,” said Jakhmola, who has conferred with the prestigious Tilu Rauteli award for sensitising her community about animal cruelty. Meanwhile, the state government has also asked the officials of each district to look after stray animals. In an order issued on April 27, Meenakshi Sundaram, the secretary of the animal husbandry department, directed the chief veterinary officers of all the 13 districts to ensure the supply of food and fodder to the animals.

Around 1.5 lakh HCWs are eligible for vaccination in the region. According to hospitals, these HCWs are serving without the protection of vaccination even in Covid-19 wards. Hospitals complained that they have to follow a long-drawn process to enrol these new HCWs with the civic or district administration before they can book a vaccination slot for them on the Co-Win app. Local authorities have stopped accepting hospital administration enrolments following complaints of fraudulent entries. Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said that at no centre there are more than 30 beneficiaries in the queue. “If they are really HCWs, they will get the jab. Recently, our Pachpaoli centre HCWs were vaccinated with the first dose. The new format has been put in place to ensure only genuine beneficiaries take the jab,” he said. Nagpur IMA president Dr Sanjay Deotale said NMC had assured them that HCWs would get the jab on priority at government centres. Amit Somani, director at Kingsway Hospitals, said some new joinees are yet to take their first dose. “Majority of our staff has been vaccinated. Some haven’t received their second dose, in addition to the new joinees. We will get them vaccinated soon,” he said. Dr Tushar Gawad, director-administration at Alexis Multispeciality Hospital, said that HCWs are at a higher risk as compared to others as they care for patients. “Across hospitals many HCWs who have joined recently are yet to get even the first dose. Also, most of them are below 45 years of age. If they get infected their health will be at risk and they won’t be able to serve patients, resulting in staff shortage,” he said. Dr Gawad stressed it’s important to vaccinate them on a priority either at NMC or government centres “or the authorities must provide vaccines to us so that we can vaccinate them”. “Many hospitals in city are trying to procure vaccines directly from manufacturers but may only be able to get them by the second week of June,” he said. Vidarbha Hospitals Association (VHA) convenor Dr Anup Marar said that no HCW (18 to 44 years) can walk-in for on-site registration or jab. “New doctors, nursing and paramedical joinees need to fill up a form and submit it at nearest government vaccination centre. Once the civic body updates the details, the beneficiary gets a call. Without NMC verification, HCWs can’t book a slot on Co-Win app. Hospitals need to follow this format only and there is no exclusive queue for such beneficiaries,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/many-new-hcws-yet-to-get-first-dose-serving-in-covid-19-wards/articleshow/82985475.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Fruits are cultivated in 4.50 lakh acres, while vegetables in over 3.50 lakh acres in the state. Fruit dropping caused by gale and unseasonal rain was not the only loss to mango growers. Lack of market facilities due to coronavirus and only four-hour selling period in the retail market, has resulted in not many wholesalers coming forward to buy the king of fruits from farmers. “It was a good mango crop this year. The market was also good in March and April. Merchants were offering Rs 50,000 to Rs 60,000 per quintal. But the rate fell to Rs 15,000 to Rs 20,000 quintal in May. Even the quality of fruit took a beating due to the unseasonal rain,” Seelam Srinivas Reddy, a mango farmer from Thallada in Khammam district, said. Normally, merchants and wholesalers directly purchase mango and other fruits from farmers at their orchards. However, the farmers did not find many takers this time. Though the government has exempted transport of fruits and vegetables from lockdown restrictions, lack of goods transport vehicles also dashed the hopes of farmers of a windfall at least this year. This is the second consecutive year that farmers of fruits and vegetables have been hit by unseasonal rains and lockdown woes. Though some of the farmers managed to bring their produce to the markets, they did not get remunerative price. Ditto is the situation with sweet lime, banana, water and musk melon, guava, pomegranate and other fruits, whose consumption goes up during the summer. Vegetable farmers are also pouring out their woes over the unseasonal rain damaging their crop. Greater Hyderabad receives a major chunk of vegetable supplies from the neighbouring districts of Rangareddy,Medchal-Malkajgiri, Nagarkurnool, Mahbubnagar, Siddipet, Nalgonda, Vikarabad, Sanga Reddy, Medak, Suryapet and Yadadri-Bhuvanagiri. “The unseasonal rain affected the quality of the vegetables causing losses to the farmers. Though tomato, brinjal, cabbage, ladies finger, onion and beans crop was affected, the worst hit was leafy vegetables,” an official said. Horticulture officials have taken up enumeration of losses and said preliminary estimation was that nearly 10% of the fruits crop was damaged and the losses could be in a few crores of rupees. This is in addition to the losses incurred by vegetable farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/lockdown-unseasonal-rain-hit-horticultural-crops/articleshow/82987541.cms||Roushan Ali

Pappu had warned his wife that he would kill her if she did not do it. When she refused again on Tuesday early, Pappu allegedly shot her in the head at their home in Basedi village. After killing the wife, the accused was worried what would happen to their children, so he killed them too,” a police officer said.

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: 3 of a family found dead in suspected suicide pact||HYDERABAD: In a suspected case of suicide pact, a mother and her two children were found dead in the hillock area at Devarkadra of Mahabubnagar district on Wednesday night. After recovering the three dead bodies, police said they have identified the victims by matching the details of a missing case registered by their family members on Tuesday. The victims were identified as Balakistamma, 50, her son Raju, 25, and daughter Santosha, 18. Though the police suspect that it could be a case of suicide, they are yet to find any poison at the scene of offence. “There was a cold drink bottle and some food found at the scene. It is possible they might consumed soft drink or food laced with poison. We will get clarity on Thursday morning,” Bhootpur police station inspector Rajitha Reddy told TOI. According to her, the three left their residence on Monday after informing Balakistamma’s elder daughter Maneamma that they were going to a local temple to offer prayers since Balakistamma had been keeping unwell. Recently, Raju too had recovered from Covid-19. Police said since the three did not return by evening, Maneamma tried to reach her mother over the phone. As the phone was inaccessible, a worried Maneamma approached the police, who shared the missing persons photos with locals. Locals in the village, who visited the hillock area accidentally, found three decomposed bodies and alerted the police. The officials did not find any suicide note at the site.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/3-of-a-family-found-dead-in-suspected-suicide-pact/articleshow/82987567.cms||---

The area where the body was found is also near the main pipeline that supplies drinking water to the town which has increased the anguish amongst residents that bodies of Covid-infected persons are not being disposed of properly. A video of the half-burnt body found floating in the river is being widely circulated on social media platforms. Miffed with the episode, locals have demanded strict action against those responsible. Taking cognisance of the incident, Rishinder Mahar, the district president of the Youth Congress wing, launched an attack on the local administration. He said that the authorities have taken a callous approach towards ensuring proper disposal of bodies in times of a raging pandemic. When queried on the issue, Tushar Saini, SDM Pithoragarh (city), said that teams of officials have been deployed at the places where the cremation of Covid victims is taking place. “I urge people to not believe in rumours.

---||Mumbai||Powai principal collects Rs 40L from donors to pay students’ fees||MUMBAI: As parents faced with job losses and pay cuts struggle to pay their children’s fees, the principal of a state board school in Powai, a stone’s throw from IIT-Bombay, has so far quietly managed to raise Rs 40 lakh from corporate houses and individuals. Around 200 students’ fees have been paid with the funds collected. Shirley Pillai, principal of Powai English High School, started the crowdfunding initiative soon after the Covid-related lockdown was imposed in March 2020. “For the first time in my 35 years of teaching, I had seen report cards pile up on my table and parents unwilling to come to school to collect them,” said Pillai who has been heading the school for four years. Just 50% of the 2,200 students paid their fees. When teachers reached out to the parents, they understood their struggles to make ends meet due to the pandemic. “We have children of daily wagers and lower middle-class families studying with us. The worry was that girl students would be the first to be forced to drop out of school,” said Pillai. Initially, the school gave a discount of 25% in the annual fees of around Rs 35,000 for the academic year 2019-20. The 105 teaching and non-teaching staff had already taken a 30% to 50% salary cut. “When that too looked difficult, I decided to appeal to corporates and individuals in Powai,” said Pillai. The principal used a local community network and social media platforms to appeal to people to sponsor the education of the students. “It took a while for corporates to respond. I am glad the effort is bearing fruit. Around 200 students’ fees have been paid with the collected funds. We are now looking at sponsors for our students for the academic year of 2021-22,” said Pillai. The principal said all her students have been instructed to attend online classes. “Children have been told to focus on their studies and leave the fee issue to the adults.” The money has even helped the school pay the fees of the children of their peons and bus drivers. If two siblings are enrolled in the school, half their fees are borne by the school (using the donated money) and parents have been asked to arrange the rest, said the principal. Till recently, parents were getting calls from the school informing their children’s fees had been paid by a sponsor. They were unaware about the principal’s role. “I am putting in my best. I will not rest till the remaining report cards of 2019-20 are taken away by parents without any fear or worry,” she said. Parents across the country have been asking for fee reduction due to online classes. Earlier this month, the Supreme Court had said educational institutions must reduce fees as their running costs have come down with various facilities provided on campus remaining closed. Meanwhile, teachers in city schools have been complaining of having to call parents to pay the fees as their salaries depend on it. Some told TOI they had to keep a watch on parents’ social media activities, such as posing for photographs on holidays, and mention these if they complained of financial difficulties in paying the fees.

Justice Pushpa Ganediwala directed the Maharashtra Public Health Department’s principal secretary to refer the minor to a medical board constituted by Government Medical College Hospital (GMCH) in Chandrapur and obtain opinion about her suitability to undergo abortion. After the mother knocked the court’s doors, High Court Legal Aid Committee assigned lawyer Sweety Bhatia to plead her case. According to latter, the minor girl was a victim of alleged rape and sexual abuse by accused Sahiram Gaikwad, a labourer, who was engaged by her father. Bhatia alleged the accused abducted her on March 7, 2020, when her parents had gone on to their fields. A complaint was lodged in Jivati Police Station in Chandrapur and efforts to trace the girl began. More than one year later, survivor was traced at Gaikwad’s place on May 8 by her cousins. It then came to fore that she was 21 weeks’ pregnant. Offences of rape and kidnapping under the IPC and Pocso Act were registered against the accused. While adjourning the hearing till Friday, justice Ganediwala directed the state secretary, represented by assistant government pleader NS Rao, to submit the board’s report. Before issuing notices to respondents, including union health secretary and GMCH dean, she directed the board to consider and inform on all medical issues that normally arise in such matters. “The board needs to inform on whether the continuance of pregnancy would involve risk to minor’s life or grave injury to her physical or mental health. Also, whether there is a substantial risk that if the child was born it would suffer from physical or mental abnormalities and remain handicapped,” the judge said. The judge further asked the board to inform on risks involved if the pregnant girl is permitted to terminate her pregnancy that is in an advanced stage. “The members should also inform on the medical process best suited to terminate pregnancy and possibility of child being born alive in the process or any other relevant issues in such cases,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mother-of-teen-rape-survivor-moves-hc-seeking-abortion-for-her/articleshow/82985490.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Pradeep Naik, a police wireless department officer, lodged a complaint with the Chatushrungi police station. According to the FIR, the police wireless department and the contractor executed an agreement in 2018 and it was agreed that the contractor would pay a rent of Rs9.50 lakh to the police wireless department as rent for the facility. The contractor was supposed to rent out the facility for weddings and other functions. He was supposed to pay the rent to the wireless department in May 2019, police said. However, the contractor left the marriage hall and lawn premises without paying the rent. The police wireless department contacted him on several occasions in the last few months, but he did not respond to their communications. Following this, the authorities decided to lodge a police complaint. Police are now searching for the contractor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/case-against-contractor-for-cheating-police-of-rs-9-5l/articleshow/82985505.cms||---

The police said that they have seized a lot of raw products from the makeshift factory at Thakurpukur though raids are on to nab the gang members. “We have been carrying out raids against fake and high-cost oximeters. We received information through our sources on Tuesday evening that oximeters were being manufactured locally and sold as expensively as Rs 4000. During investigation and raid at the Amritalal Mukherjee Road at Thakurpukur, 30 such assembled pieces and 100 other partially manufactured oximeters were seized by our team,” said DC (EB) Kankar prasad Barui. The police said that the gang had even fixed up agents who received a good commission once they managed to sell these items at shops. “The danger with fake oximeters is that the readings vary greatly. The device we checked gave different readings depending on whether the patient was sitting or lying down. Doctors whom we consulted said the readings fluctuate a lot in the first week of treatment and can lead to panic among the patients,” said an officer. Manufacturers of oximeters and other medical devices must comply with Drugs & Cosmetic Act, 1940 & Rules, 1945 and the Medical Devices Rules, 2019. However, the rules are yet to be implemented fully in India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fake-oximeter-gang-busted/articleshow/82985482.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Cops’ Plus Code location help for cell users||Kolkata: For a force that depended largely on phone calls to dial 100 and only recently asked residents to switch to using the WhatsApp location to send across their exact position in times of trouble, a presentation by a HAM operator before cyclone Yaas promises to usher in a whole new use of technology — especially when someone in trouble finds himself or herself offline or their phone battery is dying out. Kolkata Police has requested citizens to download a popular programme — Google Plus Code — so that they can reveal their location to cops even when they are offline. Plus Codes are like street addresses for people or places that don’t have one. Instead of addresses with street names and numbers, Plus Codes are based on latitude and longitude, and displayed as numbers and letters. With a Plus Code, people can receive deliveries, access emergency services, or just help other people find them. Police say this system helps during disasters and is easy to locate, better than finding addresses at a time when battery is dying. According to Lalbazar, there is an understanding among those residing at cities that landmarks are enough to give directions. “But when you reside in the middle of a street or have multiple streets around your location, you can easily guide us or any other agency to the spot without even having to talk,” said a senior officer. The application will also show other options, including the ones to see nearby places, share your location and save your parking. However, if one is on the move, this application will be redundant. The cops said that Arya Ghosh, a HAM expert, had made a detailed presentation at Lalbazar on its uses after which the police have decided to ask the citizens to make use of the technology. “We have found the app helpful, especially since it is open sourced and anyone with a smartphone can have access to it,” said a senior cop at Lalbazar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-plus-code-location-help-for-cell-users/articleshow/82985534.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Delhi||If Pakistan declares war, will states buy own tanks?: Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal||NEW DELHI: Just as states can’t be asked to get their own weapons and look out for themselves if Pakistan declares a war on the nation, it is the central government that has to purchase and supply vaccines, not leave it to state governments to fend for themselves in the war against Covid-19, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Wednesday. “If Pakistan declares war on India tomorrow, states cannot be asked to look out for themselves — that UP should buy its own tanks and Delhi procure its own weapons,” Kejriwal said in a digital press briefing, pointing out vaccines for people in the 18-44 age group and the stock of Covaxin for the elderly was now exhausted. Kejriwal said vaccines should have been procured from across the world when the second wave started in March, but the states were instructed to make arrangements for themselves. “I’ve been in touch with the CMs of several states, and none has left any stone unturned to be able to get vaccines,” he said. “Many state governments issued global tenders for the vaccine and failed. The vaccine companies have clearly stated that they will not communicate with the state governments, only deal directly with the central government. Why is the country not buying vaccines?” The CM said that India could not lose this war at any cost. “If the central government loses the Covid war, it is not just BJP which will not lose, India will lose,” he said. “If Delhi government loses, it is not AAP losing, India is. This is the time when the governments of 36 states and Union territories should work with the Centre as Team India.” Kejriwal assured the PM that all CMs, rising above petty party politics, were working with him like soldiers of the nation. “You give us the responsibility and we will fulfil them,” he said, “but how can we execute the work that is not ours to do? The country has lost six months. If we delay it any further, no one knows how many more homes will be destroyed and how many more lives will be lost.” Earlier in the day, Kejriwal visited a drive-through vaccination facility at Vegas Mall in Dwarka operated by Aakash Hospital. There were 70 jabs at the spot. Kejriwal hoped the facility would help many citizens. He said similar centres are expected to open in the next few days, but vaccination supply remained a problem. “The government has Covishield for those above 45 years for a few days. We have already written more than once about Delhi’s need for 80 lakh vaccines per month,” the CM said, adding that Indian scientists had made among the first Covid vaccines. India should have started producing vaccines on a war footing right then and begun vaccinating citizens on a mass scale. “Had we vaccinated the country at the right time, we might have avoided the wrath of the second wave,” he said. Kejriwal also said the relaxation of the lockdown couldn’t be linked with the vaccination drive because Delhi government wasn’t certain of the time the vaccines would take to arrive in the city. “The livelihoods of people are suffering, their businesses are shutting down, so we will have to consider how much unlocking can be allowed,” he said. AAP MLA Atishi claimed that only private hospitals were inoculating the youth at a cost. “A vaccine dose costs between Rs 800 and Rs 1,300. A lot of young people in Delhi cannot afford to pay so much. This is the reason for the decline in daily vaccination numbers,” Atishi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cm-if-pak-declares-war-will-states-buy-own-tanks/articleshow/82985591.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Pune||Pune-based NGO helps workers who lost jobs during pandemic earn livelihood||PUNE: Yug Foundation, a city-based NGO, has begun helping those who have lost their jobs with meals and essentials, and identifying work opportunities that will bring back their livelihoods under their campaign ‘Replace Hunger with Employment’. During their food distribution drives, the volunteers met many individuals out on the streets looking for a meal after losing their jobs to the pandemic and the lockdown. They were between 40 and 60 years old and had worked as cooks, housekeeping staff, waiters, kitchen help, electricians, carpenters and other ITI trades. “These workers did not have a resume or know how to make one, so we helped make and uploaded them on various job search websites. We built a database and appealed to businesses and corporate houses that we network with to hire them,” Nisha Nair, co-founder of the campaign, said. The database has been sent on all social media platforms and human resource boards/forums where many senior corporate employees, business owners and HR personnel can help, co-founder Kamlesh Melwani said. Currently, the NGO has collected information of 500 unemployed workers. They have helped 20 workers get hired in restaurants, employed a few on the NGO’s payroll to assist with food delivery to Covid patients, and are in the process of getting more recruited at other establishments in the city. Kiran Sapkale, who lost his job with a restaurant last year, said,“Though this NGO initiative, I am now a delivery agent for food distribution drives they carry out.” Ranjit Yadav, who relocated from Ranchi six years ago to work with a catering service in the city, said, “I met a volunteer during food distribution at Shaniwarwada, who introduced me to the owner of a restaurant in NIBM area who hired me as a chef and provided a place for me to stay as well. Now, I send good money to my family.” Minibus driver Siddhant Dhangekar was hired as a food delivery agent at a restaurant in Kharadi. “My employer and colleagues treat me like family and we look after each other,” he said. The NGO is also working with the women to tailor masks and bags where the proceeds from the sales go to them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ngo-helps-workers-who-lost-jobs-during-pandemic-earn-livelihood/articleshow/82985547.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Schools staring at new year without textbooks||PUNE: The printing of textbooks by the Maharashtra State Bureau of Textbook Production and Curriculum Research (Balbharati) has hit a pause. The delay in the demand from local bodies to procure textbooks and court cases filed by certain paper vendors against Balbharati has led to no paper at the Balbharati press to print the books at present. Every year, the textbook bureau prints over nine crore books. The bureau prints textbooks for all state board affiliated schools from std I to XII. As per Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan, the local civic bodies should check the number of students enrolled in each school from Std I to VIII in their jurisdictions and send a demand for the books as they are distributed free to the children via Maharashtra Prathamik Shikshan Parishad. The expenses are borne by the parishad at a prefixed rate with the Balbharati for each class. Sometimes, some of the previous year’s stock remains with the local bodies and students are encouraged to return the books in a good shape after their use so that the next batch can use them. The local body has to minus this amount and send the demand for books every academic year. “This year, there has been a delay in filling up these details on the portal due to which we do not have an exact amount on the number of books required. However, we had started the printing early on as we had an idea of how much books would be required. There was some surplus paper and other material from last year. In total, till now, we have completed printing of about two-thirds of the last year’s demand. However, at present there is no printing because there is no paper,” Dinkar Patil, director of Balbharati said. Some vendors went to court against Balbharati over the tendering process for the paper, another official said. Since the matter is in court, Balbharati cannot buy paper and print the remaining copies of textbooks. “We have requested the court to speed up the hearing of the matter as books need to be distributed at the earliest to the students. However, even if everything falls in place and the decision is in our favour, we would need to give the work-order, then the vendor needs to provide paper and finally it has to be printed which will at least require another one month or so. However, all the textbooks are available online in their pdf module as there is no change in any books since the last year. Hence, students can use the online format till they get physical textbooks,” a Balbharati official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/schools-staring-at-new-year-without-textbooks/articleshow/82985526.cms||Ardhra Nair

The Byculla police said that the accused, Shraddha Gaikwad, was produced before the Mazgaon court and remanded to police custody. It is learnt that the woman spent the money on her own wedding. The retired cop, who had taken a loan of Rs 7 lakh and mortgaged gold to give the accused so that his two daughters secure jobs in a private bank, filed a complaint two years ago. “The accused posed as an employee of a private bank and told the former cop that she was earning a decent income.

---||Pune||Pune: Metro ramp work to be completed by next month||PUNE: The work of a crucial ramp section to switch over Metro tracks from the elevated portion to the underground stretch, and vice-versa, is in the final stage. Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited (MahaMetro) is aiming at completing the rest of the work by next month. The ramp is being built at the Metro’s Agriculture College depot — the point connecting the underground and the elevated stretches. The ramp is a part of the Metro’s Pimpri to Swargate corridor. The Pimpri to Agriculture College stretch is an elevated viaduct section, after which the Metro will travel underground till Swargate. Two box culverts for two Metro lines are being constructed at the site by the cut-and-cover method. The upper portion of the ramp is being filled and covered by soil, so that the area can be utilized for other purposes, a MahaMetro official said. “The 500m-long ramp will help in the Metro’s seamless entry-exit from the elevated portion to the underground stretch. The work was expedited in the last few months and it has reached the final stage. The backfilling is being done. It will take another month to complete the rest of the work,” the official said. MahaMetro has already completed the excavation of the underground tunnel, starting from the Agriculture College towards the Civil Court. “The construction of a viaduct up to the Agriculture College is also at the advanced stage. Metro will cross the railway tracks near Khadki to enter the Range Hills stretch and then travel towards the Agriculture College ramp before going underground. The height of the ramp has been lowered after Range Hills,” the official said. Hemant Sonawane, general manager (public relations) of MahaMetro, said the corporation was coming up with two depots, one each at Agriculture College and Vanaz. The Agriculture College depot would look after the maintenance of Metro rakes of the Pimpri-Swargate route.A separate wing was being constructed at the depot site for the rakes to enter the maintenance area, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/metro-ramp-work-to-be-completed-by-next-month/articleshow/82985601.cms||Sarang Dastane

According to a RERA official, over 350 promoters who failed to adhere to self-set deadlines for various reasons, including the pandemic, had applied online and taken extension. A source said, “On March 9, the authority had allowed the promoters to avail one year special extension on account of pandemic, if they apply online for such extension till March 31, 2021. A special online window was created for this purpose. Following this, more than 350 developers in the state applied for extension after depositing standard fee.” Last year in May, on the ground of force majeure, extension of 12 months was granted to the real estate projects expiring on or after March 19, 2020, after lockdown was imposed in the state owing to the first wave. Those projects that had lapsed before March 19, 2020 were also allowed the benefit of the extension if the promoter first applies for usual extension and pay extension fee, standard fee and penalty. “As normalcy did not return after last year, majority who sought extension are same developers, who were provided relief last year. Though, there are few defaulters from Bhiwadi who neither completed the project nor applied for extension,” said a source. Earlier, after witnessing the second wave, the developers associations also demanded an extension from the authority. The developers reasoned, instalments have been deferred by the government for a very long period which has resulted in poor recovery and reduced revenue collection. Many claimed there is also a cascading effect of the first wave, which has hampered recovery in the real estate sector in the last six months. “The vicious cycle of recession had impacted the economy adversely. This has resulted in reduction in demand, production, employment, income. Many allottees are facing difficulty in making payment of EMI. Also, there is reduction in buying capacity and frequent cancellations,” said a promoter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/350-developers-avail-reras-1-yr-deadline-extension-offer/articleshow/82987679.cms||---

As per the bid agreements, the private companies implementing government projects of various departments like discoms, Prasaran Nigam, RIICO, PWD, RSRDC, PHED and warehousing corporation etc need to complete the work as per the specified time, failing which they are liable to pay penalty.Sanjay Saboo, chairman of CII-Rajasthan said, “During the lockdown, project execution facing headwinds from multiple fronts like labour shortage, unavailability of raw material, planning, monitoring, etc. We urge the government to extend the completion time period of these projects by at least six months.” Drawing attention to the liquidity crisis these MSMEs are facing, Saboo said that all the government departments and large-scale units should follow the MSME Act for payment within 45 days and a monitoring cell could be established to ensure its compliance. Last year, state finance department had issued a notification giving directions to various government departments to pay the pending dues to companies within 15 days and to report to it by July 6. Saboo said, said, “Most of the payments are still stuck with JVVNL, AVVNL, JdVVNL, RSRDC, RSWC, Rajasthan Medical Corp Ltd, medical department; etc. It will be a big support to MSMEs during the crisis time if the performance guarantee money of those who have not been selected for procurement is returned.” The industry has also appealed the government to adhere to the norms of the procurement policy. It said the items which are produced in Rajasthan must be purchased by government organisations in priority. “RVPNL, JVVNL, AVVNL, and PHED are doing turnkey projects with bigger companies which purchase from outside Rajasthan. There are around 140 products in Rajasthan which have been earmarked to be purchased from Rajasthan-based industries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-industry-appeals-to-extend-govt-project-completion-dates/articleshow/82987707.cms||---

A vial was also seized from the accused. Police said the drug that comes under essential category is in demand because of higher number of Covid patients and hence unscrupulous elements try to sell it in the black market at inflated rates. The team of DCP Zone-II received a tip off that some people would come to a place on Ram Nagar-Ravi Nagar Road to sell the injection. The police laid a trap and first detained one Sachin Gevrikar (20, a resident of Mohgaon, Balaghat district in Madhya Pradesh) who was standing in front of a medicine shop near Ravi Nagar Square. During his search, the special team, led by PSI Kunal Dhurat, found Tocilizumab injection worth Rs40,600, two mobile phones and a motorcycle from his possession. During interrogation, Gevrikar spilled the names of his two accomplices, both practising BHMS doctors — Vishesh aka Sonu Bakat (26, a resident of Paraswada in Balaghat) and Ramphal Vaish (24, a resident of Tharaktela in MP), who were caught standing near a private hospital in Ravi Nagar area. Police said Sachin’s mother had tested positive for Covid-19. Doctor had prescribed her Tocilizumab, but it remained unused. With the help of both the doctors, Sachin, a student of engineering, tried to dispose off the vial for Rs1 lakh. An offence has been registered against the trio at Ambazari police station. The accused were produced before a court on Wednesday and were sent in police custody till May 28.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/2-docs-among-3-held-for-toci-black-marketing/articleshow/82985635.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

There is hardly any vaccine to inoculate for this category on Thursday. The drive will resume as usual only after the state receives 2.92 lakh doses of Covaxin from Bharat Biotech, expected to arrive on Thursday. According to an official, the state government had received 14.94 lakh doses of Covishield for the age group. Till Wednesday, 14.87 lakh doses were administered. So, only 6,752 doses are left for Thursday. “Of these 6,752 doses, there will be a wastage of around 2,000-3,000 doses,” said an official. “We will receive 2.92 lakh doses of Covaxin on May 27 (Thursday). We will not receive Covishield till June first week,” he said. “For tomorrow, we hardly have any vaccine for the age group.” State health secretary Siddharth Mahajan confirmed that there will be hardly any vaccination for the group on Thursday. "We will be able to resume vaccination (for the 18-44 age group) only after we receive the doses. We have already made advance payment for Covaxin. On Thursday, vaccination will mostly remain closed for the group. It will be conducted only in a few centres which have a negligible number of doses left. Even on Wednesday, we couldn't conduct vaccination in most of the centres. If we receive the consignment tomorrow, we will distribute it to districts. It will take time. On Friday, we will be able to resume vaccination in only a few districts where the distribution has been completed. We will restart vaccination in Jaipur on Friday if we get it tomorrow. In other districts, we will resume the drive after that.” Meanwhile, the state government had started walk-in appointments for the 18-44 years age group on Tuesday. Based on feedback from states and the Union health ministry, the Centre had decided to provide the facility for on-site registration for this group based on a few conditions. This is to minimise wastage if beneficiaries who had booked online slots through CoWIN do not turn up for inoculation for some reason. In such cases, on-site registration will be considered. However, this facility will be available only at government Covid vaccination centers (CVCs) and not at private CVCs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/state-runs-out-of-vaccines-for-the-18-44-yrs-category/articleshow/82987740.cms||Sidhartha Dutta

Three major overbridges promise to ease traffic congestion. One will connect Hebatpur Crossroads to Sola Bhagwat, the other will lie over Vaishnodevi Circle, and the third is coming up near Khodiyar container depot. A senior officer in Gandhinagar said that two flyovers, one being constructed at Vaishnodevi Circle and the other at Gota Crossroads, are almost ready. Technical teams are running load-bearing tests on the two bridges. The authorities expect to inaugurate these two bridges by mid-June. Officials said that the longest flyover on SG Road, linking Hebatpur Crossroads to Sola Bhagwat, will be completed by Septemberend. The flyover merges with the Thaltej underpass. The officials said that the three projects have been delayed by nearly 45 days because migrant labourers had left the state last year due to Covid. Work on Sola railway overbridge is ongoing and involves the railway ministry. “SG Road has become one of the busiest roads of Ahmedabad city over the past ten years,” said an official. “Also, the construction of flyovers at key junctions across the 14km stretch on the highway was causing traffic snarls.” The authorities had planned a series of flyovers and the six-laning of the road, the official said. “However, with work on the three flyovers in progress, driving on the road had become a nightmare,” he said. “We expect the stretch to be ready by September-end and will ensure that a commuter who gets on to the Iskcon flyover drives straight to Gandhinagar without much hindrance.” Currently, commuters encounter a bottleneck on the Khodiyar overbridge after Vaishnodevi Circle towards Gandhinagar as road-widening work is under way. Since the railways is involved, the exact deadline for the completion of this overbridge cannot be given, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/sg-road-to-bypass-jams-only-in-sep/articleshow/82985773.cms||Himanshu Kaushik
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: ‘Prevent husbands of women councillors from interfering’||JAIPUR: To prevent interference by spouses of women councillors in the proceedings of JMC-Greater, the commissioner has issued an order stating that women wardens must be present in meetings and their husbands won;t be allowed to interfere. Commissioner Yagya Mitra Singh’s Tuesday order mentioned specifically that any meeting or decision taken in the corporation should be done by women councillors and any interference by their husband or male family members will be considered as against the rules. According to sources in the corporation, husbands of women councillors were seen attending meetings on behalf of their spouses. A source in JMC said, “The order was a necessity as interference of husbands had increased in the last two months. Even women chairpersons of the committees, who are given separate chambers, don’t sit there but their husbands or male relatives do. These men attend meetings on their behalf and recently there was a tussle with officials of the corporation as well.” Both the civic bodies in Jaipur have women mayors. At the same time, a large number of women councillors have also been elected. Most of these women councillors are those who have nothing to do with active politics, but come from families whose other members are into politics. When a ward was reserved for women in lottery, most of the former councillors made their wives contest elections. Now the entire management of such councillors is looked after by the male members of their families. Ward 61 councillor Rakhi Rathore and chairperson of a committee welcomed the move. “There have been such incidences when husbands interfere and this should be stopped or else motive of giving representation to women through reservation will be lost,” said Rathore. Similar views were expressed by Sheel Dhabai, former Jaipur mayor. She said this was a much-awaited order which should encourage women participation instead of domination by husbands.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/prevent-husbands-of-women-councillors-from-interfering/articleshow/82987741.cms||---

Last Friday, the girl, 16, was found hanging at her house in Bijnor’s Gazipur village. A police source said she had been involved with a boy from the village but no one knew about their relationship. After the girl’s last rites had been performed, the family found a call recording on her phone. In that, another boy, Tinku Kashyap, 18, was heard allegedly blackmailing her with the threat that he would tell everyone she was in a relationship while she kept pleading that she is "not that kind of girl". The family took the recording to the village council and a panchayat was convened on Monday. In a video shot at the panchayat meeting, Tinku is seen cowering before a group of angry villagers. A woman, a relative of the girl who died, is egged on by others to thrash him. She comes forward, tears streaming down her face, slaps him, beats him up with a slipper and hurls abuses at him before leaving. The video cuts off at this point. After this, Tinku was told he had to leave the village for five years. “The video went viral, on the basis of which we took action. We have filed an FIR against the five panches,” said Bijnor SP Dharamvir Singh. “The youth has been booked under section 306 (abetment of suicide) of the IPC,” Jeet Singh, SHO of Kirathpur police station, under whose jurisdiction the incidents occurred. “The panchayat members have been booked under sections 141 (using criminal force), 143 (unlawful assembly) and 503 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC.

The family had given up its rights over the islands in 1905 to the British for an annual pension of Rs 23,000 which they still receive. Senior member of the family, Adiraja HH Koyamma Thangal (80), the next in line for the title, head of family, said that it was unfortunate to see that people are facing difficulties in continuing their traditional livelihoods like fishing and dairy due to the proposed laws. “The islands are peaceful regions where even prisons lacked inmates. They should be allowed to lead their lives. I don’t think there is a need to impose changes now. If at all reforms are needed, it should be implemented with their wishes. People of the islands should not be put into difficulty,” he said. Ashraf Adiraja, member of Arakkal Adi Raja Family Trust, said the family has a bond with the islanders, with elders from Lakshadweep often visiting the Arakkal family residence. “Sometimes they come with presents and traditional sweets and when the son of the former head of our family visited the islands, he was given a guard of honour by the people,” he said. Historian KKN Kurup who wrote the book ‘The Ali Rajas of Cannanore’ said Arakkal dynasty was Kerala’s lone Muslim royal family and the Laccadive Islands were in their control from early 1500. “Apart from its strategic location, the islands were a source of revenue for the house of Arakkal through sale of coir, dried tuna fish, jaggery. The fortunes of the family were affected when British forces captured Kannur fort, which Arakkal Beevi had brought from the Dutch in 1784 on the grounds that they were in cordial terms with Tipu Sultan,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/let-wishes-of-the-people-prevail-arakkal-family/articleshow/82985731.cms||---
---||Dehradun||‘Even their father can’t arrest me’: Another Ramdev video goes viral||HARIDWAR: The war of words between Ramdev and the Indian Medical Association (IMA) over the Patanjali founder’s recent comments that ‘lakhs of people have died after taking allopathic medicines for Covid treatment’ shows no sign of winding down. On Wednesday, yet another video of the yoga guru surfaced on social media in which he can be seen interacting with a few persons and telling them in the context of #Arrest Ramdev trends on social media that "nobody's father" can arrest him. “Khair, arrest toh unka baap bhi nahi kar sakta Swami Ramdev ko (Anyways, even their father can’t arrest Swami Ramdev),” he is heard saying. He goes on to add, “They keep on creating such trends, like ‘Thug Ramdev’, Mahathug Ramdev’, ‘Giraftar Ramdev’ and so on. Let them do it. Our people have also become accustomed to running such trends and our trends always reach the top.” TOI tried to get in touch with Ramdev for his comments on the latest video but neither he nor officials of Patanjali Yogpeeth could be reached despite several attempts. Meanwhile, IMA-Uttarakhand officials said that the statement made by the yoga guru “smacked of arrogance”. Speaking to TOI, Dr Arvind Sharma, president, IMA-Uttarakhand, said, “Nobody is above the law and authorities should take action against Ramdev for his statements which smack of arrogance.” Police officials, when asked, said no complaint has been received so far against Ramdev on the issue. SSP (Haridwar) Senthil Avoodai Krishna Raj S said, “If we get a complaint, we will investigate the matter and take action as per law.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/even-their-father-cant-arrest-me-another-ramdev-video-viral/articleshow/82983986.cms||MS Nawaz

---||Jaipur||Driver, friend rape homeless woman inside ambulance in Jaipur||JAIPUR: A 24-year-old homeless woman was raped in an ambulance by the vehicle driver and his friend late Monday night. A case was lodged on Wednesday at the city’s Moti Doongri police station. The accused have been identified as driver Surendra Yogi of Dausa and his friend Mahendra Singh from Kanota in Jaipur. Police said the rape survivor has been living with her husband on the footpath for the last few years. The two have been selling vegetables and salads on a cart outside the SMS Hospital on JLN Marg. Yogi who frequently comes to the hospital with patients and parks his ambulance outside was aware of the movement of the rape survivor in the same area. Since the lockdown, the woman was not regularly selling vegetables and had been begging for food and money. Taking advantage of the situation on Monday, Yogi asked the victim to come with him for free food in his ambulance at 11pm. “Since she had seen him standing with his ambulance almost every day, she didn't suspect anything and got into the vehicle. The driver picked up his friend Mahendra from Trimurti Circle and they both took her to an isolated place at Jhalana Circle. Here they raped her,” said the police. Later, they dumped her on the footpath near Jhalana. The family was scared to go to the police and kept quiet for two days. However, a hospital staff gave them assurance and prompted them to file a complaint with the police. “Both the accused have been identified by the victim. The main accused has not turned up at the hospital since the incident. We are searching for both. They will soon be caught and put behind bars,” said SHO Surendra Pancholi, Moti Doongri police station. Police have collected CCTV footage from the area and confirmed their identity (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/driver-friend-rape-homeless-woman-inside-ambulance/articleshow/82987817.cms||---

According to Union health ministry data, Telangana stands fifth in the country in black fungus cases. Gujarat has the most cases with 2,859, followed by Maharashtra (2,770), while Andhra Pradesh has 768 cases. Telangana received 1,889 amphotericin B vials for treatment of black fungus cases and another 1,980 vials will be released soon, the health ministry said. With the number of patients treated at the Government ENT hospital touching more than 200, doctors are conducting procedures on patients to remove fungus from the nasal track. Director of medical education (DME) Dr K Ramesh Reddy on Wednesday said there was no need for every affected patient to take amphotericin B, adding that several private hospitals are sending requests for the vials. “There are many alternative medicines to treat black fungus. Since there was not much demand for the drug before, production was low in the country. As raw materials have to arrive from other countries, it will take some time for the production to go up. We are making alternative arrangements to ensure medicine supplies,” he said. Officials said the challenge in treating mucormycosis patients in Telangana could get tougher in the coming days as the caseload in neighbouring states like Maharashtra and AP is also very high. It may be recalled Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Odisha, Telangana, Assam and Delhi have already declared black fungus as a notifiable disease under the Epidemic Diseases Act-1897.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/state-logs-744-black-fungus-cases-5th-highest-in-india/articleshow/82989620.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Mumbai||Edible oil goes up from Rs 80 to Rs 180, touches 11-year high||MUMBAI: Prices of edible oil have reached an 11-year high, prompting the Centre to take stock of the situation. India imports 65% of the edible oil consumed in the country. A global shortfall in production, as well as hefty government duties, both here and abroad, are to blame for the price rise. Rates of sunflower, soya and mustard oil have all increased at a fast rate since 2020 from about Rs 80 to Rs 180 per litre. Consumers whose incomes have dropped owing to the pandemic lockdown, are weighed down by this additional burden. “Sunday brand has increased from Rs 80 to Rs 170-180 at D’Mart in Andheri. The five-litre can which sold at a discounted rate of Rs 465 last year now costs Rs 865. Rates have shot up on online stores also. On Amazon, I bought Saffola Gold for Rs 179, which was Rs 139 just six months ago,” said Pratima Sinha, a homemaker. Sudhakar Desai, CEO of Emami Agrotech and president of the Indian Vegetable Oil Producers Association, said: “About 65% of edible oil consumed in India is imported from countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, Argentina, Brazil and Ukraine. India consumes about 22 million tonnes annually, of which 13.5 million tonnes is imported. In the last one year global prices of edible oil have doubled due to lower production in the origin countries. This has resulted in Indian edible oil prices going up sharply. Also, higher export duties are being levied by Indonesia. Moreover, India also levies about 35% import duty on edible oil." The IVPA suggested that the government make an import duty correction as per a slab system. In the short term it can activate PDS to help ration card holders by procuring oils from local millers and refineries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-edible-oil-goes-up-from-rs-80-to-rs-180-touches-11-yr-high/articleshow/82989671.cms||Bella Jaisinghani
---||Jaipur||Chaura Rasta water pipe damage hits 4,000 residents in Jaipur||JAIPUR: A six-inch water supply pipeline burst during a Smart City project work on Chaura Rasta on Tuesday evening. Workers were digging the road unaware of the presence of a water pipeline there that impacted the supply in the area around although Public Health and Engineering Department (PHED) repaired it by Wednesday evening. This was amongst many such incidents when the Smart City contractors have damaged water pipelines. Around 4,000 people living in the area were impacted and water supply remained disrupted on Wednesday morning. PHED claimed that the repair work will be finished by evening. Ravindra Garg, executive engineer of PHED, said, “Some work was being carried out by Jaipur Smart City Ltd at Vishweshwar area near Chaura Rasta. While digging up the road, they didn’t realise that there was a pipeline underneath and burst on Tuesday evening. We started the repair work on Wednesday and by evening the work was completed. As the water is supplied in the evening, people didn’t have to suffer without drinking water.” Many other incidences have occurred in the past when pipelines have burst due to work done by some other department. This shows lack of co-ordination within the government departments. Another problem that the departments are facing right now is the availability of labour in the city. Due to pandemic, most of the labourers have gone back to villages or have refused to work as the fear of second wave is immense. Sometimes PHED, Smart City or municipal corporation have to wait for days to get a work done as labourers are not ready to come even on higher rates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/chaura-rasta-water-pipe-damage-hits-4k-residents/articleshow/82987778.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Poor response continues at vax centres||NAGPUR: Though local authorities are trying their best to motivate eligible beneficiaries in getting them inoculated, the numbers present a sorry figure at the end of each day. On Wednesday, the figures for Nagpur city were almost same as they were a day before. Only slight improvement was noticed as around 150 more beneficiaries in the 45+ age group took the jab at NMC centres. On Tuesday, 2,265 had taken the jab which increased to 2,404 on Wednesday. Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said, “We are expecting at least 5,000 to 6,000 daily vaccination so that in next 25 days around one lakh 45+ age group people are covered. Over 5 lakh in this age band have already taken their first dose. Vaccination is open for both doses for them,” he said. Despite the civic body’s daily appeal, the vaccination is not getting good response. The civic body’s ‘vaccination at your locality’ kicked off with much hope but didn’t make the desired gains. Incidentally, the decline started with the fall in daily Covid cases, though civic officials have ruled this out. New norms and mistrust are still believed to be the reasons behind people remaining reluctant to take the jab. Joshi said many eligible beneficiaries are willing to take the jab but the new gap norms prevent them from getting vaccinated. Some private hospitals said after vaccinated HCWs and FLWs got infected, many are unwilling to take their second dose. Doctors said they are trying to counsel the staff that vaccine won’t give 100% protection but still it is necessary as it is the only available option. The trend was seen across the Nagpur division’s remaining five districts. The figures fell by more than 50% at 6,582 on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/poor-response-continues-at-vax-centres/articleshow/82985794.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Dehradun||U’khand assembly deputy speaker returns ‘faulty’ oximeters purchased by Almora officials to CDO, intimates DM of the issue||Almora: Deputy speaker of the Uttarakhand assembly and Almora MLA Raghunath Singh Chauhan on Wednesday returned all the oximeters purchased by the district officials from MLALAD fund to the chief development officer (CDO). He went down to the office of the CDO to return the medical device after locals told him that they were faulty and giving incorrect readings. Earlier in the day, MLA Chauhan had gone to a village in the district’s Hawalbag block to distribute these oximeters. Soon after the distribution, locals told him that the devices were faulty and giving inaccurate readings. Unhappy with the alleged callousness in the purchase of these devices, the MLA returned them all to the CDO and even wrote a letter to the district magistrate asking him to look into the matter. “I released Rs 1 crore from the MLALAD fund to strengthen the district’s fight against the pandemic. Oximeters were to be distributed and an oxygen plant was to be set up in the district. However, villagers told me that the oximeters were not working fine. Such episodes tarnish the image of the state government,” said MLA Chauhan. He added, “The payment of the company from which oximeters were purchased should be withheld. The GST has been slashed on such medical devices and still some companies are manufacturing sub-standard products, causing great inconvenience to people. I have written to the DM and asked for strict action against the errant company.” When queried on the matter, Navneet Pandey, CDO Almora, told TOI, “We have summoned the officials of Dehradun-based company which sold us the oximeters. If the devices are found faulty, we will blacklist the company.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-assembly-deputy-speaker-returns-faulty-oximeters-purchased-by-almora-officials-to-cdo-intimates-dm-of-the-issue/articleshow/82983979.cms||---

She claimed that he was accompanied by 14 others who attacked her kin, including a nine-year-old boy, and also threatened her with rape. In her FIR with Sabarmati police on Tuesday, the woman said that she had filed an application to register a complaint of molestation against her neighbour last week. After she filed the application, the accused along with his relatives and friends first pelted stones at her house on Monday night. They later allegedly attacked her and her family members with sticks and pipes. She said that they first attacked her with sticks then turned on her uncle and aunt who rushed to her rescue. She said that the accused also thrashed her nine-year-old cousin, who suffered a fracture. She said that they constantly kept threatening her, asking her to withdraw the plea. They also allegedly tried to intimidate her with rape threats. The woman then called up the police control room and later filed a complaint of assault and criminal intimidation along with charges of unlawful assembly against 15 persons including her molester.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/molestation-victim-kin-attacked-for-going-to-cops/articleshow/82985840.cms||---
---||Agra||Two who recovered sans steroids or Oxygen aid get black fungus, doctors probing cases in Agra||AGRA: Two Covid-19 patients, who were never given any steroid or industrial oxygen, have contracted black fungus taking the doctors by surprise in Agra. The two common reasons attributed to the increase in the number of black fungus cases are excessive use of steroids and industrial oxygen in treatment of Covid-19 patients. Both the patients in their 40s stayed in home isolation after getting the Covid-19 infection last month. They took medicines suggested by the ICMR and recovered. Doctors at the SN Medical College are now conducting a detailed study on both of these cases. SNMC principal Dr Sanjay Kala said, “The two patients didn’t use steroids and recovered from Covid-19 at home without any use of oxygen. However, both of them have been suffering from diabetes. We are studying both these cases in detail.” “It is not correct to say that use of steroids and industrial oxygen is the main reason behind the increasing number of black fungus. Last year, we had treated over 3,500 Covid-19 patients. Then also, steroids and antibiotics were provided to the patients but no case of black fungus surfaced. Therefore, the main reason behind the increasing number of black fungus is the change in nature of Coronavirus. The subject is being studied in detail,” he said. Till Wednesday evening, 32 suspected patients of black fungus were admitted at the SN Medical College. Since Saturday, at least four suspected patients of black fungus have died under treatment. Chief medical officer of Agra district Dr RC Pandey said, “We have an in-house facility at SNMC to conduct all the required tests for detection and drugs for treatment of black fungus patients available with us. Most patients in early stages do not know that they have the disease, progression is very rapid. For patients with uncontrolled diabetes, black fungus is life-threatening. Early diagnosis is important for treatment and better outcomes.” District in-charge for black fungus treatment, Dr Akhil Pratap Singh said, “The symptoms of the black fungus vary from person to person. For some patients, the infections can start with strong headache, fever, nasal congestion, facial pain, while for others, it can be loss of vision, toothache, swelling in cheeks or upper jaw, eyes, black crusts in the nose, and sometimes face paralysis. There is a serious chance of dying if the infection reaches the brain. If it is diagnosed at the initial stage, then the patients can be saved.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/2-who-recovered-sans-steroids-or-o2-aid-get-black-fungus-docs-probing-cases/articleshow/82983989.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Raj forms panel to decide fate of university exams||Jaipur: The state government has formed a six-member committee to give suggestions and chart out a plan on conducting university examinations which are being delayed due to pandemic. The order was issued by secretary of higher and technical education Narain Lal Meena on Wednesday and the committee has been asked to submit a report within 15 days. Rajasthan has been under lockdown since April due to which university examinations were indefinitely postponed. In 2020, except for the final year, all students were promoted with passing marks.The order instructed the committee to make a report as to on what dates the examination should be conducted and whether it should be held in online/offline mode in state universities. If there is a scope to promote students in case the government is not able to hold the examination, the committee will suggest ways how to promote students and the timing of the start of the next semester. Last year, all universities had its own formula to decide how to give marks to students. Some universities gave marks attained in internal assessment in the report cards, while some didn’t. Hence, a uniform formula is likely to be suggested by the committee.Vice-chancellor of Dr Bheemrao Ambedkar Law University, Devswaroop, who is also the convener of the committee, said this will help to give a direction to the problem. “The formation of this committee will give direction to the problem faced by the government. It will give clarity of thought and a uniformity of procedure. The exercise on behalf of the government will help everyone to finalise a blue print,” said Devswaroop.The order further stated that the committee will give recommendation if there is a need to reduce the syllabus or the number of hours for writing the examination, to make a formula of examining the answer sheet and distribution of marks. Due to the closure of educational institutions, students enrolled in Teachers Training Programme (B.Ed) were not able to do internship this year. Hence, the committee has been asked to provide an alternative to this.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-forms-panel-to-decide-fate-of-university-exams/articleshow/82987821.cms||---

The order reads, “Rajasthan RERA will work from home and court cases listed for hearing before RERA Authority and Adjudicating officer between May 24 and June 7 will be heard through video conferencing.”The date and time of virtual hearing are communicated through emails and SMSs to both the parties whose cases were at the argument stage.The authority made phone calls, too, to remind and help the parties in facilitating the process and to offer technical help to them. A senior official said, “An official has been appointed to resolve the difficulties and problems in appearing through video conference. A mobile number has been given for the same.”Similarly, Rajasthan Real Estate Appellate Tribunal (REAT) has also started virtual hearings. The tribunal, which was recently constituted in the state, is hearing five to six cases on daily basis since May 24.As per the records, over 40 aggrieved parties approached the appellate tribunal. A source said, “As we have started functioning effectively and cases are being heard, more aggrieved are expected to approach us. The tribunal website will be soon in place.” The Act also mandates states to establish a real estate appellate tribunal. The tribunal is important so that in case home buyers are not satisfied with the decision of an authority, they can approach the tribunal and put in an appeal for relief. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/realty-body-goes-virtual-to-hear-cases/articleshow/82987791.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||YSRC rebel MP Ramakrishna Raju does a Houdini act, flies off to Delhi||HYDERABAD: YSRCP rebel MP Raghu Ramakrishna Raju executed a perfect Houdini act at the Military Hospital (MH) in Secunderabad on Wednesday. Hours later, he surfaced in Delhi. Surprisingly, on Tuesday, the Narasapuram MP had expressed a desire to stay back at the hospital for four more days, citing health reasons. Soon after getting discharged from the hospital, the MP took a flight to Delhi. The dramatic turn of events came days after the Supreme Court granted the MP bail in a criminal case registered against him in Andhra Pradesh. His advocate S Sri Venkatesh said they were apprehensive about his arrest again in a different case lodged by the Andhra Pradesh police. Several criminal cases have been filed against Raju for allegedly spreading hatred against certain communities in the state. Raju had obtained stay in some of these cases from the AP high court. The apex court had granted him bail in the case filed by AP CID, which charged him with spreading hatred in society and creating disaffection against the state government. In the meantime, the CBI court in Hyderabad posted to June 1 the petition filed by Raju seeking cancellation of AP chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy’s bail in the quid pro quo case granted eight years ago. Raju’s counsel S Sri Venkatesh objected when advocates representing CBI and Jagan sought time again to file their counters. He wanted the court to impose costs for these ‘dilatory tactics’ adopted by the respondents. “They need not cite lockdown as a reason, they could as well file their counters online,” he said, objecting to the argument of Jagan’s counsel G Ashok Reddy, who maintained that it was not easy during lockdown to obtain signatures and filing affidavits without any express permission from the authorities to roam around. The judge, however, said that he would hear the matter on June 1 regardless of the status of the counters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ysrc-rebel-mp-raju-does-a-houdini-act-flies-off-to-delhi/articleshow/82989652.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Covid-19: Toll in Maharashtra’s tribal districts 2-4 times higher than in first wave||MUMBAI: The tribal-populated and underdeveloped districts of Maharashtra are among the hardest hit by the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic. In these districts, the number of deaths in the first five months of 2021 is two to four times higher than the toll in the nine months of 2020. A manifold increase in cases has been accompanied by high death burden. Gadchiroli and Nandurbar, with tribal populations of 70% and 38% respectively, have recorded a 267% and 263% increase in deaths compared to last year. In absolute numbers, deaths in Gadchiroli rose from 87 last year to 316 this year, doubling its case fatality rate to 2% in the second wave. Cases increased 125% in the second wave. Deaths in Nandurbar rose from 169 in 2020 to 621 in the second wave and positive cases grew three-fold—from 8,193 in 2020 to 30,336 this year —and CFR remained at 2.05% in both waves. Community health veteran and activist Dr Abhay Bang, who is based in Gadchiroli, said the second wave has been “absolutely devastating” on the population. “The official death numbers are a tip of the iceberg. The tribal population doesn’t believe in rushing to a hospital as they fear testing and isolation and dying away from their families. Many have preferred to die at homes,” he said. Every village that he passed, Dr Bang said, he saw pyres being lit. “Those numbers may not show anywhere,” he said. Though cases in all 36 districts of Maharashtra have jumped during the second wave, 21 of them have had both cases and deaths rising. The state has surpassed last year’s case tally of 19.32 lakh to reach 36.69lakh, but overall confirmed deaths so far this year (39,691) continue to be less than last year’s 49,521. Of the 21 districts that bucked this trend, 11 had more than 100% rise in deaths. Chandrapur in the Vidarbha region registered a near three-fold rise in deaths as cases rose from 23,245 last year to 61,390 this year. From 389, deaths this year increased to 949. Case fatality rate has dipped though from 1.55%. Not too far away in Amravati, believed to be the starting point of the second wave, deaths rose from 381 to 951 in the second wave as positive cases trebled to touch 66,351. Other districts with similar rise in fatality numbers are Sindhudurg, Washim, Gondia, Wardha, Nanded, Hingoli, Parbhani. Former dean of KEM Hospital Dr Avinash Supe, who heads the MMR’s death audit committee, said numbers do indicate that some districts have been hit hard as deaths continue to mount. “Many districts like Amravati are seeing two waves, one of cases followed by a wave of deaths. There is a gap of 2-3 weeks between the two. Worryingly, some of the districts are still simmering,” he said. A senior BMC doctor told TOI that the state must not rejoice a lower CFR since the virus has not yet run its course. The state’s CFR in the second wave is 1.08% compared to 2020’s 2.56%. “The drop in deaths in the mega cities such as Mumbai, Pune, Thane and Nagpur has pulled down the state CFR, but smaller and neglected districts have been hit hard,” he said. In Mumbai, where cases have grown from 2.93lakh to 4.04lakh, deaths have dropped from 11,116 to 3,497. Similarly, in Thane, deaths dropped from 5,577 to 2,385 and Pune from 7,767 to 3,730. A Gadchiroli official said medical knowhow in cities has not percolated to the rest of the state. For the third wave, Dr Bang has suggested that communities and villages should be empowered to manage coronavirus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/toll-in-mahas-tribal-dists-2-4-times-higher-than-in-first-wave/articleshow/82989689.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Meerut||UP: Man molests girl, 11, panchayat 'punishes' him with ‘shoe slaps’||MEERUT: A panchayat in Sardhana ordered that a man, 60, be beaten up with shoes and expelled after he was accused of molesting a minor in his village. Police were informed only after the “verdict” had been passed. On Monday, the parents of the girl, 11, from Chandna village were away working in the fields. The man, Raj Kumar, their neighbour, snuck in and, finding her alone, molested her. Someone chanced upon him and he was caught. But soon, the controversy turned into one about identity — the two were from different castes and each community backed its own member. Police had to be called in as tension rose and it was diffused for the day, a local source said. The following day, a panchayat meeting was organised. After deliberations, the panchayat passed its order — the 60-year-old must be beaten up with shoes and expelled from the village. Those present at the meeting instantly complied, landing blows, thrashing him and hitting him with shoes. After the order had been carried out, he was asked to leave. Police were told about his crime after the panchayat. “The accused, Raj Kumar, has been booked under Section 354 (criminal force to any woman with an intention of disrobing her) and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) Act. He has been arrested and sent to jail,” said Brijesh Kumar, SHO of Sardhana police station. Police, however, denied any such panchayat proceedings took place. Kumar added, “We do not have any information of such a diktat.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/man-molests-girl-11-panchayat-punishes-him-with-shoe-slaps/articleshow/82978509.cms||Sandeep Rai

Lucknow’s Mahabodhi Society of India marked the occasion with live-streaming of rituals and recitation of verses, including ‘bodh vandana’, ‘trisaran panchsheel’ and ‘paritran path’. In the memory of people who succumbed to Covid-19, members of the society paid tributes by lighting 1,000 earthen lamps in the eveningand praying for the pandemic to end. Explaining the religious significance of the day, president of the society Bhante Gyanalok said, “On this day, Lord Buddha was born, attained enlightenment and also ‘nirvana’. It is a triple-blessed day. Devotees take a bath, gather in vihars, and also give alms to monks on this day. Taking into consideration the severity of the pandemic, we live-streamed the programmes online on Facebook.” Those who observe the day reaffirm their faith in the five principles (Panchsheel) of Buddhist belief – not to take life, not to steal, not to lie, refrain from liquor or any other intoxicant, and not to commit adultery.

He along with eight other leaders of the party had resigned from the party membership on Monday, protesting the decisions of the new island administration. Hashim said that the statements from BJP leaders in Kerala against Lakshadweep hurt them the most. “We joined the BJP with the intention of bringing development to the islands. But what is going on here now is plain autocratic governance by the administrator. He doesn’t listen to anyone and forces his orders on us. We decided to quit as the administrator’s rule is disrupting the life of the islanders,” said Hashim. He said that the party’s Kerala leadership was commenting without consulting with the Lakshadweep wing of the party. “A senior leader from Kerala said before the media that terrorist activities and drug trafficking was going on in Lakshadweep. They are planning to put blame on the islanders even for seizure of contraband from boats in the sea, several nautical miles away from the island. We decided to quit as we couldn’t stand such false narratives against our islands,” said Hashim. Besides Hashim, former state vice-president MC Muthukoya, former state treasurer B Shukoor, former unit president MI Mohammed, members PP Jamhar, Anwar Hussain, Afsal N and Ramees N had tendered their resignations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ex-gen-secy-of-yuva-morcha-slams-bjp/articleshow/82985847.cms||---

The crucial highway got blocked after a 50-metre-long stretch of the road at the Radang bend, about eight kilometres ahead of Lambagad in Chamoli district, caved in following a heavy rain spell in the district on May 20. Since then, the Border Road Organisation (BRO) has been working round the clock to repair the damaged part of the road, according to the district authorities. Nand Kishore Joshi, disaster management officer of Chamoli district, had told TOI on Tuesday that the highway would be reopened on Wednesday as the majority of repair work would be completed by then. “The delay was mainly due to the difficult terrain,” said Joshi. It is to be noted that road widening work under the Char Dham All-Weather Road Project has been underway at the Radang bend, making it vulnerable for the landslide. Meanwhile, a fresh landslide occurred at Totaghati on Rishikesh-Badrinath National Highway on Monday night when large boulders tumbled down the hill slope blocking the road. However, the boulders were removed on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/rishikesh-badrinath-highway-opens-after-seven-days-as-repair-work-finishes/articleshow/82984010.cms||Gaurav Talwar

The single bench of Justice Mahendra Goyal order followed a petition by Bhanwar Singh and others. The court said the petitioners would pay only 40 per cent of the bank guarantee/exclusive privilege account for the period of lockdown and the remaining once normal business activities resume, said R B Mathur, counsel for the petitioner. The court said on account of prevailing pandemic situation, normal business of the petitioners had been hampered. The shops were permitted to open from 6am to 11am five days a week. Still, it could not be disputed and denied that their normal business was adversely hampered in the wake of the lockdown imposed by the state government. “In these circumstances, the petitioners are directed to pay in addition to excise duty on the quantity of liquor lifted by them, 40 per cent of the monthly instalment of the exclusive privilege amount/bank guarantee for the period of lockdown.” The petitioners should pay the balance amount of monthly instalment of exclusive privilege amount/bank guarantee once they are permitted to carry out their regular business.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-hc-grants-relief-to-liquor-traders-on-bank-guarantee/articleshow/82987868.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||3,500 junior doctors strike work, Telangana CM ups stipend||HYDERABAD: On a day of high drama, 3,500 junior doctors boycotted elective duties across government hospitals on Wednesday seeking better wages and facilities, and vowed to continue their strike, even as chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao acceded to some of their demands. Hours after KCR promised a 15 per cent increase in the honorarium paid to senior residents and appealed to the junior doctors to join duties immediately, they decided to intensify their strike instead, which could now see scores of Covid-19 patients suffering as well. Demanding assurance of better treatment and beds for Covid-19 hit healthcare workers and their immediate family members and 15 per cent hike in stipend, the strike took hold in almost all state-run hospitals during the day. The ENT PGs went on strike in Gandhi Hospital and have demanded a separate wing for mucormycosis and Covid-19 patients. At the Gandhi Hospital, which is the nodal centre for Covid-19 treatment, seniors handled duties as the juniors were not seen in the wards. “We pursued for approval of hike with officials regularly since last six months. The 10 per cent incentive that was announced for healthcare workers has not been implemented till date,” the strike notice had read. “In this second wave we are seeing so many youngsters dying and knowing that we might be unable to find a bed is a demotivating factor,” said a junior doctor who protested at the Gandhi Hospital. Though the CM extended the enhanced honorarium to even the medical students who are engaged in the Covid-19 duties after their three years of MBBS course and ordered better medical facilities to junior doctors and their family members at NIMS, Telangana Junior Doctors Association vice-president M Kalyani told TOI that they were yet to take a decision on calling off the strike. “We are demanding 15 per cent hike for junior doctors with retrospective effect from January 2020, ex gratia of Rs 50 lakh for the family members of junior doctors who die of coronavirus, allotment of beds in Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences for healthcare workers including junior doctors, their spouse and parents for free treatment of Covid-19, and 10 per cent risk allowance among other demands,” Kalyani said. KCR said if their demands were justified, the government has no objection to solve them. They can put those demands before the government and get them resolved. “But it is not proper to abstain from duties under the pretext of strike without understanding the situation, and causing inconvenience to the patients. Moreover, going on strike during the present medical emergency caused by the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic is not correct. No one will appreciate it. Not even the people,” KCR said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/3-5k-jr-doctors-strike-work-kcr-ups-stipend/articleshow/82989721.cms||Roushan Ali

In the second wave, around 1,200 jawans at the Rajasthan and Gujarat borders got infected and more than 300 jawans are still undergoing treatment. More than 900 jawans have returned to duty after defeating coronavirus and are discharging their duty with complete alertness. These jawans are not only helping the border population in the health sector, but also in providing ration, water etc. More than 35,000 jawans are deployed at the Indo-Pak international border adjoining Rajasthan and Gujarat borders. During April 1 to 25, around 350 jawans and officers got infected at BSF Rajasthan frontier, while around 850 jawans were infected at Gujarat frontier. At present, around 150 jawans are corona-positive and are asymptomatic, and are undergoing treatment at various hospitals of BSF. Similarly, at Gujarat frontier, around 200 jawans are undergoing treatment for Covid. The good news is that BSF jawans and officers deployed at Gujarat and Rajasthan frontier have taken two doses of vaccine, due to which not many got infected this time and the death rate is low. Only at the Gujarat frontier, three jawans have died. BSF Rajasthan frontier IG Pankaj Ghumar said that all jawans and officers of Rajasthan frontier have been administered vaccine due to which this time, the infection did not spread much. Majority of them have defeated the virus and now are guarding the country’s border. He said that these jawans, along with fighting Covid, are helping the villagers by providing health facilities along with providing ration etc. Jaisalmer sector south in 149th battalion organized a civic action camp led by commandant Shivanand Yadav where villagers were distributed items of need. Bikaner sector DIG Pushpendra Singh Rathore said that two fully equipped ambulances are being used to ferry the coronavirus patients in villages to the nearest health centre. Apart from this, a hospital with ICU beds has been prepared for the patients at sector headquarters, which is again first in the sector. BSF at many places is providing food packets and food items to the needy. Similarly, Gujarat frontier DIG ML Garg said that on the directions of IG BSF GS Malik, a quarantine centre has been made at each battalion to deal with the infection, where jawans are put on quarantine on seeing symptoms. Hundreds of jawans after the treatment by BSF have recovered and are on duty at the borders. Apart from this, quarantine centres have been made in border outposts where jawans are quarantined.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/1200-bsf-men-hit-by-virus-but-no-let-up-in-vigil-on-indo-pak-border/articleshow/82985877.cms||---

The units will come up at Bandh Road, Aya Nagar and Ghitorni. Four new CNG-based cremation sites had already been added in the city during the pandemic, with two sites each under South and East Delhi Municipal Corporations. The municipal health officer from public health department had earlier written to DDA for allocation of land at three village sites in November 2020 to set up CNG/electric furnaces. DDA has now written to revenue department to hand over the land pockets. It added that the land for the three sites had not been handed over to DDA by the respective revenue department after urbanisation yet. Ved Pal, the area councillor, said these three sites were located on gram sabha land, and each had just a couple of cremation platforms. “As the number of deaths increased during pandemic, people had to wait 5-6 hours for their turn. Therefore, I pushed the demand to set up CNG crematoria at these locations,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/3-crematoria-to-come-up-on-dda-land/articleshow/83017605.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

This has taken the toll for the disease to 25 in city hospitals with an average of three deaths daily since May 18, when the first death was reported. Meanwhile, 24 more patients were admitted in various hospitals. All four deceased patients were men and getting treatment in other hospitals before being referred to KGMU. Three of them had Covid-19 and had contracted black fungus during treatment. The fourth was a diabetic who had survived Covid-19 but got infected due to low immunity. The two Lucknow residents—a 60-year-old from Nawabganj and a 47-year-old from Gosainganj—died due to respiratory failure. The other two—from Kannauj and Farrukhabad—died due to septicemia as the fungal infection had reached the brain, said KGMU doctors. While 21 more mucormycosis patients were admitted to KGMU in the past 24 hours, three came to Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences, taking the number of patients currently under treatment at KGMU to 170 and overall in the city to 230. “KGMU’s ENT department has conducted surgeries on 17 patients to remove infected tissue. Doctors have performed 103 dead tissue removal surgeries on black fungus cases,” said university spokesperson Dr Sudhir Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/black-fungus-snuffs-out-four-lives-at-kgmu-grips-24-more/articleshow/82987895.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan
---||Dehradun||Farmers in Terai, Roorkee observe "black day", burn effigies of Union Govt||Rudrapur/Roorkee: Farmers in various towns of Terai region, Uttarakhand’s “rice bowl”, observed “black day” on Wednesday to mark six months of the farmers’ agitation against the Centre’s three contentious farm laws. Farmers carried black flags and burned effigies in protest. Congress and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) supported the farmers’ cause. In Jaspur, farmers led by Sheetal Singh, secretary of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), protested at the sub divisional magistrate's (SDM) office and submitted a memorandum addressed to the President of India, demanding repeal of the farm laws. The farmers then hoisted black flags and burnt an effigy of the Central government. In Kashipur, farmers led ‘jathas’ (processions led by Sikhs) and burnt the Centre’s effigy. Farmers in Gadarpur, Kichha, Sitarganj, Nanakmatta and Khatima towns of the district also took out protest marches, carrying black flags and raising slogans against the Union government. “The struggle will continue until the laws are repealed. We owe it to those who sacrificed their lives in the struggle and to our future generations,” said Najot Singh Bhullar, a farmer from Kichha. Vikramjeet Singh, a farmer from Bigwada village, said that the farmers will never desist. “The struggle has not exhausted us. It has rather strengthened our zeal. People like me go to the dharna site every week, fighting for our rights, because we understand that struggles yield results,” he said. Meanwhile, the protest was rather muted in Udham Singh Nagar district headquarters Rudrapur, where only Congress party members staged a dharna at Gandhi Park, where former minister Tilak Raj Behar delivered a speech. “The farmers’ agitation has completed six months. A large number of farmers have left their families and are sitting at the border but the Union government has shown them no sensitivity. Congress stands in solidarity with the protesting farmers and urges the government to hold talks with them with a positive mindset,” Behar said. In Roorkee and Gurkul Narsan, black day was observed on the call of BKU leader Naresh Tikait. “It was the biggest mistake of farmers to cast their votes for BJP. They looted us with both hands after imposing the farm laws. We are waiting to uproot their government at the Centre. The Black Day protest was observed with adherence to Covid guidelines,” said Padam Singh Rod, vice president of Uttarakhand unit of BKU at a government guest house where he presented a memorandum against the farm laws to the additional sub divisional magistrate Puran Singh Rana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/farmers-in-terai-roorkee-observe-black-day-burn-effigies-of-union-govt/articleshow/82983998.cms||Aakash Ahuja

---||Ahmedabad||Birthdate mismatch invites FIR under Passport Act||Ahmedabad: If you have a discrepancy in you birth dates on two documents, it needs to be sorted out because it will invite legal action if an application for a passport is made. This has happened to a 22-year-old man from Naroda, whose date of birth is different on two documents and the authorities slapped charges under the Passport Act against him after he made an application to modify his birth place details. According to the FIR filed at Gujarat University police station, Darshil Patel, a resident of Shreeji Bungalows Society in Naroda, got a passport issued on February 13, 2019, in which his date of birth was July 8, 1998. He had then produced his Class X marksheet as proof. On May 27, 2019, Patel filed an application at the passport service centre in Mithakhali, to change place of his birth on his passport from Naroda in Ahmedabad to Pardhol village in Daskroi taluka of Ahmedabad district. Patel produced his birth certificate where his date of birth was July 8, 1998. The application was forwarded to the regional passport office in Gulbai Tekra where an inquiry was initiated before making a change to the passport. An officer of the regional passport office directed a talati to check the village panchayat documents to verify Patel’s birthplace. Though Patel’s birthplace was right, but his date of birth was different. In the village panchayat documents, Patel’s date of birth was September 8, 1998. When Patel was summoned and asked about this, he told officers of the regional passport office that there may be some mistake on the part of the two different authorities — the village panchayat and his school — where two different dates were mentioned. Investigating officer R C Dhummad said Patel did not commit forgery and this was a mistake either by the school or village panchayat. As he was careless in not verifying his birth date with the village panchayat or school, he has been charged with certain sections of the Passport Act which has provisions for imprisonment of up to six months. On May 19, Gujarat University police a booked a man from Mehsana for forgery as he produced a forged Class X marksheet to get a passport.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/birthdate-mismatch-invites-fir-under-passport-act/articleshow/82985911.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Anti-corruption crusader who rattled political class||Bengaluru: Freedom fighter HS Doreswamy was an epitome of Gandhian principles as he followed them in letter and spirit. He never sought power but his imposing presence in the political firmament was so powerful to rattle the governments in Karnataka irrespective of which party ruled. He believed that the words ‘freedom’ and ‘independence’ would never mean anything for the common man if his life continues to be dogged by corruption and economic inequality in Independent India. Hence, his campaigns were always themed on issues like corruption and land encroachment. And, in his endeavour, he spared neither Congress nor BJP when they were in power. “Doreswamy used to say the poor will never get a dignified life if they don’t own a piece of land and without dignity, ‘freedom’ would just be a dictionary word for them,” said Mallige, state secretary of Karnataka Janashakthi, who accompanied the veteran in the Diddahalli land movement in Madikeri in 2010.The movement was aimed at getting land rights for coffee estate labourers, who lived in dingy huts called ‘linemane’ on farm lands, and it went on to antagonise powerful landlords and politicians. Thanks to the uncompromising and unwavering leadership of Doreswamy, the government granted four acres of revenue land to each 520 households.His fight continued in Bengaluru against land grabbers and he blamed the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike officials for letting fresh encroachments on the land be recovered. While the AT Ramaswamy committee estimated that over 44,000 acres had been encroached in the city, BBMP had taken back only 15,833 acres. In 2017, the government had to face the wrath of the Gandhian and after a 36-day agitation and sit-in in front of the office of the then law and parliamentary affairs minister TB Jayachandra, the Siddaramiah-led government obliged to set up a special court to try those accused of land encroachment.“He was the conscience keeper of all of us, who are in public life. He was there to lash the whip when we erred and pat on the back for our good job,” said former chief minister Siddaramiah.The man, who fought for the land rights of the poor, however, never hankered for a piece of land for himself. Siddaramaiah had offered a house to his family and his wife Lalithamma was even willing to take it. However, Doreswamy chose to live in a rented house in Jayanagar till he breathed his last. The Siddaramaiah government came under his attack for separating the Anti-Corruption Bureau from Lokayutka.Doreswamy was no stranger to controversy. His comment on Veer Savarkar and the BJP ideology had prompted the party leaders to question his credentials as a freedom fighter. The controversy died down with Doreswamy showing a certificate of his imprisonment during the freedom struggle between 1942 and 1943.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/anti-corruption-crusader-who-rattled-political-class/articleshow/82985904.cms||---

The notice has been issued after a man, Leeladhar Nailwal, alleged that the hospital charged Rs 3.75 lakh for his Covid-19 treatment even though he had an Ayushman Card. The directorate had, on May 21, issued a notice to the hospital directing it to refund the money but it received a reply stating that the hospital is registered under the Ayushman scheme only for children and infant care. The directorate, however, has refused the argument terming it baseless and said that the hospital was authorised by the health department in October 2020 to treat Covid-19 patients, including those holding Ayushman cards, and therefore, the medical facility cannot refuse to treat the patients holding Ayushman cards. The directorate has now said that the amount owed by the hospital to Nailwal will be recovered by withholding its claim of Rs 2.03 lakh.

The BJP speaks the most for cow conservation and it's board itself has violated the cow conservation laws. Of the 227 missing bovine animals, 167 were calves,” the minister said on Wednesday.The Udaipur Municipal Corporation has been in controversy for release of the cows that had been caught from the streets and kept in the shelter home at Balicha. They were kept here for a year and only few of the owners came to get their animals and the rest were released in the Kewde ki Naal sanctuary by the civic body. Khachariyawas said the state government runs gaushalas through municipalities for the conservation of cows. He added that if the UMC was incapable of keeping the cows, it should have approached volunteering organisations for help as many people are willing to serve the cows. By discarding the cows in the forest, the UMC has committed a grave crime and the mayor and officials are answerable to the people who are hurt by the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/state-govt-to-probe-cattle-deaths-in-udaipur/articleshow/82985938.cms||---

A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh asked the government to take immediate action. With the direction, the court disposed of the petition by a JNU student, who claimed that she had tested Covid-positive while staying on the varsity campus, and since there was no quarantine facility there, she was transferred to the Sultanpuri Isolation Centre. She added that to her “utter shock” the quarantine centre was unhygienic and no facilities were given to the patients. During her four-day stay, she had found that “patients were suffering severely not only on account of their illness, but also due to the negligence of the authorities in providing them with basic facilities like sanitation, food, medicines, regular doctor visits, proper monitoring of oxygen, etc”. She had also alleged that “not a single person visits these wards, be it a doctor or nurse”. She had sought appointment of a court commissioner to visit the facility and directions to Delhi government “to follow the recommendation issued by WHO and the guidelines issued by NCDC for implementing quarantine”. pti||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/take-action-on-pil-claiming-poor-state-of-quarantine-centre-hc/articleshow/83017646.cms||---

Covid pandemic has led to severe shortage of manpower, which has pushed back the completion of all major under-construction projects by about six to eight months. The officials in AMC and Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority said projects have been delayed as labourers left the state during lockdown, and have just started returning slowly. They said that Bopal, Godhavi, Ghuma, and Shela areas were supposed to get 24x7 Narmada water supply by mid-2021, but the project has been delayed by over eight months. The new deadline for this project is early 2022. Similarly, AMC and AUDA officials said that even the three overbridge projects near Science City and Bopal-Karnavati Crossroads on S P Ring Road as well as the one in Dehgam will also get delayed by over six months. The officials said that contractors have demanded increase in payment as there has been a rise in the cost of steel and cement. The officials said that the AMC is evaluating each and every project after which they will consider if they need to increase the price or extend the deadline.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/24x7-water-in-bopal-shela-only-next-year/articleshow/82985951.cms||---

Highlighting the importance of putting up a progressive face of Goa 60 years after Liberation, the group has volunteered to set up a task force of professionals to guide the government in implementing their recommendations. Cyclones, becoming a regular phenomenon, a well-planned project to transfer all overhead cables underground is the “need of the hour”, the IT workforce of Goa has stated, adding that this layout must be made available to all road contractors so that there is no unintended damage. The group of professionals has also requested the directorate of health services to have a comprehensive statewide hospital management system with all information available at the fingertips of citizens in real time. “During a sickness in the family, the patient should not be made to run from pillar to post and make umpteen calls on always busy helplines searching for a hospital bed. Health records of patients should be available to doctors digitally…. patients should get a paperless experience. With current technology, this is certainly possible with several established software vendors offering this service,” GITP stated. It is also essential to diversify Goa’s industry which is still mainly tourism. “We have already seen that in order to keep the economy alive, the government was constrained in applying stringent measures in the state. It is now necessary to look beyond tourism and focus on IT, Electronics systems design and management (ESDM) and manufacturing which have been highly resilient in continuing their business in the pandemic,” the group stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/it-professionals-for-underground-power-cabling/articleshow/82987969.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Mithali is in hard quarantine with the Indian team in a Mumbai hotel ahead of their tour of England, but has started an initiative to help autorickshaw drivers. “Distribution of food grains and a small amount for sustenance being given to auto drivers by the Mithali Raj initiative. Dad doing the honours in my absence. Only problem is his mask," she tweeted, gently chiding her father for not wearing the mask properly. Mithali, who has the rare distinction of scoring 10,000 runs in international cricket across formats, had personally distributed essential commodities to the needy when she was at home last year. In her absence now, her father Dorai Raj distributed essentials to cab drivers and vendors over the last few days. “Several people have lost their livelihood because of the pandemic and lockdown. Our’s is a small initiative to help the needy,” Mithali’s mother Leela Raj told TOI on Wednesday. “We are providing rice, wheat, dal, oil, other essentials and some money to buy vegetables,” she added. “Actually, the purpose of our initiative is different. We launched it last year. But due to the lockdown, we could not go ahead with our project. But with a lot of people suffering now, we decided to take the initiative forward and help them in a small way,” she added. Auto drivers apart, help to the underprivileged children is also on the cards. “Our plan is to help talented underprivileged children with rural background achieve their dreams. It’s not just cricket, we want to cover all other sports. Our aim is provide them with sports kits, help them train in the best of academies so that they can achieve their dreams,” Leela Raj added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/mithali-pads-up-for-covid-hit-provides-essentials-to-needy/articleshow/82989757.cms||---

In its recently-issued SOP, the government stated that people travelling between Kumaon and Garhwal – via roads of adjoining districts of Uttar Pradesh – do not need an RT-PCR negative report but would have to register themselves on the Smart City portal. The move has been initiated to help authorities keep a record of the people visiting the hills and other areas. In the second phase of Covid-19, there has been a significant rise in the number of infections recorded in the nine hill districts of Uttarakhand. Therefore, the people travelling from four plain districts — Dehradun, Nainital, Haridwar and Udham Singh Nagar — to the other nine hill districts have been asked to carry an RT- PCR-negative report of not earlier than 72 hours. The SOP adds that vehicles should not have more passengers beyond its 50% seating capacity. Meanwhile, agriculture minister and state government spokesperson Subodh Uniyal said, “The officials of the districts have been alerted to keep a strict vigil at the border and all entry points. Besides, teams have been deployed to check the RT-PCR report of people visiting hills from the four plain districts.” He added, “All the people coming from other states are expected to produce the RT-PCR negative report and also register on Smart City portal.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/people-travelling-between-kumaon-garhwal-dont-need-rt-pcr-report/articleshow/82984052.cms||Kautilya Singh

Transport minister Pratapsingh Khachariyawas said the government had released Rs 40 crore to pay the delayed dues. The employees, however, said a permanent solution needed to be found so that their salaries do not get delayed every month. Salaries of nearly 20,000 employees and pensioners have been getting delayed for over three years. The employees claimed that they have received assurances, but the delays have become a permanent fixture and had approached the transport minister regarding the same. Rajasthan State Roadways Employees Union president ML Yadav said, “Since 2017, irrespective of which party was ruling in the state, monthly dues get delayed regulalrly. The roadways department gets a financial grant from the state government using which we are given our salaries. Some sort of solution needs to be found because all of us depend on our salaries and pensions to run households.” He added that delay of at least a fortnight has become a regular occurrence for the last few years and the government needed to find a permanent solution.

The exodus of labourers during the fourth Covid peak since April 2020, which is often referred to as the second wave, has been one of the major reasons. At least four flyovers with high passenger car units (PCU) per hour scores are all facing a delay mainly due to the shortage of labour. These flyovers are coming up in Naroda, near Ajit Mill, in Khokhra, and near CIMS Hospital. AMC officials said that they are currently operating with 35% labour attendance. “After the 2020 lockdown, construction has stopped twice — once in July and then in November —due to the Covid surge,” said a senior AMC official in the roads and bridges division. “This has affected the projects significantly as new labour contractors have to be engaged.” Only two flyovers — on Rajendra Park Road and at Viratnagar Crossroads — will be ready in a month, senior AMC officials said. “The flyover over Viratnagar junction was to be inaugurated in April but then the pandemic surged,” said another senior AMC official. “Right now, finishing touches are being given to the 548m bridge. The project was completed for Rs 36.5 crore.” It is estimated that close to 2 lakh vehicles cross the junction daily, he said. “The flyover will be a huge relief for commuters who cross the junction every day,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/four-flyovers-in-city-face-delays-of-up-to-eight-months/articleshow/82986004.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Inspiration, comrade in armsfor young activists across state||Bengaluru: Be it the ‘India Against Corruption’ movement, struggle against the mining lobby, Save Lokayukta campaign or Arkavathy Layout-related protests, freedom fighter HS Doreswamy was in the forefront of most peaceful demonstrations in Karnataka over the past few decades. The ageing Gandhian’s energy matched that of young activists who he not only inspired but marched with shoulder to shoulder. He was the go-to man for activists who felt the idea of India born on August 15, 1947 appeared to be under threat. He’s regale them with anecdotes from his satyagraha days. Young activists recall he was always for peaceful campaigning. Srinivas Alavilli, head, Covid participation, Janaagraha, recalls his recurring question: ‘There are hundreds of organisations in Bengaluru but why don’t they work together?’ “Doreswamy was a rare soul who fought for our freedom and continued to fight for our rights after 1947. Not a week passed without him giving voice to the voiceless and sitting in dharnas, true to his Gandhian methods. The audience would be spellbound by every word he spoke,” said Alavilli. “The best tribute we can give to the man who dedicated his life to the service of the nation is to work together, across ideologies and affiliations and contribute to nation building,” Alavilli said. Prithvi Reddy of Aam Aadmi Party recalled an incident from the 2012 India Against Corruption protest. “He was against corruption, not any particular party. When the stage was taken over by the then ruling party in the state to score petty brownie points over its rival which was at the helm in the Centre, he walked off the stage. He refrained from commenting against that party. He made us sit in the rain and said it’s fine to get drenched once in a while as it makes you fit. He was a man of integrity,” he said. He added that in the last year of his life, Doreswamy yearned to participate in protests against the government’s handling of the Covid pandemic and lockdown. “He was angry with us that we didn't protest,” Reddy said. He recalled that Doreswamy was impressed with the mohalla clinics and government schools of Delhi and wanted to visit them. S Varalakshmi, president, Karnataka State Anganwadi Workers’ Association, said that the biggest lesson from him was not to stop protesting and keep questioning till one achieves the desired result. “He was simple, so influential, but never asked anything for himself or his family. He was with us in our protest for a wage hike for mid-day meal workers and ASHA workers,” she added. Activist Ravi Krishna Reddy said Doreswamy was his guide. “He believed in peaceful protest. He was not emotional and emphasised facts while taking decisions. We need to celebrate his life,” he added. In June 2012, Doreswamy was among activists detained by police during the Save Lokayukta campaign at Freedom Park. Protestors wanted to meet the chief minister to urge him to appoint a Lokayukta. Doreswamy, then 98 years old, was not upset by the police action was seen conversing with activists about the next course of action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/inspiration-comrade-in-armsfor-young-activists-across-state/articleshow/82986080.cms||Sunitha Rao R
---||Delhi||BJP slams Kejriwal over his vaccination comments, accuses him of making U-turn||New Delhi: BJP on Wednesday slammed Arvind Kejriwal for his Pakistan reference while criticising the Centre’s vaccination programme and accused the Delhi CM of doing “politics of self-promotion” and asked him to desist from “abuse and accuse” tactics. BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said Kejriwal had earlier advocated decentralisation of the vaccination programme and opening it up, but after the Centre did so, he has taken a “U-turn” and is indulging in “lies, misinformation and credit-taking”. Speaking on the Centre’s decision to allow states to approach vaccine manufacturers for procurement, the Delhi CM had said, “It is something like Pakistan declaring a war on India and then they ask if Delhi has manufactured a nuclear bomb and Uttar Pradesh bought a tank.... It is the central government’s responsibility to procure and supply vaccines. Delhi can be held accountable if they (the Centre) give us vaccines and we do not open up centres.” Patra said Kejriwal was seeking evidence when India was indeed in a war with Pakistan, referring to the surgical strikes by the Indian forces inside Pakistani territory to target terror camps. He said, “Kejriwal appears to be doing politics of self-promotion. Now is not the time for such politics ... The AAP chief should shun accuse and abuse tactics.” The BJP functionary asked the Delhi CM to apologise for his “mistake” of not taking adequate measures to deal with the recent surge in Covid-19 cases in the national capital. Meanwhile, Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta and leader of opposition in Delhi assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri claimed that the AAP government is trying to mislead the people on vaccination shortage. In a press conference, where East Delhi MP Gautam Gambhir was also present, Gupta claimed that when the second phase of vaccination started from March 1, Kejriwal said that if the Centre permitted the state could directly order the vaccines from the manufacturing companies. “After the Centre gave permission, his government has done nothing to procure vaccines,” said Gupta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-slams-kejriwal-over-his-vaccination-comments-accuses-him-of-making-u-turn/articleshow/82986035.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The BJP state president Surendran and other leaders alleged that concerted efforts are going on to falsely implicate the party leaders. The looting incident had taken place on April 3, and the money was allegedly being transported in a car for election funding of a national political party. Meanwhile, SIT officials recovered Rs 9 lakh from the house of the sixth accused Martin at Vellangallur. Police had questioned him in jail and recovery was based on his statements. The money was kept concealed underneath a crushed stone heap. He had also reportedly purchased a car and some gold after the looting incident, police said.  Loktantrik Janata Dal leader Salim Madavoor said he would approach the high court to press for an enquiry by the Enforcement Directorate into the heist case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/highway-heist-case-sit-questions-bjp-leader-kartha/articleshow/82986039.cms||T Ramavarman
---||Dehradun||Open more counters at DMC office to issue death certificates: Mayor||Dehradun: Having issued less than 1,000 death certificates against 1,474 deaths in Dehradun between April 20 and May 10, Dehradun mayor has asked the officials to open more counters at Dehradun Municipal Corporation office to expedite the process. However, the officials managing the work said the counters cannot be increased as of now to avoid large gatherings on the DMC premises. Each day, around 25 tokens are being given to people for submitting the documents. Certificates are also being made on the spot in most cases, officials said. The officials also added that most of the private hospitals issue death certificates after it is applied for online while Doon Hospital has been given the authority to issues death certificates within 24 hours of a Covid death. Senior municipal health officer, RK Singh said, “It can be risky if we allow more people to stand in queue. However, we are making sure that people don’t have to come repeatedly to get certificates. We are handing over the certificates on the spot.” Sharan Singh, whose elder brother died of covid-19 two weeks ago, said, “As if losing someone in the family is not enough, getting the death certificate from the hospital to process other formalities of insurance and family pension is only adding to the woes. In such times, online facilities should be enabled to help people get their work done without any hassle.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/open-more-counters-at-dmc-office-to-issue-death-certificates-mayor/articleshow/82984060.cms||---
---||Mumbai||End capitation fee in medical colleges: National Medical Commission||MUMBAI: Almost two years after the National Medical Commission (NMC) Act was passed, the commission has released draft guidelines on fixing fees in private and deemed medical colleges across the country. Once these norms are passed, fees for 50% MBBS and postgraduate medical seats in these colleges will be regulated. The commission has listed over 25 guidelines, ranging from not charging exorbitant sums as security deposits to not including all hospital expenses while computing the cost for providing medical education. It has disallowed capitation fees in any form and said colleges must adhere to the ‘not-for-profit’ model. TimesViewThe NMC should ensure that the draft fee fixation guidelines are implemented before the next academic session begins and does not remain only on paper. A stringent audit process needs to be in place to ensure colleges do not find loopholes in the norms. With limited seats in government medical institutions, it is about time the Centre takes measures to make private education affordable for meritorious students.Parents say once implemented, the rules will bring relief to thousands of meritorious students who cannot pursue medical education in private and deemed colleges due to the steep fees. In Maharashtra, private colleges charge up to Rs 16 lakh per annum while deemed colleges charge up to Rs 25 lakh per annum as fees. “It is already two years, and we hope these draft regulations are implemented before the next academic session begins. It will bring relief to meritorious students who are unable to pursue these courses from private institutions,” said a health ministry official. The guidelines state that only operating cost should be primarily considered to determine fees. “The fees can be fixed for a block of three years or on a year-to-year basis and should remain the same for the entire duration of study, subject to inflation adjustment,” the draft said. Fees in newly established colleges should be decided on an ad-hoc basis, based on the fee structure of a recently established college in the state. “Since the expenditure in the Covid-19 pandemic year will not depict the true picture --- as hostel and mess expenses dropped, and expenses in hospitals and doctors’ allowances and salaries went up --- the state fee regulatory body can consider the average financial result of the previous three years,” said the statement. The expert group has recommended linking the development fee of 6-15% of the operating cost to the performance of the college in a rating system, which is in the pipeline. The amount of security deposits should not be considered for calculating fees and interest on the deposits may be deducted from the operating costs, it said. The dean of a leading deemed medical college said the guidelines need to be studied. “Most deemed colleges will oppose the idea of the government regulating fees in 50% seats. Our autonomy will be affected. Since it is open to suggestions, we are going to write to the NMC after studying the draft,” said the dean. Jasmine Gogri, a medical education counsellor, said it is a great initiative and should put an end to the under-the-table donations taken in the name of spot admissions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/end-capitation-fee-inmed-colleges-nmc/articleshow/82989798.cms||Yogita Rao

The move will boost availability of sand in the state and check illegal mining. After nearly three-and-a-half-years, three leaseholders have been allowed to excavate sand in Kotadi (Bhilwara), Jalore and Syala (Jalore). There 82 large lease holders for sand mining in the state. “After the completion of the replenishment study, the lease holders had received environmental clearance (EC) on October 16, 2020. So, it was decided to allow these large operators to mine sand,” an official with the mining department said. On November 16, 2017, the Supreme Court had restrained 82 lease holders in the state from mining sand and bajri. Since then, many infrastructure and private housing projects have come to a standstill. Consumers were purchasing sand illegally after paying an exorbitant price. “Finally, people and those associated with the trade can heave a sigh of relief. The sand mafia has been illegally excavating bajri and selling it at higher rates, hitting both legitimate traders and residents. We appreciate the move and thank the government for restarting the process in a legal manner,” said Naveen Sharma, president, All Rajasthan Bajri Truck Operators Welfare Society. According to officials, the demand of the remaining 79 large leaseholders is pending in the Supreme court. After the central empowered committee (CEC) had recommended issuing environmental clearance (EC) to valid lease holders, the hearing was scheduled on April 15. However, it has been postponed after the second Covid-19 wave hit the nation, a source said. The CEC report had recommended MoEF to issue EC to all valid lease holders recommended by the expert appraisal committee (EAC) without insisting on the submission of scientific study report as a precondition to grant EC within a period of three months. According to sources, out of the 82 large leases, the EAC recommended 65. “The final nod will be given by the Supreme Court,” said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sand-mining-raj-gives-nod-to-3-leaseholders/articleshow/82987999.cms||---

WhatsApp’s refusal to comply with the guidelines is a clear act of defiance of a measure whose intent can certainly not be doubted,” the government said in a combative rebuttal to the company’s decision to petition the court against implementation of the new IT rules which, among other things, mandate companies to give out the original source of an unlawful/inflammatory viral message within 72 hours. Read AlsoGoogle and Facebook may comply, but stand of Twitter not clearAmid growing controversy over the new IT rules, the government on Wednesday asked large social media platforms to immediately report their status of compliance with the new mandate. While the stand of Twitter is still not clear, Facebook and Google have indicated to the government that they will beAmidst allegations that rollout of the new laws would impact the privacy of citizens as WhatsApp would have to do away the end-to-end encryption of user chats, IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad came out with an explanation, saying the government “is committed to ensure the right of privacy to all its citizens, but at the same time it is also the responsibility of the government to maintain law and order and ensure national security.” He further said that “as per all established judicial dictum, no fundamental right, including the Right to Privacy, is absolute and it is subject to reasonable restrictions. The requirements in the intermediary guidelines pertaining to the first originator of information are an example of such a reasonable restriction.” Read AlsoWhatsApp moves high court against new IT rules, terms them unconstitutionalFiling a petition in the Delhi high court on the first day of the implementation of the new IT guidelines and rules which mandate top social media companies (such as WhatsApp, Facebook, Google and Twitter) to identify the source of an unlawful message within 72 hours, the top instant messenger saidIt said that the rule to trace the first originator of information is mandatory for each and every significant social media intermediary, irrespective of their method of operation. It could be done through breaking encryption, or any other technical measure. “Such requirements are only in case when the message is required for prevention, investigation or punishment of very serious offences related to the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign states, or public order, or of incitement to an offence relating to the above or in relation with rape, sexually explicit material or child sexual abuse material.” The government said that in cases of mob lynching and riots etc, there have been instances of repeated WhatsApp messages that are circulated and recirculated whose content are already in public domain. “Hence, the role of who originated is very important.” Also, it sought to assuage the concerns of companies that this would become a regular practice, rather than an exception, by saying such requests would be rare. “As per the intermediary guidelines, the originator of information can only be traced in a scenario where other remedies have proven to be ineffective, making the same a last resort measure. Moreover, such information can only be sought as per a process sanctioned by law, thereby incorporating sufficient legal safeguards… Therefore, WhatsApp’s attempt to portray the intermediary guidelines of India as contrary to the right to privacy is misguided.” The government also claimed that India is not the only country to enforce such laws, but rather this has been implemented internationally too. “The rules enacted by India… are not rules enacted in isolation but have global precedence… In July 2019, the governments of the UK, the US, Australia, New Zealand and Canada issued a communique, concluding that: ‘tech companies should include mechanisms in the design of their encrypted products and services whereby governments, acting with appropriate legal authority, can gain access to data in a readable and usable format’.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/government-terms-whatsapp-legal-challenge-an-act-of-defiance/articleshow/82992126.cms||Pankaj Doval
---||Delhi||Vax effective in fighting mutated variants: Study||New Delhi: In a significant study conducted by Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, vaccines were found to be effective in combating mutated variants of Covid-19 and protecting the vaccinated from severe illness, hospitalisation or death. The study was carried out on 69 healthcare workers, of whom 51 had taken both doses of the Covishield vaccine, and had turned Covid-positive. Only two of those who had taken both doses were hospitalised with severe symptoms, but they recovered fast and didn’t need the ICU. During the second wave, a small percentage of people who had taken either one or both doses of the vaccine had tested Covid-positive. This raised concerns on the efficacy of the vaccination as well as against the mutated variants of the virus. The infections occurring two weeks after full vaccination were referred to as “Break Through Infections” or BTI. A key author of the study, Dr Raju Vaishya, senior consultant (orthopedics) at Apollo, said, “The vaccine doesn’t prevent the infection 100%, but we found in our healthcare workers that it surely protects from severe infection. We are now planning to analyse 33,000 healthcare workers across all Apollo hospitals in the country.” “We noticed that post-vaccination SARS-COV-2 infection was seen only in a small subset of healthcare workers. The majority of these infections were minor. Since the immunity of an individual takes some time to build after vaccination, it’s essential to be extra careful for at least two weeks after the second dose and even further by taking precautions like maintaining social distancing, using face masks and hand sanitation,” added Vaishya. Dr Anupam Sibal, group medical director and senior pediatric gastroenterologist at Apollo Hospitals, said, “The predominant infections in the 69 healthcare workers occurred from the B.1.617.2 lineage (47.8%), followed by B.1 and B.1.1.7 strains. These findings are significant because more than half of the cohort were found infected with the Variant of Concern and still escaped from severe illness, which could have been a severe event for them without vaccination coverage.” The study analysed nasopharyngeal samples for genome sequencing in collaboration with National Centre for Disease Control. Genome sequencing is the key test to identify the nature of the virus and the variants that may emerge. Currently, this facility is available in only 10 select government organisations, but such testing facilities are now being increased by the Centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/vax-effective-in-fighting-mutated-variants-study/articleshow/82986086.cms||---

While online applications for the scheme can be made on www.niveshmitra.up.nic.in till June 30, allotment will commence from July 1 through both draw of lots and interviews for plots over 4,000 sqm. GNIDA expects investments worth Rs 93 crore from these allotments, which comprise a total area of 83,000 sqm. “We have come out with an industrial plot scheme where 38 plots ranging from 904 to 4,061 sqm will be available in sectors Ecotech 10 and 11 of GNIDA. In addition to these, there are three plots above 4,000 sqm in these two sectors,” said Deep Chandra, additional CEO of the Greater Noida Authority. While GNIDA is inviting investments under the ‘ease of doing business model’ of the state government, it aims to encourage more international companies to open units in the area. “Many electronics companies from Japan, Korea and Taiwan have shown interest in starting their units in Greater Noida. Therefore, even in Covid times, we have floated the industrial plot scheme to encourage more investments,” said Narendra Bhoohsan, CEO of GNIDA. Moreover, the Greater Noida Authority will soon introduce new institutional, commercial, information technology, builder and residential group housing schemes, said Bhooshan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/gnida-starts-new-industrial-plot-scheme/articleshow/82988046.cms||Meenakshi Sinha

Work on the third Mandovi bridge will be taken up on priority,” he said. Sawant said the state had fixed a target of completing the first phase of Zuari bridge in May and open it for public. But now, it will be completed by December, the chief minister said, adding that work has been delayed due to the pandemic. French bridge specialist Erwan Vicat of Ingerop, Paris, in association with Infinite Civil Solutions, India, have created the technical design of the bridge. While Dewei Chan of Tongji University, Shanghai, China, is acting as the proofreader for the design, the final blueprint is being checked by an IIT-Bombay team. When work on the project first began in late 2016, the entire eight-lane bridge was expected to be completed within three years, while the approach roads were to be ready within 30 months. Bhopal-based Dilip Buildcon, along with a Ukrainian company Mostobudivelnyi Zahin Ltd, was awarded the construction contract in that year. The chief minister chaired a meeting of Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation (GSIDC) officials to review of pending works and decide on new projects. Sawant said that some projects would be delayed due to the pandemic, but the state will complete these as soon as possible. He also said that he has directed GSIDC officials to fast-track projects related to health infrastructure. “We have asked them to complete the hospitals on priority,” he said. Sawant said that he has also directed GSIDC officials to fast-track the completion of schools and high secondary buildings and complete the renovation works. He also said that many structures of educational institutes have sustained damage. He also said that GSIDC will soon take up repairs on the Canacona high school building in Cola which has been damaged due to the cyclone. Sawant said that the Pernem high secondary project will be taken up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cm-first-phase-of-zuari-bridge-to-be-ready-by-dec/articleshow/82988048.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Though the number of CBSE students is lesser in those regions as compared to plain districts, I have put forth these concerns during our recent meeting with the Centre,” Pandey told a local media house. In his message to Class XII students, Pandey said, “The students should continue with their preparation considering that the exams will be held in the same format as previous years. As far as our state board (UBSE) students are concerned, the announcement for exam dates or any changes will be declared within a week.” Meanwhile, the state education department has started with a helpline service for the teachers posted in the hilly rural areas of the state. The helpline service — +918068172473 — will assist teachers with all sorts of Covid-related help. The helpline has been established after the teachers' union highlighted that teachers who have been sent for Covid-19 duty are dealing with a lack of arrangements.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/challenging-task-to-hold-exams-in-hills-during-monsoon-arvind-pandey/articleshow/82984082.cms||Mohammad Anab

---||Ahmedabad||Falling passenger load at SVPI increases flight cancellations||Ahmedabad: Thirteen flights to different destinations were cancelled from the city airport on Wednesday, due to operational and commercial constraints. In May, an average of 10-12 flights were cancelled in a single day from Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International (SVPI) airport in Ahmedabad. The same has gone up from an average of 6 flights in a day in April, according to data compiled based on daily cancellation of flights. Airline sources said, operating a flight is often not viable in case of a very low passenger load. Passenger footfalls have declined due to the second wave of the pandemic according to sources.An email query sent to the city airport authorities on the number of flights cancelled, evoked no response.The trend was similar in April too. DGCA’s Air Traffic Report for the month of April 2021 suggests that 76.9% of the flights were cancelled due to commercial reasons, which means it was not viable to operate flights. With leisure and corporate travel coming to a standstill,and only those with exigencies comprising most passengers travelling, the overall air passenger traffic has gone down, forcing airlines to cancel flights.The demand for air travel therefore has clearly taken a hit. Explaining this, a senior official affiliated with a low-cost carrier spoke of five factors that are denting air travel demand.“Widespread apprehensions continue to prevail over travelling. This is expected because varying rules on giving mandatory RTPCR negative test reports from state to state are not just making travel a costly affair but also cumbersome. During the peak of the second wave, even reports were not readily available,” the official explained.“Given territorial lockdowns and restrictions on movement even within a given city, leisure or adventure vacations are out of question. Moreover, a cap on the allowed baggage itself suggests that trips better be short or well-prepared. Add to this, the restrictions imposed by individual residential societies on allowing outsiders particularly from other states. These factors coupled with the sinister second wave have played a major dampener for air travel demand,” the official further added.Airline industry sources said that it is not viable for airlines to operate a flight with less number of passengers and therefore, are compelled to cancel flights. Aviation sector sources also said that barely 30-50% of the fleet of various airlines is utilised given the slashed demand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/falling-passenger-load-at-svpi-increases-flight-cancellations/articleshow/82986064.cms||Niyati Parikh

NCP spokesperson and skill development minister Nawab Malik said it’s time the CM takes a review of the curbs that end on May 31. “We are sure he will relax the norms before June 1,” he said. Malik said the positivity rate is more than 16-17% in 16-18 districts and there is no scope for relaxing the curbs there. “But we feel that in Mumbai and the neighbouring areas, where the positivity rate is very less, it is time we relax the lockdown. We are keen that people in these districts lead a normal life and have scope to earn their livelihood.” Malik further said that political parties must pressure the Narendra Modi-led NDA government to bring in a new national vaccination policy. Meanwhile, NCP president Sharad Pawar met Thackeray in the evening and discussed various issues including the Covid situation, vaccination programme, Maratha quota and ‘reservation in promotion’, said sources.

At Sadar Bazar, Rakesh Yadav, president, Federation of Sadar Bazar Traders’ Associations, said, “Many traders in Sadar Bazar, Chandni Chowk and other old Delhi markets have lost their kith and kin. We have asked all shopkeepers, including those with shops on the lanes, to suggest ways to make the place safer so the markets can remain open.” The business owners have so far agreed to open shops on alternative days according to their odd or even numbering, close the markets on weekends, restrict entry to those above 60 years and have co-morbidities, engage Civil Defence Volunteers to book Covid-behaviour violators, deploying ambulance services and arrange vaccine camps for traders. As a beginning, the federation has asked its 83 constituent associations to use WhatsApp and online modes to receive orders rather than have clients from Delhi-NCR coming physically for the purchases. “The grains, cosmetic and jewellery markets are evincing the most customer interest, so we have asked these traders specifically to transact business online or on WhatsApp,” said Yadav. “The traders will also be responsible for their employees not gathering or roaming around and restrict the number of buyers at any point of time.” Beopar Mandal Karol Bagh wants shops to call in only half the employees and keep masks for distribution. Murli Mani, president of the traders’ body, added, “We have decided to engage female marshals because a majority of our customers are women. They will identify mask violators and, if they need, provide them with a mask.” In Lajpat Nagar, the traders’ association plans a vaccination camp, but the vaccine shortage has held up that plan. It has asked shopkeepers to limit the business hours and restrict the number of customers allowed into the shops. “Customers without masks won’t be allowed into the shops,” informed Ashwani Marwah, general secretary. “Shopkeepers will provide free masks to the people. No crowding inside the shops will be permitted.” Vaccination of employees is also a priority in Connaught Place. Amit Gupta, executive member of New Delhi Traders’ Association, said talks were under way with New Delhi Municipal Council, a private hospital and the district administration for help in arranging an inoculation camp by June 10. “We are compiling a list of shop owners and their employees who need to be vaccinated,” said Gupta. “We also plan frequent disinfection of our areas.” But, said Gupta, the traders are still wary about opening shops when the lockdown is lifted. “The air conditioners in the stores are working and they don’t know how safe it will be to have all their employees returning for work,” he said. “We are all apprehensive this time having seen how much suffering this wave of infections brought.” Shopkeepers at Sarojini Nagar Market have also been discussing measures to be taken in addition to the government mandated regulations on safety. They are aware that their survival depends on the markets opening. “We are ready to collaborate with the administration in limiting the number of shoppers besides taking immediate action against norm violators,” asserted Ashok Randhawa, president, Mini Market Traders’ Association. “We are also planning to barricade the market entrances to streamline the entry of people into the market.” Randhawa said the traders were seriously considering the odd-even shop number format for opening of shops, extending a similar provision to the hawkers. However, social distancing of 10 metres as advised by the principal scientific adviser to the Indian government wasn’t feasible because most shops are small and each has 2-3 workers, he added. However, the South Extension I Market Association said the odd-even scheme wasn’t possible there, though it is discussing a vaccination camp with Apollo Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/markets-sold-on-the-idea-of-self-preservation/articleshow/82986132.cms||Vibha Sharma

The two-page letter, a copy of which is with TOI, says that Ramdev “turned antagonistic towards IMA as well as allopathy after the doctors’ national body sought information under RTI about his Divya Swasari Coronil Kit in February 2021 as part of its efforts to dispel misinformation being spread by the yoga guru regarding Covid treatment.” Meanwhile, IMA’s central body on Wednesday wrote a letter to PM Narendra Modi, asking him to stop Ramdev's “misinformation campaign” against the Covid-19 vaccine and to book him for sedition. “When you (Modi) initiated the vaccine rollout, IMA leaders across the country stood first to get the vaccine and by this dispelled vaccine hesitancy,” the letter said, adding that “if someone is claiming allopathic medicine has killed people, it is an attempt to challenge the ministry that has issued the protocol for treatment to us.” The medical body called Ramdev’s comments “a deliberate move to stall the efforts of vaccination” and asked the PM to stop it immediately. “We are pained to witness the great services rendered by nearly 10 lakh modern medical doctors being ridiculed and being called a ‘stupid system’. This in our opinion is a clear-cut case of sedition and such persons should be booked immediately without any delay under the charges of sedition.” The letter from IMA-Uttarakhand further alleges that Ramdev “as part of his conspiracy to malign allopathic treatment and doctors deliberately violated Covid curfew guidelines at an event on May 19 where over 125 people were present and levelled false and libellous allegations against allopathy treatment for which action should be taken against him under the Epidemic Disease Act, 1897 and Disaster Management Act, 2005.” The doctors’ body has said Ramdev “spread confusion and fear regarding side-effects of Covid vaccines in the minds of the people by releasing advertisements that the adverse effects of the vaccine can be countered by his Coronil kits. “Ramdev should withdraw all the advertisements pertaining to Coronil kits within 76 hours of receiving the letter or else an FIR would be registered against him and his associates under relevant sections of the IPC.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ima-seeks-apology-from-ramdev-warns-of-rs-1k-crore-libel-suit/articleshow/82984117.cms||---

The order, dated May 25, issued by chief wildlife warden JS Suhag, says that in accordance with guidelines of the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) and the Uttarakhand government, all national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, protected areas, zoos as well as tiger reserves will remain closed for visitors till June 1. Uttarakhand’s wildlife sanctuaries and reserves which includes among others Corbett Tiger Reserve (CTR), Shivalik Elephant Reserve, Valley of Flowers and Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary, are one of the most diverse and sought after spots by tourists and adventure lovers in the country. Valley of Flowers is due to open on June 1 and is currently undergoing ritual maintenance works. However, officials are unsure if visitors will be permitted. “Our staff is removing the weeds and clearing the glacier points from the trekking routes right now. However, given the situation, whether tourists will be allowed or not cannot be said at the moment,” said director of the Valley of Flowers National Park, Amit Kanwar. Similar is the case of CTR, which is due to reopen in the second week of June but officials are unsure if visitors will be allowed, as the threat of transmission of the coronavirus from humans to animals remains high. “We cannot open these sensitive, wildlife-rich areas for tourists unless we have clearance from all quarters, especially in the wake of cases wherein animals, too, were found affected by the virus,” Suhag said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ban-on-entry-of-tourists-to-uttarakhands-protected-forests-extended-till-june-1/articleshow/82984115.cms||Shivani Azad

---||Bareilly||Uttar Pradesh: Labourer kills wife, sons consumes poison||BAREILLY: A 32-year-old jobless labourer from Bahraich district in Uttar Pradesh poisoned his 26-year-old wife and two minor sons - aged one and two years - following a quarrel on Tuesday. He then took the same poison and is now fighting for life at a hospital in Kheri. Budhai Lal had returned home from Punjab after losing his job due to Covid lockdown. His wife, Nanhi Devi, was living with her parents for the past few days in the Isanagar area of Kheri district and had refused to return to her husband’s place in Bahraich, sources said. Police said Budhai took the step in a fit of rage after a quarrel with his wife. His in-laws went to a neighbouring village to meet their kin and the couple was alone with children at the time of incident. Isanagar station house officer (SHO) Sanjay Tyagi received a call from a local on Wednesday and he reached the place with his team. Forensic experts were then called in. Tyagi found that Budhai was lying semi-conscious near his dead wife and sons. The man somehow told the cops that he had poisoned them and was himself "waiting to die". The SHO shifted him to a local hospital, and the three dead were sent for autopsy. Kheri SSP Vijay Dhull said, “Nanhi Devi was living at her maternal place for over two weeks and Budhai had come to take her along on Tuesday evening. She insisted on staying there as her parents were on a visit to another village. The couple then had a heated argument." The SSP added, "Later in the night, the man gave his wife and children a cold drink laced with poison. He also took the same drink. The woman and her kids soon died while the man is now critical at the district hospital.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/jobless-labourer-kills-wife-2-sons-before-consuming-poison/articleshow/82978666.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

---||Dehradun||Covid-19 impact: Hotels & restaurants on verge of closure, say hoteliers across U’khand||Nainital/Mussoorie/Haridwar: Reeling under the economic impact of the Covid-induced curbs for over a year now, hoteliers, many of whom had invested lakhs of rupees in leasing properties, say that they will not be able to restart their businesses again as a prolonged period of no business has drained them financially. Speaking to TOI, Praveen Sharma, a hotelier who runs a chain of hotels in Nainital, Kausani and Ranikhet said that he had already paid almost 90% of the lease amount to the owner in March but the second wave of Covid-19 ruined all prospects of business as hotels had to be shut in the wake of restrictions. He said that he had to lay off almost 50% of his staff. “I had taken a loan to pay the lease amount but now I am liquidating my existing assets to pay the installments to the bank. I have been in the industry for decades but I don’t have the stamina or the strength left to recover from this kind of unprecedented situation,” Sharma said, adding that the state government not formulating any clear-cut policy to help out hoteliers is another disappointment. The Nainital hotel and restaurant association officials say that there are at least two dozen hotels in the town which are run on lease and the financial condition of almost all of them is bad. “During the first wave of the virus, RBI had at least put a moratorium on loans but this year even that didn't happen,” said Ved Sah, the association’s secretary. The hoteliers in Haridwar and Rishikesh are facing a similar crisis. Several businessmen who took hotels on the lease before the Kumbh Mela are facing huge losses and many of them have returned the establishment to the owners. Some of them are even planning to move to other states. Vibhas Mishra, president of the Haridwar hoteliers’ association, told TOI that around 60% of all the hotels in the district are run on lease and operators of these facilities are suffering huge losses due to the Covid-induced curfew. “As the government has not announced any relief packages for the hotel industry, these businessmen are planning to move to some other state in search of a better business environment.” In Mussoorie, hoteliers claim that close to 90% of the hotels have shut operations in the past one-and-a-half months. “It is a worrisome trend and does not augur well for the economy of the state. Hospitality is a major industry for our state and the government should support the industry to prevent negative impacts on employment and economy,” said Sandeep Sahni, president of the Hotel and Restaurant Association of Uttarakhand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/covid-19-impact-hotels-restaurants-on-verge-of-closure-say-hoteliers-across-ukhand/articleshow/82984124.cms||Prashant Jha

The construction is being opposed by locals terming it a violation of Coastal Regulation Zone norms. Cabral said that he would personally ensure demolition of the wall, if found to be illegal. “As an environment minister, all permissions are given under central acts and state bodies, like Pollution Control Board and CRZ authority, all autonomous bodies. I have no direct control over them as environment minister. I am aware of this issue. People have contacted me over it. And if it is wrong, I will personally go and break it with the help of administrative staff,” Cabral said. He, however, said that he will have to examine the matter closely and added that he cannot outright make any statement against the construction without studying the issue at hand. “I cannot make a comment just because someone is posting videos. I have to study it. And if it is wrong, it has to be removed, because the law is the same for everyone, including me. Let me see, let me understand the issue. I assure the people of Goa, I will personally look into it,” Cabral said. “I was unwell. I have joined back on duty and I will monitor it and will see to it that an inspection is carried out to see what wrong they have done,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/environment-mantri-assures-to-study-vainguinim-wall-matter/articleshow/82988074.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh government to bear cost of post-Covid treatment in medical colleges||LUCKNOW: The Uttar Pradesh government will provide free treatment to hospitalised patients suffering from post-Covid-19 complications. The facility will be made available in all state medical colleges — state-aided, autonomous and private institutions, including SGPGI, KGMU, and RMLIMS. This will benefit at least one in 10 Covid hospitalised patients requiring treatment for post-coronavirus complications. At present, more than 20,000 of the 62,000 patients with active infections are undergoing treatment in hospitals across the state. Principal secretary, medical education, Alok Kumar II, who passed the order on Wednesday, said the state government found that despite recovering from coronavirus, many patients require extended stay in hospitals owing to post-Covid complications. “This leads to additional cost of treatment for these patients. Therefore, in the public interest, the government has decided to bear the cost of the extended treatment,” he added. While the order assures free continuity of treatment to Covid patients already in hospitals, there is no clarity about patients who require re-hospitalisation following a post-Covid complication after being discharged. Sources said the medical education department may come up with a clear protocol on this as well. “The government is not averse to extending treatment to cases of readmission as well but then a time frame may be fixed in this regard,” sources added. Several Covid patients who get hospitalised suffer from at least one comorbid condition. For example, the blood sugar levels of those with diabetes get affected post-Covid treatment which often includes steroids. A number of such patients require insulin therapy and administration of medicines through the intravenous route. “At times, patients recover from coronavirus infection but their organs do not recover from the damage caused by the virus. Under the present system, once such patients test negative for coronavirus, their patient care management becomes chargeable. Families of some patients have expressed the inability to bear the cost of the treatment,” said an administrative official at SGPGI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/state-to-bear-cost-of-post-covid-treatment-in-medical-colleges/articleshow/82988095.cms||Shailvee Sharda

Confirming the development, chief medical officer (CMO) Sanjeev Yadav on Wednesday said both the patients — hailing from Milak and Bilaspur tehsils — were referred to Meerut medical college for specific treatment. A suspected patient of black fungus was under their observation, said the CMO. “A 39-year-old woman from Hamidabad village of Bilaspur tehsil, who was admitted to the district hospital here on Saturday, was found infected with black fungus on Sunday and was referred to the Meerut medical college.

---||Vadodara||Vadodara’s rural areas witness faster downtrend||Vadodara: About a week back, rural areas of the district had raised concern as they accounted for around half or even more of the Covid-19 cases in the district. But the areas have since shown a consistent decline and the cases have fallen to less than one-third of the total number in the district. The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) issues a combined health bulletin for the city and district. All Covid-19 cases registered outside the VMC limits are considered as cases from Vadodara rural. For a better part of the pandemic, rural areas were supposed to be safer when it came to throwing up new cases. But that changed drastically from April and the ratio of cases contributed by the rural areas started rising steadily. Since last week, however, things have started turning around again. The cases went down to around 30% to one-third of the total cases. Sources said that this is more on the expected lines and the higher numbers earlier were surprising. “Both rapid and RT-PCR tests of samples from rural areas clearly reveal that there is a drastic fall in the number of cases there. This is reflected in the data too,” said an official. According to official data, at the peak of the first wave on September 19, 2020 only 39 of the 135 fresh cases were from the rural areas. The rural areas used to report only stray cases except for a couple of small towns that had outbreaks. Against this at the peak of the second wave on May 7 this year, 465 out of the 989 new cases were from the rural areas. The lesser number of cases from the rural areas will also ease the pressure on hospitals in Vadodara city. Most Covid patients from rural areas have to rush to the city for treatment. Officials said that most such patients coming to the city are serious. They have to be admitted to ICUs or need oxygen support. ICU beds and oxygen were difficult to find during the peak of the second wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/vadodaras-rural-areas-witness-faster-downtrend/articleshow/82984054.cms||---

The facility has been set up jointly by the Almora district administration and the Kumaon Regiment in the hostel building of Kendriya Vidyalaya. Speaking on the occasion, the CM said, “The facility will be very helpful in treating Covid-19 cases in the hills. The hospital currently has 10 beds with oxygen support but the number of such beds in the facility will be increased soon.” The CM added that it is crucial to better the healthcare infrastructure in the primary and community health centres before the third wave of the pandemic strikes. He also emphasized the need for increasing Covid-19 testing in rural areas. “In rural pockets, people need to be encouraged to go for the Covid-19 test. The Asha and Anganwadi workers and the village committees need to carry out a door-to-door campaign to provide the medical kit to those under home isolation.” He added, “With the help of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), two temporary Covid-19 hospitals will soon be set up in Haldwani and Rishikesh,” the CM added. Meanwhile, Rekha Arya, women and child development minister, said, “I thank CM Rawat to allow MLAs to use Rs 1 crore from their MLALAD fund for undertaking Covid-related works in their constituencies.” Almora MP Ajay Tamta was also present on the occasion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/cm-rawat-inaugurates-50-bed-covid-hosp-in-ranikhet/articleshow/82717670.cms||Kautilya Singh

Addressing media on Tuesday, director of medical education (DME) Dr Ramesh Reddy said patients who were critically ill, need long term follow up as they might develop lung and other complications, including black fungus. “Detection and treatment of patients in all government teaching hospitals and vaidya vidhana parishat hospitals have been planned. Recovered patients can go to outpatient wards which will start functioning in one or two days,” the DME said. The Government ENT Hospital has 240 cases, the DME informed and said that 20 persons were undergoing surgery on a daily basis. “We want to increase this number to 30 to 35 daily, and therefore required equipment and directions have been given,” he said. In addition, the outpatient wing at ENT hospital will also check patient status and advise accordingly, he informed. Urging families of patients not to panic, the DME said that in the early stages, the infection is easy to treat. “As we are having outpatient wings in all district hospitals, there is no need to come to Hyderabad, even those who got treated here can get the follow-up check-up in their respective places,” he said. “The Centre will supply limited vials of the drug but each patient should not be seeking hundreds of vials. There are many alternate treatments and they will be guided on this,” the DME added. In case of complicated cases, they will be referred to higher facilities, the government has said. Major government hospitals like Khammam and Karimnagar will have facilities to treat such cases. The health department advised recovered Covid patients who had been critically ill and have low immunity because of reasons like diabetes to wear masks even at home for some time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/opd-for-covid-19-recovered-patients-to-curb-black-fungus/articleshow/82987667.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The vaccination drive is likely to start next week with the United Federation of Resident Welfare Societies (UFERWAs), the apex body of resident welfare associations (RWAs), identifying over 50 RWA communities to set up vaccination centres in the first phase. The decision to launch a vaccination drive was taken by UFERWAs during a meeting with various RWA representatives on Wednesday. They discussed the drive move as per the government’s permission to allow private hospitals to carry out vaccination drives in RWA areas, NGOs, and corporate offices. “A mobile app will be developed for RWAs to register names of residents of apartments, gated communities and other housing groups in the city for first and second doses. This data will then be forwarded to firms who are willing to administer the vaccine. The cost for both Covishield and Covaxinwill be paid as per the central government’s guidelines,” UFERWAs vice-president P Uday Shankar told TOI. Another UFERWAs member and president of Green Grace Residents Society in Khajaguda, RSV Badrinath said that he will provide data of residents of all gated communities to ensure every person is vaccinated. “We are already in talks with Apollo, Dr Reddy’s, KIMS and AIG hospitals along with other agencies to roll out the Covid-19 vaccination drive in RWA communities,” Badrinath said. UFERWAs members have urged the state government to involve the medical and health department, police and GHMC to ensure the vaccination drive can be carried out in a smooth manner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/uferwas-draws-up-roadmap-for-vaccination-drive-within-societies/articleshow/82987875.cms||Sunil Mungara

Despite his Asperger’s syndrome and stuttering, Sugandh calls each number that he finds on various social networks and posts verified contact numbers with quoted prices on social media to prevent online fraud. During the second wave, Sugandh started getting a lot of help requests for resources. He started scouring social media for oxygen, medicine and hospital bed requests he was getting. He soon found that there was a lot of misinformation on social media. “Most of the resource contact numbers passed around on WhatsApp, Twitter or resource portals either did not work or belonged to scammers and blackmarketers. A lot of people, who got scammed by fraudsters, started approaching me. After going through their stories, I published modus operandi of these scams and tips on how people can avoid them,” Sugandh told TOI. This Covid-19 warrior also focuses on providing verified news, resources and medical information on the pandemic via his Twitter handle and audio discussions on Twitter Spaces.

Experts pointed out that Kerala’s detailed document on Covid-19 associated mucormycosis (CAM) has several important learnings. Kerala’s document states that CAM has high possibility of morbidity and mortality. It says that CAM is a diabetes defining illness and remains one of the most serious complications. The document observed that India contributes to 40 per cent of the global burden for mucormycosis with an estimated prevalence of 140 cases per million. “Single risk factor development of CAM is uncontrolled glycemic status. Studies have revealed that 47 per cent of Indians are unaware of their diabetic status and only a quarter of diagnosed cases have achieved adequate glycemic control on treatment...For the same reason, it is important to check diabetes constantly during Covid-19 treatment,” said ICMR-certified researcher, Dr Kiran Madala According to ENT Hospital superintendent Dr Shankar, due to use of steroids and high sugar levels, patients may develop CAM as immunity is compromised. “It is not just diabetic patients but anyone with compromised immunity after prolonged Covid-19 illness is at risk,” he told TOI. He added that wrong use of mask can also lead to fungal infections other than CAM. “Many don’t wash masks properly, keep them at dusty places. In such cases, fungus enters their nose, and if immunity is low, they develop symptoms,” he said. DME Dr Ramesh Reddy clarified that black fungus is not contagious and there is no need to isolate patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/experts-point-to-kerala-cam-docu-for-insights/articleshow/82987825.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Pereira’s nomination was proposed by Sawal and former chairperson Pooja Naik, while Sawal’s candidature was proposed by Pereira and Sagun Naik, who got elected from ward 12 as part of Kamat’s panel. Srinet Kotwale, senior scale officer of the Goa Civil Service, has been appointed as the presiding officer to conduct the election of the new chairperson and vice-chairperson by the director of urban administration. In pursuance to Section 42(2A) of the Goa Municipalities Act, he will administer the oath of office to the newly elected councillors at 11am on Thursday, Fernandes said. The Margao Civic Alliance had won 17 of the 25 seats at the MMC in the recently held civic polls, defeating BJP’s panel which won just seven.  It was decided that the chairperson and vice-chairperson’s posts would be rotated alternately between GFP and Kamat’s candidates during the five-year term.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/margao-civic-body-chief-deputy-to-be-elected-unopposed/articleshow/82988102.cms||---

His department has already announced in the recent past that there will be no new thermal generation units in Maharashtra. As per the estimates, Maharashtra has a capacity to produce 25,000MW from solar projects, but the energy department has framed the new Renewable Energy Policy (REP) to produce 17,385MW in the next five years, Raut said. The REP will also attract investment of Rs 75,000 crore in the power sector and other affiliated industries. Also, the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission has set a target for the state to meet 25% of its demand from renewable sources in the next five years and therefore the government has decided to promote renewable energy only, an official said. “Solar power will be much cheaper than thermal power, benefiting industries and agriculture (for daytime generation for farmers) across the state,” Raut said. By 2030, there are plans to produce 30% of power by solar only. A statement issued by the energy department said: “The new REP is aimed at providing daytime power to agriculture pumps at cheaper rates. A total 5 lakh solar agriculture pumps will be installed in the state in the next five years. About 10,000 households in remote areas will get solar power.” Sources said that presently during the pandemic, the power demand has gone down by 33% and several thermal units were lying idle. “In fact, there is a huge gap between demand and supply at this moment,” an official said. For instance, MSEDCL has signed power purchase agreements for 35,000MW of electricity for the state, but is purchasing only 14,500MW due to low demand during the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/in-5-years-maharashtra-to-go-green-with-17385mw-solar-energy/articleshow/82988132.cms||Somit Sen

The viharas were closed for the devotees to prevent the spread of Covid while prayers were offered by resident monks at dawn and then in the evening. The prayers were live streamed so that devotees could join from home. Most of the people stayed home and prayed to Lord Buddha for deliverance against Covid and safety from Yaas. As the day progressed and the sky cleared up, the evening prayers were of relief and gratitude. The two traditional offerings like ‘payesh’ and fruits were made in the viharas and at homes. “After the prayers, we spent the day distributing dry ration among the needy. We also distributed PPE kits among hospital staff,” said Arunjyoti Bhikkhu, head of Sambodhi Buddha Vihara at Tollygunge. Every year, Buddhists from across the state congregate at Rani Rashmoni Road to celebrate the day, but this year the programme was called off due to the pandemic. The 128-year-old Bauddha Dharmankur Sabha organised a virtual programme to discuss the life and teachings of the Buddha, said the president, Hemendu Bikas Chowdury. Virtual programmes were also organised by Ananda Palit Bidarshan Shiksha Kendra. Most viharas distributed ‘prasad’ and food among the needy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cov-effect-devotees-observe-buddha-purnima-online/articleshow/82986125.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

Some centres even had ‘only 100 doses available’ displayed outside their premises. Furious over the shortage, residents got into heated arguments with officials at some centres, demanding to know why doses were not available. “I came here at around 8 am; it’s 12 pm now and I am still waiting for my turn,” rued KV Rao, a resident of Kukatpally visiting a government vaccination centre. While the pace picked up at private hospitals, sources said that sufficient vaccine doses were not available at all urban and rural primary health care centres. The state health department, meanwhile, maintained that three lakh people will get their second dose by the end of May. The number of private centres administering the vaccine increased from 40 on Tuesday to 151 on Wednesday. Till 9.30 pm 53,908 people took the shot in the state — of them 9,814 from Hyderabad.

The residents' body has demanded some policy decisions and suggested acknowledging the efforts of scientists and other frontline warriors. Printing the national emblem, national flag or logos of vaccination companies can be other options, it stated in a letter to the LG. “It has been observed that a new tussle has started between various political party leaders over pasting their photographs on the vaccination certificates issued to all those getting inoculated. Such behaviour by them is not acceptable in the biggest democracy of the world and at least at this point of time. They should rather show the statesmanship qualities and admire those who have made genuine efforts to overcome the crisis,” said Atul Goel, president of URJA. In the letter to the LG, URJA stated, “It is remarkable that worldwide scientists have been able to develop vaccines in a short time which offer efficacy against the deadly coronavirus. The credit goes to them and the medical fraternity that has been in the forefront against this unseen enemy. It is time to acknowledge their good work by releasing photographs of these warriors, along with the Indian national emblem, on the vaccine certificate, instead of photographs of political leaders.” Jasbir Chadda, chief convenor of URJA, said that the decision to write to the President of India through the LG was taken after suggestions from various RWAs. “We have requested them to intervene and pass suitable directions to the Government of India and state governments,” he stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/put-scientists-pics-national-flag-on-vax-papers-rwa-body/articleshow/82986175.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Two white fungus cases surface in T||Hyderabad: The LV Prasad Eye Institute (LVPEI) has seen two cases of white fungus infection in patients who have recovered from Covid-19. The white fungus (Candida albicans) infection, which is not as rare as mucormycosis (black fungus), largely affects eyesight. With surfacing of these two cases and doctors expecting more cases in near future, demand for antifungal drugs, including injection amphotericin, are likely to go up. Other major tertiary centres, however, have not seen post Covid white fungus cases so far. In recent weeks, white fungus cases have been reported in Bihar’s Patna and UP’s Ghaziabad. “The two cases, both young males and Covid-recovered patients, had presented with mild to moderate loss of vision. They had history of being diagnosed with Covid and had undergone related treatment. Both patients underwent appropriate surgery and antifungal injections. A month down the line, they have recovered 80% vision,” said Dr Vivek Dave, vitreoretine consultant at LVPEI. “These microorganisms can cause endogenous infections or from within in Covid patients treated with steroids or the immunocompromised. Such fungi do not cause disease in normal individuals, but in post-Covid patients who develop symptoms of infection like fever and cough, it is important to have a high index of suspicion and perform tests to accurately and rapidly diagnose the agent causing infection to save their lives with correct treatment,” said Dr Rohini Kelkar, consultant, clinical microbiologist and specialist, Metropolis Healthcare. Hospital treatment requiring IC lines staying in the body for a long time is believed to be a source. “If the IV lines are there for a long time and the hygiene around it is not good, it can be a source of fungus in the blood stream. By these means, once in a while we keep seeing white fungus cases even unrelated to Covid,” Dr Dave said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/two-white-fungus-cases-surface-in-t/articleshow/82987780.cms||Amrita Didyala

In an attempt to reach out to its workers in distress, the UP BJP is preparing a list of party members who have been in the grip of virus. The district chiefs of the party have also been asked to keep updating the list of workers or office-bearers who have lost lives due to Covid-19. The party is also helping its members who require treatment or medication. The Lucknow unit of the party has been asked to compile two separate lists – one of those who recovered from Covid-19 and the other listing the names who succumbed to the infection. A party functionary said the list would be sent to the BJP headquarters after updation.  “It will have details of former and current office-bearers of the party who got infected with the coronavirus, the ones who recovered and those who succumbed to it,” he said. “We do not know if other districts have also been asked to submit such a list. But we are preparing ours,” an office-bearer in the Lucknow unit said. All district units have been asked to be in touch with the families of workers who lost their lives and the ones who are still recovering from infection and check on their needs, if any.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/state-bjp-extends-help-to-workers-in-grip-of-corona/articleshow/82988139.cms||Neha Shukla

He said the positivity rate of Covid-19 cases has come down to 4.1%. “It is well within the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended rate of 5%.” To bring the spread of the virus under control, the state health authorities have come up with a vaccine strategy for the next two weeks. As per the strategy, a special vaccination drive covering 7.55 lakh high-risk people (possible super spreaders) including auto and cab drivers, LPG cylinder distributors, kirana shop workers, fruit and vegetable vendors, workers at meat and chicken shops, salons and journalists will be carried out. “We have identified people falling in these high risk categories with the help of concerned departments and will vaccinate all of them,” the health director said. “These high-risk category of people who regularly come in contact with others will be vaccinated from May 28.” He said the daily number of cases are expected to reduce significantly over the next one week. Vaccine availability in the state is expected to improver further. “We currently have 6.18 lakh dose of Covishield, while another 3.35 lakh doses are expected in the first week of June. Currently, 2.5 lakh doses of Covaxin are available, while another 2.5 lakh doses are expected in the first week of June. The state has also paid up for another 5 lakh doses of Covaxin, which may be supplied in 2-3 weeks. The available doses will be utilised for vaccinating the identified high risk people and people awaiting second doses,” said Rao. The health director said that private hospitals can apply for the roll-out of vaccination for 18 years and above category. Once permitted, they can take up drivers for workplace vaccination, vaccination in gated communities, industrial establishments and IT companies. Speaking on the issue of shortage of the antifungal injection liposomal amphotericin, Dr K Ramesh Reddy, director medical education (DME), Telangana, said that some alternative medicines for this injection are available. “Liposomal Amphotericin-B is in short supply, and alternatives regimens to it should be followed.

The damage done by the fungus has been removed and the patients are under observation, now, said doctors. Talking to TOI, Prof Mohd Aftab, department of otolaryngology at JNMC, who along with his team successfully operated on the patients, said early diagnosis and timely treatment resulted in the satisfactory recovery of the patients. “The disease has been removed through surgery. Now, the infection will be controlled by administering anti-fungal injections, which are being provided by the government.” Prof Aftab said their symptoms included unilateral nasal obstruction, facial pain, swelling, numbness, blurring of vision and watery eyes. The patients, both locals, were earlier treated for Covid-19 at a private hospital. “Mohal Lal and Vivek underwent endoscopic procedures without any incisions, which resulted in easier recovery time and less pain and discomfort. The patients are, however, under close observation as the black fungus is a very aggressive disease,” said Prof Aftab, adding that he has “conducted two similar surgeries today (on Wednesday)”. According to Prof Aftab, they have been receiving more such patients, who are being operated on following the urgency of their cases. Stressing on early detection and treatment, JNMC principal Prof Shahid A Siddiqui, however, said, “Covid patients can contract black fungus two or three weeks after their recovery. These cases have increased all over the country and people with symptoms specific of the fungus such as nasal congestion, nasal block, dry and black crust in the nasal cavity, black spots around the nose and or eyes, redness and congestion in eyes, reduced eyeball movements, sudden diminished vision and black spots in the oral cavity, especially on the palate, should avoid self-medication and keep their blood sugar level under control. They must contact a doctor immediately.” Applauding the ENT specialists for the successful surgeries, AMU vice-chancellor Prof Tariq Mansoor said, “JNMC health workers are doing their best to check the possibility of fungal infections by making sure that Covid patients — those who are undergoing treatment as well as those who have recovered — are administered right dose of steroids.” The VC added that JNMC doctors had also been taking care of diabetes of the discharged Covid patients by way of regular consultations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/amus-medical-college-docs-successfully-treat-black-fungus-patients-by-non-invasive-surgery/articleshow/82978826.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

A police team, which reached the eatery around 11.30pm, found 22 people dining inside the facility in gross violation of the prevailing state rules, which disallow dine-in service and allow only take-away food parcel service between 7am and 11pm. Apart from operating beyond the 11pm deadline, the facility had failed to regulate the crowd and maintain social distancing norms, police said. Both, Ramesh Bagwe, a former minister of state for home, and Baker denied the police claim and maintained that four to five of the 22 people were acquaintances, who were there to meet Baker and were sitting at a table, and the remaining people were waiting for their parcels. “We are operating with far less staff. Preparation of parcels takes time. We have to arrange for customers to sit while they wait for their parcels,” said Ramesh Bagwe. Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta said, “Our action is as per the law and whatever more (stringent) action is required to be taken we will take after we complete our probe.” The police swung into action after a video clip of the proceedings at the eatery owned by Baker went viral on social media. “We received information from some people that customers were dining at the eatery. When we visited the spot, we found 22 people dining. We collected their names, apart from that of the restaurant owner and the manager, and filed an FIR on Wednesday,” senior inspector Sardar Patil of the Kondhwa police said. “All the 24 people are being served notices for their impending prosecution before the court,” he said. For now, the police have booked the 24 persons for offences under Sections 188 (disobedience), 269 and 270 of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 51 (b) of the National Disaster Management Act, 2,3 and 4 of the Epidemic Diseases Act and 11 of the Maharashtra Covid-19 rules. Bagwe told TOI, “There was a sudden rush of customers, which led to the situation.” “We did not anticipate such a rush during closing hours. Our manager told police that no customer was dining. The police then walked out but did not inform us of the FIR. We are implementing the state’s Covid norms and have not flouted any rules,” Baker said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ex-minister-bagwes-son-23-others-booked-on-charge-of-flouting-covid-curbs-at-nibm-rd-eatery/articleshow/82986210.cms||Asseem Shaikh

It was 30% bigger and 14% brighter than the usual full moon. “This is indeed a miracle. Though the clouds ensured that the brief partial lunar eclipse could not be sighted, we had not expected to see the moon because of the cyclonic weather. But the weather improved in the evening when the moon shone bright for a while around 7.30pm before the sky again became overcast and it began raining again,” said MP Birla Institute of Fundamental Research and MP Birla Planetarium director (research & academic), Debiprosad Duari. Many parts of Asia and Europe witnessed a total lunar eclipse with a Super Blood Moon leaving people mesmerised.  Kolkata had last seen a total lunar eclipse 10 years ago on December 10, 2011. The next time the city is likely to witness a total lunar eclipse on November 8, 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/super-moon-plays-hide-and-seek-peeks-through-clouds/articleshow/82986284.cms||---

State government officials said that this was nearly 80% below the peak of 3.10 lakh cases recorded on April 30. The improvement in the state’s Covid-19 situation is being attributed to UP’s aggressive testing policy. “Over 3.58 lakh Covid-19 tests were conducted in the past 24 hours which is a new high. No other state in the country has been able to undertake so many tests in a day. It is for our aggressive testing policy that the Covid-19 situation in the state is now under control,” said Navneet Sehgal, additional chief secretary, information, UP. He also informed reporters that the state’s cumulative case positivity rate had declined to about 3.5% now against a range of 18% during the peak. “In fact the case positivity rate for the past 24 hours was below 1%,” he said, adding that case positivity rate is a crucial indicator of present pandemic activity in any state. Meanwhile, as per the official Covid-19 bulletin, 3,371 new cases and 10,540 recoveries were reported in the past 24 hours. Covid-19 deaths, however, continued to remain a cause of concern. Officials stated that 196 deaths took the toll to 19,712. Sehgal claimed that the state is not leaving any stone unturned to ensure that the pandemic situation is brought under control.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/active-cases-down-by-80-since-april-30-peak-in-state/articleshow/82988175.cms||---
---||Goa||Mormugao MLA’s nominee chosen for chairperson’s post||Vasco: Urban development minister Milind Naik proved his supremacy in the Mormugao Municipal Council (MMC) as his nominee Damodar Kaskar will be the chairperson of the newly-elected council, while Shraddha Mahale Shetye will be the deputy chairperson. In a call by the state BJP leaders, the decision of selecting the new and first chairperson and vice-chairperson of the new elected council was taken on Tuesday night at a meeting held in chief minister’s bungalow. The decision was taken in the presence of all three MLAs of Mormugao who share the jurisdiction of the MMC - urban development minister and Mormugao MLA Milind Naik, panchayats minister and Dabolim MLA Mauvin Godinho and Vasco MLA Carlos Almeida. While Naik has nine wards in his Mormugao constituency, Vasco constituency has 12 and Dabolim 4. On Wednesday, Kaskar, a two-time councillor, and new councillor Shetye filed nominations for the post of chairperson and vice-chairperson of MMC respectively before the chief officer in the presence of Rajya Sabha member of parliament Vinay Tendulkar. Both were elected unopposed. “The BJP has 19 councillors out of 25 who won in the council election. Another two councillors who are independents also supported us. With the support of 21 councillors, we decided to make Kaskar and Shetye the new chairperson and vice-chairperson respectively,” Tendulkar said. In the muncipal polls, the BJP-led panel had swept the polls in Mormugao council “The salary of MMC staff was Rs 70 lakh before the 7th pay, and now with 7th pay it has touched Rs 1.3 crore. The municipality is facing financial problems. The municipality has to speed up the work of collecting revenue. The new council will work on improving the financial crisis and make it stable,” he said. Almeida said the names of chairperson and deputy chairperson were decided at a high-level meeting. “ I accept the decision,” he said. Sources said that the post has been given for one year to Kaskar and Shetye. The run-up to the municipality elections had witnessed bitterness between Naik and Almeida over reservation of seats. Sources said that the party leadership prevailed upon the MLAs to maintain peace, particularly as the assembly elections are little more than six months away.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mormugao-mlas-nominee-chosen-for-chairpersons-post/articleshow/82988180.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Lucknow||‘Vax safe, best way to combat Covid’||Lucknow: Vaccines approved in India and around the world are completely safe and the best way to stop the spread of coronavirus, according to Prof Ram Shanker Upadhayay, an infectious disease expert. “Speculations around Antibody Dependent Enhancement (ADE) also has no basis as it can only be true if antibodies stay in a body persistently for a long duration. The classical example is Dengue Shock Syndrome which occurs after second infection,” said Prof Upadhyay, a native of Agra and assistant professor at Upsala University in Sweden. He added in case of a Covid-infected person or those vaccinated against the virus, antibodies were likely to stay not more than a maximum of nine months. ADE is a phenomenon where antibodies themselves aggravate an infection or trigger a respiratory disease. “ADE is a reality for vaccinated subjects as well as infected and recovered patients for the fact that there might be a pool of non-neutralizing antibodies that can facilitate the entry of the virus into immune cells on subsequent infection. In case of Covid vaccines, antibodies, both neutralizing and non-neutralizing, will not last beyond a year. Given the data on memory cells is still not available, the probability of ADE dependent infection enhancement is low,” Prof Upadhyay, who is also the chief scientific officer at US-based Ohm Oncology, said. He said ADE was still not reported for well-known yearly flu shot. “Notably, established vaccines covering other diseases are rigorously tested for their capacity. If vaccines don’t prevent spreading and instead can best reduce severity may trigger a fight-back mechanism for the virus by mutating,” he said. “Covid vaccines made until now are antibody-response based and it will wash out in 3-9 months’ time. If it will finish, there is no question of antibody dependent enhancement,” he said. Prof Upadhyay said the motto of antibody dependent vaccines was “live today and fight tomorrow”, and added that it was the need of the hour. However, he clarified that antibody dependent vaccines were safe for a short duration but after sometime people would have to go for memory cell-based vaccine for prolonged protection. “This will help in creating a memory of the virus antigens and antibodies will be formed only when there is infection,” Prof Upadhyay said, adding that otherwise too, antibodies were most likely to fade away within nine months. Putting his perspective on surge in mortality rate, Prof Upadhayay said many people who had taken first jab had to be hospitalised or they died only because many were not able to develop antibodies. “Those who got vaccinated started roaming freely without following Covid protocol. Even though they were safe to some extent but were carrier of virus and those who were casual and didn’t wear mask or took no precaution caught the infection easily,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/vax-safe-best-way-to-combat-covid/articleshow/82988234.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Asked cos about remdesivir supply:Maharashtra State to high court||Mumbai: The state government has told the Bombay high court that it has sought details from pharmaceutical companies on the supply of remdesivir injection to NGO Sood Charity Foundation and a charitable trust that helped patients sent to it by MLA Zeeshan Siddique. It informed the court about the action it has taken so far after initial show-cause notices were issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to the NGO and Siddique. Last week, while hearing PILs about Covid-19 management, HC had rapped the state over its “absolutely casual” response to its direction to look into the parallel distribution of remdesivir by political and film personalities who received appeals on social media. The state’s affidavit-in-reply said Sood in its May 20 reply to FDA said the NGO had requested manufacturers Jubilant Generic Ltd, Hitero Healthcare Ltd and Cipla Ltd to help it provide required medicines to needy patients. The FDA has issued notice to Solan-based Jubilant to submit details of remdesivir and tocilizumab supplied to Sai Medico, Oscar Hospital, Kandivli (W) and Unix Superspeciality Hospital, Indore as per the NGO’s request. It has also sought details from Hitero and Cipla on supplies to the NGO. The state’s reply said Siddique’s May 22 reply to FDA’s notice referred to BDR Charitable Foundation Trust at Opera House. The FDA then issued a letter to the trust, requesting it to submit procurement details of remdesivir injections supplied to Siddique. BDR replied that it is one of the manufacturers of remdesivir for Cipla and “they requested CIPLA and Sun Pharma to give some vials and likewise they helped the needy patients sent by Zeeshan Siddiqui by providing some vials free of cost.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/asked-cos-about-remdesivir-supplymaharashtra-state-to-high-court/articleshow/82989986.cms||Rosy Sequeira

These days though it has acquired a new identity as the flight on which the probability of being the solo passenger aboard is the highest. Three days after an Emirates passenger had an entire Boeing 777 aircraft to himself, an Air India passenger had a Boeing 787 Dreamliner solo flight from Mumbai to Dubai on May 22. His exclusive flight experience didn’t end after the flight landed in Dubai as the entire crew, including the pilots, walked him right up to the passenger coach bus to see him off. "I felt like a Maharaja on that Dreamliner flight," said Oswald Rodrigues, referring to Air India’s 'Fly like a Maharaja' slogan. "Even billionaires fly in smaller private aircraft," said Rodrigues, senior partner, Skybridge Freight Solutions, speaking to TOI from his Dubai office. But this 'Maharaja' had a few battles to win before he could board his `personal’ 256-seater Dreamliner. A negative RT-PCR report along with a QR-code linked to the original report is mandatory for international travel and the code on his report didn’t work. It was 1.15 pm and flight AI-983 to Dubai was scheduled to take off at 3.30 pm. Rodrigues, anxious to fly back to Dubai, stood feeling helpless at the Mumbai airport Air India check in counter. That was when Melvin Saldanha, the Air India supervisor said `We want to help you’, said Rodrigues. Saldanha deputed an AI ground staffer, Ketan Deolekar, to rush Rodrigues to a rapid PCR test counter located at another section of the airport. "It provides report in 13 minutes or so. But we reached there to find a few passengers in a queue to get the test done," he said. While Rodrigues waited anxiously, Deolekar sent a minute by minute report of the progress to Saldanha. "As soon as I received my negative PCR report, Deolekar began scanning my passport, visa, report and sent it to the AI desk for them to begin the check in process. And then we bolted back to the AI counter," he said. By 2.15 pm, all the documents were reverified and Saldanha again deputed Deolekar to rush the passenger to the boarding gate in another adrenaline-fuelled run which ended with Rodrigues stepping into the seemingly cavernous Dreamliner aircraft. "The flight was surreal. The Dreamliner felt huge. The crew treated me like a Maharaja. Capt Rayo Mucadum personalised all inflight announcements. Mr Rodrigues we have a crew of 8 to serve you today….Thank you for flying with Air India, Mr Rodrigues," he said adding that the entire crew saw him off to the passenger coach bus. Air India did not respond to a query sent by TOI. Currently, flights from India to Dubai have been flying empty or with few passengers due to the UAE restrictions which permits only its residents, holders of UAE Golden visa and diplomats to fly from India to UAE. Saldanha, a Dubai resident for 25 years, a Golden visa holder had bought a Rs 38,000 business class ticket to return to Dubai after a ten day stay in India, spent largely in a Mangaluru hospital ICU from where his father was admitted with severe heart, kidney and lung malfunction. The day after his father returned home, Rodrigues boarded the return flight. "I’ve been flying Dubai-Mumbai-Dubai since 1995. These flights are always packed. Though I was happy to have the aircraft all to myself, I was also sad to see, first hand, the damage done by Covid, first in the hospital ICU and now onboard Air India," he said. "I walked along the length of the passenger cabin, not a passenger in sight. I felt I shouldn’t take pictures or videos out of respect. It’s such a sad time for humanity," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-airline-goes-out-of-way-to-help-lone-passenger-board-flight/articleshow/82988279.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Basic education minister should quit, demands AAP||LUCKNOW: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MP Sanjay Singh has demanded the resignation of basic education minister Satish Dwivedi over the recruitment of his brother in a university under the economically weaker section quota. Singh has said that the resignation by the minister’s brother is not sufficient as the minister was responsible for allowing such a thing to happen. The AAP has also claimed that the minister had purchased properties worth crores in his mother’s name after 2017 when he was elected MLA, proving that he did not come from a ‘poor’ family. “There are multiple wrongdoings in this matter. First of all, the EWS certificate was made in Arun Dwivedi’s name in 2019,,” Singh said. “These certificates are valid only for a year. How was he then given a job on the basis of an expired certificate? We also demand action against the SDM who issued this fake certificate to him and also against vice-chancellor of Siddharth University for having given him this job on the basis of that certificate,” Singh said. The minister’s brother tendered his resignation to the university on Wednesday after the matter was highlighted. However, Singh said that unless the minister himself resigned, no justice could be done. “This job was given at the insistence of the minister. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, who claims to have cracked down on corruption, should take action against his minister,” he said. The party also alleged that Dwivedi purchased several properties for much less than the market rate. Dwivedi said that he and his wife had been professors for several years and that details of any property that he had purchased was in the public domain. “If someone is making allegations, they are free to have these deals investigated,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/basic-education-minister-should-quit-demands-aap/articleshow/82988287.cms||---
---||Goa||Court on Tarun Tejpal case: Survivor was happy, not traumatised||PANAJI: The additional sessions court, Mapusa, which acquitted Tehelka founder-editor Tarun Tejpal on Friday, noted that on the night of the alleged rape, there was “only drunken banter” between the survivor and the accused. The court also noted that the prosecutrix (survivor) could not be called reliable and trustworthy after she declined to show an email to the court and added that the “prosecutrix wants to hide something”. The email, the judge said, was relevant to the case. “The messaging record shows that it was entirely the norm for the prosecutrix (survivor) to have such flirtatious and sexual conversations with friends and acquaintances,” judge Kshama Joshi said. “Therefore, the WhatsApp chats of the prosecutrix and her propensity to indulge in sexual conversations with friends and acquaintances, as well as her admission that the accused was talking about sex or desire because that is what the accused usually chose to speak to her about unfortunately, never her work, proves that the accused and the prosecutrix had a flirtatious conversation on the night of November 7, 2013,” she said. Considering the evidence regarding these messages, the court said, “the chat clearly shows that there was only drunken banter between them”, and that there was “absolutely no denial of the same by the survivor”. The court also said that “CCTV footage does not support the statement that she was in shock or trauma and blinking in tears”. “Evidence of witnesses and printouts of photographs clearly prove that the prosecutrix was absolutely in a good mood, happy, normal, smiling, and did not look distressed or traumatised in any manner whatsoever, though this was immediately a few minutes after she claims to have been sexually assaulted again by the accused,” the judge said. “It is extremely revealing that the prosecutrix’s account neither demonstrates any kind of normative behaviour on her own part — that a prosecutrix of sexual assault on two consecutive nights might plausibly show, nor does it demonstrate any such behaviour on the part of the accused.” The court also questioned as to why the survivor did not reveal the alleged rape incident to her colleagues after the incident. The court also said that the survivor refused to go for a medical examination. “There is no medical evidence on record on account of delay in lodging the FIR and as the prosecutrix refused to go for medical examination,” the court said. Regarding the prosecution claim of an apology sent by the accused, the court observed, “A bare reading of the alleged personal apology categorically shows that his email neither implicitly or explicitly makes any of the admissions or confessions which the survivor demanded in the apology, or with relation to any other offence with which the accused was charged, and is clearly therefore not an apology but an attempt to assuage any discomfort the prosecutrix might have post-facto felt.” The defence lawyer argued that there is ample evidence on record to show that the alleged personal apology was the result of inducement, promise and implicit threat due to the charge made against the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/court-on-tejpal-case-survivor-was-happy-not-traumatised/articleshow/82988284.cms||Murari Shetye

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Govt centres to roll out vaccination drive for 18-44 age group, relaunch first dose for 45+||KOLKATA: The state is all set to expand its vaccination drive in two ways: rolling out the drive for the 18-44 age group from all government hospital Covid vaccination centres (CVCs) and offering first doses to the 45-plus category again. Also, more private hospitals will get their orders to re-launch their vaccination programmes from the coming week. Procuring vaccines directly from manufacturers since the second week of May, Bengal has bought over 11 lakh doses of Covishield. According to the Union health ministry directive, states can use only directly bought doses for the inoculation of 18-44 group. “We have been told to start the 18-44 age group vaccination at the earliest, for which we are preparing a separate team and storage as we cannot mix up the doses coming from state’s own procurement channel and those from the government of India. Doses from GoI are meant for the 45-plus category,” said the nodal officer of a CVC at a medical college. Though the civic centres are yet to roll out the drive for the entire 18-44 age group, the KMC brass have decided to open its 102 centres for the inoculation of a priority groups in the age category. The civic centres will now vaccinate transport workers, bus drivers, conductors, taxi drivers, auto drivers, vegetable and fish sellers and grocery shop owners from 10am to 2pm.  “We need to bring more frontline workers and super spreaders under the vaccination net. So, we will open over 100 vaccination centres for them,” Atin Ghosh, a member of the KMC board of administrators (BoA), told TOI on Wednesday. This apart, the KMC has decided to open its vaccination centres for those in the 45+ age group who want to get their first dose of Covishield . This facility will be available at all the 102 KMC-run Covid vaccination centres in 144 wards. Ghosh said the Covishield first dose would be available from 2pm to 4 pm. All that the recipients need to do is apply on a KMC WhatsApp chat box (8335988888). The applications can be made from Thursday, while their vaccination will start from Saturday. Now, KMC is using 44 centres for administration of Covaxin second dose. “Since the Covishield second dose date has been pushed back, we will extend the first dose to people above 45,” said a health department official. More private CVCs are expected to get their doses. “Had a flight not been cancelled, we would have got 50,000 Covishield doses on Wednesday. We are expecting it latest by Friday and can start our drive from Saturday,” said R Venkatesh, zonal director (east), Narayana Health. The state was to receive 50,000 Covaxin doses on Wednesday but flights were cancelled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/govt-centres-to-roll-out-18-44-vax-relaunch-1st-dose-for-45/articleshow/82986391.cms||Saikat Ray

National Association of Street Vendors of India (NASVI) has demanded that the town vending committees should be involved in the process and timings should be decided on the basis of the nature of goods being sold in a weekly market. The city has more than 400 weekly markets, out of which 272 sites are notified. Arvind Singh, the national coordinator of the association, said a large number of street vendors were on the verge of starvation as all their savings had been exhausted and the administration should think about them while finalising the rules to lift the lockdown gradually. “Weekly markets should be opened on a rotational basis. The leaders in these markets can be roped in to ensure the social distancing and masking rules. Since all 28 town vending committees, which have been mandated to manage the affairs of street vendors by Street Vendors Act 2014, are functional, we should use them to run the weekly markets,” he suggested. According to NASVI, the administration and vendors have already worked together for distribution of the PM-SVANIDHI scheme and the same mechanism should be taken forward. Singh said some of the weekly markets and vendors catered to essential food items but still they were facing harassment from local-level officials. “The timing should also be practical,” he added. The vendors of Sunday Book Bazar near Daryaganj have been appealing to change their timings to 7am to 5pm, instead of the evening schedule. They have already approached and written to the district administration many times, but to no avail. Known by the name of their geographical prefixes, Budh bazars, Shukr bazars, Guru bazars etc come up at a fixed time of the week at specific localities. They attract large crowds, most of them belonging to middle and lower economic groups, while acting as weekly replenishment centres for their reserves. NASVI estimates that the city has 1.5 lakh vendors whose livelihood has been impacted. “The maximum concentration of these markets are in east Delhi while fewer exist in planned areas of central, New and south Delhi,” Singh said. From essential grain items, fruits and vegetables, street food, clothes, flea markets and home merchandise, weekly markets or hafta bazars commonly trade in the items as per the demographics and demands of their localities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/plea-to-govt-keep-weekly-market-vendors-in-mind-while-unlocking/articleshow/82986405.cms||Paras Singh

Raje is meeting community leaders as part of his tour, and is also likely to meet NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Thursday and CM Uddhav Thackeray and opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis on Friday. The BJP MP said the Maratha community is eligible to avail the 10% EWS quota benefit, but the state will have to relax a few conditions related to land holding or area of the residence to extend the benefit to the poor in the community. He said the state can amend the conditions and there was no need to approach the Centre. Raje said the pandemic is not the right time for protest, but warned that if the state does not pay attention to the community’s demands, it will protest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/give-marathas-quota-under-ews-in-maharashtra-bjp-mp/articleshow/83009338.cms||---

---||Delhi||Can’t undo sex offence, can give psychological security to survivor: HC||New Delhi: Delhi High Court has enhanced the compensation and awarded Rs 6 lakh to a six-year-old survivor of sexual assault, observing that the system can provide psychological security or empowerment with monetary help besides prosecuting the offender. “Since the system cannot turn the clock back nor ‘undo’ the offence, there is little else the court can do other than prosecute the offender and provide to the victim whatever psychological security and sense of empowerment that monetary compensation can give,” the high court noted, setting aside trial court’s order of Rs 50,000 interim compensation to the minor boy. Justice Anup Jairam Bhambhani said that while attempting to quantify the compensation payable to the victim even at the interim stage, the court’s effort should be to offer monetary recompense to the extent possible for the atonement of the crime. The court noted that the victim was subjected to physical and mental trauma and emotional scars were left on his psyche. As per the prosecution, the child was subjected to sexual assault, abuse and sodomy by his uncle in his own house in 2020. The trial is underway. Advocate Prabhsahay Kaur, representing the child, contended that the trial court failed to appreciate that even at interim stage the compensation is to be granted to a minor who is victim of sexual abuse to enable them and their family to overcome the incident. The high court directed the Delhi State Legal Services Authority to disburse the amount to the child immediately and clarified that the interim compensation will be adjusted against the final compensation that may be awarded by the trial court on conclusion of the trial. “It is not hard to see that apart from the actual expenses that would be incurred for the petitioner’s psychological counselling and treatment at a specialised institution like Institute of Human Behaviour & Allied Sciences, as recommended by the Child Welfare Committee in its report, it would also be necessary to put money in the hands of the petitioner’s family, to arrange for the petitioner to safely attend school and to cater to his educational needs,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cant-undo-sex-offence-can-give-psychological-security-to-survivor-hc/articleshow/82986471.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Pune||501 inmates released on interim bail, emergency parole since May 12||Pune: Pune: A total of 501 undertrial prisoners (UPs) and convicts have so far been released on interim bail or emergency parole since May 12 as part of the SC-mandated high-powered committee (HPC)'s May 7 and 11 recommendations for decongestion of jails across Maharashtra. Of these, 443 are UPs and 58 are convicts. However, legal experts have said that the process needs to be hastened compared to the current pace of release. The HPC, headed by a sitting HC judge, had recommended courts across the state to decide pending interim bail pleas of 12,751 inmates by May 20. It also directed 3,182 inmates, whose interim bail pleas were rejected by the courts, to reapply for bail and asked the courts to consider the same without getting influenced by their earlier orders. The courts were asked to take a sympathetic view of the interim bail pleas of around 1,000 inmates, who are 65 years and above and suffering from co-morbidities. Additional director general (prisons) Sunil Ramanand said on Wednesday, “It is incorrect to say the process of release is not picking up pace. Our largest component is of the UPs involved in serious offences having punishment of seven years and above. It appears the courts are reluctant to release them on bail.” Ramanand said, “Since April 20, all jail superintendents have collected 16,751 interim bail applications of UPs and filed them before the review committee of the sessions courts for deciding the pleas on a priority basis. We have taken all efforts to decongest the jails to contain the spread of the Covid-19 virus among the inmates and jail staffers." "Some petitions were filed in the Bombay High Court last year, stating that the sessions courts were not working as per the HPC’s recommendations. The HC made it clear that the HPC’s recommendations are administrative. It is taking time to decide on bail pleas because they have to be decided on merit on a case-to-case basis. Most bail pleas in serious offences are getting rejected," he added. Milind Pawar, ex-president of former Pune Bar Association, said, "Most criminal courts have proceeded on leave because of summer vacations. The bail pleas of UPs are listed for hearing before the in-charge courts but the presiding officers are referring the pleas to the regular courts for hearing because they are handling multiple charges of other judges on leave and they are overburdened with work." Pawar said, "The courts are working between 11am and 1.30pm. Online hearing of bail matters/court cases have stopped this year. I will be making a representation to the Supreme Court and Bombay High Court to re-start the facility for hearing bail pleas online between 1.30pm and 5.30pm. The lawyers should be given the choice to argue either in person or via online, either from his or her home/office. The initiative will expedite hearing in bail pleas." Lawyer Pratap Pardeshi said, "The courts are liberal in granting bail to UPs in minor offences, but they are reluctant in giving the same relief in serious offences. Bails are also granted in medical emergency cases. The Supreme Court has issued directives to decide the bail pleas within 20 days because of the surge in Covid-19 cases after the second wave. But most courts are on leave." Pardeshi suggested that the judicial system should pick up speed, considering the prevailing pandemic situation and impose stringent conditions on UPs while releasing them on bail at the earliest. He added that the officials from the prisons department and police have shown promptness in filing and replying to the bail pleas. The prosecution has also extended all possible support for expediting bail matters.

The trust-run hospital has so far helped 50 such patients economically so that they can purchase expensive medicines for the treatment. “We are already administering injections at the price for which we purchase from the manufacturers, but that is also expensive, so we decided to help the patients,” said Mathur Savani, chairman of the hospital. The hospital will be helping 50 more patients with financial support. The hospital too is facing a shortage of injections due to which they are conducting surgeries accordingly. So far 105 patients have taken treatment at the hospital of whom 69 have been discharged. However, these 69 patients continue the day-care treatment for their daily dose of the injections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/hospital-extends-financial-help-to-mm-patients/articleshow/82984274.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Prevent illegal sale & hoarding of fertilizer, govt directs DMs||Lucknow: The state government has upped its ante over possible hoarding and smuggling of fertilizer – inter-state as well as across international border (Indo-Nepal) – by anti-social elements during the forthcoming season of kharif crop cultivation. The development comes less than a week after the Centre increased the subsidy on Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP) fertilizer by 140% to provide it to farmers at Rs 1,200 per sack. In a missive to all district magistrates on May 25, additional chief secretary, agriculture, Devesh Chaturvedi said hoarding and possible smuggling of fertilizer should to be checked by conducting regular inspections of selling centres and physical attestation of available stock. In case of international border, the state government has restricted sale of fertilizer by private centres. For this, police and state investigation bureau (SIB) have been asked to keep a vigil. “The state government is committed to providing quality fertilizer to farmers,” Chaturvedi said in the order. While sowing of kharif crop started in mid-May, the demand for fertilizer is expected to go up in June and July. The state agriculture department had, on January 12, pitched for district-level committees to oversee supply of fertilizer to the farmers after assessing demand and supply. Chaturvedi said the district-level committees should assess the situation on a weekly basis and carry out distribution of fertilizer after an assessment of crop and on the basis of Aadhaar card of farmers. The ACS said the distribution of fertilizer to retail outlets be done under the supervision of the district magistrates. A squad comprising officials of agriculture and revenue departments should conduct enforcement drives to prevent hoarding by retailers and wholesalers, he added. The department has also asked the district authorities to see that retailers and wholesalers do not tag other items for sale with fertilizer. To bring in transparency, the department has directed sale of fertilizer through e-PoS machines. Chaturvedi said that action should be initiated against retailers/wholesalers who do not sell fertilizer through e-PoS machines and do not give receipt to farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/prevent-illegal-sale-hoarding-of-fertilizer-govt-directs-dms/articleshow/82988368.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Bengaluru||The Grand Old Patriarch of Gandhian Revolution||As a true Gandhian and an eternal fighter for justice, Doreswamy never craved for power all his life even when it came knocking at his doors. He lived in a rented house all his life and had firmly refused to accept the government’s offer to get him a house sanctioned. He had told his wife that if she accepted such a gift, she was free to live there but he would go and live in Gandhi Bhavan. His grit was such that he would sit for long hours without even getting up once even when he hit a century. He could read without glasses, eat whatever that was offered. Even his memory was phenomenal. He remembered the date on which Godse had alighted the train from Pune at Yeshwantpur Railway station. The recollection of this incident was found unpalatable to certain sections of people for whom Mahatma Gandhi is an anathema. He enjoyed the adoration people showered on him. Not because he was self-indulgent, but he loved people, to be with them at any time or place they wanted and fight for a cause that he found just honest and close to his cherished belief in Gandhian principles. His public life spanning nearly nine decades, from being a journalist during the early years of the freedom struggle to supporting the recent farm struggle, is perhaps one of the longest in our times. He was secular to the core but did not spare the Congress or any other party that he believed had moved miles away from the spirit of independence. He firmly believed that the country needed a second freedom struggle as it had lost its freedom long back. He lived a spartan life, but rich with ideas and experience. One cannot but recall the famous lines of Einstein on Gandhi: ‘Generations to come, it may well be, will scarce believe that such a man as this one ever in flesh and blood walked upon this earth’.

This is the first time that the award, being given to litterateurs from Malayalam and other Indian languages, is going to a non-Keralite writer. Malayalam University vice-chancellor Anil Vallathol, writer Alamcode Leelakrishnan and poet Prabha Varma were members of the award jury. The award comprises a cash prize of Rs 3 lakh, citation and plaque. “Vairamuthu stands apart with his mellifluous language, original images and philosophical insights,” said jury member Prabha Varma. Vairamuthu had faced a series of complaints of sexual misconduct and harassment from women, including playback singer Chinmayi Sripaada. She had called out on him and posted a thread of tweets revealing instances of harassment she had faced from him. Vairamuthu had brushed aside the allegations and said that it had become a norm to malign respected persons and that truth shall win. Chinmayi had rebutted his statement on social media. Vairamuthu’s first poetry collection was released in 1972, when he was still a student of Pachayappa’s College in Chennai. In his literary journey spanning 49 years, he has won several national and international awards for his contribution to literature. His novel ‘Kallikaattu Idhigaasam’ won the Sahitya Akademy award. ‘Thanneer Desam’ won the Aadhithanar literary prize. Poet Vairamuthu has received seven national film awards for his songs. He has also been conferred with India’s prestigious Padma Shri and Padma Bhushan awards. “I am honoured to receive the prestigious ONV Kurup award. This award, from Kerala, the land I highly respect for its soulful literature, gives me immense happiness. I see this as a crown placed on Tamil by its sister language,” said Vairamuthu in a statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/onv-award-for-poet-vairamuthu/articleshow/82986522.cms||---

The hospitals witnessed a massive drop in patient count, both in emergency wards and OPDs. Even fever clinics, which are visited by suspected Covid patients or those with confirmed reports, wore a deserted look, though hospitals had been on guard since Tuesday, taking measures so that they could treat patients despite possible destructions by the cyclone. “We hardly had 10 patients in the OPD on Wednesday. Even the fever clinic, where people report for getting their Covid test done, had only 23 turning up,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. OPD footfall has been on a downswing ever since the enhanced restrictions were imposed on May 15. But still, hospital OPDs saw a daily average of 50 to 100 outdoor patients. “Our fever clinic had no patient on Wednesday. We had stepped up infrastructure at our emergency unit in case people were injured in the natural calamity, but much fewer patients than usual came during the day,” said Subhasish Datta, general manager operations, Ruby General Hospital. OPD footfall in other hospitals, like RN Tagore Institute of Cardiac Sciences and all three units of AMRI Hospitals, remained 10% to 20%. With the memories of Amphan devastation still fresh, many recovered Covid patients, who were due for discharge on Wednesday, preferred to stay back for a day. As a result, the discharge count also went down on Wednesday. But hospitals could accommodate all as only a few number of people came for admission. “The cyclone spared the city. But many patients from districts and city fringes did not want to go home on Wednesday as they feared they might not be able to return to hospital immediately in case of an emergency. The discharge rate was about 60%,” said Simmerdeep Gill, COO of CK Birla Hospitals CMRI. At the three units of AMRI Hospitals at Dhakuria, Mukundapur and Salt Lake, where the average daily discharge rate is around 70, the three units combined had only 29 patients who went home on Wednesday. Around 40 discharges were held back on request of patients’ family members, who feared cyclonic storm and thundershower, an official said. “We had to defer discharge of 20 patients that will be done on Thursday as it would be more comfortable for them,” said R Venkatesh, zonal director (east), Narayana Health. “At Peerless, we had only two discharges against our average daily discharge of 30. Patients who did not want to go home included many from places in South 24 Parganas that were predicted to be affected by the cyclone. The discharge will pick up from Thursday,” said Mitra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/opds-emergencies-wear-deserted-look-on-yaas-day-many-patients-defer-discharge/articleshow/82986463.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Delhi||8 new species slither into city’s snake list||New Delhi: A five-year survey carried out between 2016 and 2020 by the environmental studies department at Delhi University has added eight snake species to the city’s herpetofauna checklist, updating the 1997 list in the book, Fauna of Delhi, which is widely used to track its native species. While the historical book only has a record of 15 snake species sighted in Delhi, these eight new species in the city’s reptilian list takes the total count to 23. The research was carried out from January 2016 to October 2020, in assistance with NGOs like Wildlife Trust of India and Fauna Foundation of India across Delhi’s urban parks, urban forests, waterbodies and farms, while also accounting for road-kill data of snakes. This included night-field surveys, pitfall traps and nocturnal road crusing. The study says the additions are common bronzeback tree snake, common trinket snake, common cat snake, barred wolf snake, common kukri, streaked kukri, common sandboa and saw-scaled viper. Gaurav Barhadiya, a PhD researcher and part of the study, said the preliminary research was part of a bigger research being carried out by them to analyse urban biodiversity in Delhi’s green spaces. “Snakes are one of the most misunderstood animals out there. Unfortunately, our conservation strategies are mostly based on glamorous taxa such as mammals, which leads to smaller and less conspicuous vertebrates or invertebrates often being neglected. Snakes are an important part of biodiversity and play an extremely important role in an urban ecosystem by maintaining a prey-predator balance,” said Barhadiya, stating they also help in eliminating disease-causing pests like rats and mice. Professor Chirashree Ghosh, main supervisor of the research, said documentation of urban biodiversity was an urgent requirement as the latest statistics and generated data on urban floral and faunal biodiversity had not been compiled and documented properly. “Rapid urbanisation is impacting heavily the animal population. Future planning should be inclusive of preservation of its green spaces and wildlife.” Dr Suryaprakash, zoologist at Jawaharlal Nehru University who has been studying snakes in Delhi for over three decades, said, “More time is required to identify pockets in Delhi where different snake species are found. We feel there are over 30 snake species in Delhi.” Kartick Satyanarayan, co-founder and CEO of Wildlife SOS, said Delhi might have more species than those that had been recorded so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/8-new-species-slither-into-citys-snake-list/articleshow/82986539.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

Those named as accused in the FIRs include the then-MD and secretary of the department. An official privy to the probe said that the OMR sheets of genuine candidates were fudged, while the OMR sheets of those who were to be selected were overwritten. From April 2012 to March 2017, Uttar Pradesh cooperative department had conducted recruitment for its seven organisations for 2,374 posts through written examination. However, several candidates who had performed well in the examination did not qualify for it. They lodged a complaint with authorities but the then-government gave a clean chit to all the exam organizers, said an officer privy to the probe. However, when the government changed, the candidates again demanded a probe. On April 27, 2018, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath asked the SIT to conduct a probe in alleged anomalies done by the Uttar Pradesh Co-operative Institutional Service Board. DG, SIT, RP Singh, confirmed to TOI that as per the findings of the SIT, in October 2020, the first FIR was registered. “We have registered six more FIRs,” he said. One FIR each has been lodged against organisations including UP State Warehousing Corporation, UP Cooperative Federation Ltd, UP Cooperative Union Ltd, UP Cooperative Society and two FIRs against UP Cooperative Village Development Bank. Chairpersons of the society Ram Jatan Yadav and Onkar Yadav, then secretaries Bhupendra Kumar and Rakesh Mishra, members Santosh Srivastava, then managing director of development bank Narad Yadav, manager Sudhir Kumar, and private agencies which got recruitment conducted have been booked. The charges include dishonesty, forgery of valuable security, forgery for cheating, using as genuine a forged document, destruction of evidence and criminal conspiracy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/omr-sheets-were-fudged-in-cooperative-dept-exam/articleshow/82988430.cms||---

A senior DRDO scientist told TOI over the phone from New Delhi on Wednesday: “Our Defence Bioengineering and Electromedical Laboratory in Bengaluru has developed the technology in the form of a medical oxygen plant (MOP). It is an offshoot technology from the onboard oxygen generation system being developed for the light combat aircraft Tejas.” The MOP generates oxygen directly from the air by utilising pressure swing absorption and molecular sieve technology. “The DRDO has carried out the transfer of technology to two firms to generate oxygen, which will be supplied to the Covid hospitals in the future,” the DRDO scientist said. Resident deputy collector for Jalna, Ravindra Paralikar, on Wednesday said the district civil hospital at Jalna would be the first beneficiary of the MOP developed using DRDO technology. “The district civil hospital will get an oxygen plant having a capacity of 1,000 litre per minute and is expected to get commissioned by the end of the current month. The upcoming plant, in general, can cater to oxygen needs of 190 patients and fill195 jumbo cylinders per day,” he said.

It also involved some sharp detective work in tracking down a cabbie who had kept the doctor’s bag with him for nine days. Dr Komal Jain had boarded a kaali peeli from Wadala on May 16. She was headed to the BKC Covid centre for duty and was carrying a bag of clothes, some money and personal belongings. Between 8 and 9 pm, sometime after she had alighted from the cab, Jain realised her bag wasn’t with her. She asked a security guard at the Covid centre to check the CCTV footage and help her with the cab’s registration number. “I took the registration number to the Wadala police station and requested them to provide the cabbie's address. He lived in a Worli slum. But on visiting the place, I gathered that I had got the wrong man. Locals said his taxi was in Kerala for the past four months,” Jain told TOI. The doctor also realised that the vehicle registration number she had wasn’t correct. Meanwhile, a policeman posted at the BKC centre connected her to his friend at the Bandra traffic chowky on May 24. The traffic police asked for a copy of the CCTV footage and noticed that some of it was blurred. They keyed in different combinations of the registration number seen in the footage into their app containing RTO vehicle records. Finally, a match was found. But the taxi owner’s phone number as per the RTO records was deactivated. “On an impulse, I checked a pending e-challan issued against the cab and found the owner’s current mobile number in it,” said traffic constable Mehboob Tamboli. “When I called him up and said I was a policeman, his immediate reaction was to hang up. But he called an hour later to apologise and said he was in his hometown,” the constable added. The cab owner spoke to the driver of the vehicle and asked him to get in touch with the police and the doctor’s bag was returned. Jain, who had lost all hope of seeing the bag again, was all smiles when the police handed it to her on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-9-days-after-covid-centre-doc-forgets-bag-in-cab-traffic-cops-help-trace-it/articleshow/82990105.cms||Nitasha Natu

Sources said the administration had pointed out that it had not given any clearance for transfer of land to Citco and no approval was taken from heritage committee. These concerns had been raised following a TOI report on reinviting bids for the project. Citco had recently shortlisted open space at Leisure Valley in Sector 10 for the restaurant hanging in the air from a crane at a height of 165ft. Earlier, Citco was planning such a facility either at Leisure Valley, Sector 10, or Sukhna Lake, or Kaimbwala, or the new lake in Sector 42. Later, Leisure Valley was shortlisted. In the first tender, there was only one eligible firm, forcing Citco to reinvite bids. The company, which had submitted the proposal, had said the structure would be secured by aircraft-standard safety belts on comfortable seats that could rotate 180 degrees. It would take around one-and-a-half minute for visitors to reach the peak height of 165ft, and the same time to come down. One batch — comprising 25 people — could stay for 40 minutes. The visitors would have to book seats online on a website and a mobile app, according to the proposal that suggested tickets could range from Rs 2,500 to Rs 4,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/objections-hold-back-mid-air-eatery-project-takeoff/articleshow/82986452.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

While the UT had planned to fix between Rs 2 lakh to 4 lakh per month, the interested firms wanted UT to lower the lease money. Facing flak for frequent auctions of heritage furniture abroad, the administration had recently prepared an action plan to check the practice. The Heritage Protection Cell of the administration had suggested the press building be converted into a museum. The administration had planned to display vintage cars, owned by private people, in this museum. The administration had prepared an inventory of as many as “12,793 heritage items” belonging to Chandigarh. Notably, the entities, including furniture, tapestry, drawings and other things, which were designed, made and used by city’s creator French architect Le Corbusier, his cousin Pierre Jeanneret and others associated with the founding and planning of Chandigarh in the 1950s and 60s, comes under the category of heritage items. In Chandigarh, the Government Museum and Art Gallery has possession of large number of heritage items, including furniture, drawings, murals, models among others made by Le Corbusier and his other associates. Besides, Punjab and Haryana civil secretariat, Punjab and Haryana vidhan sabha, Punjab and Haryana high court also have huge stock of heritage furniture. Corbusier, Jeanneret touch Le Corbusier and his cousin Pierre Jeanneret had designed heritage furniture items in the city. Both used to design chairs, tables, stools, and racks for government offices in the late 1950s. The designed furniture lot was replaced in the late 1980s and early 1990s, after which the administration had tossed the items in its backyards and stores. Unaware of the furniture's international worth, most UT departments had auctioned the old furniture presuming it to be junk.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ut-gives-3rd-shot-at-museum-of-heritage-furniture-vintage-cars/articleshow/82986480.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

The Pimpri Chinchwad police issue e-passes to people willing to travel between districts of Maharashtra, or outside, for various emergency situations, such as death in the family, medical reasons, to catch a flight or attend a wedding. “The state government’s orders are clear. People should follow the orders while applying for the e-passes,” the officer said. Assistant commissioner of police (Pimpri Chinchwad) Prashant Amrutkar told TOI, “The cybercrime cell of the Pimpri Chinchwad police has been assigned the task of checking and verifying the applications for the e-passes. We started issuing travel e-passes to citizens from April 23. Since then, the police have received 93,780 applications and e-passes were issued to 20,250 of them.” Amrutkar said, “We have rejected 52,216 applications, as the people had cited flimsy reasons, such as ‘getting bored in house’ or ‘no one at home to cook’, to travel.” The Pune city police have, during the period, approved 60,039 e-passes to facilitate citizens’ movement for emergency reasons. However, the number of applications was as high as 2,33,042. As many as 1,21,558 e-pass applications were rejected for reasons like submission of improper documents, inappropriate emergency travel requests and uploading jpeg files instead of PDF format, said an officer from the Pune crime branch. Abhinav Deshmukh, superintendent of police (Pune Rural), “We have so received 75,522 applications, of which 18,285 have been approved. We have issued passes only for genuine emergency reasons.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/flimsy-requests-for-e-passesleave-cops-at-their-wits-end/articleshow/82986563.cms||Mihir Tanksale
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh has .7% of 11,000 black fungus cases in country||CHANDIGARH: The city has 83 of the over 11,000 mucormycosis (black fungus) cases reported in the country so far, a mere .7%. Premier medical institute PGI has 53 cases from Haryana, Punjab, Chandigarh and some other states. Staying safe from fungal infections due to Covid“I have seen a Covid case with both mucormycosis and aspergillus (another fungus). We used to see these cases earlier too, but they have suddenly risen, mainly in those who have uncontrolled diabetes, Covid and/or were on high dose of steroids,” said Prof Jagdish Chander, microbiologist, Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32. While the central government has allocated 211 vials of Amphotericin B --- the drug for the treatment of black fungus-- microbiologists feel this amount is insufficient as five vials per day are required. “Within 15-20 days, the numbers have risen to 53 in the institute. Earlier, we used to see around 65 cases in a year. There are some theories that the use of industrial oxygen instead of medical oxygen, of zinc supplements and humidifiers in the oxygen concentrators are contributing to the increase in the cases. These have no scientific validation,” said a faculty member in PGI. Moreover, there is no serological testing for the infection meant for detection of antibodies. “There is no such thing found in the immune response as it is a rapidly devastating disease. The antibodies are less and if the necrosis are not entirely removed, there will be recurrence,” said Prof Jagdish. Not many private or government secondary care hospitals are able to detect the infection in the absence of expertise. The samples are sent to GMCH in case of suspected case. “However, if the fungus is detected timely and the dead tissues are removed surgically, patient can survive without anti-fungal medicines as well,” said Prof Jagdish.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/city-has-7-of-11k-black-fungus-cases-in-country/articleshow/82986520.cms||Shimona Kanwar

Vijayan told the secretaries that the government would back them for their right decisions, but would not tolerate corrupt practices. He said that there is still a lot of delay in processing a file and secretaries should fix a maximum time frame for which a file can be retained by a particular official. He said that it should also be examined if a file should pass through the hands of many officials and a system should be put in place through a collective decision taken under the chief secretary’s leadership. The chief minister asked each secretary to examine recommendations of the administrative reforms commission in their respective departments. If the files demand secrecy, it should be maintained. It should not be leaked to those with vested interests. Any information from the files should go out only under RTI Act, he said. Secretaries and the chief secretary were asked to ensure that the vacancies in government departments are properly informed to PSC and they must assess the progress in the framing of special rules for recruitment in posts that haven’t been referred to PSC. He instructed officials that there should not be delays in the distribution of CMDRF. Vijayan instructed the secretaries to prioritize the list of assurances made in the government’s political manifesto and prepare a list of implementation plan in a time-bound manner. The targets should be split into those that can be implemented in 100 days, in the next one year, and thereafter as yearly targets, which will be periodically reviewed. The government appointed a three-member committee consisting of additional chief secretary (finance), additional chief secretary (local self-government) and secretary (women and child development) to prepare an action plan to implement the Smart Kitchen project that is one of the main promises in the election manifesto. The same should be submitted before July 10, he added.

The team will also comprise Senior Superintendent of Police Muktsar D Sudarvizhi and Deputy Superintendent of Police, Budhlada (Mansa), Prabhjot Kaur. Earlier an all-male SIT was formed to investigate the case. The court has directed the SIT to probe the rape case registered against ASI Gurvinder Singh as well as the NDPS case registered against petitioner widow’s son. ASI Gurvinder Singh was found at the house of a widow in a Bathinda village on May 12 following a sting operation. The ASI was accused of sexually assaulting her after framing her son in the NDPS case. The police had arrested Gurvinder after registering a rape case against him and had dismissed him from service. Petitioner’s counsel Gurpreet Singh Bhasin said the high court bench, in its interim order, had observed that the case "reflects the sordid state of affairs in Punjab Police, particularly in the Crime Investigation Agency (CIA) at Bathinda". The order also referred to the FIR registered against her (widow’s) son under NDPS Act by planting contraband on him so as to arm-twist the petitioner. The court has asked the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Bathinda, to get the FSL report of the audio/video recordings made by the petitioner, upon the same being submitted in the court, which shall be treated as part of case property. Court has also asked state counsel to look into providing protection to the petitioner under the Witness Protection Scheme, 2018.

The vaccine mix-up for the first and second dose took place at Badhni primary health centre in Audhai Kalan village of the district, where a group of villagers were given Covishield in the first week of April and Covaxin on May 14. The rulebook strictly recommends against mixing of vaccines even though the impact of such an aberration is still under research. Though nobody complained of side effects, the local health office has launched a probe. Recalling sequence of events, villagers accused health teams of apathy. State to bear cost of post-Covid treatment The Uttar Pradesh government will provide free treatment to hospitalised patients suffering from post-Covid-19 complications. The facility will be made available in all state medical colleges — state-aided, autonomous and private institutions, including SGPGI, KGMU, and RMLIMS, reports Shailvee Sharda. P 5 ‘No one even checked my vax history’ I got the first dose of Covishield on April1, the second vaccine was administered on May 14. When I went for my second dose, no one bothered to check my vaccination history and gave me a Covaxin jab. Now, I am living in fear of developing ailments,” said a villager, Ram Surat. Admitting negligence, chief medical officer, Siddhartnagar, Dr Sandeep Chaudhury, said: “This is a clear deviation from norms. A cocktail of vaccines is not allowed. We ordered an inquiry and received the report.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: No case filed against driver, but couple in mishap awarded Rs 18L||Mumbai: Ruling that victims not pressing charges against an offending driver does not mean he is innocent, a Motor Accident Claims Tribunal ordered a car owner from Powai and an insurance company to pay around Rs 18 lakh (with interest) to a 62-year-old Ghatkopar resident and his wife who were left with fractures after the driver of the car they borrowed from a friend lost control on the highway in 2014. The couple, Laxman Bhalerao who was then working with the police department, and Aruna, did not file a criminal case against the driver but moved the tribunal, for compensation from the car owner Bhanupratapa Singh and his insurance firm, Tata AIG Genearal Insurance Company. The tribunal said that when Aruna’s statement was read as a whole, it became more than obvious that she was not willing to initiate criminal proceeding against the driver without compromising her legal right for compensation. “Therefore, her police statement ends with the sentence that she has no complaint against anyone. The statement certainly does not say that the car driver was innocent. At the same time the police statement of claimant reflects all facts which indicate negligence of the driver,” the tribunal said. Aruna’s pay also included Rs 84,000 as reimbursement for expenses for hiring a domestic help to cook and clean during their year of recovery. Other components encompassed medical expenses, pain and inconvenience suffered and prolonged physiotherapy expense. The Bhaleraos moved the tribunal in October 2014. in separate pleas, they submitted that on June 9, 2014, at 2.20 pm, they were on the way to the city from Kolhapur. It was alleged that the driver, Dhiren Menta, was driving in a rash and negligent manner. The couple alleged that on Pune-Bangalore highway, when a motorcycle suddenly came in front of the car, to avoid an accident, the car driver took a right turn, ran over a divider and then rammed into a canal wall. The couple said they both suffered several fractures requiring repeated hospitalisation, limited their mobility and they required care. The insurance company strongly argued that no offence was registered by the police against the driver or any allegation made that the mishap occurred due to his rash and negligent driving. The tribunal, however, said that from the driver’s statement, it was clear that on noticing the two-wheeler, instead of applying brakes he swerved his car to the right. “Had he applied the brakes, the mishap could have been averted... it appears the car was in speed. Had it been at slow speed, it would not have mounted on the divider. Also, the driver did not apply the brakes to avoid the accident,” the tribunal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-case-filed-against-driver-but-couple-in-mishap-awarded-rs-18l/articleshow/82990203.cms||Rebecca Samervel

---||Kochi||Kerala: Man after whom a village is named dies in Alappuzha||IDUKKI: A 96-year-old man, after whom a village in the district is named, died in Alappuzha on Wednesday. Balan Pillai, the deceased, had moved to Mathirapally Varun Nivas in Alappuzha years ago, but the name of the place remained after him. Balan Pillai City is a town near Nedumkandam in Idukki district. Pillai reached Kallar Pattom Colony, the first colony set up by the state in the high range of Idukki as part of the “Grow More Food” scheme in 1955, as a settler farmer under the scheme. He started a shop in the village bordering Tamil Nadu. In those times, donkeys were used to transport goods from Tamil Nadu to Kerala. The area came to be known as Balan Pillai City, and is now the main hub of Ramakkalmedu tourism center. Balan PillaiBalan Pillai city gained popularity after the release of Kunchakko Boban and Ann Augustine starrer Malayalam film ‘Elsamma Enna Aankutty’. Manoj Mathirappally who authored a book “Idukki Desham Charithram Samskaram” said that the names of the places are linked with the culture of the area. “In Idukki, people consider all places to be cities. When asked one, where are you going, people reply, ‘to the city’,” said Mathirappally. “In the settlement period, there would be just one or two shops in every village where most goods would be available,” he added. In Idukki high range, there are many places that derived its name from the first shop owner there. Ummakkada, Labbakada Appachan Kada, Appappancity are some of the places. Many village names in the district are suffixed ‘City’. NR City, Aathmav City, Kuruvila City, Mike City, Kuttappan City, Anakkulam City, Kuwait City, Thomman City, Palli City and Elappally City are some of the villages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/man-after-whom-a-village-is-named-dies/articleshow/82986637.cms||Sandeep Thomas
---||Delhi||Sushil Kumar case: Four henchmen of Neeraj Bawana held||NEW DELHI: Two days after TOI reported that Delhi Police had stumbled upon substantial evidence on arrested wrestler Sushil Kumar’s links with gangster Neeraj Bawana, four of the latter’s henchmen have been arrested. The quartet works for the Kala Asaudia-Bawana gang and their presence was established at Chhatrasal Stadium where wrestler Sagar Dhankad was murdered. The arrested men — Bhupinder Bhupi, Mohit Bholi, Gulab Pehelwan and Manjeet Chhunilal — belong to Jhajjar and Rohtak. The Scorpio seized from the spot belonged to Bholi. DCP (Rohini) Pranav Tayal said, “The four men, who had non-bailable warrants issued against them, were nabbed by a team led by ACP Brahmjeet Singh and inspector Ishwar Singh. They were found to be associates of Sushil Kumar in wrestler Sagar Dhankad’s murder case at Chhatrasal Stadium. They have revealed the entire conspiracy and the sequence of events.” Police got a tip-off that four of the accused in Dhankad’s murder would come to Ghewra village to meet an associate after which a trap was laid. The accused were identified by the informer and they were nabbed after a brief chase. The arrested men disclosed that on the intervening night of May 4 and 5, they had gone to Chhatrasal Stadium at the behest of Kumar. “They reached the stadium around midnight in two vehicles, a Scorpio and a Brezza. After committing the crime, they heard a police siren in the vicinity and fled on foot leaving their vehicles behind,” said Tayal. Kumar’s connections with Bawana were first reported by TOI. The report had also mentioned that many people accompanying Kumar were Bawana’s henchmen. The rival side had gang members of Dubai-based criminal Kala Jathedi. Kumar not only assaulted Dhankad, but also another man named Sonu, a notorious criminal with 19 cases of murder, extortion and robbery lodged against him. Jathedi had been grabbing disputed properties in Delhi through Sonu and others. Kumar allegedly joined hands with Jathedi a while ago and landed a flat in M2-Block of northwest Delhi’s Model Town, which was at the centre of the entire controversy. This flat was being used to shelter criminals belonging to the Jathedi-Lawrence Bishnoi gang and many crime plots had been hatched there, said an officer.

The monks — Acharya Bhagwant Jinratnasurishwar Maharaj and Muniraj Viragratna Maharaj — had developed Covid symptoms while they were in Palitana. Since the temple town Palitana did not have proper treatment facilities, doctors advised them to go to a bigger city. The two monks, who were siblings before they attained monkhood, got admitted at Covid care centre at Adajan. Incidentally, their third sibling Naresh Adani, who lives an ordinary life, also got admitted at the same centre. The two monks said that they had heard about excellent treatment facilities at Covid care centres in Surat in discourses delivered by other monks, so they came all the way to Surat. After undergoing treatment for 15 days, the two monks were discharged on Wednesday and they proceeded for their journey.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/two-palitana-jain-monks-beat-corona-in-surat/articleshow/82984463.cms||---
---||Pune||PMPML set to introduce new cashless fare system||PUNE: The Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) is set to start a non-contact fare payment system within three months. The introduction of the new system would mean cancellation and replacement of the mobile integration (MI) cards launched in 2017, PMPML chairman and managing director Pajendra Jagtap said. “We have tied up with Ibix cash to introduce a system of cashless payment of fares as an option for our commuters. We will be able to float the system in three months. The MI cards will be replaced by new cards,” he said. When the MI cards were introduced, the PMPML authorities had called them a game changer. They had said these cards could be used for payment of fares and would be integrated with other modes of public transportation in the city, especially Metro. “The MI cards didn’t become popular among the commuters. Moreover, these cards are a close-loop type, which means they can only be used to avail the PMPML services. The new cards will be based on an open loop system and can be used to pay fares for PMPML and Pune Metro services,” the CMD said. “Ibix has already provided the special ticketing machines to us and the conductors are being trained to use them. The whole non-cash payment plan will be launched in phases,” Jagtap said. APMPML official said they were still deliberating what to do with the balance remaining unused on the MI cards once the cards were discontinued. Commuters and activists were confused by the PMPML’s plans. “Why were the MI cards introduced in the first place and why was it said that they would be used for all forms of payment? Isn’t this a waste of money? If the cards were not popular among commuters, the PMPML should have put in efforts rather than deciding to scrap them and issue new cards,” activist Sanjay Shitole said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmpml-to-start-new-cashless-fare-payment-system-in-three-months/articleshow/82986606.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Pune||Driven by a sense of purpose, youngsters give Covid-19 victims a dignified farewell||Pune: Cremating bodies of Covid-19 victims may not be the ideal way to celebrate one’s birthday, but for Satish Birajdar, an engineering student, it gives him immense satisfaction to be able to do something for the society, especially in these testing times. Birajdar spent his 24th birthday on May 5 volunteering at the Vaikunth crematorium, cremating the dead till late into the night. Parties and celebrations can wait for these youngsters, but not their sense of purpose in society. “I will remember this birthday for years to come, because I could do something for the society. It gave me a huge sense of satisfaction,” he said. Avinash Dhayarkar, too, spent his birthday on April 27 at the same crematorium. “I am glad that my birthday was spent volunteering for a social cause. It was tough to deal with the situation on the ground at the crematorium. But at the end of the day, the satisfaction I derived by fulfilling my social obligation was beyond words,” he said. Birajdar and Dhayarkar are among a group of youngsters who are helping the bereaved lay their loved ones to rest. They have so far cremated 465 people who died of Covid-19. Many of the dead had no one to perform their last rites as their relatives were also Covid-19 positive and admitted into hospitals. Right from arranging drinking water for relatives of the deceased to performing the last rites of the dead, they take care of everything. They have come together under the banner of Seva Sahyog, Swa-Roopwardhinee and Surajya Sarvangeen Vikas Prakalp to give a dignified farewell to Covid-19 victims. The volunteers work in batches of 8 hours at crematoriums. Women do not generally perform cremation-related rituals. But the volunteering group comprises many young women who do all the work. During the peak of the second wave, they used to be at the crematorium for long hours. “Many of my family members and friends are engaged in social work, which inspired me to get involved in this mission. Helping people in this hour of need is our social responsibility,” said Vaishnavi Rathi, another volunteer. Besides working at the crematorium, the youngsters also volunteer at the Sassoon hospital. To ensure that relatives get death passes in time, they have started an online system for allocation of passes. As many as 1,290 passes were allocated through the system. They have also started a facility for providing free photocopies of important documents. “Waiting at the crematorium is very painful for the relatives. They are overcome by shock and grief. As our social duty, we try to console them. The waiting time has also reduced from two-and-a-half hours to 20 minutes due to better planning,” said Nilesh Dhayarkar, a volunteer at Swa-Roopwardhinee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/driven-by-a-sense-of-purpose-youngsters-give-covid-19-victims-a-dignified-farewell/articleshow/82986646.cms||---

Skygazers were keen on witnessing the celestial spectacle during which a bigger and brighter moon lights up the sky and hence followed all Covid protocols earnestly. Since the impact of the cyclone that made landfall on the east coast was imminent, clouds often interrupted every now and then, but the astronomy enthusiasts stayed glued to their positions from 5.54pm to 7.19pm to enjoy the beauty of the Supermoon. “The best view one gets of a celestial event is from Old City, where the moon looks more beautiful when its rises above historical monuments like Rumi Darwaza and Clock Tower. Due to the pandemic, I was in two minds whether to venture out or not, but couldn’t resist myself finally out as it was the last Supermoon of the year,” said president of Scientific Knowledge for Youth Amateur Club Swapnil Rastogi. Scientific officer at Indira Gandhi Planetarium, Sumit Srivastava said, “We had made arrangements to live stream the Super Flower Moon — when the moon reaches closest to earth in its orbit, making it appear slightly bigger than average full moon, but clouds didn’t allow an uninterrupted view.” “The full moon in May is called Flower Moon, and since it was a Supermoon, it is being called Super Flower Moon,” he added. The next celestial spectacle will be on May 28 when Venus and Mercury will be just 0.4 degrees apart. We will be able to see such close conjunction of the two planets next only in 2033. Similarly, Moon and Jupiter will be in conjunction on May 31, and Moon and Saturn on June 1, Srivastava said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/hide-seek-stargazers-get-fleeting-glimpse-of-supermoon-amid-clouds/articleshow/82988517.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The office and residential premises at Ahmedabad belonged to Snehal Ajitbhai Patel, a director in multiple companies along with Deshmukh’s younger son Hrishikesh, and in some firms with his elder son Salil, sources said. The Nagpur premises included the residence and office of businessman Sagar Bhateware, who too is a director in several companies associated with the Deshmukhs. Patel, Bhateware and Hrishikesh are directors in Rabia Properties since 2010, and one of the several companies whose financial transactions are under ED scanner. ED officials refused to share the details of the premises searched in Mumbai, but sources indicated that the person is “politically and socially connected”. During the raids, which continued till late on Tuesday, the ED collected digital records and documents for examination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/ed-searches-12-premises-of-six-deshmukh-aides-in-3-mumbai-cities/articleshow/82990322.cms||Vijay V Singh
---||Delhi||Delhi: Mercury to touch 40°C, but heatwave unlikely this May||NEW DELHI: While the maximum temperature is likely to remain 40 degrees Celsius or below till month-end, this May is likely to see no heatwave day. Due to five western disturbances and the impact of Cyclone Tauktae that resulted in highest ever rainfall on a day, the day temperature never reached 42 degrees Celsius. In May last year, four heat waves were recorded. A heatwave is declared when the maximum temperature is 45 degrees Celsius or above or when the maximum temperature is at least 4.5 degrees above normal. The normal temperature around this time of the month is 40.4 degrees Celsius. As Cyclone Yaas and a western disturbance are likely to impact the region in the remaining days of the month, the day temperature is expected to hover around 38-39 degrees Celsius. According to India Meteorological Department’s data, the highest maximum temperature in May so far was recorded at 41.5 degrees Celsius on May 2. In 2020, the highest temperature reported on a day in May was 46 degrees Celsius. Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at IMD and head, Regional Weather Forecasting Centre, said, “No heatwave has been reported this month so far. As the temperature is expected to remain low in the remaining days of the month, there are less chances of heatwave. The temperatures mostly remained below normal due to the influence of five western disturbances that caused cloudy skies and rain. Cyclone Tauktae also caused Delhi to break the all-time record of highest rainfall in a day in May.” Last week, Safdarjung, Delhi’s base station, recorded 119.3mm of rainfall between 8.30 am on May 19 and 8.30 am on May 20. It was the highest rainfall recorded in 24-hour in May due to the impact of Cyclone Tauktae. The previous highest for a single day in May was 60mm, recorded all the way back in 1976. On Wednesday, the maximum temperature was recorded at 39.5 degrees Celsius, one degree below normal while the minimum temperature stood at 22.6 degrees Celsius, four notches below normal. “The maximum temperature may rise slightly to 40 degrees Celsius on Thursday, but it may hover around 38-39 degrees Celsius from May 28 to 31. The temperature is predicted to dip on Friday as the wind direction would change to easterly under the influence of Cyclone Yaas. The temperature is unlikely to rise because a western disturbance may impact the region by month-end,” said a Met official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mercury-to-touch-40c-but-heatwave-unlikely-this-may/articleshow/82986733.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Delhi||City’s ozone levels rose during lockdown last year, says study||New Delhi: According to a recent research conducted by experts from Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, India Meteorological Department and Utkal University, a 10-15% increase in ozone was witnessed during the lockdown in Delhi last year. The concentrations of nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide and volatile organic compounds, however, declined by 35–50% during the same period. The study, which was recently published in the international journal, Heliyon, says ozone mainly rose due to high concentration of nitrogen oxide and rise in temperature. “Ozone first witnessed a downfall in March, when the lockdown was imposed, but it rose again by March-end. The overall decline of ozone was 3%. However, the ozone level witnessed an increase of 10-15% from March-end to April-end in 2020. It was due to high concentration of nitrogen oxide and rise in temperature. But the other primary and secondary pollutants continue to decrease during the same period,” said one of the researchers of the study. According to the research, the nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and volatile organic compounds (VOC) declined by 50%, 37% and 38%, respectively, during the lockdown period of 2020 as compared to similar period in 2019. The lead pollutant in Delhi’s air is PM2.5 and PM10 but ozone, NO2 and CO are considered secondary pollutants. The secondary pollutants are not directly emitted from a source like vehicles or industries but they are formed in the atmosphere. Ozone is formed in the atmosphere from reaction between gases in the air under the influence of sunlight. Ozone is a harmful pollutant and is responsible for many health issues. “Ozone’s harmful effect when directly exposed to human being should be understood in proper perspective. The data obtained from this study advances the fundamental understanding of ozone chemistry that may lead to improved ozone parameterisation in chemical transport models and better planning of ozone risk management strategies for any global mega cities,” said the research.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/citys-ozone-levels-rose-during-lockdown-last-year-says-study/articleshow/82986814.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

Forest officials were not able to confirm the species of the whale since the carcass was found in a badly decomposed condition. Locals spotted the carcass early on Wednesday and alerted the forest officials. A team of forest officials visited the spot and collected samples for further investigation. “The postmortem is not possible since the carcass is badly decomposed. We will try to find out if it is natural death or if it was killed,” deputy conservator of forest Yadu Bhardwaj told TOI. “Due to its huge size, we are yet to take a call on its disposal. As per rules cremation and burial both are permissible but looking at its size, burial will be a better option,” said Bhardwaj. “The carcass is decomposed and it is not possible to identify its species from the observation. The whale must have died many days ago. After some detailed examinations we will be able to find out the period of death,” said an official. Crowds from nearby villages have gathered at the spot to see the huge carcass. In the recent past the carcass of a dolphin was also found on the coast of Malvan. In the past, carcasses of whales and dolphins were found on beaches of Valsad, Navsari and Surat. In 2013 the carcass of a dolphin was found in river Tapi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/18-ft-long-whale-carcass-washes-ashore/articleshow/82984597.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

The district has been reporting a positivity rate of 1-1.5% in the rural areas for the past few days, health officials have said. About 2,800 tests are being conducted daily in the rural areas of the district. Ghaziabad has ramped up its daily testing drive. While the target was 5,200 tests between May 1 and 15, it was later increased to 8,150 tests daily. On an average, 8,250 tests are being conducted every day, according to official data. This number includes RT-PCR and antigen tests. If Truenat and tests at private laboratories are counted, then the daily average figure is 8,706. The average daily positivity rate is around 4%, a significant dip compared to the period between May 1 to 15 when it was around 15%. In the first 15 days of this month, the average daily fresh infections were 711. The daily testing target for this period was 5,200 (1,700 RT-PCR and 3,500 antigen tests). But around 4,070 tests were being conducted daily on average. With Truenat and private testing data, the number would go up to 4,648 tests daily on an average. The death toll averaged at 11 a day. In the second half of the month, till May 24, an average of 317 positive cases and five deaths are being recorded daily. According to an official, the RT-PCR lab in the district has a capacity to carry out 900 tests per day, while more than 2,000 samples are being sent to GIMS in Noida daily.

---||Delhi||Delhi better placed than most global cities in climate change fight: Report||New Delhi: Nearly half the global cities at present do not have any adaptation plans to keep people and infrastructure safe from climate threats, despite an increase in average global temperature over the last few decades, a new study has found. As Covid-19 continues to impact the health of people across the globe, the study, released by CDP — “Cities on the Route Towards 2030: Building a Zero Emissions, Resilient Planet for All” — finds almost 43% of cities around the world are not aligned to reducing the increase in global average temperature by 1.5°C. CDP is an NGO that runs environmental disclosures. The report, however, found Indian cities such as Delhi, Kochi, Rajkot, Chennai and Kolkata amongst those which had taken measures in advance to fight climate change. The report also found one in every four cities faced budgetary barriers in taking action against climate change. “CDP’s analysis of 2020 data also shows that 41% of cities have not carried out a climate risk and vulnerability assessment (CRVA) — a key step in climate preparedness where the city identifies people, infrastructure, and resources at risk from the growing physical hazards of a changing climate,” the study states. For Delhi, the study identified its revival of waterbodies and lakes as a key measure to regulate temperature and reduce water scarcity. Delhi is also amongst the cities with its own state action plan on climate change. The report states the creation of new lakes or revival of old lakes, such as Timarpur, Najafgarh, Rohini and Nilothi, will lead to the creation of carbon sinks, thereby allowing natural control of carbon emissions. The study further states carrying out a climate risk and vulnerability assessment (CRVA) was crucial in making cities resilient, with those undertaking CRVA more than twice as likely to report long-term hazards over those without the assessment. They are also likely to take more actions to adapt to climate change than those without. To accelerate de-carbonisation, the actions being taken at present include using energy efficiency measures and retrofits, improving fuel economy and reducing emissions from motorised vehicles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-better-placed-than-most-global-cities-in-climate-change-fight-report/articleshow/82986860.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

These two issues are supply of contaminated water and cleanliness and sanitation of the area. The residents claimed that the recent surge in the Covid-19 cases in the MHC area could be attributed to poor state of public health system as well as supply of muddy tap water and poor hygiene and sanitation conditions. Not only this, the RWA also mentioned in their letter to the mayor that he promised during the annual function of the RWA on March 20,2021 to solve these twin issues on priority, but the condition has now turned from bad to worse resulting in resentment among 3,000 households. Further, residents alleged that the 30-year-old underground water pipes have outlived their life and needed immediate replacement. Unless this is done, they will continue to get muddy and polluted water supply due to frequent leakages. Colonel Gursewak Singh, president of the RWA, said, “Poor sanitation condition in this area is due to less manpower as well as lack of due diligence shown by the existing staff in performing their duty.” Gursewak further added that while on one hand the strength of safai karamcharis deputed at the MHC, which is spread over 60 acres of land, has gradually been reduced from 48 to 28, on the other, new areas are added to responsibility. This is not the first time that the officials of the MHC RWA have knocked the doors of the officials concerned, yet their issues remain unresolved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/muddy-water-coming-from-taps-manimajra-rwa-writes-to-mayor/articleshow/82986826.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The five-member Coram of NGT headed by its chairperson, Justice A K Goel passed these orders while disposing of an application filed by H C Arora, a Chandigarh-based lawyer. In his plea, Arora had sought directions to frame a policy for the cremation of the unclaimed bodies, exclusively in gas crematoria, and to provide some incentive, like free commercial gas cylinders, for motivating people in other cases to cremate the bodies of their dear and near ones in the LPG crematoria. The case set out in the application was that in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic, there have been large scale deaths and there are unclaimed bodies requiring proper cremation, in the interest of protecting the environment. Hearing the plea, the NGT observed that the issue raised primarily concerns action by the administration, having regard to the fact situation and all relevant circumstances at a particular place. The tribunal noted that the applicant has impleaded Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEF&CC), states of Punjab and Haryana as parties. However, having regard to the nature of the issue, the same issue can be looked into by all the concerned authorities of all the states/UTs in the country. “Accordingly, without expressing any opinion on the issue, we consider it appropriate to dispose of this application with a direction that a copy of this order be forwarded to the MoEF&CC, CPCB, chief secretaries of all states/UTs, state PCBs/PCCs, and district magistrates of all the states/UTs by email for such consideration as may be found necessary,” observed the NGT while disposing of the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ngt-asks-centre-states-uts-to-consider-cremation-of-unclaimed-bodies-in-lpg-crematoria/articleshow/82988583.cms||---

Unfortunately, the government is unfazed and not bothered by their plight. We will continue with this fight against the government and stand in solidarity with our farmers. We appeal all to support and break the high-headedness of this government.” He said, “We are here to support the agitation by farmers and protest against the violence and oppression that the state government has subjected them to.” Congress has been supporting farmers since the beginning of the agitation and held multiple protests in the favour of farmers time and again. Senior leaders of the Congress party had held protests on the roundabouts of the city earlier in support of farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/black-day-cong-backs-farmers-protests-outside-raj-bhawan/articleshow/82986790.cms||---
---||Vadodara||Two held from UP for petrol pump loot||Vadodara: After more than a month-and-half of the loot at a petrol pump on the Halol Road, sleuths of the local crime branch (LCB) arrested two men involved in the crime. The accused were nabbed from their home town in Uttar Pradesh and brought to the city on Wednesday. Two other accused of the gang are yet to be arrested. According to the police, the gang reached the petrol pump early on the morning of March 10 on a motorbike and pointing a country-made revolver at the manager, they looted Rs 27,000 from the cash counter in the office and fled the spot. The accused also fired in the air before escaping. Within hours of the incident, cops swung into action and found the abandoned motorbike nearly 2kms away from the petrol pump. After scanning CCTV footage of Halol Road, Panchmahal, Dahod and even Madhya Pradesh, cops spotted a four-wheeler that was following the motorbike in a footage of Golden Chowkdi. “The car had license plate number of Unnao in Uttar Pradesh and it had travelled from Halol Road to Dahod, MP and then reached UP,” said the police. A team of cops left for UP and reached Unnao where they started to mingle with the locals in camouflage. “We found out that the car belonged to key accused Chandra Prakash Sharma, a resident of Unnao, who was involved in several crimes. Our team also learnt that Sharma carried a country-made pistol. We first nabbed Sharma and then arrested his accomplice Atul Kumar Verma,” the police added. The duo revealed the names of Dhanraj Lodhi and Ajay Kumar Patel, both residents of Unnao, who are yet to be nabbed. Sharma has 19 complaints registered against him including loot, robbery, attempt to murder and theft in UP. Verma too has six offences whileLodhi has 20 and Patel has been booked in six different cases in the past.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/two-held-from-up-for-petrol-pump-loot/articleshow/82984075.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Won’t seek documents till June 9 in Anil Deshmukh case, CBI tells Bombay HC||MUMBAI: In some reprieve for the state, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) will hold its hands on seeking certain documents from the government till June 9 in its investigation into its First Information Report (FIR) against former home minister Anil Deshmukh. Additional solicitor general S V Raju made the statement on Wednesday on behalf of CBI after agreeing with a suggestion made by the Bombay high court. A bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and S P Tavade enquired if CBI could hold its hand till a petition by the state is placed before the bench led by the Chief Justice on reopening, post vacation. The documents include the letter dated August 25, 2020 of former commissioner (special investigation department) to the DGP, Maharashtra and the DGP’s letter of August 26 along with all enclosures and digital devices and correspondences from the office of the state home secretary and home minister.  Also included are the original minutes of meetings and files of the police establishment board, Maharashtra, from January 2020 to April 5, 2021 and related correspondence from the home department. The state had last month petitioned HC to seek quashing of two paras from the CBI’s April 21 FIR against Deshmukh, saying it was a “roving” inquiry into the state administration and would “demoralize” the police force. The unnumbered paras 4 and 5, which the state wants quashed, refer to Waze’s reinstatement as assistant police inspector last year, him being assigned most of the ‘sensational cases’, and alleged ‘exercise of undue influence’ over transfers and postings. The CBI said, “A portion of a FIR comprising of 2 paras cannot be quashed and such a request is unheard of, particularly when the said paras are statements of fact.” It said “a statement of fact cannot be quashed.” The matter came up at a special hearing for urgent interim relief before the vacation bench on Wednesday. The state, represented by senior counsel Rafique Dada and Darius Khambata, essentially sought a halt on the investigation into Waze’s reinstatement and police postings and transfers on the ground that it went beyond the preliminary enquiry directed by HC.  The bench noted that CBI, in its written submissions, wanted the matter to be heard by a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni, whose April 5 order was under interpretation. The bench of Justice Kathawalla said it had no objection if the CJ-led bench hears it since it is their order that the state says has been “exceeded” by the CBI in its FIR. The bench directed Raju’s “statement will continue till June 9.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-wont-seek-docus-till-june-9-in-deshmukh-case-cbi-tells-hc/articleshow/82990401.cms||---

---||Delhi||Police bust cow slaughter racket; three arrested||New Delhi: Footage from 1,350 CCTV cameras covering 70 kilometres and scanning of over 60,000 movement passes led Delhi Police to bust a cow slaughtering racket. Of the three men arrested for the crime, two carried a reward of Rs 50,000 declared by Uttar Pradesh Police. The trio — Asif Mohammad (36), Mohnish (24) and Naeem (20) — used curfew passes of Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) and would look for stray cows in outer Delhi. They would take the cattle to an isolated plot, slaughter them and sell the meat. Police are trying to trace the man who bought the meat and other accomplices of the accused. Mohammad has over two dozen criminal cases lodged against him, while Naeem helped his father run a meat shop in Okhla. On May 16, police got a call from Baprola village in outer Delhi reporting cow slaughter. The remains of a cow were found scattered in a vacant plot. A probe revealed that the cattle had been slaughtered there and the main body parts were taken away, while the innards were left behind. DCP (Outer) Parvinder Singh said, “During investigation, it was observed that another cow slaughter had occurred at Baprola in Das Garden Krishan Vatika on the same day. Here, too, all main body parts of the animal were missing and the innards were scattered on the ground. Five teams were formed to track the criminals.” On May 20, another case of cow slaughter was reported from Chander Vihar in Nihal Vihar. Cops realised that the same group was behind all three incidents. After analysing CCTV footage, the vehicle used by the criminals was identified. The vehicle was tracked on 1,350 cameras over 70km, which finally led police to Jamia Nagar. Over a week, 110 suspects from Delhi and UP were rounded up and questioned. In an operation carried out between Monday night and Tuesday afternoon, the trio was nabbed from Batla House. A Maruti Brezza used in the crime and knives used to slaughter cows were seized from them. The accused had allegedly purchased the APMC movement pass for Rs 200. Police are tracing the person who sold them the pass.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/police-bust-cow-slaughter-racket-three-arrested/articleshow/82986916.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Yaas Cyclone misses Kolkata but anti-clockwise movement creates coastal storm surge||KOLKATA: Cyclone Yaas thundered into the Odisha coast — around 290km from Kolkata — with a wind speed of 130-140km/hr, gusting up to 155km/hr, wreaking havoc in and around the Dhamra-Balasore coastline for two-and-a-half hours, from 9.30am to noon. Kolkata, which had braced for a repeat of Amphan, escaped with just light to moderate showers that were sporadic through the day. A wind shear and its heading cloudmass, which hit land first, reduced the wind speed by around 20km/hr. While it left a large part of the Balasore coastline in Odisha devastated, East Midnapore in Bengal, which is a mere 130 km from the landfall spot, suffered major damages as a 2-4m storm surge left large parts inundated. Tourist spots like Digha, Mandarmani, Shankarpur and Tajpur were flooded as sea water gushed, damaging several shops and hotels. As predicted, the sky remained cloudy in Kolkata with a few spells of moderate rain in the morning that were followed by a couple of more drizzles towards the afternoon. But the rain never got heavy or consistent. Early on Wednesday, Kolkata was lashed by a wind speed of 60km/hr with a maximum of 62km/hr for about a minute. The wind surge slowed down subsequently, though. Kolkata received 26.8mm rain in 24 hours till 5.30pm on Wednesday. Between 8.30am and 5.30pm, the city received 9.4mm rain. Interestingly, it wasn’t the cyclone-induced rain that caused waterlogging in the city. It was the water overflowing from Tolly’s Nullah — swelled by high tide — that flooded some areas in Chetla, Kalighat and Bhowanipore. Incidentally, some of these areas received heavier rain than others, said Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC). Even though Kolkata and its neighbourhood was largely unaffected by the cyclonic winds or torrential rains associated with cyclones as Yaas shifted further away from Bengal, the state’s coastline was majorly affected by the storm surge due to multiple reasons, including anti-clockwise cyclonic rotation or circulation, bore tide and Sunderbans’ geography. “Due to the anti-clockwise movement, the rotational velocity and track velocity of the cyclone got added and this led to the bulging of the sea in the eastward direction, causing the storm surge along the Bengal coast. The spring tide contributed to the surge, raising the tide level from the usual 6m to 10m, leading to water crossing the embankment in the Sunderbans,” pointed out climate scientist Lakshmi Narayan Satpati. The geography of Sunderbans worsened matters. While the mouth of the estuary is wide open, it narrows as one progressively moves inward towards land. This leads to a funnelling effect in cyclonic wind conditions, causing the water to bulge and add to the surge. On Thursday, Kolkata may receive a thunderstorm, said the Met office. “Since there’s a lot of moisture left in the atmosphere by the cyclone, conditions are favourable for a thunderstorm if the temperature rises sufficiently. Otherwise, it will remain sunny during the second half of Thursday,” said Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) director G K Das.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cyclone-misses-city-but-anti-clockwise-movement-creates-coastal-storm-surge/articleshow/82984676.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Chandigarh||In Punjab and Haryana, farmers’ ‘black day’ stir across villages, cities, towns||CHANDIGARH: Farm unions, farmers, and groups and people supporting the ongoing agitation against the three agro-market laws passed by the Centre last year, staged protests across all districts of Punjab and Haryana on Wednesday. Sanyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), a grouping of farm unions which is spearheading the agitation, had given a call to supporters to stage the protests as part of observing ‘black day’, a name given to the six-month anniversary of protests on the borders of Delhi. In Punjab, farm body Kirti Kisan Union took out tractor processions at Sadiq, Jaito, Kotkapura, Moga, Baghapurana, Dharmkot, Ajnala, Nawanshahr, Behram, Gurdaspur, Samana, Patran, Kapurthala, Muktsar, Gidderbaha, Majitha and Ajnala, said union president Nirbhay Singh Dhudike. Farmers under Krantikari Kissan Union and other factions took out a protest march in Patiala city, whereas unions burnt effigies in villages of Patiala, Sangrur and Fatehgarh Sahib districts. BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) and BKU (Ekta Dakaunda) held protests at over 200 places in the state. “The central government must read the writing on the wall. Farmers will wait for any number of months for this, even while facing the Covid pandemic,” said farm leaders Darshan Pal and Joginder Singh Ugrahan. Rattan Singh Randhawa, a leader of Zamhuri Kisan Sabha, said they burnt effigies at 172 places, while Kisan Mazdur Sangarash Committee leader Gurbachan Singh Chaba said they protested at 321 places. At the protest sites of Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur borders, effigies of PM Narendra Modi-led government were burnt, and black flags hoisted on trolleys and tents. In Haryana’s Sirsa district, there were skirmishes between farmers and police as the former broke barricades near deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala’s house and burnt his effigy as cops tried to stop them. There was no major incident of violence as farmers returned peacefully after burning the effigy. In other parts of Haryana, protests were staged in Karnal, Panipat, Sirsa, Hisar, Fatehabad and many more disricts. In Jind district, people burnt effigies of the PM and staged protests in Ramkali, Gatauli, Garwali, Julana, Jalalpur Kalan, Karsindhu, Makhand and many other palcess. Farmers in large numbers also reached the toll plazas at Khatkar and Baddowal to burn the effigies of PM Modi, Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar, Dushyant, and BJP MPs Ramesh Kaushik from Sonipat, Sunita Duggal from Sirsa and Brijendra Singh from Hisar, said Azad Singh Palwa, Jind BKU head. Bharatiya Kisan Union (Charuni) held protests in Ambala, Kurukshetra and Yamunanagar districts. Political parties Congress, Aam Aadmi Party and Indian National Lok Dal also extended support to the protest call. In Ambala, farmers protested at Shambhu and Saini Majra toll plazas. In Kurukshetra, protests were held in Pehowa, Ismailabad, Shahabad and Thanesar. In Yamunanagar, farmer held a protest at Gadholi-Gadholi toll plaza on national highway (NH)-344. BKU (Charuni) Haryana president Gurnam Singh Charuni said, “Protests remained peaceful in all villages, blocks and districts of Haryana state and we have not received any report of untoward incident.” Women gathered at main chowk in Makhand village of Uchana town, represented by Dushyant, and made an announcements asking people to step out from their homes. The ‘black day’ protests come close on the heels of SKM writing a letter to the PM on May 21, asking him to resume talks. Farmers had asked for a reply to the letter by May 25, saying that they would otherwise intensify protests. However, the Centre is yet to respond.  'Enthusiasm fizzling out in Majha In Majha, enthusiasm to observe May 26 as Black Day was visible among farm unions and their leaders, but it seemed to be on the wane among regular farmers, most of whom felt the six-month-old agitation had started to fizzle out in the wake of the Centre’s apathy to farmers. In most villages, there were groups of just a handful of farmers with black flags on their hands and vehicles, mostly two-wheelers, raising slogans against the PM Narendra Modi-led central government and waiting for media to cover their agitation. Charan Singh, who owns 2.5 acres, said farm leaders saw a political future for themselves in the agitation, but the protest had given nothing to farmers like him. "How many times do I have to travel to Delhi, stay there, and return empty-handed with pressure to travel once again to Delhi?" said Charan. Balkar Singh, who owns four acres and a Verka milk booth on Loharka Road in Amritsar, said, "The level of energy in our agitation which was six months ago has now fizzled out because the Centre has not promised anything. We have not been able to generate enough pressure on the government." However, he said, he had put up a black flag on his house to honour his friends who were leading the agitation. A farm leader who didn’t wish to give his name admitted to earlier sending a jatha of over 400 people to Delhi every 10 days, but now he could hardly mobilise 70 people to travel to Delhi and that too by train.  ‘Funeral’ of central govt in Karnal village Farmers in Karnal’s Bansa village carried out a mock funeral procession of the central government and performed its mock last rites at the village’s cremation ground. They raised black flags atop their houses too. Political parties back SKM too Congress MLA Kuldeep Bishnoi hoisted black flags at his Adampur and Hisar residences. Former MP Ashok Tanwar also supported the Black Day against agricultural laws. In Fatehabad, Congress women district president Krishna Poonia hoisted a black flag at her house and demanded that the government restart a dialogue with the protesting farmers. In Chandigarh, AAP observed ‘Black Day’ by carrying black flags and protesting in front of the Punjab governor’s residence. Led by party MLAs Kultar Singh Sandhwan and Gurmeet Singh Meet Hayer, the party workers raised slogans in favour of the farmers’ rights and against the central government; demanding repeal of the three farm laws.  Nationwide response: SKM SKM said protests had been reported in Chamarajanagar, Mysuru, Ramanagara, Belagavi, Dharwad, Bangalore in Karnataka; Kurnool, Anantapur, Visakhapatnam, Krishna district in Andhra Pradesh; Amravati, Nanded, Nandurbar, Nagpur, Sangli, Parbhani, Thane, Beed, Sholapur, Buldanha, Kolhapur, Aurangabad, Satara, Palghar, Jalgaon, Nashik, Mumbai in Maharashtra; Begusarai, Vaishali, Purnea, West Champaran, Madhubani, Darbhanga, Sitamarhi, Siwan, Jehanabad, Ara, Bhojpur, Patna in Bihar; Bareilly, Sitapur, Benaras, Baliyan, Mathura in Uttar Pradesh; Sivaganga, Dharmapuri, Tanjore, Tirunelveli, Coimbatore, Karur, Chennai in Tamil Nadu; Jhunjhunu, Bharatpur, Ganganagar, Hanumangarh and many other places in Rajasthan; some places in Himachal Pradesh and Terai region of Uttarakhand; Rayagada in Odisha; Kolkata in West Bengal; Anantnag in Jammu & Kashmir; in Tripura; and Assam; and in all the 22 districts each in Punjab and Haryana.

The other languages in which it would be available are Hindi, Bengali, Telugu, Tamil, Gujarati, Kannada and Malayalam. The move would help aspirants, particularly from rural and tribal areas, to realize their dreams. Till date, many bright students used to stay away from these courses due to fear of English. Many advanced countries like Germany, France, Russia, Japan and China impart entire education in their official languages. “The aim is to impart technical education to the students in their mother tongue so that they can grasp the fundamentals in a much better way,” said AICTE chairman Anil Sahastrabuddhe. “We’ve received about 500 applications from the entire country. We’ve planned to offer UG engineering courses in 11 more languages in future. AICTE is offering course material in all these languages and also translating courses taught under Swayam and massive open online course (MOOC) portals,” he told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/now-engineering-courses-in-hindi-7-other-languages/articleshow/82992198.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Delhi||Gambhir: Will continue to serve even if 1,000 PILs filed||New Delhi: Facing flak from Delhi High Court over distribution of Covid-19 drugs, BJP MP Gautam Gambhir on Wednesday said he will continue to save lives of people even if thousands of PILs are filed against him. The court had, on Monday, directed the drug controller to probe into the issue of politicians buying Covid-19 drugs in bulk amid shortages and observed that while Gambhir must have been distributing the medicines to the best of his intention, the gesture unintentionally did a disservice. The East Delhi BJP MP said he did what he felt was necessary to serve the people and was ready to face any punishment. “The medicines I distributed were the need of that hour. Not one even if thousands of PILs are filed against me, I will continue to serve the people and try to save their lives,” Gambhir said at a press conference. Gambhir said he will accept the court’s decision and asserted he would do it again whenever such an occasion arrives. “Questions should also be asked why medicines were not available at shops in Delhi and why there was shortage of hospital beds and oxygen. I joined politics to serve people, which is what I did,” he said. Gambhir has been involved in distribution of oxygen cylinders, concentrators and Covid medicine Fabiflu to people in his constituency. Delhi Police, under the court orders, also sought his statement in this regard. “Gambhir must have done it with best of his intentions. We are not doubting his intentions. He has been a national player of our country. Our question is whether it is a responsible behaviour when you know the medicine is in short supply,” the court observed. “We are not doubting his intentions but the way he has gone about it, he has actually done a disservice, unintentionally may be. This was not the way that you buy from the market so many strips, certainly not,” the court said. The PIL, filed by Deepak Singh, sought lodging of FIR on the allegations that politicians were able to procure Covid medicines in huge quantity.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: High tide inundates areas along Adi Ganga||KOLKATA: Large parts of the city were spared from inundation as it didn’t pour as it was expected, but some south Kolkata areas went under water after high tide led to Adi Ganga — also known as Tolly’s Nullah — overflowing. Scores of houses along the canal were flooded. According to KMC drainage department sources, large areas of Bhowanipore, Kalighat, Chetla, Hastings and some parts of Tollygunge, which are located along Tolly’s Nullah, were waterlogged after the high tide reached the height of 17.3ft in the Hooghly. At Nabanna, chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday warned that another high tide on Thursday may inundate some areas in Kalighat, Chetla and Bhowanipore. Many people living along Tolly’s Nullah had been removed as a precautionary measure. The CM has asked the police commissioner to shift others who might be in danger. All police stations have been kept on high alert so that police can evacuate marooned people to safer areas in short notice. “I stay in Kalighat and I know how the areas near the canal go under water. It is a problem. Even those in Bagbazar and other places close to the river need to be shifted,” Banerjee said. On Wednesday, some of the slums and makeshift dwelling units along Tolly’s Nullah in Chetla and Hastings were the worst affected. A KMC source said some residents of a slum at Chetla needed to be shifted from their houses as the water level in Tolly’s Nullah rose menacingly during the high tide. Kalpana Mondal, a resident of Chetla Lock Gate slum, said: “Within 15 minutes of the water level rising, my room was flooded. We immediately decided to take out the valuables and left for a safer place,” Mondal said. Rajen Guin, who owns a shop at Kalighat, close to a ghat along the canal, rued that water had entered his shop and damaged his goods. “My business took a toll today as tide water flooded my shop,” Guin said. The KMC sewerage and drainage department on Wednesday issued a warning about two more high tides in the next two days. “We have kept our teams and submersible pumps ready to flush out water from low-lying areas along Tolly’s Nullah,” said a KMC sewerage and drainage department official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/high-tide-inundates-areas-along-adi-ganga/articleshow/82984746.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Jaipur||Covid death data is authentic, says Rajasthan health minister Raghu Sharma||JAIPUR: Health minister Raghu Sharma on Wednesday claimed there was no cover up of Covid death data and due to the efforts of the state government, the rate was less compared to other states. Since the outbreak of Covid till May 25, a total of 7,911 Covid deaths have been reported. Sharma said highest number of 5,093 deaths was reported in April and May this year during the second wave. In the previous 13 months till March, a total of 2,818 casualties were reported. These include a total of 1,632 deaths between August and November and 1,186 in the remaining 9 months. The minister said the state government was making sure to keep a record of every death caused by Covid in hospitals. “It has been our endeavour since the first wave that there should be clarity in the data. Strict instructions have been given to the lower level in this regard so that there is no manipulation at any level. We are worried about the lives of people, not the figures,” claimed the minister. Sharma said Rajasthan is a big state with a population of over 8 crore. In such, deaths due to diseases, accidents, old age and other reasons are natural in addition to Covid fatalities in various districts. “It is possible that some patients due to ignorance or negligence haven’t been admitted to hospitals. In cases where the patient has not undergone a Covid tests, such deaths are not counted as Covid deaths,” he said. Sharma said the medical department was ensuring regular online maintenance of data including sampling, positive cases and deaths. The data released at the government level is completely factual and authentic. The minister has appealed to people to get themselves tested if they have Covid-like symptoms. He said the state government was providing the facility of investigation and treatment in rural areas through door-to-door survey. “People should cooperate with the government. Do not hide if you have symptoms, but get treatment immediately after getting tested,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/covid-death-data-is-authentic-says-health-minister/articleshow/82986934.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Tourism industry seeks loan moratorium||Jaipur: The hospitality and tourism sector has written to finance minister to allow them restructuring of their loans including moratorium on repayments as their units remains closed due to the lockdown. Representatives of the industry said they were unable to service their loans because their units have not been generating any business income for nearly one-and-a-half year barring few months starting from December to February.“What we want is a moratorium on repayments for two years. When you don’t have business for a year, where will you get the money to pay the money to banks,” said Surendra Singh Shahpura, executive member of Federation of Hospitality and Tourism of Rajasthan.While RBI has released guidelines on May 5 for restructuring of loans taken by Micro, Small and Medium Entreprises (MSMEs), majority of the banks are yet to offer the facility to the companies in need.But a senior SBI, Jaipur official said that their board has issued a circular listing the conditions where the MSMEs can be offered the restructuring window.“There are guidelines for restructuring loans up to two years. We are in touch with our borrowers and whoever qualifies, the moratorium will be offered,” said the officials.But not boards of all banks have decided on the parameters.Abhishek Mishra, director of a realty firm in the city said, “Private banks are yet to decide on any kind of moratorium. In the meanwhile, we are required to pay EMIs. If we don’t pay, our accounts will be classified as NPA.”Trade bodies like Federation of Rajasthan Trade and Industry (FORTI) has already appealed to the Centre to announce a relief package for the MSMEs which have been severely hit by the pandemic.According to industry sources, the Centre is working on a plan to offer relief to the hospitality sector. In the Atmanirbhar relief packages last year, the sector was given a raw deal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/tourism-industry-seeks-loan-moratorium/articleshow/82986987.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Veggies sold at half rate in deserted markets but price hike looms large||Kolkata: Most markets and stores across the city were open on Wednesday morning, but very few vendors and customers turned up because of the cyclone warnings coupled with a windy and rainy morning. The vegetable and fish sellers who set up stalls preferred to sell off their items as fast as they could — some times even at half the price. However, there is news of mass destruction of crops in many districts because of flooding, which will affect productivity and likely spike prices. “Ladies’ fingers sold at Rs 20 a kg and prawns I normally buy at Rs 400 were being sold at Rs 300,” said Snehendu Koner, who visited Lake Market. Across markets, most seasonal vegetables sold at Rs 20-Rs 25 a kilo instead of Rs 35-Rs 40. B Rajesh found most vegetable and fruit stalls shut, but got lucky at Dakshin Stores in Lake Market while Tapan Das managed to buy fruits at Sovabazar Market at much cheaper rates than normal. Some supply issues, however, are looming with roads connecting vegetable producing zones to haats and wholesale markets being inundated. The loss of standing crops is also a major hit to farmers. “Vegetable prices are likely to rise,” said Kamal Dey, president, West Bengal Vegetable Growers and Vendors’ association. The affected areas are big producers of ladies’ finger, bitter gourd, green chilli, betel leaves, cucumber, snake gourd, ivy gourd, pointed gourd and spine gourd. Preliminary reports said damage of 70% of standing crops in over 14 blocks of three districts is bound to have an adverse impact on vegetable prices. “Most farmers will sell what they grow at the local markets. A section of middlemen will try to buy the produce cheap and sell them at urban markets at a premium,” said Sanatan Dasgupta, a farm economist. Invasion of saline water in farms can also hit production. “Everything will depend on how fast embankments are repaired and water is drained,” said an agriculture department officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/veggies-sold-at-half-rate-in-deserted-markets-but-price-hike-looms-large/articleshow/82984785.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

She said they will burn the effigies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, and deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala. Participant Sheela said Bollywood movie ‘Pink’ had inspired the protest’s theme, since this part of the agitation was dedicated to woman power.

---||Kochi||Kerala: Proposal to turn hyacinth into fertilizer||KOCHI: To fight the invasive water hyacinths that have contaminated the waterways of Kochi, Shannan Kamalaneson, a member of the Liveable Urbanism Design School at Welsh School of Architecture, Cardiff University, UK, has come up with an innovative idea of creating a community hub and a biofuel and biofertilizer plant at Vaduthala. The proposal is to harvest and covert water hyacinths into biodiesel and biofertilizer. Kamalaneson’s MArch proposal investigated, “how clearing Kochi’s waterways of the water hyacinths through economic incentives, could improve the health, economy, social capital, and environment of the city”. “By studying Kochi’s waterways and the liveability rates of the city it was clear that the poor waterways were negatively affecting and reducing the cities liveability,” she said in her proposal. Kamalaneson said that the collection of hyacinth could be incentivized. “The water hyacinths were proposed to be collected by the public who would be financially rewarded for depositing the weed at set zones across the city, where they will then be converted into a profit-generating asset: biofuel, biofertilizer, crafts or isolated chemicals. The key hub which the project focused on was the biofuel and biofertilizer hub which would span 30 years on the site in Kochi to allow for successful water hyacinth eradication and improved community resilience. The proposal would therefore provide a water hyacinth conversion plant as well as a community garden, visitors centre, restaurant, educational space, research lab and a local market amongst other community-strengthening facilities in order to create a new resilient economy and future for the city,” she said in her proposal. Kamalaneson suggested the biofuel and biofertilizer plants could be designed as modular, flexible, floating structures that would allow for ease of transportation through the waterways of Kochi in order to harvest the weed. “The structures are built upon concrete barges with floating reed beds tied to the structures which will assist with improving the quality of the water whilst providing habitats for the aquatic life below,” she proposed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/proposal-to-turn-hyacinth-into-fertilizer/articleshow/82984817.cms||Shenoy Karun

When the country was struggling with lack of oxygen, he was claiming that there is enough oxygen in the country,” he said.“Today, when there is shortage of vaccines in the country, he says there are one crore vaccines in the country. But if we take all the states together, one crore vaccines will be finished in just a day,” said Gehlot in a series of tweets.He said that on April 2, 42 lakh vaccines were administered across the country, but now only 16 lakh vaccines are being administered daily. Such statements by the Union health minister are creating ‘resentment’ among the public, he claimed.Vardhan had said on May 19 that more than one crore doses are still in stock with state governments.Gehlot also demanded that the Centre issue guidelines on how bodies should be buried along the banks of Ganga and Yamuna rivers and also on immersion of ashes to prevent further spread of coronavirus.There is possibility of the pandemic spread from these bodies during the rainy season if it was not properly disposed of, he said.“There have been reports of bodies of suspected Covid-19 victims floating in the Ganga. Taking cognizance of the way bodies are being buried along the banks of holy rivers including Ganga, Yamuna and others, the central government should issue SOPs,” he demanded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/gehlot-slams-vardhan-over-availability-of-vaccines/articleshow/82986982.cms||---
---||Jaipur||From lung fibrosis to mucormycosis, hospitals witnessing post covid complications in Jaipur||JAIPUR: Recovering from Covid is the main concern of patients, but post-Covid complications are becoming even more frightening. Mucormycosis wards and separate OPD and IPD for post-Covid complications at Jaipur’s SMS Hospital are indications about how serious the problems can be. Even other government and private hospitals are running separate OPDs for recovered Covid patients and are advising such people to keep monitoring their health and take medicines, if required, under supervision of doctors. A 48-year-old businessman from Jaipur, who recovered from Covid five days ago, has developed lung fibrosis. He is currently undergoing treatment at SMS Hospital. A 45-year-old person from Alwar is undergoing treatment for mucormycosis, which is another post-Covid complication. Doctors advice patients to take care of their heart and brain as they may face issues like stroke and cardiac issues post recovery. In May, 4.2 lakh Covid patients defeated the virus and recovered. Doctors are worried about their health and have advised them to take proper precautions. “Lung fibrosis, breathlessness, persistant cough, tiredness, lethargy, post-Covid headache, impact on memory, lack of concentration and frequent palpitations are some of the complications which patients complain when they come to post-Covid OPD,” said Dr Sudhir Bhandari, principal and controller, SMS Medical College. He said, “Other post-Covid complications include stroke, cardiac arrest and psychological issues such as depression, anxiety and stress.” Mucormycosis, another post-Covid complication, has attracted the attention of the government. Five more hospitals were allowed to provide treatment to mucormycosis patients by the health department taking the number of such hospitals to 30. Health minister Raghu Sharma said, “800 patients have already been diagnosed with mucormycosis in the state.” Four days ago, government-run Jaipuria Hospital also inaugurated its post-Covid recovery and counseling ward. “We have made arrangements for psychological counselling at our ward,” said Dr SS Ranawat, superintendent, Jaipuria Hospital. During treatment, Covid patients have to stay in isolation due to which they develop various psychological issues and require counselling, said an official of the hospital. Doctors said even if a person has recovered from Covid, his sugar levels get elevated due to steroids used in treatment. The patient must take precautions post-recovery to bring the sugar levels down. Some recovered patients catch mucormycosis after recovery for which they must take antifungals. Doctors advise people to take proper precautions even after recovery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/from-lung-fibrosis-to-mucormycosis-hospitals-witnessing-post-covid-complications/articleshow/82986997.cms||Syed Intishab Ali
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: If third wave happens, JK Lon hospital will have a major role to play||JAIPUR: Fearing that the third wave could affect large numbers of children, a drive has been launched across Rajasthan to analyse and assess the health infrastructure, including ICU beds, oxygen beds and treatment facilities. State’s biggest child-specialty JK Lon Hospital in Jaipur has started preparations for installing four oxygen plants, a new 20-bed ICU, upgrade of Covid ward and if it is felt necessary, the whole facility will be turned into a dedicated Covid hospital for children, leaving a small portion for non-Covid cases. A video conference, headed by health minister Raghu Sharma, was held on Wednesday in which chief medical health officers and doctors across the state participated and were told to remain prepared for the third wave. Sharma said in hospitals attached to medical colleges, availability of ICU beds with ventilators will be ensured. In Zanana hospital and mahila chikitasalaya, facility of 50 beds in each will be developed. Number of beds in all NICU in maternal and child health wings will be increased. From more oxygen production to procuring medicines for children, the health department has started its preparation for the third wave. Health secretary Siddharth Mahajan said, “Keeping in mind the third wave, we have started preparation and working on four different aspects which are increasing oxygen production in state, for ensuring availability of good stock of medicines for children we have issued tenders for medicines for children and we are also imparting training to our MBBS doctors.” Since oxygen is required for Covid treatment, oxygen plants have been sanctioned for JK Lon Hospital. “Within a month, the four oxygen plants will become functional. A 20-bed ICU has been sanctioned. We are upgrading the Covid ward. If we require, we will dedicate a block with 200-250 beds in the hospital, which will be isolated. If more beds for Covid patients are required, we will dedicate the whole hospital for Covid patients leaving a portion for other patients,” said Dr Arvind Shukla, superintendent, JK Lon Hospital. In the first and second wave, the percentage of children (under-10), out of total Covid cases, never exceeded more than 3%. Since it is feared that the third wave might hit in September or October and affect children, the state government has started preparations to ensure proper treatment for children. Hospitals that treat the paediatric population have been asked to remain prepared, ensure supply of oxygen through a centralised oxygen system to beds and strengthen intensive care units such as NICU and PICU. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot, too, had raised the issue in a review meeting asking the health department to ensure proper facilities for treatment of children. Across the state, health department officials in their respective districts have started collecting details about the availability of paediatric doctors along with the number of child specialty hospitals, government and private as well. “We have already organised a meeting with private hospitals having facilities for treatment of paediatric population and the facilities including ICU beds and beds with oxygen support,” said Dr Ajay Chaudhary, chief medical health officer, Sikar. The health department is also taking help of Rajasthan Bal Swasthya Karyakaram to get details about the children who have congenital diseases and co-morbidities. Besides, for children up to 6years, the health department is taking details from anganwadi centres. Also, the health department teams visiting door-to-door for Covid survey are also keeping an eye on the health of children to ensure that they do not have any influenza-like illness. “Since it is feared that third wave would affect children, we have started our work to ensure proper healthcare facilities. We are collecting details about the facilities and infrastructure available for the paediatric population.

The incident happened during a council meeting scheduled on Wednesday. Mayor Arya Rajendran had convened an all-party meeting in which it was agreed that stipulated members of each party may attend the council meeting and remaining councillors shall attend the meeting via online. On Wednesday, four BJP councillors sat in the council hall whereas the remaining councillors gathered in the gallery holding placards. This led to verbal exchanges between CPM councillors and BJP councillors. The mayor requested the BJP councillors to retire to office rooms and attend the meeting via the web link. When the councillors refused to leave the gallery, mayor Rajendran declared that some of the items on the agenda were passed and that other items will be considered in the next council. BJP councillors later staged a protest in front of the corporation office. Museum police confirmed that case has been registered against the councillors who violated Covid-19 protocol and staged protests. BJP councillor P Ashok Kumar said that they had submitted a letter to the mayor seeking permission for the participation of all the councillors in the council meeting. “She didn't respond to our request. They wanted to hold it online because we were about to flag irregularities in some of the items on the agenda. They hence avoided an open council session. Besides we had planned to raise concerns regarding the conduct of community kitchen as well,” said Kumar. When asked whether they had agreed for a stipulated number for the council meeting, Kumar said that if assembly session and swearing-in ceremony could be held here, there was no reason why council session should be limited to online medium. Mayor Rajendran said that it was BJP which had put forward the idea of online meeting when triple lockdown was in effect. “When we thought of council meeting, they only suggested that it be held online. Following the death of our councillor, we decided to limit the participation to 20 members —five from CPM, four from BJP, three from UDF and heads of standing committees. Today when I was about to enter the council hall, BJP demanded that one more member shall be allowed. I couldn’t have allowed that in the last minute. There was a general opposition to running the council with BJP councillors sitting in the gallery and I declared the items passed with a few exceptions,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/corp-council-witnesses-protest-case-against-bjp-councillors/articleshow/82984864.cms||---

---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore: Thanks to volunteers, stray dogs aren’t starving this lockdown||COIMBATORE: V Chithran and his friend S Pavithran would be busy cooking food by 8am daily. When it is ready, they embark on a ride on their bike to feed stray dogs, which surround them at some places at their very sight, wagging their tails. At some places, they whistle to alert the dogs about their arrival. Patting a few that responds to them, the two place the cooked food and a few biscuits on a neatly laid newspaper on the road corner, before moving to another location. This has been their routine ever since the state went into complete lockdown 15 days ago. Chithran said, “Most of the stray dogs survive on the leftover from the eateries, most of which are not functioning now. Hence, we have decided to feed them. We have obtained feeder pass from the animal husbandry department and been feeding dogs in and around Singanallur, Ramanathapuram and Ondipudur areas.” Explaining that they used to feed biscuits to stray dogs before the lockdown, he said they were cooking about eight to 10kg rice with chicken liver, milk and eggs to feed about 30 stray dogs a day. “As we wanted to cover multiple locations, we visit an area only once in a few days.” Just like Chithran and Pavithran, 14 volunteers/organizations have obtained feeder pass from the animal husbandry department to feed stray dogs, and animals and birds in pet shops in the district. A senior animal husbandry department official said, “We have issued passes to the volunteers and non-governmental organizations after assessment and they will be allowed to move on the roads.” Another volunteer, Rahul Manoharan, 28, who has been feeding stray dogs since last year, said he had been feeding more number of dogs nowadays. “Before the lockdown, I used to feed about 200 dogs. Now, the number has increased to 350 to 400. This time, lots of people are placing food and water for dogs in front of their houses.” Rahul, who is unwell now, hasn’t stopped feeding the dogs. “I am distributing dog feed to my acquaintances in the localities that I used to visit with a request to feed the dogs. I will start feeding them myself from Wednesday.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/thanks-to-volunteers-stray-dogs-arent-starving-this-lockdown/articleshow/82987058.cms||Nivedha Selvam

---||Coimbatore||Helplines offer support to find beds in hospitals||COIMBATORE: Non-governmental organizations, volunteer groups and even political parties have set up helplines for the people running from pillar to post in search of ambulances, hospital beds, oxygen cylinders and concentrators. A helpline set up by Communist Party of India (Marxist) in the district committee office at Gandhipuram is providing information about vacant beds in government and private hospitals, vehicle support to transport Covid patients to hospitals and conducting counselling sessions. “The number of people requiring oxygen support has increased and people are struggling to find beds in hospitals. As we were receiving several calls seeking assistance, we decided to set up a dedicated helpline and deployed volunteers to manage it,” helpline coordinator K S Kanagaraj said. The helpline is receiving 40 to 50 calls every day, most of them about vaccine-related queries and information regarding bed availability. Jamaat-e-Islami Hind (JIH), along with Students Islamic Organization of India (SIO), turned Masjid ul Huda at Karumbukdai into a helpline centre. The centre is receiving 1,000 calls every day, said JIH youth wing president Abdul Hakkim. “Many of the callers are shocked and anxious after testing positive for Covid-19. They don’t know what to do, whom to approach or where to go for treatment. To reduce their anxiety, we have been giving telephone counselling with the help of doctors,” Hakkim told TOI. A Covid helpline set up by the Coimbatore chapter of Art of Living Foundation 10 days ago is informing the public about availability of beds and oxygen cylinders and concentrators, and providing counselling sessions. More than 200 volunteers are working for the initiative. The helpline is receiving 100 calls a day, said Sasireka Venkatesh, a coordinator. “Most of the people seek information about availability of beds and counselling sessions. Our volunteers call hospitals at regular intervals to know about availability of beds. We are also planning to set up an oxygen concentrator bank. We will give the concentrators to hospitals that can use them for deserving patients,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/helplines-offer-support-to-find-beds-in-hospitals/articleshow/82987094.cms||Nivedha Selvam

Khadoor Sahib MP Jasbir Singh, who was present at the protest site, said he was supporting the call by Kisan Morcha. “The government is harming the interests of farmers. There is no minister in the Union cabinet who understands agriculture. The farmers’ agitation is one of the biggest protests but the Centre has remained unmoved. The BJP paid a price for this issue in West Bengal and it will be wiped out in the forthcoming assembly elections in Punjab and UP,” he said. The MP also welcomed Sidhu’s decision to put up a black flag at his house to express support for the farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-mps-protest-against-farm-laws-enters-171st-day/articleshow/82987095.cms||---

Private junior colleges managements have demanded that the state rolls back the hiked fee in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. “The managements are facing severe financial crisis amid the pandemic. On humanitarian grounds, we request the board to roll back the fee,” said G Satish, president, Telangana Private Junior Colleges Management Association (TPJMA). The members of the association further said that 95% of them have not applied for the affiliation yet. They said that apart from paying the hiked fees, getting mandatory documents such as structural soundness certificate, sanitation certificate, among others during lockdown is difficult. “Health department officials are occupied with the pandemic. Even if we apply, they are not in a position to issue a certificate. Keeping this in mind, for this year, the state should grant affiliation to all colleges, who had been granted affiliation last year, without insisting on documents,” added Satish.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pvt-jr-colleges-call-for-fee-waiver/articleshow/82987093.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Aurangabad||More ventilators found unused||Aurangabad: After ventilators made available via the PM Cares fund were allegedly found defunct at the state-run hospitals in Aurangabad and Hingoli, similar life-saving devices have now also been found lying unutilized in Beed and Parbhani districts. As many as 25 such ventilators have been facing technical issues at the SRT Medical College and Hospital at Ambajogai in Beed district, while the District Civil Hospital at Parbhani has 14 such ventilators. Authorities at the SRT Medical College and Hospital have given it in writing to NCP MLC Satish Chavan that all the 25 ventilators received under PM Cares cannot be put into service of patients as they cannot provide oxygen at the desired pressure. Hospital dean Dr Shivaji Shukre, in his official response, has added that the necessary follow-up with the manufacturing firm was on. Chavan, who visited the District Civil Hospital at Parbhani, said only one ventilator — out of the 15 supplied to the state-run hospital under PM Cares fund — was found in use. “The one ventilator pressed into service was used on BiPAP mode, whereas 14 others are yet to be installed,” he said. When contacted, Parbhani civil surgeon Balasaheb Nagargoje said the ventilators have no issues. When asked why these devices were not pressed into the service, he said ventilators are put into service “as and when needed”. Chavan, who visited the Parbhani hospital on May 22, however, did not agree with him. “During my official visit, the hospital authorities clearly said that 14 ventilators were not pressed into service because of issues related to regulation of oxygen pressure. It is wrong to hide facts given the pandemic situation and public interest,” he said. Chavan said an audit of all the ventilators supplied to Marathwada under PM Cares fund should be carried out. “While these ventilators are found lying idle at major hospitals in the region, the health authorities complain that the repeated follow-ups with the manufacturing firm for trouble-shooting has failed to evoke a positive response. The PM Cares Fund is a corpus generated from public money and every rupee spent from it needs to be accounted for,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/more-ventilators-found-unused/articleshow/82979718.cms||---

How can buyers be responsible for the sellers’ activities? We have been requesting the central government to undo the norms, but they have not paid heed to our request,” said Cotma president C Sivakumar. “We have also been requesting the government to waive interest and heavy penalty slapped on those who had failed to pay the tax on time. Instead of freezing their accounts, the government should waive the penalty and interest, and take steps to collect the whole tax amount,” he said. “We have also been requesting the government to reduce GST tax from 12% to 5% for those doing job works. As GST of raw materials is higher than the GST on processed items, it has been causing a lot of trouble for industrialists.” “The lockdowns have pushed back the growth of industries by a few decades and it is difficult to recover without the state government’s assistance,” Sivakumar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/industrial-body-seeks-finance-mins-help-to-reduce-gst-slab/articleshow/82987091.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Airport operations restart early as storm spares city||Kolkata: Kolkata airport authorities withdrew the suspension of operations an hour before schedule on Wednesday, after strong cyclonic winds and heavy rainfall gave Kolkata a miss. At 5pm, Kolkata airport issued a notice to airmen (NOTAM), announcing the airport’s reopening at 6.45pm. The airport had closed down at 8.30am to ride out the turbulence and was supposed to reopen at 7.45pm.  “The airport received a fair degree of rain during the night. In the morning, there were gusts of wind but nothing strong enough to cause damage. We carried out an inspection around 4pm and decided to reopen. Though it was not possible to operate commercial flights before 7.45pm, the airport was made available for emergencies and cargo operations,” said airport director Pulla Hezekiah. This is the third instance in which the airport was shut down due to a cyclone warning but didn’t suffer any damage. In November 2019, the airport was shut down to bypass cyclone Bulbul. In May 2019, it was closed for cyclone Phani, but again escaped major damage. Only during Amphan last year did the airport get inundated and an old hangar collapsed. While the airport remained empty all day, the air traffic navigation wing worked as usual, offering services to 500-plus flights.  Air traffic controllers (ATCOs) reported early for duty. But with overflying flights avoiding the cyclone path, ATCOs did not have to handle any major deviations. “It was as though a dry-run was held for a similar emergency in future. Everything was handled professionally. However, the SOP prepared will not be handy in future,” an ATC official said. Seven labourers from South Dinajpur were among 30-odd passengers who got stuck. The group was booked on an Air India flight to Ahmedabad on Tuesday which got cancelled. Their flight on Wednesday too was cancelled because of the closure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/airport-operations-restart-early-as-storm-spares-city/articleshow/82984894.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

According to district collector Suraj Mandhare, the centralized system of making the vials available has instilled confidence among the hospitals that supply is certain and regular. “As a result speculative hoarding was not required. Due to this injections are now available in good quantity,” Mandhare said. It should be noted that shortage of remdesivir injections was felt as the number of Covid positive patients peaked in Nashik district during the month of April. The kin of the covid positive patients admitted in civil hospital were struggling to get their hands on this drug. This is when the administration moved in and took control of the distribution of remdesivir. A cell was also formed to get the demand for remdesivir registered online, with proper case papers, verify the demand patient wise and distribute the vials to the particular hospital. Arvind Anturlikar, deputy collector and incident commander for distribution of remdesivir, Tocilizumab and even Amphotericin B injections, said, “The demand in the beginning was more than 5,000 vials per day and the availability of the medicine was just around 700. It was tough to verify and allot the medicine. The collector had also formed squads to check if the drugs were given to particular patients only.” He added, “The demand in May was round 3,500 and supply was 1,600. On May 14, 1,900 vials were distributed against demand for 2,500. However, on Tuesday, the demand was just 376.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/over-10000-remdesivir-vials-available-with-nashik-admin/articleshow/82979772.cms||Abhilash Botekar

But in the end, all that was required was switching off power in areas where the spring tide led to inundation.  “Power had to be switched off at Kalighat, parts of Chetla, Nadial in Metiabruz, Budge Budge, Nungi, Akra, Bauria and Sankrail in Howrah as the water level was rising to a dangerous level. We have switched on supply to most areas, except those in Howrah and Nungi, after water receded around 5.30pm. Our men will switch off supply around 1am when the tide peaks,” CESC managing director (distribution) Debasish Banerjee said. In areas under WBSEDCL, network damage is feared in coastal areas of East Midnapore, South 24 Parganas and North 24 Parganas.

Interestingly, the posting has been made by creating an ex-cadre post of DGP in the commission. It is for the first time that an officer of the rank of DGP has been appointed to the commission. The government created an ex-cadre post of DGP (investigations) and declared it equivalent to that of director, vigilance, for appointing Thachankary. He is the seniormost ranking officer in the list of officers presently in the state who is being considered for the post of state police chief. Thachankary was holding the post of chairman and managing director (CMD) of Kerala Financial Corporation (KFC). The government appointed secretary (finance expenditure) Sanjay M Kaul in full additional charge of the CMD of KFC. He would hold all the portfolios that he is currently holding, except that of secretary (home and vigilance). The government also appointed CMD of Kerala Transport Development Finance Corporation (KTDFC) B Ashok as the secretary (power). He would continue to hold the post of CMD, KTDFC as well.

Over the last few days, there has been a spurt in fresh Covid cases in rural areas. In a bid to enable vaccination of villagers during the lockdown, the administration distributed vaccines to 88 PHCs across district for those above 45 years of age. This would facilitate the villagers to get vaccinated in close proximity to their residences. On the other hand, the government is taking efforts to monitor and control Covid spread in villages. Collector S Nagarajan said that instructions have been given to form a Covid isolation centre in all panchayats. The isolation centres, turned Covid care centres, would go a long way in mitigating the troubles of Covid positive patients in villages. Right now, they have to travel to the nearest urban centre. In worst case scenarios, villagers choose to stay at houses rather than taken the trouble of travelling to hospitals, which in turn spreads the virus to more people. The mini-Covid care centres would be opened in the next few days. “Villagers have also been told to monitor people who enter from other places and neighbouring districts,” said Nagarajan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/focus-on-vaccination-covid-care-in-villages/articleshow/82987130.cms||---

Police have arrested the accused Hasmukh Varmora in this case.According to police, the victim was identified as Haresh Varmora, a resident of Ranmalpar village. Haresh had loaned money to the accused Hasmukh. Haresh’s constant reminders regarding returning the money irked Hasmukh, who decided to eliminate his cousin. “On Tuesday evening, Hasmukh called Haresh to the farm. When Haresh reached the farm, the accused assaulted him with an axe and brutally killed him on the spot. Later, Hasmukh, in order to hide his crime, cooked up a story.

---||Hyderabad||Despite severe Covid blow, Hyderabad homes attract buyers||HYDERABAD: Despite the severe Covid-19 blow, Hyderabad’s residential market saw an over 60% yearly jump in sales during the first three months of 2021 — the highest across all major metros. The city closed as many as 4,400 new home deals during this period as opposed to 2,680 during January and March 2020, show market reports. If that’s not all, launches of new housing projects too picked up pace — almost touching the 7,000-mark — in Hyderabad this year bringing with it a marginal upward revision in property prices. This, even as costs in Bengaluru and Chennai remained unchanged. Industry experts attribute this slow yet significant growth to a host of reasons: Relatively affordable property prices (despite the rise), robust social and physical infrastructure, among others. “Also the city has witnessed some momentum in office leasing activity, the pandemic notwithstanding. That’s given an edge to its residential market too,” said Anuj Puri, chairman, Anarock Property Consultants. City developers admit to have made a 50% to 60% recovery, since the pre-Covid-19 period. “Though the market is still far from being in the pink of health, the traffic of enquires (both online and offline) has improved substantially from what it was during the first half of 2020. Genuine home-buyers who are financially stable aren’t holding back their plans any more,” said Tapas Patel, CEO of Om Sree Builders and Developers, with multiple projects in Secunderabad. The firm is in the process of launching a new venture shortly. Given the mood of the market, experts feel it’s the right time to invest in Hyderabad. “With home loan rates at all-time-low in over a decade, and expected to continue to remain so through 2021, and developers offering various incentives to push sales, it is a good time to buy a house in Hyderabad provided one has financial stability, said Veera Babu, managing director of the major real estate services firm, Cushman & Wakefield (Hyderabad). He added: “Though after a good Q1in 2021, the sentiments have been dampened because of the second wave, it’s impact is likely to be temporary. The market will certainly bounce back in line with reduction in active caseload and faster vaccinations that’ll improve consumer demand in the second half of 2021 – early 2022 and sales will come back to average levels again.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/despite-severe-covid-blow-hyd-homes-attract-buyers/articleshow/82987162.cms||Sudipta Sengupta

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Now, rate card to rein in ambulance operators||HYDERABAD: To check exploitation by private ambulance operators, authorities have come up with a tariff card for transporting Covid and non-Covid cases. Of late, private ambulance operators have been charging huge amounts and families, left with no option, had to cough up the exhorbitant charges. Police have warned private ambulances against collecting unreasonable amounts for providing services, but their threats have been ignored. The Regional Transport Authority (RTA), Rangareddy, have now come up with fixed rate ambulances can charge. The Regional Transport Office, Ibrahimpatnam, on Monday released the tariff card. The charges have been fixed based on type of vehicle, distance with all waiting charges being provided for so that no additional amounts are collected by private ambulances. For example, for a Maruti Omni for a distance up to 10 km, the private ambulance operator could charge Rs 1,400 for providing transport for a non-Covid case and Rs 2,200 for a Covid case. For a Tempo or Toofan, the rate has been fixed at Rs 1700 and Rs 2,700 respectively. The amount increases according to a 10 km slab thereafter. Similarly, for a distance between 71-80 km, the charges for a Maruti Omni have been fixed at Rs 3,700 and Rs 4,800 respectively and for Tempo/Toofan Rs 4,050 and Rs 5,150 respectively. The Nirmal district administration also held a meeting with private ambulances operators on Monday on the issue of fixing rates so that the public were not put to inconvenience. Collector Musharaff Ali Faruqui asked drivers and owners of vehicles to adhere to the stipulated rates when transporting Covid and non-Covid cases or bodies. The rates begin with Rs 1,200 for Maruti Omni to transport non-Covid cases up to 10 km and Rs 2,000 for Covid cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/now-rate-card-to-rein-in-ambulance-operators/articleshow/82987170.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

This proves that cosmetic measures will not yield results and underlines the need of the state government’s intervention in this regard. There requires a detailed study by a competent agency to prepare drainage master plan for the city. Though some of the studies conducted more than 15 years ago for containing waterlogging in the city are there, such studies can’t address the new challenges. Large-scale encroachments on the waterbodies is one of the major reasons for waterlogging in Kochi and eviction of encroachments is the only lasting solution. “Even after one-and-a-half year since launching Operation Breakthrough, the authorities are unable to evict encroachments on the canals and drains in the city. The minimum width of Thevara-Perandoor canal is 45m as per old records. But the maximum width of the 11-km-long canal, which is the arterial canal in the city, is now less than 15m. The average width of the canal is less than 10m,” said K T Cheshire, RTI activist. Similarly, many agencies like railways, National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), Cochin Port Trust (CPT), Kochi Metro Rail Ltd (KMRL), revenue department and Kochi corporation are to work together for avoiding waterlogging in the city. “It will be very difficult for the officials with Operation Breakthrough, under district collector, to coordinate all these agencies and secure various approvals from these agencies. For containing waterlogging in many places, including Ernakulam South, small pipe culverts, which facilitate the flow of water from the big canals on one side of the railway line to the other side, should be replaced with big box culverts. It would require the approval from the railway zonal authorities in Chennai,” said corporation works standing committee former chairman P M Harris. “Similarly, small pipe culverts carrying water from canals on one side of the national highway bypass to the other side are causing waterlogging in many areas like Edapally, Palarivattom and Vyttila. The issue can be sort out with the help of top NHAI officials only. So, there should be intervention from the state government,” Harris said. “The state government can write to the Union government or the top officials of railways and NHAI for securing various permissions in this regard,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/op-breakthrough-fails-to-end-waterlogging-in-city/articleshow/82985016.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

If the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) had been followed immediately, the 75 lives of personnel on board that were lost could have been saved, they said on a day the Yellow Gate police summoned officials of four companies, including the barge company and its charterer agency, with documents for their probe into the mishap. The barge capsized and sank 70 km off the Mumbai coast on May 17. The responsibility of a deck officer posted from an ONGC-appointed third party agency includes ensuring compliance with ONGC's marine operating manual by the contractor. The officer mailed the alert on May 14, and this information has been shared with the nautical advisor appointed by the DG Shipping to probe the matter. TOI received a release from Afcons on May 20 which said, “Preventive and precautionary measures taken after receiving the alert on May 14 itself. All our vessels were advised to secure their work locations and move to a safe location at the earliest. Accordingly, all vessels and barges, including P305, commenced moving out of their work locations on May 14 and 15. While the other barges moved to Mumbai Port/ Mumbai Outer Anchorage/Anchorage close to Revandanda, the Master of P305 chose to move 200 m away from the HT platform where Barge P305 was working, and to remain at that location, deciding this as a safe location since the max predicted wind speed was only 40 knots and his location was 120 NM away from the eye of the tropical storm. Unfortunately, the weather conditions deteriorated rapidly from the evening of May 16.” Yellow Gate police have booked the barge captain Rakesh Ballav and others under IPC sections after chief engineer Mustafizur Rehman Shaikh lodged an FIR. The Afcons release said that as per marine protocol as well as the specific charter agreement for P305, matters concerning vessel safety lie with the owner/barge master. A police officer said, “We have issued summons to four companies (under CrPC sections) and asked their office-bearers to come with documents and give statements.” The officer refused to divulge the names of the companies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/barge-tragedy-probe-police-summon-officials-of-four-cos-in-mumbai/articleshow/82990722.cms||Mateen Hafeez

The price of fertilizers had gone up drastically following which there were demands from the farmers to decrease the rates. The central government paid heed to the demands and increased the subsidy on Di-ammonium phospate (DAP). The decision brought down the price of DAP from Rs 1,9000 to Rs 1,200. The prices of combination fertiliers also came down, but prior to this the manufacturers had already sold the fertilizers with the increased price printed on the bags. This error is now being used by some traders to earn extra bucks. However, the agricultural department received several complaints from farmers regarding fertilizers being sold at higher rates. Acting on one of the complaints, a shop was sealed in Karad by the agriculture department officials. Also, on Wednesday, licence of 12 shops were cancelled for selling fertilizers at increased rates. Gurudutt Kale, district agricultural superintendent in Satara, said, “Many traders are selling at hiked prices. Since the subsidy has been increased the prices of fertilizers have come down and it should benefit the farmers irrespective of whether the stock is old or new.” Many farmers are complaining that they are being forced to buy the fertilizers at high cost citing scarcity. However, officials have clarified enough stock is made available with the dealers and shops managed by the companies. Dnyandeo Wakure, Kolhapur district agricultural superintendent, said, “We have formed teams to conduct surprise visits at shops and godowns. The companies provide us the details of the fertilizers supplied to the shops. We are verifying the complaints and if found true strict action will be taken against shop operators.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/13-shops-sealed-for-selling-fertilizers-at-inflated-price/articleshow/82979945.cms||---

The secretary, along with the other Apex council members, handed over the letters at the Gymkhana ground on Wednesday morning. Vijayanand said that the women’s and men’s senior selection committees will be the finalised by the Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC). “The names given under the women’s selection committee are only in consideration and haven’t been finalised,” Vijayanand said. “We are just going ahead with the decisions of the general body. If someone is not happy with it, there is nothing that can be done,” he added. Azhar, however, steered clear of the appointments. “Persons whose names have been called out in the press release may please realise that their appointments are not valid under the procedures established by the rules and regulations of the HCA. I, therefore, do not recognise these appointments,” Azharuddin said. “I shall not be held liable as president of the HCA and member of the Apex council for any commitment, promise, compensation, honorarium or any other pecuniary benefit that is conveyed to you through the invalid letter as an entitlement to you by virtue of your appointment,” he added. He also conceded that the game was suffering. “Cricket may inadvertently become the victim but this culture of nepotism — using positions in the association to gratify power groups to strengthen vote bank — has been prevalent over the years. I will not cease to fight this during my tenure,” the former India skipper said. In a related development, Vijayanand and company have also decided to release the cricket development fund, including arrears pending, the resolution for which was passed in the meeting on April 28.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/not-valid-azhar-decries-hca-appointments/articleshow/82987164.cms||Solomon S Kumar

---||Hyderabad||Owners drop rates to draw tenants||Hyderabad: The second wave of Covid-19 hasn’t spared Hyderabad’s rental market. A quick scan of online portals indicate a significant rise in vacant homes — primarily across the city’s IT corridor — with most owners willing to negotiate on the listed rent. In fact, given the huge demand-supply gap, industry sources say that many lessors are willing to drop their monthly charges by up to Rs 10,000 to Rs 12,000 (depending on area and size of home) to attract tenants. “A sizeable population of the migrant workforce, especially those living alone in the city in shared accommodations, have returned to their home states with companies allowing them to work remotely. That has led to this steep rise in vacant homes,” said Sumanth Reddy, immediate past president of the National Association of Realtors adding that this trend is unlikely to change soon. “Unless offices start making it mandatory for people to be physically present at work —which I don’t think will happen for a while now — this workforce will not return,” he said. Property consultants admit to a crunch of tenants in the city. “Houses that once attracted rents of over Rs 40,000 a month in a gated community is now up for grabs for Rs 30,000 or even less,” said a consultant operating in the Nanakramguda-Gachbowli belt.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/owners-drop-rates-to-draw-tenants/articleshow/82987177.cms||Sudipta Sengupta

Ramol police have registered a case against Mukesh Parmar, the accused, who is at present in Churu, Rajasthan. The details of the case emerged on Wednesday. Ramol police inspector K S Dave said that Parmar had tricked the woman into letting him take her photographs and now was blackmailing her. “We will arrest him once the lockdown is lifted and the restrictions are eased,” he said. The complainant told Ramol police that she had met Parmar on social media and the two had fallen in love. The woman was unmarried and was in constant touch with Parmar. He told the woman that he was unemployed and would marry her once he gets a job. Parmar made the woman meet him regularly and eventually forced her into a physical relationship. He took photographs of the intimate moments. The family of the woman got her engaged to another man earlier this year and it was then that Parmar began asking for money. He has so far taken Rs 35,000 from the woman and later demanded Rs15 lakh. According to the complaint, Parmar even got the number of the woman’s fiancé and sent her photographs to him. The fiancé informed the cousin brother of the woman. The cousin relayed the information to the woman. Parmar even made a fake social media profile and sent friendship requests to the woman’s sister and sister-in-law. He demanded money from them too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/man-threatens-to-post-intimate-pics-online-demands-rs-15-lakh/articleshow/82987181.cms||---

The IMD has included Simdega, East Singhbhum, West Singhbhum and Seraikela Kharsawan have been included in the red alert zone. Additional director general (operations) R K Mallick said, “Police, along with the NDRF, have a crucial role to play in rescue operations.” DGP Neeraj Sinha has instructed the senior field officers to station themselves in the sensitive areas and keep a close watch over the situation. Sinha is also keeping close watch from the control room in the headquarters. Sinha said, “All the SPs have been instructed to ensure there are enough number of NDRF teams in the sensitive areas and we have made arrangements for ambulances and vehicles equipped with oxygen at the national highways.” Fearing that mobile connectivity could be disrupted, Sinha has asked the police officials to keep their wireless sets ready and has directed the officials concerned to ensure that satellite phones are provided to police stations located in the Maoist-hit zones.

---||Ranchi||Centre accuses Jharkhand of 37% vax wastage, CM counters||RANCHI: A day after the Union government said Jharkhand wasted 37.3% Covid-19 vaccines it received till date, the state government refuted the charge with chief minister Hemant Soren and health minister Banna Gupta claiming wastage of only 4.65%. However, later the health department clarified that although it could not compile data from all the 24 districts due to the impact of cyclone Yaas, the wastage stands around 2.5%. Meanwhile, a political slugfest ensued between leaders of the ruling Mahagathbandhan constituents and BJP. Releasing a data hastily compiled by the health department, chief minister Hemant Soren’s tweet said 48,63,660 doses were supplied to the districts of which, 40, 12,142 have been administered and 6,56,532 are still in stock. “As per the total number of vaccine doses available with the Jharkhand government till today (Wednesday), currently only 4.65% vaccine doses have been wasted. Vaccination data could not be fully updated to the central Co-Win server/ platform due to technical difficulties/glitches and the update is in process,” Soren’s tweet read. However, in its scheduled even press briefing, Siddarth Tripathy, the officer on special duty of the health department’s IEC wing, said, “The data shared by the CM and health minister, provided by the health department in haste, is incorrect. The department estimates that vaccine wastage is somewhere around 2.5%. A review meeting is being held to tally the exact figures and it will be released soon.” Additional chief secretary (health) Arun Kumar Singh said, “In the drive for beneficiaries aged above 45 years, the wastage stands at 0.4% and 7% for the age group between 18 and 44 years. This is because of the Centre’s regulations, which does not allow on spot registration. For instance, if 100 people booked have booked slots at a session site and only 93 turn up, doses for seven other beneficiaries are wasted,” Singh said. As per the state’s data, nearly 6.88 lakh people, including frontline workers, health workers and beneficiaries above 45 years, took both their doses while 4.31 lakh people aged between 18-44 years have taken their first dose till Tuesday. Singh said a high percentage of wastage is reflecting on the Centre’s database due to human errors on the part of the districts while failing to upload data on time. “We have urged the Centre to allow a mechanism whereby the statistics can be rectified,” he said. Cashing in on the confusion, political leaders took to mudslinging on Twitter with Soren responding to the claims and writing, “As per Centre’s data, out of the 48,63,660 doses received, 40,12,269 doses have been administered. If wastage was 37.3%, then approximately 18 lakh doses would have been wasted. Then how did we vaccinate so many people? It is a conspiracy on part of the Centre to malign Jharkhand.” His statement was endorsed by Congress leader and former Union minister Jairam Ramesh. Retweeting the set of data released by Soren, Ramesh wrote, “This statement nails the Lie Virus being spread by the BJP ecosystem.” State health minister also Banna Gupta accused the Centre of distorting the numbers to mislead people. Meanwhile, BJP’s legislative party leader and former CM Babulal Marandi blamed it on the state government’s mismanagement. “When vaccines are priceless at this hour, such a huge amount of vaccines are being wasted. More people will die if the mismanagement is not fixed,” he said. BJP’s state president and Rajya Sabha MP Deepak Prakash said, “On one hand, Jharkhand is wasting the maximum amount of vaccines in India and on the other hand, its government is shedding crocodile tears and blaming the Centre for not giving vaccines. The people are watching.” Though Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) conceded that vaccine wastage must be reduced to less than 1%, its general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya said, “Our state is much more organised than Uttar Pradesh, where Yogi Adityanath is providing jabs of different companies to one person. We want to purchase vaccines through open tenders but the Centre is not allowing us to do so.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/centre-accuses-state-of-37-vax-wastage-cm-counters/articleshow/82985766.cms||Dhritiman Ray

It was again the young doctors in Khandol public health centre (PHC) at Anand’s Anklav taluka that rose to the ocassion when the hospital did not have pulse oximeters and managed to arrange for 10 units. Bi-PAP masks too were arranged by young medical professionals for Covid-19 wards at GMERS Medical College and Hospital, Gotri in Vadodara with the help of a foundation. In a heartwarming gesture, junior doctors and medical students, who are already serving Covid-19 patients are now going beyond the call of duty to help the needy through a project ‘Local Heroes’. The project managed under an umbrella ‘Unite4India’, led by World Youth Heart Foundation (WYHF) and Sadanah Foundation, has partnered with the Medical Students Association of India (MSAI) to provide Covid-19 relief across the country. Through the project real time ground requirements in Covid-19 hospitals are looked and donors are guided to arrange for suitable supplies. “We are working on the ‘Local Heroes’ project with a hyperlocal model. For instance, if there is a need of medical supplies at SSG Hospital or Gotri hospital, we inform the donors who in turn help us get the required supplies as per the need,” said Dr Priyansh Shah, president and founder of WYHF. Locally, Heeru Foundation, Mani Manek Foundation and Javantriben Hazarilal Charitable Trust have donated thousands of units of injections, BI-PAP masks and pulse oximeter through this project. “We have a network of 10,000 medical students and junior doctors across India. Being part of the frontline workforce, the doctors know and can easily enquire and understand the needs of tertiary care centres, Covid care centres and rural PHCs. Through the project, medical supplies to a large number of healthcare centres across the cities have been provided impacting nearly 5,000 lives so far,” said Dr Shah. “Our volunteer team verifies local supplies and creates a list for the same. At the local level, we help in guiding charities, NGOs and CSR funds to the on-ground requirements. The national funds are used for areas that are in crisis and then later distributed towards the other cities that require support,” said Shah, adding that the work is being carried out in 55 cities across India. Even in Delhi, to support ASHA workers at Mehrauli PHC, we supported donations of 200 N95 masks, 200 pairs of gloves and 38 bottles of 500 ml sanitisers,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/junior-doctors-go-beyond-call-of-covid-duty-to-ensure-essentials/articleshow/82984112.cms||Prashant Rupera
---||Ranchi||Parents stage virtual dharna to oppose fee hike by pvt schools||BOKARO: Several parents in Bokaro on Wednesday organized an agitation on social media to oppose the hike in fees proposed by some private schools. Organised by the Jharkhand Parents Association on Zoom, the protesters were seen putting up placards while some put up statuses on their respective social media profiles, denouncing the schools for increasing the tuition fees. The president of Jharkhand Parents’ Association, Ajay Rai, said that despite the orders from the state government, the private schools are charging an excessive amount of fees by increasing it or under various heads. Besides reducing the tuition fees, the parents are also demanding that all private schools implement the Jharkhand Education Amendment Act, 2017, stop re-admission from Class XI students onwards, upload the CBSE guidelines on their website and not deprive the students of online classes for non-payment of fees. The president of Jharkhand Parents Association’s Bokaro unit, Mahender Rai, said, “The schools should not charge any additional money from the students of Class XI. Many schools are charging re-admission fees from Class XI students amid the pandemic where most of the parents are facing financial problems due to job loss.” He added that the as per the Supreme Court, a 20% reduction in fees has to be implemented immediately by the schools. “Recently, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) asked the Jharkhand government to take appropriate action against 10 private schools in Bokaro for increasing the fees by around 20% in this Covid-19 pandemic,” he said. According to an advisory issued by the NCPCR on April 4 last year, private schools cannot increase their fees amid the pandemic. Increasing school fees is against the advisory issued by NCPCR to private schools regarding fee related issues during Covid-19 lockdown on April, 04, 2020. The parent’s body has announced that their agitation will continue in phases. “In the second phase, the parents will observe May 28 as a black day and demonstrate live in Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. We will continue our agitation until our demands are met,” Ajay said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/parents-stage-virtual-dharna-to-oppose-fee-hike-by-pvt-schools/articleshow/82987553.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Citizens face hardship as JSR shops shut for Yaas||JAMSHEDPUR: The East Singhbhum district administration’s decision to shut shops on Wednesday in view of cyclone Yass left the people of Jamshedpur in the lurch with many not being able to buy essentials like milk and bread. A few shopkeepers said they had stocked up milk and curd but will have to throw them as they have very few hours’ of shelf life. Ratan Singh, a banker, with aged parents and kids who needs milk and bread everyday went around the Steel City on his motorcycle in search of milk but was disappointed as all shops were shut. “In a bid to save people from the cyclone, the administration has made life difficult for many like him. People should be shifted to shelter houses and the administration should take care of their essential needs,” he said. Radha Apte, a housewife and resident of Sonari, early morning reached the Kagalnagar market for buying milk packets and bread. Her husband had just recovered from Covid, so she chose to venture out in the rain. Her three-year-old child too needs milk. “I wish to ask the administration where will I get the milk for my child and ailing husband?” she said. A shopkeeper on condition of anonymity said he tried to open his shop but was instructed by patrolling police personnel to close his establishment or face arrest. He had ordered 150 litre milk and curd and other dairy products for sale and now everything would have to be thrown away. Some shopkeepers tried to help their customers by going door-to-door delivering milk packets but the number of such incidents was few. Later in the day, deputy commissioner Suraj Kumar said shops selling milk will be open from Thursday till 2pm, while all other shops will remain shut.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/citizens-face-hardship-as-jsr-shops-shut-for-yaas/articleshow/82985274.cms||Debasish Chatterjee

In an order issued on Tuesday evening, state health secretary Arun Kumar Singh constituted two teams, comprising doctors, to audit the deaths which were reported at Ranchi's Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences, the SAIL run Bokaro General Hospital, Jamshedpur's Tata Main Hospital, Hazaribag's Sheikh Bhikhari Medical College and the Shahid Nirmal Mahto Medical College in Dhanbad. The audit will be completed by May 31. “The death audit will involve speaking with the kin of the deceased and the hospital administration to ascertain the complications along with Covid-19, which resulted in the fatalities,” deputy director Dr. SN Jha said. As per health department's data, as many as 3,738 people have died of Covid in the state between April 1 and May 25. Of them, 24 died in home isolation. “The need for the audit was felt as the mortality rate during the second wave is higher (1.46%) than the first wave (0.9%),” the order read. The auditors will speak with the relatives of the deceased patient to enquire about possible delays in hospitalization, unavailability of beds and oxygen which may have resulted in the deaths. “The hospital administration, on the other hand, will be quizzed to enquire the possibilities such as the unavailability of drugs, of equipment and manpower and mistreatment which resulted in the deaths,” a doctor, who is a part of the auditing team, said on anonymity. Jha said the interview will be conducted in a set parameter and its findings will be used to bolster management in case of a third wave in the hospitals. As per the department, there were over 12,000 non oxygen-supported Covid beds and 10,440 oxygen equipped beds in the state as on Tuesday. The state had 3,143 Covid ICU beds and 923 ventilators. Meanwhile, with cases declining, the department on Tuesday also directed the hospitals to reduce dedicated Covid 19 beds to 50% of their respective total capacities from 70%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/state-to-conduct-audit-of-all-cov-deaths-in-2nd-wave/articleshow/82985263.cms||---
---||India||End capitation fee in med colleges: National Medical Commission||NEW DELHI: Almost two years after the National Medical Commission (NMC) Act was passed, the commission has released draft guidelines on fixing fees in private and deemed medical colleges across the country. Once these norms are passed, fees for 50% MBBS and postgraduate medical seats in these colleges will be regulated. The commission has listed over 25 guidelines, ranging from not charging exorbitant sums as security deposits to not including all hospital expenses while computing the cost for providing medical education. It has disallowed capitation fees in any form and said colleges must adhere to the ‘not-for-profit’ model. Parents say once implemented, the rules will bring relief to thousands of meritorious students who cannot pursue medical education in private and deemed colleges due to the steep fees. In Maharashtra, private colleges charge up to Rs 16 lakh per annum and deemed colleges charge up to Rs 25 lakh per annum as fees. “It is already two years, and we hope these draft regulations are implemented before the next academic session begins,” said a health ministry official. The guidelines state that only operating cost should be primarily considered to determine fees. “The fees can be fixed for a block of three years or on a year-to-year basis and should remain the same for the entire duration of study, subject to inflation adjustment,” the draft said. Fees in newly established colleges should be decided on an ad-hoc basis, based on the fee structure of a recently established college in state. “Since the expenditure in the Covid-19 pandemic year will not depict the true picture — as hostel and mess expenses dropped, and expenses in hospitals and doctors’ allowances and salaries went up — state fee regulatory body can consider the average financial result of last three years,” said the statement. The expert group has recommended linking the development fee of 6-15% of the operating cost to the performance of the college in a rating system, which is in the pipeline. The amount of security deposits should not be considered for calculating fees and interest on the deposits may be deducted from the operating costs, it said. The dean of a deemed medical college said the guidelines need to be studied. “Most deemed colleges will oppose the idea of the government regulating fees in 50% seats. Our autonomy will be affected. Since it is open to suggestions, we are going to write to the NMC,” said the dean.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/end-capitation-fee-in-med-colleges-national-medical-commission/articleshow/82992270.cms||Yogita Rao
---||Goa||Goa: Herd immunity only after minimum 60% of population gets vaccinated, say doctors||PANAJI: Goa is a long way from achieving herd immunity. As of Tuesday, only 6% of the state’s population has been vaccinated, and to reach herd immunity, at least 60% of the people have to be immunised. The 45-plus age group is still skeptical about the vaccine and many of them are yet to come forward to get the jab. The 10-day Tika Utsav covering villages and municipal areas, which started on Wednesday, is expected to cover a greater proportion of people in this age category in the following days. “People should come in big numbers to get vaccinated so that herd immunity is reached. It will set in when at least 60% of the population is fully immunised (administered both doses) but we are far from it,” said Dr Jagadish Kakodkar, head of the department of preventive and social medicine, Goa Medical College (GMC). Data released by the directorate of health services revealed that as of Wednesday, 95,886 people in the state were fully vaccinated and 3,00,923 people had received the first dose. Kakodkar said that greater the proportion of the population vaccinated, less severe will be the cases and fewer deaths. “A doctor will tell you that no vaccine is free of side-effects. Yet so much misinformation has been spread about the Covid vaccine.” “Even with the Covid vaccine, there is a risk, but it is negligible. So isn’t it wiser to take the vaccine?” he said, urging people to get vaccinated without further delay. State epidemiologist Dr Utkarsh Betodkar said that people have no option but to get vaccinated at the earliest so that herd immunity is achieved. “If we don’t do that, we are giving the virus a chance to mutate. Once we get about 70% of our population vaccinated, mutation of the virus will reduce,” said Betodkar. He said that the next 15 days will be the best time to get vaccinated as after that the monsoon will set in. During rains, people may defer stepping out and standing in queues. “I would say, people should not waste an opportunity to get vaccinated in the next 15 days,” Betodkar said. The government has maintained that it wants to get the maximum population inoculated at the earliest, however, an official, who did not want to be named, said that by looking at the pace of vaccination, it is difficult to say when Goa will be able to attain the target.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/herd-immunity-only-after-minimum-60-of-population-gets-vaccinated-say-docs/articleshow/82987287.cms||Bindiya Chari

While the case positivity rate continued to be high at 32%, the recovery rate further rose to 88%. With 39 fatalities, the morality count touched 2,500. Over the last one week, daily hospital admissions have fallen below 200, but hospitals continue to have patients coming in late, in critical condition, and dying within a few hours. Some are brought dead. On Wednesday, a 75-year-old woman from Quepem, who had multiple comorbidities, including chronic kidney disease, and an 85-year-old woman from Cacora were declared brought dead. Eight patients died within 24 hours of admission with the youngest among them a 30-year-old man from Mapusa. Most of them were in home isolation until shifted to the hospital. The 30-year-old man had no comorbidities. Among the dead, nine were under the age of 45 and a few had comorbidities. On Wednesday, the directorate of health services kick-started the 10-day Tika Utsav at various panchayats and municipal areas for the 45-plus age group, which has so far not shown much enthusiasm to get vaccinated. The day saw 6,402 people getting their first shot and 34 fully vaccinated. On Wednesday, the Tika Utsav was held at 34 villages. The government is expecting the drive to help raise the numbers as during the last few days the daily average of vaccination has reduced to 3,000-3,500 doses a day. While the 18-44 age group is most enthusiastic about getting immunised, the health services has been compelled to conduct vaccination for this group in a staggered manner for want of vaccine doses. Health minister Vishwajit Rane appreciated the efforts of the Candolim primary health centre in vaccinating a 93-year-old beneficiary in a car. “Such out-of-the-box solutions will help us vaccinate elderly beneficiaries successfully,” Rane said in his social media post. A health officer said people still believe in misinformation about the vaccine and shy away from getting the shot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/39-deaths-on-wed-case-positivity-still-high-at-32/articleshow/82987304.cms||---

Ports minister and Calangute MLA Michael Lobo recently told reporters that although he, along with the panchayat members, had visited the hospital to check the infrastructure available and the viability of turning it into a hospital for Covid-19 patients from Calangute, the plan had to be abandoned. “The hospital is located next to the market and the lane leading to it also has many wholesale vegetable shops, all of which would have to be shut down as per the guidelines in case it was turned into a Covid-19 hospital,” Lobo said. “Closing down the shops there and the market would have created a lot of problems for members of the general public. Also, the Covid-19 situation is improving, so there is no immediate need for a Covid-19 hospital in Calangute,” he said. Those in home isolation whose condition deteriorates have to be either taken to the North Goa district hospital at Mapusa or the GMC. Meanwhile, an NGO, Keshav Sena Sadhana, has started a free isolation centre at the Calangute Residency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/calangute-hosp-not-to-be-step-up-facility/articleshow/82987345.cms||---

GFP spokesperson Prashant Naik on Wednesday accused the state government of ignoring directives of the Union government to set up vaccination centres for seafarers. Taking a dig at chief minister Pramod Sawant, Naik said that the role of seafarers should have been better understood by Sawant since mineral ore from Goa’s mines is transported through ships. “Seamen won’t be able to join their duties on ships unless they are inoculated,” he said. On May 7, the Union ministry for shipping, ports and waterways directed all 11 major ports, including MPT, to set up vaccination centres for seafarers. Goan Seamen Association of India has also requested the state to urgently release doses to MPT and to prioritise at least those seafarers who are above 45 years and who have already taken first dose. GFP also expressed reservations over the extension of the time interval between two vaccine doses. “The extension of the gap to 84 days means the seafarers will remain unemployed for nearly three months,” he said. Naik said if no immediate action is taken by the government to set up a vaccination facility for seafarers, GFP would move court over the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gfp-demands-vaccination-on-priority-for-seafarers/articleshow/82987370.cms||---

---||Goa||Goa: Vegetable supply may stop again this weekend from Belagavi||PANAJI: Vegetable supply from Belagavi, which was briefly suspended for three days due to rising Covid-19 cases in Karnataka, resumed on Wednesday, much to the relief of vendors in the state. This however is a temporary resumption of services as suppliers from the neighbouring state anticipate another weekend lockdown in Belagavi. “Owing to rising Covid cases, we have to keep the APMC in Belagavi closed. As of now, we have been instructed not to supply to Goa on Saturdays and Sundays. The supply will be normal only through the week,” said Vineet Bichu, a vegetable supplier from Belagavi. Another supplier, Ramesh Pawale said that the supplies will continue to this Friday, before they go on a break from Saturday to Monday.“We will resume operations form Tuesday,” another supplier, Ramesh Pawale, said, adding that there is also shortage of vegetable due to scattered procurement owing to the new restrictions. The prevailing weather conditions of rain showers and humidity have resulted in damage to crops, thus leading to a price rise. While vendors in Goa are slightly relived with supplies having normalised after a three-day hiatus, they are however troubled by the quality of the greens coming in. Even resorting to plan-B of sourcing greens from Sankeshwar has not helped. “Leafy greens and coriander are coming in from Sankeshwar but due to the impact of rain, these are not fresh. Even some the vegetables coming from Belagavi currently are not of great quality,” said Bashir S, a vegetable vendor from Taleigao.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vegetable-supply-may-stop-again-this-weekend/articleshow/82988446.cms||Nida Sayed
---||Nagpur||Half the world’s cities have no plan to meet climate threats||Nagpur: Nearly half of global cities lack plans to keep their population safe from climate threats. In India, 16 cities disclosed their plans to tackle the environmental crisis, more than half of which have sustainability targets incorporated into the master plan of the city. Only 43% of the Indian cities have a published plan that addresses climate change adaptation. This was revealed by the latest analysis done by international organization CDP. According to it, one-third of the 16 Indian cities have a greenhouse gas emission reduction target which is a “strong indication towards a low carbon development pathway.”Among major Indian cities, New Delhi in its plan has declared the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (GNCTD) has approved the creation of new lakes in Timpur, Rohini, Nilothi, Dwarka and Najafgarh. “The latest addition to this list is the new lake at the closed Rajghat power station ash-pond site. Proposed land is spread on 40 acres in the Yamuna flood plains and will be fed by 15 MGD (million gallons per day) of treated water. These lakes will also work as potential carbon sinks,” the analysis stated.The report highlights another effort -- restoration of the Palla flood plain to create an off-channel reservoir of 1,000 acres to conserve excess flood water. “269 water bodies and 12 lakes will be revitalized through DSTPs for groundwater recharge,” it added.Kochi, which faces extreme precipitation and rainstorm, is increasing its green cover through an initiative ‘Cities 4 Forests’. “It helps cities from around the world connect with and invest in inner forests such as city trees and urban parks, nearby and faraway forests,” the report stated.Nagpur, for which heatwaves and water scarcity continue to be major climate hazards, has reportedly prepared a heat action and disaster management plan in which all ten zones of the city have appointed Zonal Incharge related to health. “Citizens of Nagpur can report to these officials for any risk or hazard they face any time. Capacity Building of Urban Local Body officials has been conducted for the risks and hazards,” the report stated. The city is also providing tax exemption of 5% on the household rainwater harvesting plant. “The Nagpur Municipal Corporation is planning to improve the construction of barrage on Kolar River situated 1km from upward from Kanhan reservoir. It is also proposed that construct an intake well and pumping station so that water can be taken up from Kanhan river from July to December which will save around 60 Million Cubic Metres of water. The project will complete in 2021,” the report stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/half-the-worlds-cities-have-no-plan-to-meet-climate-threats/articleshow/82987445.cms||Manka Behl
---||Ghaziabad||Will protest till 2024 if needed: Rakesh Tikait||GHAZIABAD: After a prolonged lull, the sound of protest returned to UP Gate on Wednesday as farmers marked six months of the agitation against three agriculture laws brought by the Centre as ‘Black Day’ and Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait declared the stir would go on till 2024 – the year general elections are due – if needed. In a speech replete with pandemic analogies, Tikait told the modest crowd at the protest site the BKU was ready for the long haul and hit out at the Centre for not responding to the Samyukt Kisan Morcha’s (SKM) letter seeking resumption of talks. “By observing ‘Black Day’, we have administered the first dose of vaccine to the government. As for the second dose, we will chalk out plans very soon,” said Tikait, who went from a peripheral player to the focal point of the agitation when his tearful appeal renewed the protest after the January 26 violence in Delhi during the tractor parade SKM had planned. Giving his own interpretation of the medical oxygen crisis in Delhi-NCR during the second Covid wave, he added, “We saw how life-saving medicines and oxygen were locked up in big corporate hospitals. This is what will happen if we allow corporates to take over the farm sectors. Grains and farm produce will be locked up in their godowns due to the new farming laws.” The protesters wore black turbans and put up black flags on vehicles at the protest site. “We have written to the government for resumption of talks but received no response. If they think the delaying tactics will tire us out, they are wrong because we plan to carry on with the protest till 2024. We are not going anywhere. We have built semi-permanent structures at the protest site and before monsoon sets in, we will place tin shades on our tents. The protest will continue as long as required,” Tikait said. The numbers have thinned out at UP Gate because of the pandemic and commitments of the sugarcane season. But the small group of around 250 protesters that had stayed was joined by farmers who arrived from nearby districts on Wednesday. One of them, Satpar Singh of Modinagar, said, “I came to participate in the protest, which is again gaining momentum now.” Asked about the risk of infection spreading as a result of the gathering, Jagtara Singh, another protester, said, “If the government is concerned about us, they should take back the three farm laws and we will go home. Besides, as far as Covid safety protocol is concerned, where was it during the West Bengal assembly elections and UP panchayat elections?” Groups of farmers also gathered in various other places with black flags to mark their protest. But most were small gatherings as farmers said they did not want to compromise social distancing. In Noida, the BKU-Tikait protested outside its camp office in Dankaur and near Atta Chowk in Sector 27. Kisan Ekta Sangh members protested by wearing black bands and organised a hawan in Dankaur for better sense to prevail on the government.

---||Nagpur||In a 1st, AICTE offers BE in Marathi, Hindi & other languages||Nagpur: All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) has allowed colleges to offer engineering degree in as many as eight regional Indian languages, including Marathi, from the new academic year (2020-21) commencing June. The other languages in which it would be available are Hindi, Bengali, Telugu, Tamil, Gujarati, Kannada and Malayalam as of now. The move would help aspirants, particularly from rural and tribal areas, to realize their dreams. Till date, many bright students used to stay away from these courses due to fear of English. Many advanced countries like Germany, France, Russia, Japan and China impart entire education in their official languages. “The aim behind the apex body’s move is to impart technical education to the students in their mother tongue so that they can grasp the fundamentals in a much better way,” said AICTE chairman Anil Sahastrabuddhe. “We’ve received about 500 applications from the entire country. We’ve planned to offer UG engineering courses in 11 more languages in future. AICTE is offering course material in all these languages and also translating courses taught under Swayam and massive open online course (MOOC) portals,” he told TOI. AICTE’s approval process head Rajendra Kakde, who earlier worked with Nagpur University’s pharmacy department, told TOI that the option had been introduced in line with New Education Policy (NEP) wherein applications were invited from colleges. The option, however, would be available for undergraduate courses and is limited for traditional branches like mechanical, engineering, civil, electrical and others. The apex body has put very stringent conditions on those aiming to launch the courses. The colleges need to be accredited by the National Board of Accreditation (NBA) and should be among top ranked in their respective states. They can start with either the batch size of 30 or 60. The priority would be granted to autonomous institutions fulfilling all the criteria. They would have an option to either appoint another set of teachers who can teach in regional languages or train the existing ones, which would be much easier. “The examinations would be conducted in the languages opted by the students. However, colleges are directed to make arrangements for compulsory English language graded courses with a view to accustom and make them proficient by the time they graduate. Countries like China, Japan and Germany impart education in their own language and are considered among the world’s finest as far as innovations in technology are concerned,” Kakde said. AICTE had conducted a survey in Tamil Nadu on whether students prefer English or Tamil for engineering courses. About 42% voted in favour of their mother tongue. The apex body had already directed universities to amend their statutes and rules to accommodate the option of engineering courses in regional languages for paper setting and other works. AICTE software translates any English book into 22 languages According to Kakde, the move to introduce engineering in regional languages was made possible due to AICTE’s indigenously developed software that can translate entire engineering syllabus into 22 regional languages in a short span. “Developed by our chief coordinating officer, it can also convert courses taught through Swayam and MOOC portals. The software has a huge dictionary of over 10,000 words related to the engineering faculty.” Sahastrabuddhe added that the software would do maximum translation work and if there are any deficiencies, teachers of respective faculties in various states would remove them. “Of course, the technological terms and formulae wouldn’t be translated.” Kakade said the apex body was encouraging academics to write books or translate their existing ones in English to all regional languages with the help of our software. “We’re also providing them royalty for it and pushing for MOOC.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/in-a-1st-aicte-offers-be-in-marathi-hindi-other-languages/articleshow/82987468.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The last time the district recorded less than 10,000 active Covid patients was on March 4, at 9,631. The next day, cases had shot up to 10,070 and kept on increasing till the second wave peaked. Of the 685 new cases, the city reported 339, rural 341 and five belonged to outside states. There were over 200 more cases than a day earlier. Deaths declined to 16, including seven from rural, 4 from city and 5 outside district. This was the second consecutive day in the second wave when the city fatalities remained under five. The active caseload had hit the peak at 77,627 on April 29. In less than a month, 67,996 patients have beaten Covid. Among the 71,370 testing positive between April 29 and May 26, 1,538 passed away. Thus, 87.59% recovered while 1.98% died of Covid during the same period. The active cases had began to surge dramatically from a low level at 3,255 on February 1. Next month, the figure stood at 8,438, followed by 40,807 on April 1, and 75,608 on May 1. But the highest number of active cases were seen on April 29 at 77,627. After this, the decline started with higher recoveries than new cases every day. Another relief for the district was seen in continued decline in positivity rate, which now stands at 4%. City’s test positivity rate declined to 3% while for rural it is 6.25%. At some Covid testing labs, the ratio was less than 2%. The district now has 2,611 patients admitted, of which over 80% are said to be in home isolation. Covid beds in many hospitals are lying vacant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/active-cases-plunge-below-10k-mark-within-a-month-of-hitting-peak-of-77k/articleshow/82987547.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Ghaziabad||Farmers will protest till 2024 if needed: Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait||GHAZIABAD: After a prolonged lull, the sound of protest returned to UP Gate on Wednesday as farmers marked six months of the agitation against three agriculture laws brought by the Centre as ‘Black Day’ and Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait declared the stir would go on till 2024 – the year general elections are due – if needed. In a speech replete with pandemic analogies, Tikait told the modest crowd at the protest site the BKU was ready for the long haul and hit out at the Centre for not responding to the Samyukt Kisan Morcha’s (SKM) letter seeking resumption of talks. “By observing ‘Black Day’, we have administered the first dose of vaccine to the government. As for the second dose, we will chalk out plans very soon,” said Tikait, who went from a peripheral player to the focal point of the agitation when his tearful appeal renewed the protest after the January 26 violence in Delhi during the tractor parade SKM had planned. Giving his own interpretation of the medical oxygen crisis in Delhi-NCR during the second Covid wave, he added, “We saw how life-saving medicines and oxygen were locked up in big corporate hospitals. This is what will happen if we allow corporates to take over the farm sectors. Grains and farm produce will be locked up in their godowns due to the new farming laws.” The protesters wore black turbans and put up black flags on vehicles at the protest site. “We have written to the government for resumption of talks but received no response. If they think the delaying tactics will tire us out, they are wrong because we plan to carry on with the protest till 2024. We have built semi-permanent structures at the protest site and before monsoon sets in, we will place tin shades on our tents. The protest will continue as long as required,” Tikait said. The numbers have thinned out at UP Gate because of the pandemic and commitments of the sugarcane season. But the small group of around 250 protesters that had stayed was joined by farmers who arrived from nearby districts on Wednesday. One of them, Satpar Singh of Modinagar, said, “I came to participate in the protest, which is again gaining momentum now.” Asked about the risk of infection spreading as a result of the gathering, Jagtara Singh, another protester, said, “If the government is concerned about us, they should take back the three farm laws and we will go home.

---||Goa||Goa: Ahead of election year, politics reigns over pandemic, Cyclone Tauktae at Sanguem||MARGAO: The aftermath of cyclone Tauktae and the Covid-19 pandemic have served as convenient grounds for politicians to enhance their visibility among voters ahead of the 2022 assembly election. While in Fatorda constituency it’s a political slugfest between the two local power centres as reported by TOI earlier, in Sanguem constituency, BJP ex-MLA Subhash Phal Dessai and its Mahila Morcha vice-president Savitri Kavlekar, wife of deputy CM Chandrakant Kavlekar, are competing to cement ties with their voters from remote villages by offering relief measures, in an attempt to portray Sanguem MLA Prasad Gaonkar in poor light. Both Phal Desai and Kavlekar were defeated by Gaonkar in the 2017 assembly polls. While Phal Dessai claimed to have taken initiative for restoring power to Karla hamlet in Cavrem-Pirla panchayat, which was reeling under blackout for nine days, Kavlekar has been distributing essential commodities to people affected by Covid-19, particularly to those in home isolation, in the remote areas of Netravali, Vadem-Curdi and Rivona. “During my visit, villagers of Cajur, Verlem and Saljini placed their grievances about the deteriorated roads leading to the villages. After inspection, I found that they have been totally washed out and urgent repairs are required to make them motorable. I have assured them of restoring the road,” Phal Dessai told reporters. On Tuesday, Phal Dessai led a delegation of party workers and met chief minister Pramod Sawant, bringing to his attention to the bad condition of the Verlem-Saljini road in Netravali. Sawant, it is learnt, promptly directed the PWD to repair the road before the monsoon. “The villagers said the local MLA is incompetent and requested me to take up the matter myself with the chief minister,” Phal Dessai later told reporters. Kavlekar is also making renewed attempts at touching base with Sanguem voters. She spoke about her plans of setting up a Covid care centre in remote Waddem considering the rise of Covid cases there. Gaonkar, meanwhile, is unperturbed. “I, along with my team, have been on the ground since the cyclone struck, helping clear roads, restoring power and water supply. Due to the power cut, there was no water supply in Waddem, Valankinni Colony 1, 2 and 3, and other parts of my constituency. I engaged private tankers to provide water to the people in these areas,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ahead-of-election-year-politics-reigns-over-pandemic-tauktae-at-sanguem/articleshow/82987783.cms||Govind Kamat Maad

---||Goa||After years of neglect, CM orders repair of Saljini road||Poinguinim: The dilapidated roads passing through the thickly-forested and hilly areas of Verlem-Saljini, near Netravali in Sanguem taluka, are expected to be repaired after chief minister Pramod Sawant on Tuesday directed the executive engineer of PWD (roads) Ganesh Velip to draw up the estimates for the task. Directions was given following a memorandum submitted in this regard by former Sanguem MLA Subhash Phal Dessai along with local zilla panchayat member Suvarna Zambaulikar and Bhartiya Janata Yuva Morcha general secretary Divas Deikar. In the memorandum, Phal Dessai mentioned that the villagers of these areas encounter numerous hardships, particularly during emergencies.The roads that were constructed eight years ago have washed out, rendering them non-motorable and dangerous for the villagers, states the memorandum. Phal Dessai has urged the chief minister to hot-mix the roads before the monsoon. Locals said that the roads in Verlem-Saljini were damaged in 2017. Last year, deputy collector Ajay Gaude had promised to get the roads repaired. Irked villagers had even threatened to boycott the local civic elections in 2019 over the issue. The revenue authorities rushed to the village and assured the locals of getting the roads ready on a war-footing soon after the zilla panchayat elections. Subsequently, on account of the Covid-19 pandemic, the zilla polls were cancelled and were subsequently held in December 2020. While the villagers cast their votes in the elections, the government reneged on its assurance. Last year, Kadamba transport officials had threatened to withdraw the only bus plying in the village after drivers expressed difficulty in negotiating the treacherous road which poses a risk to their safety as well as of commuters. The area is represented by independent MLA Prasad Goankar, while Phal Dessai is a BJP ticket aspirant for the assembly polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-years-of-neglect-cm-orders-repair-of-saljini-road/articleshow/82987923.cms||Albert Fernandes

Par aath ka sauda ho gaya hai, apne ko char mil sakti hain." If you intercept this kind of mobile conversation between two people, you may assume that they are smugglers talking about "maal" and "peti" but it's a dialogue between a bootlegger and his prospective customer to strike a deal for illicit sale of liquor, which is commonplace in Bhopal during the lockdown. You have "maal" (liquor) available,but the only pinching factor for tipplers is the price. It's double the counter price or more for most of the brands. "I think it's the liquor shop owners themselves, who supply liquor bottles. They also get some stuff from distilleries. The bottles illegally supplied from a distillery don’t have batch no and other details. The state cabinet may have turned down the proposal for home delivery of liquor but it's actually being delivered at your doorstep at a premium. May be not your favourite brand but it's like you may get Royal Challenge and not Royal Stag or you get Hundred Pipers and not Black Dog", said a person, who is minting money selling illicit liquor during the lockdown in his luxury car. He, however, denies earning a lot in this business. " You are paying money to me, so you think I am earning a lot but it's divided among so many people including the policemen, who allow us to operate. Excise staff is also involved but they are taken care of by our bosses", he said. The illicit liquor market fluctuates according to changing circumstances. Speculations were rife last week that lockdown in Bhopal will not be extended beyond May 24 and markets will open up, within no time the bottle being sold for Rs 2200 per bottle was available for Rs 1800. But, as it became clear that it's not happening by the evening, it was again selling at Rs 2300 per bottle, Rs 100 per bottle extra, perhaps to make up for the loss during the day when prices had come down. " During lockdown you may not get grocery but you get everything which is supposed to be "nonessential" by the state government but "absolutely essential" by those, who enjoy consuming it. The bootleggers insist that you take two extra bottles on the pretext that for a few days he may not be able to deliver the stuff", said a businessman, who has so far purchased two crates of liquor (one crate carries 12 bottles of 750 ml) from a bootlegger, who had provided him with this "service" in the first lockdown during last year as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/amid-strict-lockdown-booze-flows-freely-in-bhopal/articleshow/82992397.cms||Ashutosh Shukla

Recalling the sequence of events, villagers accused health teams of apathy. “I got the first dose of Covishield on April 1, the second vaccine was administered on May 14. When I went for my second dose, no one bothered to check my vaccination history and gave me a Covaxin jab. Now, I am living in fear of developing ailments,” said a villager.

And if the viral load remains within limits, travel destinations across the state will soon beckon tourists with their come-hither appeal. At this juncture, it is interesting to see Madhya Pradesh Tourism Board collaborate with an international travel channel, for an upcoming travel series that focusses on some of the most amazing locales in the state. According to principal secretary tourism and culture, Sheo Shekhar Shukla, tourism and hospitality sectors are worst hit during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. He said, “This sector needs greater support, hence it is fabulous that right from our heritage sites to historic and adventure tourism spots will now reach the international travellers in the US, UK Europe and several countries across the globe, in 16 languages. Post-Covid traveller would need holiday spots that heal and MP has what it takes. Whether it is Mandu, Maheshwar, Bandhavgarh, Hanumantiya, Gwalior or Omkareshwar, we have some of the most idyllic tourist spots that are waiting to be discovered.” Stressing on the need to promote culture and tourism of the state, Shukla said, “It will create several new employment opportunities and generate revenue, which will boost the economy of the state as well as the country. Our endeavour is to make MP a unique travel destination, which is quite high on national as well as international travellers’ priority list”. “As soon as the world travellers start planning their tour itinerary, we want them to come to the state and make an ideal travel choice,” Shukla added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/with-unlock-on-the-horizon-stunning-madhya-pradesh-locales-to-lure-the-global-traveller/articleshow/82992405.cms||---

We are prepared to work 24 hours.” The solution, he said, is underground cabling, adding that this would cost between Rs 2,500-3,000 crore for the entire state. When asked whether he would prioritise cities for underground cabling, he said the government would prioritise lines which are very old or along the coast prone where salinity is high or areas where lines are passing through dense forests. “We are capable of getting it done in 7-8 months if the CM permits me, with full force, in prioritised areas,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-tauktae-fewer-power-cuts-expected-with-first-rain/articleshow/82988211.cms||---

And so it was in the Union territory of Puducherry on Wednesday when ‘raahu kaalam’ (the inauspicious time span according to Hindu astrology) forced a 90-minute break in the swearing-in ceremony of newly-elected and nominated members of the legislative assembly. Most of the politicians cutting across party lines preferred not to swear in during the inauspicious rahu kalam between noon and 1.30pm. Pro-tem speaker of the legislative assembly K Lakshminarayanan began administering the oath of office to the new MLAs at 10am on the legislative assembly premises. All India NR Congress founder-leader N Rangasamy was the first to be sworn in as MLA followed by MLAs of his party, Congress, DMK and five independent members and three nominated members. A few minutes before the clock struck 12, the ceremony was stopped abruptly. It was later revealed that the remaining MLAs - four BJP MLAs and an independent MLA - will be sworn in after 1.30pm as soon as the rahu kaalam ended. After the inauspicious time span passed, the son-father duo and BJP members Richard Johnkumar and A Johnkumar, BJP legislature party leader A Namassivayam, P M L Kalyanasundaram (BJP) and independent MLA P Angalane took the oath. Most of the MLAs took the oath in the name of god. Believers and non-believers were surprised to note that almost half the number of 15th assembly were first time MLAs. Fourteen out of the 30 elected members were elected to the assembly for the first time. AINRC has four first time MLAs while BJP and DMK have three first time MLAs each. Similarly, the assembly has the most independent candidates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/puducherry/raahu-kaalam-forces-90-min-break-in-swearing-of-pondy-mlas/articleshow/82992440.cms||Bosco Dominique

The tribunal constituted a four-member committee by drawing officials from the Union environment ministry, Cauvery Water Management Authority, Cauvery Neeravari Nigam Limited and forest department of Karnataka government to inspect the area in question and submit a factual report as well as an action taken report, if there was any violation.Duraimurugan said the state government had filed a petition in the Supreme Court in November 2018, seeking stay of the permission granted by the Central Water Commission to Karnataka government to go ahead with the preparation of detailed project report and stopping latter from proceeding further with the preparation of DPR.“The TN government’s contempt petitions against the project appraisal directorate of Central Water Commission and the secretary of Karnataka water resources department in December 2018 are pending in the Supreme court,” Duraimurugan said.In its meeting in July 2019, the expert appraisal committee for river valley and hydroelectric projects of the Union environment ministry did not grant terms of reference to Karnataka government’s project, following objections from Tamil Nadu government.The agenda was also not taken up for discussion during the three meetings of the Cauvery Water Management Authority after the Tamil Nadu government raised objection, Duraimurugan said.Meanwhile, Karnataka government on Wednesday opposed formation of the joint select committee by the National Green Tribunal’s (NGT) southern bench to inspect the controversial Mekedatu project site.Karnataka law and parliamentary affairs minister Basavaraj Bommai told reporters that the government would launch a legal fight against the NGT’s decision to suo motu set up the committee to inspect Mekedatu “without consulting anyone and not based on any official complaint”.The minister said Karnataka chief minister would hold a meeting with water resources and law department officers and the advocate general on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tn-will-never-allow-mekedatu-dam-work/articleshow/82992450.cms||---
---||Erode||Cutting across faith, TMMK volunteers give dignified burial||CHENNAI/ERODE: Cutting across caste, religion and politics, volunteers of Tamil Nadu Muslim Munnetra Kazhagam (TMMK) upheld humanity by giving a dignified burial to those who died of Covid-19. They performed the last rites as per the wishes and customs of the families of the dead. From the first burial following ICMR protocol for Covid-19in Saidapet in Vellore last year to the burial of 45 year-old Anitha, of Upparapalli village in Vellore district on Tuesday, the 4,000-odd volunteers of the TMMK have always come forward to carry out the final rites of the Covid-19 victims. From April 1 to May 25, they were cremated and buried 2,064 across the state as per Covid-19 protocol. During the first wave last year, they buried and cremated 1,350 people in the state. “Fear of contracting the virus holds back crematorium workers. So, we volunteer to give a dignified burial to the dead,” said P S Nizhamuddin, coordinator of the TMMK’s volunteers in Gudiyattam. For those families belonging to the economically weaker section, the TMMK takes care of expenses, including transportation of the body from the hospital to the burial ground, and other funeral expenses. Since families cannot bid a proper farewell, the volunteers try to follow the customs that gives the final journey a personal touch. “Since many families request us to perform certain rituals as per their beliefs, we try and follow it,” said TMMK state secretary J Eajaz Ahmed, who has now become familiar with the customs of Hindus and Christians. The fear of the virus is such that relatives too sometimes shy away from giving a proper burial. On May 25, in Erode, when a Hindu family refused to carry out the final rites formalities for a covid-19 suspected person, four of his Muslim neighbours donned PPE kits and performed the rites on behalf of the family members. P Selvaraj, 42, of Erukalur village near Nambiyur in Gobichettipalayam taluk died after suffering from cold and fever for a week. He had been at home and had been taking pills from a local medical shop. “His condition deteriorated and he struggled to breath,” said N Mohammed Isak, a neighbour who helped bury Selvaraj. After his death, Selvaraj’s wife and his 16-year-old son refused to bury Selvarj fearing Covid-19 infection. As the news spread, Mohammed Isak, K Nasrullah Khan, A Abdul Shakeem and S Mohammed came forward to carry out the final rites on behalf of the family. “We performed the final rites as directed by Selvaraj’s relatives as we believe everyone deserves to go with dignity,” said Mohammed Isak.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/erode/cutting-across-faith-tmmk-volunteers-give-dignified-burial/articleshow/82993951.cms||Shanmughasundaram J
---||Chennai||Cutting across faith, TMMK volunteers give dignified burial||CHENNAI/ERODE: Cutting across caste, religion and politics, volunteers of Tamil Nadu Muslim Munnetra Kazhagam (TMMK) upheld humanity by giving a dignified burial to those who died of Covid-19. They performed the last rites as per the wishes and customs of the families of the dead. From the first burial following ICMR protocol for Covid-19in Saidapet in Vellore last year to the burial of 45 year-old Anitha, of Upparapalli village in Vellore district on Tuesday, the 4,000-odd volunteers of the TMMK have always come forward to carry out the final rites of the Covid-19 victims. From April 1 to May 25, they were cremated and buried 2,064 across the state as per Covid-19 protocol. During the first wave last year, they buried and cremated 1,350 people in the state. “Fear of contracting the virus holds back crematorium workers. So, we volunteer to give a dignified burial to the dead,” said P S Nizhamuddin, coordinator of the TMMK’s volunteers in Gudiyattam. For those families belonging to the economically weaker section, the TMMK takes care of expenses, including transportation of the body from the hospital to the burial ground, and other funeral expenses. Since families cannot bid a proper farewell, the volunteers try to follow the customs that gives the final journey a personal touch. “Since many families request us to perform certain rituals as per their beliefs, we try and follow it,” said TMMK state secretary J Eajaz Ahmed, who has now become familiar with the customs of Hindus and Christians. The fear of the virus is such that relatives too sometimes shy away from giving a proper burial. On May 25, in Erode, when a Hindu family refused to carry out the final rites formalities for a covid-19 suspected person, four of his Muslim neighbours donned PPE kits and performed the rites on behalf of the family members.

---||India||Hospitals start routine immunisation for tiny tots at home||With Covid-19 disrupting child immunisation, children’s hospitals are now planning ahead. Before the third wave of the pandemic hits, they are going door-to-door with standard vaccines against rotavirus, polio, diphtheria, tetanus, measles and seasonal flu. In an internal audit, Motherhood Hospital found that there had been a 70% drop in vaccinations for those younger than 18 months across its centres since the pandemic began. “Because of the lockdown and rising cases in Bengaluru, I didn’t want to visit a clinic or hospital,” said Jayashree Kanan, mother to a six-year-old. Three weeks ago, the hospital started its home vaccination drive in Bengaluru. It then covered Pune, Chennai, Coimbatore, Mumbai, Indore and Noida. “We have vaccinated about 500 children at home,” said Dr Prathap Chandra, neonatologist and paediatrician at Motherhood Hospital, Bengaluru. Kanan’s daughter was one of them. Another hospital, Cloudnine, has vaccinated more than 16,000 across Chennai, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Pune, Gurgaon, Noida, Chandigarh and Panchkula. While parents have been sceptical about visiting hospitals, their concern about missing out on standard vaccination for their children has also been high. So when Cloudnine introduced home vaccination services, demand went through the roof. “Since the pandemic started, we have administered 50% more flu shots compared to what we did before Covid,” said Nitin Nag, regional director (south and west), Cloudnine. Every year, the Universal Immunization Programme covers 2.65 crore children and 2.9 crore pregnant women against 12 preventable diseases. An Indian study published in February this year found 83% of paediatricians reported a drop of 50% or more in vaccination. The government launched the Intensified Mission Indradhanush 3.0 the same month to close the gap. “About 15 years ago, measles resurfaced in the UK after a report linked its vaccine to autism and people stopped getting kids vaccinated,” said Dr Chandra. “Covid affects those with low immunity. It’s important for us to provide immunisation, build immunity and reduce burden on healthcare.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hospitals-start-routine-immunisation-for-tiny-tots-at-home/articleshow/82992459.cms||Shobita Dhar

Nerul’s Coco beach had several shacks nearly two decades back, but after the tsunami in 2007, a large area of the beach near the mouth of the Nerul river disappeared. The water resources department (WRD) erected a rubble barricade with nylon netting along a roughly 200m stretch. It was partly effective in preventing further sand erosion, but it has faced the brunt of tidal action over the years. “The water level rose during the cyclone and flooded the road. If there is heavy rain and stormy conditions, water may surge into residential area,” another local, Bonny Pereira, said. They are also worried about paddy fields in the vicinity getting submerged. Nerul acting sarpanch Sanjay Kalangutkar said they have been sending reminders to the department concerned. “But the authorities keep saying they do not have the required funds for the repair work.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/barricade-on-nerul-coast-lying-battered/articleshow/82988492.cms||---

In Lakhimpur Kheri, government teacher Ravi Prakash died of Covid-19 on April 16. Staring at uncertainty, Pal’s wife Kiran and Prakash’s wife Sarita got some relief when their accounts were credited with Rs 19 lakh and Rs 20 lakh, respectively. Even as unions in UP sweat it out to ensure government compensation for teachers who have died of Covid-19, an association launched by five teachers a year ago was financially helping griefstruck families. Within a year of its launch, the Teacher Self-Care Team (TSCT) now has 24,000 teachers as members. “I will never forget the help of TSCT,” Sarita said. In the last few months, the association has helped families of 11 teachers. Four of them had died of Covid. “Forty-five families are in queue and we are collecting money for them,” said a member of the union. Government teacher Pradeep Kumar Tripathi died of Covid after panchayat poll training in Pratapgarh. His son Shivam said, “TSCT has so far collected Rs 7 lakh for my family.” The association drew its members from the group of 72,825 teachers who were appointed during Mayawati regime. But their appointment was struck down when Akhilesh Yadav came to power in 2012. They were re-appointed by the Supreme Court in 2016. Co-founder of the association, Farrukh Hasan, a resident of Muzaffarnagar, said, “When we were fighting for appointment in SC, two teachers of our group died. To give some relief to their families we had collected a few lakh rupees after members contributed Rs100 each.” It later led to the formation of the association, he said. The other members are Vivek Nand Arya and Sudesh Pandey from Allahabad, Mahendra Verma from Maharajganj and Sanjeev Rajak from Balia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/up-teachers-chip-in-gift-lakhs-to-kin-of-departed-co-workers/articleshow/82992489.cms||Mohd Dilshad

Chhattisgarh said it had already written to the Centre with accurate data to prove that the state hasn’t wasted even 1% of the doses it has received. “The percentage of wastage of vaccine doses sent by the Centre to Chhattisgarh is 0.81% and that of self-procured stock is 0.63%, both below the national average,” Dr Alok Shukla, principal secretary of the health department, told TOI. Chhattisgarh health minister T S Singh Deo tweeted the Centre should “seek help from someone who knows math". Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren and state health minister Banna Gupta issued statements claiming vaccine wastage of 4.65%. “ It is a conspiracy on part of the Centre to malign Jharkhand,” he had tweeted. Siddarth Tripathy, officer on special duty in the health department’s IEC wing, later said a meeting had been convened to “tally the exact figures and release these soon”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rates-better-than-national-average-chhattisgarh-jharkhand/articleshow/82992497.cms||Cherrupreet Kaur
---||India||NYT talks to experts, gives 3 estimates of actual India toll||A report in the New York Times has suggested that India’s actual toll from Covid could be about double the official count in an optimistic case scenario and up to nearly 14 times the recorded numbers in a worstcase scenario. That would imply at least 6 lakh deaths and at worst 42 lakh deaths. The NYT, with which TOI has a syndication arrangement, put together these estimates by talking to “more than a dozen experts” including Dan Weinberger of the Yale School of Public Health. The estimates, the report says, are based on extrapolations from sero surveys for the true number of infected people and assumptions about the infection fatality rate (IFR), a measure of the number of people who die for every 100 infected. The report points out that while official figures miss deaths all over the world, “the undercount of cases and deaths in India is most likely even more pronounced, for technical, cultural and logistical reasons”. With hospitals overwhelmed, many Covid deaths occur at home, especially in rural areas, and are omitted from the official count, it quoted Kayoko Shioda, an epidemiologist at Emory University, as saying. It also said that even in the best of times, four out of five deaths in India are not medically investigated. The best-case scenario assumes that actual infections are about 15 times the number of cases detected, that is about 40.4 crore. It assumes an IFR of 0.15% which gives 6 lakh deaths. A second scenario, which the report describes as “a more likely scenario” takes the actual infections at 20 times what’s been detected by tests, or 53.9 crore. It assumes the IFR is 0.30%, “in line with what has been estimated in the US at the end of 2020”. That gives a figure of 16 lakh deaths or over five times the official count of 3 lakh. The most alarming scenario assumes there are 26 actual infections for every detected case — based on the last national sero prevalence study that ended in January — which puts the number of infected at just over 70 crore. It also assumes an IFR of 0.6% “to take into account the tremendous stress that India’s health system has been under during the current wave”. Those assumptions yield a toll of 42 lakh or 13.7 times what the official numbers suggest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/nyt-talks-to-experts-gives-3-estimates-of-actual-india-toll/articleshow/82992533.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||High court to Karnataka government: Will you bar private hospitals from giving 1st dose?||BENGALURU: The high court on Wednesday asked the state government to make its stand clear on whether it is willing to pass an order restraining private hospitals from administering the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine. Given the shortage of vaccines in Karnataka, the first dose is being administered only to healthcare and frontline workers on priority as a large number of people are awaiting their second dose. The state government has issued an advisory to private and public facilities to give preference to administration of the second dose. A special division bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Aravind Kumar asked the advocate-general to look into the matter after Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (Phana) informed the court that they are giving the vaccine to all those who are registering on their portal. The court was also informed by the central government that 16,66,000 doses have been given to private hospitals in Karnataka. The court wondered how private hospitals can be allowed to procure more vaccines than the state government, which has placed orders for 15,98,000 doses. The bench said both the state and central governments have to take a policy decision on “diverting” people to private hospitals for getting the first dose. Issue order on vax dose, govt toldPhana said the state government can regulate the situation by passing an order against administering of the first dose, instead of issuing an advisory, as has been done now. The high court has repeatedly stressed that it is an “obligation” of governments to ensure the second dose is provided and failure to do so will be a violation of fundamental rights. The court was told that there is a huge demand for vaccines in private hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/high-court-to-karnataka-government-will-you-bar-private-hospitals-from-giving-1st-dose/articleshow/82992528.cms||---

But beneath the external appeal ran a tale of poor accessibility to the village, inadequate building infrastructure, absymal Net connectivity and a huge reluctance to take the shots. A team of nine officials from Akkalkuwa took around four hours, travelling by boat and in mountainous terrain, to reach the tribal village of Chimalkhedi. Akkalkuwa is around 450km from Nashik city. Akkalkuwa is around 450km from Nashik city.Akkalkuwa tehsildar Ramji Rathod, who led the team, told TOI that despite their best efforts, only 11 people aged above 45 took the first shots at Chimalkhedi. While seven were from the village, four were from the neighbouring villages of Manibelli and Sinduri. There are over 150 eligible beneficiaries in these three villages. Officials administered vaccines under a tree on the banks of Narmada.Rathod said mobile connectivity in Chimalkhedi was a major issue. A team member had to climb a hillock near the village to get connectivity to register the beneficiaries on the CoWin app. The vaccinations were eventually carried out under the tree only after the officials felt that the exercise could be carried out safely and comfortably there, he said. “There are two government structures in the village. But we could not use the local school building as it was too hot inside. Besides, the local anganwadi kendra is under renovation. Since we could not have held the drive in the small dwellings of the villagers, we decided to administer the vaccines under the tree on the banks of the Narmada river,” said Rathod.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/health-workers-travel-4-hrs-to-maharashtra-tribal-village-vaccinate-11-under-tree/articleshow/82992537.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
---||Mumbai||Private Mumbai hospitals offering jabs to swell to 20||MUMBAI: The count of private hospitals administering Covid-19 vaccines in the city will rise to 20 by the end of this week. This, though, may not immediately boost CoWin slots as most will dole out the shots at housing societies and for corporate firms through tie-ups. Over the past week, several hospitals have adopted a hybrid strategy where they are vaccinating through tie-ups with private firms and residential complexes, besides carrying out drives in the hospitals through CoWin appointments. Following the initial crisis after the Centre stopped allocating doses from May 1, many hospitals have started receiving supplies of Covishield from SII. Pvt hosps give jabs mainly via tie-ups with firms & hsg socsCity private hospitals are getting Covishield ranging from a few thousand to up to a lakh doses from SII. Civic data shows that private hospitals are administering 10,000 to 12,000 doses in the city every day now while public vaccination centres are giving around 15,000 to 22,000 doses. Hospitals such as Hinduja, Jaslok, Nanavati, Lilavati, Kokilaben, H N Reliance, Charni Road’s Mittal, Saifee and Masina, among others, are vaccinating both through CoWin and tieups. While Breach Candy, Criticare, Fortis and Wockhardt are mainly vaccinating through tieups at present, they also plan to open vaccination to all. Some public centres such as Seven-Hills have tied up with embassies. Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL) has partnered with Lilavati and Dr Meena’s Multispeciality Hospital for vaccinating its employees. Joy Chakraborty, COO of PD Hinduja Hospital, said at least 11 of the city’s major private hospitals have received vaccines from Serum Institute of India recently and more are in the pipeline. “Vaccination will gain momentum soon as more hospitals receive doses gradually, but we will keep the CoWin option open in Hinduja,” he said, adding the hospital has received nearly one lakh doses. Almost all hospitals have been approached by a dozen to almost 80-100 companies for vaccination. Some corporations are themselves procuring the vaccines and collaborating with hospitals only to administer the doses. Dr Prince Surana, CEO of Surana Group of Hospitals, said they will start vaccinating employees of Kotak, Yes Bank, IDBI and Motilal Oswal, among others, with Covishield doses that it expects to receive in batches of 10,000 to15,000 by the end of the week. He says the group plans to keep at least 1,000 Co-Win slots daily. Dr S Narayani, zonal director of Fortis Hospital, said they have been vaccinating societies from the neighbourhood and corporates but intend to open vaccination in the hospital this week. The group has directly sourced doses from Serum Institute. A Breach Candy hospital official said they, too, have got doses from Serum, which they are currently utilising for staff. It hasn’t opened slots on CoWin. Officials from Saifee Hospital said they had received a few thousand doses of Covaxin from Bharat Biotech and expect stocks from Serum this week. It is vaccinating around 200 through CoWin appointments and 500-600 through tie-ups daily. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said since private hospitals are procuring their own doses, they are free to administer in any manner. “They can choose how many slots they want to open on Co-Win. The only requirement is vaccination through CoWin should be 100% through online registration,” he said. Hospitals have to submit an application to the local ward office which gives permission for the drive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/private-mumbai-hospitals-offering-jabs-to-swell-to-20/articleshow/82992560.cms||Sumitra Debroy

---||Kolkata||Yaas Cyclone effect: one crore people hit, three lakh homes wrecked in West Bengal||KOLKATA: More than three lakh homes were destroyed and one crore people were affected as sea waters along the Bengal coast and rivers started swelling and breached embankments, a little after Cyclone Yaas made landfall at Odisha at 9.30am on Wednesday. The only life lost was that of a fisherman, who had ventured out to sea, ignoring warnings. Kanai Giri (55) from East Midnapore’s Mandarmani had set out, along with six others, when their boat sank in the choppy waters. While the others managed to swim ashore, Giri drowned. Kolkata, 290km from landfall, escaped the worst of the cyclone’s wrath. The city, which had prepared for an Amphan-like experience, saw just light to moderate showers in sporadic bouts. The day was windy, but the maximum speed reached was 62kmph, recorded for less than a minute. After landfall occurred, the water level in the sea and rivers started to swell to over five to six feet above normal levels because of the 10am high tide. Embankments were breached in 135 places under the dual impact, and the saline water inundated farmlands, homes and fisheries. At some places, the situation turned complicated with some villagers refusing to leave their homes and some returning after the storm subsided a bit. State agencies, the Army, the Coast Guard and NDRF units were conducting rescue operations till late into the night in East Midnapore and South 24 Parganas, with the water level again surging due to the late evening high tide. CM Mamata Banerjee said relief of Rs 10 crore had been sent to be distributed at 14,000 relief centres. She said the destruction caused by Cyclone Yaas could only be known after 72 hours, and sought reports. She, along with the chief secretary and senior officers, will conduct an aerial survey and hold meetings in the three worst-affected districts — East Midnapore, North and South 24 Parganas — on Friday and Saturday. Banerjee has set up a task force, headed by the chief secretary, for repairing embankments, which will include the secretaries of finance, home, disaster, forest and environment. Banerjee said she feared that some areas might be inundated during the evening high tide, because of which she asked for power to be switched off to avoid electrocution deaths. Reports of devastation started reaching the Nabanna control room, where the CM had camped overnight with her senior officers, from 11am. In Frazerganj, South 24 Parganas, villages like Kalisthan, Lakshmipur and Amarabati were completely flooded as early as 9am, damaging houses, farmlands and animal shelters. Such was the intensity that a pay-loader at North Bakkhali, which was stationed to repair the embankment, was itself washed away a distance as water overflowed the embankments. East Midnapore also took a day-long pounding, with sea waters damaging the seaside resorts (in Mandamani, a resort’s roof was blown away), and big boulders on the Digha beach were flung on the road. Sankarpur and Tajpur witnessed similar fury, along with the coastal towns like Ramnagar, Contai and Nandigram. Haldia, comparatively, was spared the onslaught. Earlier in the day, 100 people were rescued from Nayachar by a Coast Guard hovercraft after they were reluctant to move to cyclone shelters; 500 others in the district were rescued by the Army. The effect could be felt in vegetable prices. “South 24 Parganas takes care of the bulk supply of summer crops like bhindi, green chillies, bitter gourd, bottle gourd to the city, while East Midnapore supplies the bulk of cucumber, ivy gourd, snake gourd and ridged gourd. The supply of pointed gourd (parwal) and spine gourd (kakrol) will also get affected because of the inundation of three blocks in North 24 Parganas — Sandeshkhali, Dhamakhali and Hingalganj,” said Kamal Dey, a member of the state government-appointed market task force and president of the West Bengal Vegetable Growers’ and Vendors’ Association. The invasion of saline water from the sea is said to have affected four blocks of Patharpratima, Sagar, Kakdwip and Namkhana in South 24 Parganas. “Going by preliminary reports, 70% of the farmland of these blocks were completely inundated,” said a senior district officer. In East Midnapore, besides farmlands, a lot of fisheries were completely washed away. In East Midnapore’s Ramanagar-I and II, Contai I and II, Nandigram, Khejuri and Kolaghat, extensive damage of standing crops of vegetables, paan, flowers were reported. In East Midnapore, 51 embankments were breached. The Army and Coast Guard had to be called into East Midnapore to rescue people during the surge. A 100 stranded people from Nayachar were rescued. The damage to standing crops will have a lasting impact on retail and wholesale markets in the city. “This year, the production of vegetables was very good. This is why vendors could sell vegetables at a reasonable price, despite the record surges in diesel price. Since the damage is extensive, there will be some demand-supply gap, pushing retail prices up,” said Gobindo Naskar, a vegetable wholesaler at Chowbaga wholesale market. “Soil salinity is a huge challenge. It took nearly seven years to turn the land conducive for agriculture after Cyclone Aila breached the embankments of the Sunderbans. We hope to drain out the saline water as early as possible to minimise the damage,” said a scientist of the agriculture department.

It was largely due to this effort that the loss of life could be minimised (there was just one life lost), even though Cyclone Yaas wreaked havoc on homes and farmlands, said government sources. By the time Yaas hit land on Wednesday morning near Dhamra port in Odisha at 9.15am, as many as 15,04,506 people were already moved out from vulnerable areas to safer places, CM Mamata Banerjee said. During last year’s Amphan, when 86 people had died and 70% of the state’s population were directly affected by the storm, around 10 lakh people had been evacuated. The evacuation figure for Yaas surpassed the number on Tuesday itself. Several lakh people were also moved out from flood-prone and inundated areas on Wednesday as well. “We had evacuated all those living in the coastal belts, but there were some places, away from the cyclonic formation, where villagers were not expecting their homes to be flooded. Here, the spring tide deluged their homes and farmlands. Work is on to rescue them as well,” said Banerjee. “The tide will persist and water level will continue to rise. There is bad-weather warning till Thursday. I appeal to every evacuated person to stay at the rescue centres for a few more days.” The evacuations were risky. At ward 16 of Diamond Harbour, the state administration rescued 123 persons, including an 87-year-old elderly woman, a 9-month-old child and a woman with a physical disability after the neighbourhood got inundated on Wednesday morning with water from the Hooghly. “Around 9am, we suddenly found water gushing into our home and the road outside was inundated. We have been living here for generations but never have seen riverwater flooding our area. Within minutes, we were marooned. It was only with the help of the disaster management personnel that we could be rescued,” said 87-year-old Pramila Mondal. The same group of civil defence and disaster management personnel also rescued the nine-month-old child and his family, who had taken shelter on their roof. At East Midnapore, that is surrounded by six rivers and the Bay of Bengal, the biggest evacuation operation was carried out with close to 3.9 lakh people being rescued in two days and put up at over 2,000 flood centres and temporary shelters. The district also suffered the maximum devastation, with villages around Digha, Mandarmani, Tajpur, Chandpur, Contai, Khejuri and Nandigram flooded, damaging shops and houses. Several sea-side hotels were also severely damaged and some of their staff had to be evacuated by disaster management teams. Ground floors of multiple flood centres at Contai and Ramnagar, where rescued people were kept, had also got inundated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/15-lakh-moved-in-bengals-biggest-evacuation-drive/articleshow/82988589.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
