In visiting the spot, the team realised that the bird was an Egyptian vulture. "We sent our nearest team of volunteers after informing the District/Divisional Forest Officer (DFO). We spotted an Egyptian vulture on the spot and rescued it. The bird was dehydrated and we sent it to Kengeri wildlife hospital where the bird has been kept under observation. Other than dehydration the bird had no signs of injury," informs Prasanna Kumar A, head of BBMP wildlife rescue team and honorary wildlife warden of Bangalore urban division of Karnataka Forest department. He added that the rescue operation took an hour's time. Speaking about the species, environmentalist Vijay Nishant says, "It's heartening to see this bird in the interiors of Bengaluru. It is amazing how it reached Whitefield. Certainly not an everyday sight. As an urban conservationist, it feels great to hear about such rescue operations." Interestingly, Prasanna's team rescued another species at Bangalore University. "We rescued a small Indian civet (Viverricula indica) from the Bangalore University campus on Monday as well," he says. During the lockdown, Prasanna and his team have been getting around 65-70 rescue calls for birds, snakes and also mammals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bbmp-wildlife-rescue-team-rescues-an-egyptian-vulture-in-whitefield/articleshow/82855373.cms||Joyeeta Chakravorty

Relatives of Covid patients at Srinagar’s main hospital on Saturday even started a mini brawl over possession of oxygen cylinders, which were coming in from various private units. “Every attendant wanted to acquire as many cylinders as possible for their respective Covid patients admitted to the hospital and almost came to blows over the matter,” one witness said. Dr Kanwaljeet Singh, medical superintendent of SMHS hospital, said the facility has sufficient oxygen for all its Covid patients and that they only acquire some cylinders from private units as back-up. "The hospital has six oxygen manufacturing plants which produce 1,800 cylinders daily, which is caters to our needs," Dr Singh said. Some witnesses to the fight uploaded video clips of the brawl in the hospital on to social media, which gives the impression that there is shortage of oxygen in SMHS, but it is not so, Dr Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/attendants-of-covid-patients-fight-over-oxygen-cylinders-at-srinagars-main-hospital/articleshow/82866967.cms||M Saleem Pandit

---||World||Pakistan PM Imran Khan heads towards bigger political challenge||ISLAMABAD: Internal rifts have appeared in Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaaf (PTI) after 40 dissident lawmakers led by an estranged party leader, Jahangir Khan Tareen, formed a forward bloc to confront the ruling party over mismanagement in government. The formation of a new faction has inflicted a deep wound on Khan and his party. The matter appears to be so grave that the PM and his associates are avoiding public comment because they fear causing further damage to the party. Ever since Imran Khan became PM he has dealt with political opponents with an iron fist to deny them space to challenge his authority. Now he finds himself in the midst of uncontrollable political turmoil in the country’s corridors of power. Sources familiar with ongoing developments believe that the latest move by Tareen would not be possible without the support and approval of the country’s most powerful quarters. By creating a faction within PTI, Tareen has pulled the rug from under Imran, who has a thin majority in the National and Punjab Assemblies and that too with the backing of military-sponsored coalition partners. In the 342-member National Assembly, the PTI has 156 seats (including 10 members of the Tareen group). Pakistan’s PM can be elected with a simple majority of 172 votes in the Lower House. In August 2018, Imran had secured 176 votes, four more than the required number, to become PM for the first time, with the support of allied parties allegedly backed by the military. The opposition, however, enjoys the support of 161 legislators, with major opposition party PML-N having 84 members and the strength of Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) being 56. In the Punjab Assembly, the PTI has 181 lawmakers, including 30 dissident members of the new group. It had formed government with the support of 10 members of the pro-military Pakistan Muslim League, four Independents and one member of Pakistan Rah-e-Haq party. The opposition PML-N has 166 legislators in the provincial Assembly, followed by seven of the PPP. It appears that Khan’s federal and Punjab governments can be sent home without hindrance if Tareen’s faction joins hands with the opposition parties. The military’s approval will be crucial role in any such move. Meanwhile, Khan’s only trump card, if things get out of control, will be to dissolve the assembles ahead of any no-confidence move against him in the federal and Punjab assemblies, paving the way for fresh polls in the country. Observers believe that Pakistan’s security establishment, commonly known as "selectors" by critics and Khan’s political rivals, are unhappy with the government’s performance. The generals, who take a major chunk of the country’s financial pie, are concerned about the incumbent government’s mismanagement of the economy. They are also concerned about the PM and his team’s foreign policy setbacks and governance failures at the federal and provincial levels, specifically in Punjab, the country’s most populous province which provides more than 70% of soldiers to the country’s armed forces. The military leadership, according to army sources, has been asking Khan for a long time to change his team in Punjab, specifically provincial chief minister Usman Buzdar, but the PM to date has refused to meet the demand of who his rivals say are his "selectors". The PTI’s mismanagement, according to defence analysts, compelled the military establishment to explore other options. Well-placed sources revealed that the army leadership has been in constant contact with the opposition Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leadership and its president, Shehbaz Sharif (a former Pakistan Punjab CM and ex-PM Nawaz Sharif’s younger brother), who had been released from prison last month. Along with his party stalwarts, the younger Sharif, also leader of the opposition in the National Assembly, has adopted a soft approach towards the military. Meanwhile, exiled former PM Nawaz Sharif and his daughter, Maryum Nawaz, have also toned down their anti-military rhetoric, indicating a move from the politics of antagonism to accommodation. Sensing the political current, the Pakistan Democratic Alliance (PDM), an alliance of 11 opposition parties formed on the single-point agenda of ousting the Imran-led government, has again made a serious attempt to re-weaponise the alliance. Shehbaz Sharif has taken the initiative, inviting all opposition members in parliament to lunch on Monday. The PDM’s job, observers believe, has been made easy by Tareen. The forward bloc that he has created in PTI comprised 10 lawmakers in the National Assembly and 30 in the Punjab Assembly. Tareen has also announced parliamentary leaders for his group in the federal and provincial assemblies. Frustrated by the Tareen saga, Imran, who went to oversee construction work of a dam in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Thursday, avoided taking a single question on any political issue dominating the media right now. Journalists had thought that the PM would talk about key political issues but Khan, as well as his aide, issued verbal advisories to journalists not to ask any such question. Tareen, Imran’s yesteryears buddy and the blue-eyed boy of the military establishment, was barred by the Pakistan Supreme Court, along with ex-PM Nawaz Sharif, from holding any public office after the "Panama Papers" scam came to light. But his behind-the-scenes political influence did not end with the top court’s order. Without holding any position in the PTI since the court’s ruling, he remained a key political figure and was instrumental in crafting strategy for Imran to come to power. Tareen’s downfall in PTI began in April 2020 when his name was revealed by the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) as one of the sugar barons allegedly involved in the 2019 sugar crisis in the country. He was named by the FIA as one of the beneficiaries of subsidies obtained by sugar industry bigwigs. The FIA is currently investigating cases related to the sugar crisis and money-laundering against Tareen and his son. Tareen maintains that all cases against him have been fabricated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/pakistan-pm-imran-khan-heads-towards-bigger-political-challenge/articleshow/82867031.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

The judge, while granting the interim bail against a surety bond of Rs 1 lakh, ordered Nengroo to appear before the probe team as and when called by the investigating officer, lawyer Ishtiyaq Khan said. Nengroo was sacked as J&K Bank chairman in June 2019 after several financial irregularities surfaced during his two-and-a-half-year tenure. Subsequently in October that year, the anti-corruption bureau registered a case against three former J&K Bank officials, including Nengroo, and a Mumbai-based private firm. After further investigations, Nengroo was arrested on April 3 this year in connection with a specific case of illegal allotment of housekeeping tenders to a Mumbai-based company that allegedly caused a loss of over Rs 6 crore to J&K Bank.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/former-jammu-and-kashmir-bank-chief-gets-bail-in-fraud-case/articleshow/82867054.cms||M Saleem Pandit

Tweeting a video, Mehbooba said: “Detaining DDC members from Budgam since seven months in the name of security defeats the purpose of their election. Held against their will, administration has also prevented them from touring their constituencies. They are so fed up that they have offered to resign (sic).” The DDC members, who want to quit, are also seen in the video clip, saying that they have been “under detention” for the past seven months. “The government has no plan for us. They sought our work plan and we have already submitted that, but not a single penny has been released for us so far,” one of them says in the video. Many DDC members have already given in writing that they don’t need any security and want to live with their families. “Our security should be withdrawn as that will save the government money. We can’t even visit our families and the education of our children too has suffered badly,” another DDC member says. The J&K administration has provided accommodation to DDC members in secure areas in their respective districts to avert any terror attack on them. However, some of the members resent the move and want to stay at their respective homes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/7-ddc-members-from-budgam-want-to-quit-mehbooba-mufti/articleshow/82867136.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||India||Delhi halts vaccine drive for 18-44, CM Arvind Kejriwal sends SOS to PM Narendra Modi||NEW DELHI: The vaccination drive for the young (18-44 age-group) has been put on hold in Delhi due to a severe vaccine crunch, and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday asked the Centre to supply more vaccines to the capital so that it can re-start the drive. Delhi needs 80 lakh doses of vaccines each month but for May it received only 16 lakh. And there won’t be much relief next month either. Delhi has been promised only 8 lakh doses in June. Kejriwal said at this pace, it will take 30 months to vaccinate all in the capital. The chief minister has written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, drawing his attention to the situation. He has urged the Centre to provide the required vaccines as soon as possible so that the centres that have been closed down can be reopened. He has also pleaded with the Centre to increase Delhi’s vaccination quota. “"This Covid wave (fourth wave) has killed mostly the youth and the vaccines meant for inoculating the youth in Delhi are as of now over," said the CM at a digital address to the media. He gave four suggestions to the Centre for increasing the supply of vaccines: Ask vaccine manufacturing companies in the country to manufacture the vaccine using the formula Bharat Biotech has agreed to share (Covaxin); allow all foreign vaccines to be used in the country, and the Centre, rather than the states, should buy them; the foreign Covid vaccine manufacturing companies should be allowed to manufacture the vaccines in India; and India should reach out to countries that are storing vaccines beyond their requirement and appeal to them to share the excess stocks with India. At her daily briefing on the vaccine situation in the city, AAP MLA Atishi said that 50,20,214 people have been vaccinated so far in Delhi because of Delhi’s high-speed vaccination programme despite constraints due to the vaccine crunch. Vaccinating the maximum number of people in minimum time is the only way to protect the country from a third wave, said Kejriwal. He said the Delhi government was already arranging for beds, ICUs, oxygen and medicines but people were concerned about the vaccine shortage. “I received a call from an old woman who told me that she and her son want to get vaccinated. She is 65-year-old and her son is 35. I said we have run out of vaccines for the youth but I could get her vaccinated. She thought for a bit and asked me if it was okay if her son was vaccinated instead of her. She said she was old, but her son has to manage a family and must stay protected. I was very disturbed after listening to this,” said the CM. He said the city was facing a severe vaccine crunch. “Delhi needs 80 lakh vaccines every month. We, however, received 16 lakh in the month of May, and the central government has reduced the quota for Delhi for the month of June by half. A letter we have received from the Centre says that we will be given only 8 lakh vaccines in June. Till now, we have administered a total of 50 lakh vaccine doses in Delhi and we need 2.5 crore more to vaccinate all the adults. At this pace, if only 8 lakh vaccines are provided every month, it will take 30 months to vaccinate all adults in Delhi. And till then, no one knows how many waves and deaths due to the coronavirus will be witnessed,” said Kejriwal. “Bharat Biotech, which manufactures Covaxin, is ready to give its formula to other companies. There are several vaccine-making companies in the country. The central government should immediately invite all of them and order them – not request – to start rapidly making the vaccine. This should happen in the next 24 hours,” he said, adding that every day is precious. Kejriwal also suggested that all foreign vaccines should be given permission within 24 hours to be used in India. “The Centre should communicate with all the manufacturers. Currently, the Centre has left the job to the states,” he said, suggesting that the Centre can buy crores of vaccines and distribute them among the states.

The capital recorded 6,684 deaths as against a little over 2.63 lakh cases reported during this period, translating to a CFR of 2.54%. This is more than twice the fatality rate of 1.12% recorded in Delhi in the previous three weeks and also significantly higher than the capital's overall CFR of 1.63%. The national CFR in May so far is 1.17%, also a sharp rise from 0.73% recorded in the previous three week (April 10-30). This is because deaths have risen at a sharper rate than cases in May so far. India has reported 83,135 deaths in May, a 92% rise from 43,258 fatalities in the previous three weeks. By contrast, cases have risen by around 20%, up from 59.5 lakh in April 10-20 to 71.3 lakh in May 1-21. After Delhi, Punjab close second with fatality rate of 2.5% in MayCases have been falling steadily since peaking around May 8 but the death count has shown a much lower decline, possibly owing to a lag of around two weeks normally seen between trends in deaths in comparison to cases. The overall CFR in the country is 1.13%. Read AlsoMaharashtra: Experts see reduced Covid virulence as deaths stay lowThere has been a steady drop in the district’s weekly Covid case fatality rate (CFR) despite the recent surge in cases. The February 13-19 week recorded the lowest CFR (just 0.7%) since January 23-29, when it was 1.2%.Among the bigger states, Punjab has the second highest death rate in May of 2.46%. This is much higher than the death rate of 1.56% seen in April 10-20 but on par with the state’s CFR of 2.45%, which is the highest in the country. So, although Punjab has seen a high number of deaths over the past several weeks, it’s still lower than the rates witnessed during the first wave. Uttarakhand, the venue of this year’s Kumbh, has the third highest CFR of 2.34%, higher than the rate in the previous three weeks (1.18%) as well as the state’s overall rate of 1.85%. Other states with high CFRs in May are Jharkhand (2.24%), Goa (2.17%) and Maharashtra (1.85%). Maharashtra, which has recorded the highest number of deaths in May at 17,097, reported a CFR of 0.87% in April 10-30 and has an overall death rate of 1.57%. Read AlsoMaharashtra’s tally dips, Mumbai’s daily Covid toll of 82 highest this yearA day after adding nearly 1,000 deaths, the state reported a dip in deaths and added 771 Covid-19 fatalities.Karnataka, which logged the second highest number of deaths in May at 8,749, has had a relatively low CFR of 1.04% so far this month. Among the bigger states, Odisha has the lowest CFR in May of 0.17%, followed by Kerala (0.23%), Andhra Pradesh (0.43%), Bengal (0.68%), Telangana (0.73), Bihar (0.84%) and Madhya Pradesh as well as Tamil Nadu (both 0.92%). On Saturday, India recorded less than 2.5 lakh cases (2,41,245) for the first time in over a month since April 16. Deaths, however, showed a rise from the previous day’s count with 3,745 fatalities reported on Saturday. There were 3,478 deaths on Friday.

---||India||India, South Africa moot 3-year Covid patent waiver||NEW DELHI: India and South Africa, along with several poor and developing countries from Africa and Latin America, have proposed a three-year patent waiver for Covid-19-related health products and technologies, including drugs and vaccines, along with “their material or components and their methods and means to manufacture”. The submission made on Friday goes beyond drugs and vaccines to include diagnostics, therapeutics, medical devices, personal protective equipment with the coverage proposed to include “the prevention, treatment or containment of Covid-19”. Trade experts said that the proposal – which will form the basis for negotiations – has clearly provided a window for technology and know-how sharing, which is a major concern with suggestions that patent waiver alone will not result in production of vaccines or drugs. Besides, by including material and components, the idea is to ensure that there is access to the entire value chain. While India and South Africa were the original proponents of waiver of Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), which also includes relaxations in rules related to copyrights and designs, they now claim the support of over 120 countries, including Pakistan and Indonesia. China is seen to be coming out in support of the proposal and the government is trying to get Brazil on board. Separately, the United States, which recently announced its support to negotiations for a waiver for vaccines, has also reached out to countries such as Japan and Switzerland with the European Union too willing to engage in discussions. “The submission is absolutely clear. The idea is consolidation of the proposals, providing clarity and assertion of the intent. India and the others have made it clear that they are seeking a three-year window while there was discussion in the US around 16-18 months,” said Sachin Chaturvedi, who heads Research and Information Systems for developing countries, a think tank. “Three years provide clarity to companies looking to work on producing vaccines or drugs over the medium term. India needs to redouble our efforts on the diplomatic front and ensure that the developed countries do not link this to negotiations on other issues at the WTO,” added Biswajit Dhar, a professor at JNU. India and the others have argued that there is threat to human health, safety and well-due to Covid-19 resulting in unprecedented and multifaceted effects, including the severe disruption to societies, economies, global trade and travel and the devastating impact on the livelihoods of people. At the same time, they recognised the importance of preserving incentives for research and innovation, but added that they needed to be balanced with public health interest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-south-africa-moot-3-year-covid-patent-waiver/articleshow/82868816.cms||Sidhartha
---||India||Government steps in to expedite WHO approval for Covaxin||NEW DELHI: India's Covaxin may have proven and adequate efficacy but its lack of endorsement from the WHO remains a cause of concern for the government. What has aggravated the situation is the fact that only a handful of countries, as has been reported, have confirmed they will allow entry to those vaccinated by Covaxin. ToI has learnt that foreign secretary Harsh Shringla will hold a meeting with Bharat Biotech, the manufacturer of Covaxin, on Monday to expedite the process of WHO approval for the indigenously manufactured vaccine which has been administered to close to 2 crore Indians until now. With the US, and also many countries in Europe looking to reopen soon, it's important for the government to ensure that those vaccinated with Covaxin, particularly students, are not denied entry by these countries. Official sources said while some well meaning countries had approved Covaxin, many others are likely to do so once the vaccine is ready for export. Covaxin approval is pending at the WHO and the government will work with Bharat Biotech to expedite this process, according to Indian government sources. An emergency use approval is likely to encourage countries to import Covaxin, facilitate its manufacturing abroad and ease travel for those vaccinated with it. In India's own neighbourhood, Sri Lanka started administering China's Sinopharm vaccine to its citizens only after the vaccine received WHO backing. While India is unlikely to resume export anytime soon, the emergency listing will also mean that Covaxin can be used by COVAX, the global vaccine alliance, later to vaccinate people in many developing countries. According to the government, more than 40 countries have expressed interest in Covaxin and seem satisfied with what the manufacturer calls safe, inactivated vaccine technology and "robust data package for safety and immunogenicity". Covaxin received a setback last month though after Brazil regulatory authorities blocked its import "considering the non-compliance with the requirements of Good Manufacturing Practices for Medicines". WHO will likely seek more clinical data and information about manufacturing practices before approving it. Bharat Biotech last month announced 78 percent overall interim clinical efficacy and 100 percent efficacy against severe Covid-19 disease from phase 3 trials. Many Indian leaders, including PM Narendra Modi, and top bureaucrats have been vaccinated by Covaxin. However, as was reported earlier this week, very few countries have so far opened themselves to people inoculated by Covaxin.

---||India||‘Centre not in favour of door-to-door vaccine’||NEW DELHI: The Centre’s disinclination for door-to-door Covid vaccination was determined by the complexity of the operation needing supply chain management and monitoring of AEFI (Adverse Events Following Immunisation) reporting that is not the case with established inoculations like polio, P K Mishra, principal secretary to the PM, has said. “We must recognise that Covid vaccination is under emergency use authorisation, requiring vaccination supply chains, local infrastructure and equipment, trained medical manpower and links to AEFI reporting. This is not akin to the door-to-door immunisation programme we are now familiar with for long known diseases such as polio,” Mishra told TOI. Speaking on the Centre’s vaccine strategy, Mishra said the government adopted a phased approach to inoculate its citizens based on scientific and epidemiological protocol as well as global best practices, prioritising those needing it the most. “Vaccinating everyone as soon as possible is our goal and we will leave no stone unturned in achieving it,” he said, while pointing out that a comparison of a new injectible vaccine for Covid and an oral one for polio was misplaced. Mishra said the government aims to vaccinate all adults by the end of this year. “We have developed an indigenous vaccine in record time, and are manufacturing another one under licence agreement,” he said, adding that the Centre is looking into several strategies for scaling and diversifying production. “Our teams are in regular touch with manufacturers, domestic and international, on a daily basis,” he said. India has vaccinated 19 crore people, the third highest globally and fastest. “This is not an ordinary number by any standards, equivalent, in terms of population, to half of US, 2.5 times UK, 7 times Australia, 35 times New Zealand,” Mishra said while acknowledging the difficulties faced ensuring efficient and sustained last mile delivery across complex supply chains and varied local constraints. The shift in policy from centralised procurement to let states and private hospitals directly purchase vaccines from manufacturers was part of the strategy. “The change in strategy will lead to increased availability through higher domestic production as well as import of vaccines. While kicking in with a time lag of a few months, the supply is slated to increase from 7 crore per month in April to 16 crore in July and 25 crore in October,” Mishra said. He said the decrease in daily inoculation is not because of change in policy and less production. “In the early phase of vaccination, we had through regulatory approvals allowed stockpiling from before the vaccination began. That is why we were able to inoculate more people per day as delivery capabilities were systematically ramped up,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/centre-not-in-favour-of-door-to-door-vaccine/articleshow/82869985.cms||Pradeep Thakur

The landfall of the cyclone, named ‘Yaas’, is expected around May 26 evening. Its intensity will, however, not be like cyclone ‘Tauktae’ which hit the western coast earlier this week. “A ‘low pressure area’ has formed over east central Bay of Bengal on May 22 morning. It is very likely to concentrate into a ‘depression’ over east-central Bay of Bengal by May 23 morning… It is very likely to cross West Bengal and adjoining north Odisha & Bangladesh coasts around evening of May 26,” said the IMD. Issuing a warning, it said, “The fishermen are advised not to venture into central Bay of Bengal from May 23-25 and into north Bay of Bengal and along & off West Bengal–Odisha–Bangladesh coasts from May 24-26. Those who are out in the deep sea of east-central & adjoining northeast Bay of Bengal are advised to return to the coast.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/very-severe-cyclone-may-hit-east-coast-on-may-26-imd/articleshow/82870721.cms||---

Need more studies on it, says government||NEW DELHI: It is feasible in theory that it is alright to mix first and second doses of different vaccines, but robust scientific evidence is still lacking for India to make this a permissible practice, said leading government health expert Dr V K Paul on Saturday. It is scientifically plausible and studies are going on evaluate such a possibility, said Dr Paul, who is Niti Aayog member (Health). He said the evidence abroad and in India is being evaluated. “It is scientifically plausible but there need to be more studies. It can’t be said definitively that mixing of doses can be practised. There is no robust scientific evidence. Only time will tell whether it will be done in future. It will depend on international studies, World Health Organisation findings etc. Our experts are also studying,” Dr Paul said. “One shot of one type produces antibodies and the second shot from another will increase that. Scientifically, there is no problem but we need evidence-based data to see that happening,” he added. Of late, some emerging studies have shown that mixing different vaccines may help better protect against Covid-19. For instance, researchers in Spain found vaccinating people with both Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines is safe and produces a potent immune response. Findings of the study are yet to be published in any journal. India is currently administering Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik-V vaccines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/can-vaccines-be-mixed-need-more-studies-on-it-says-government/articleshow/82871005.cms||---

They have so far not provided any alternative. If they provide an alternative to us then we will talk,” said Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar while clearing the government’s position on Saturday. Tomar’s remark comes a day after farmer unions opposing the laws, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and west UP, wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking his intervention to resume talks. The unions warned that if they do not receive a constructive and positive response by May 25, a “further intensification” of their struggle beginning May 26 will be announced. The farm protests at Delhi borders will complete six months on May 26 – the day which the union’s joint platform, ‘Samyukta Kisan Morcha’ (SKM), has decided to observe as a ‘Black Day’. Government sources pointed out that talks will be purposeless if — as has been the case in most of the 11 rounds held previously — the union leaders simply intone “scrap the laws” in the deliberations. Despite occasional signs of a breakthrough, the discussions have ended in stalemate. It is also pointed out that if the unions remain adamant, both sides will have to await the ruling of the Supreme Court whenever it is delivered. "The unions have a chance to negotiate a satisfactory settlement. The court verdict may or may not be as satisfactory," said an official. The last round of talks between government and unions of protesting farmers was held on January 22. The government side had offered the unions a proposal to put the implementation of laws on hold for 18 months and find an amicable solution to their demands by discussing the contentious or objectionable points through a joint committee. The unions had, however, rejected the offer, leading to a stalemate. They have since then held a position that they won’t talk unless the government agrees to repeal the three farm laws and also to their demand of giving legal guarantee to procurement at minimum support price (MSP). The unions’ letter, jointly written by nine farmer leaders, was sent to the Prime Minister through email with CC to all the three ministers –Tomar, Piyush Goyal and Som Parkash – who had been involved in talks with 40 farmer unions, including 32 from Punjab. The letter is also seen in government as a reaction to concerns being expressed over gatherings at protests sites in the midst of a Covid surge, with unions wanting to convey their readiness for negotiations and seeking to place the onus on the Centre. Meanwhile, many labour organisations and trade unions on Saturday extended support to the SKM for observing May 26 as 'Black Day' throughout the country by hoisting black flags at their homes, shops, vehicles and MNREGA work sites. "The protest actions will be organised following the Covid-19 protocol," said a joint statement of these groups.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/centre-refuses-to-budge-cold-to-farmers-demand-for-talks/articleshow/82871213.cms||Vishwa Mohan
---||India||Coronavirus: Are jabs helping? ICMR seeks hospitalisation data from states||PUNE: The Indian Council of Medical Research has asked all states to ready data of those who were hospitalised with Covid after vaccination. Experts said the information will be used to explore a theory that states Covid is mostly mild after vaccination. States have also been asked to collect data on vaccination coverage, hospitalisations, treatment protocols and duration of hospital stay in the vaccinated. Senior ICMR epidemiologist Dr Samiran Panda said states are encouraged to upload the data on a common portal. “I feel this data will help states understand how vaccines are helpful in reducing hospitalisation and the burden on health infrastructure,” Dr Panda said. Experts said it is important to collect the states’ information on a common portal as research on vaccine effectiveness can help ease hesitancy. As per health ministry, out of 18.41 crore people vaccinated since January 16, 14.12 crore have received one dose and 4.29 crore people have completed their two-dose schedule. Hospitals may seek prior vaccination information but it is unlikely this information is being fed into a centralised database, experts said. Sanjay Patil, chairman of the IMA’s Hospital Board of India, Pune, said doctors have observed that severity of Covid post vaccination is “very less”. Some states have carried out small studies — especially among doctors and healthcare workers — to determine the severity of Covid after vaccinations. Experts said many of these vaccinated health workers may be acquiring the infection again due to the high viral load environments they work in.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/coronavirus-are-jabs-helping-icmr-seeks-hospitalisation-data-from-states/articleshow/82871417.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad’s brightest step up in battle against Covid-19||Barely nine months of launching US9 respiratory mask, Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad (IIT-H) incubated startup U-Safe has made a sale of almost 10,000 masks. Launched in August, 2020, the US9 respiratory mask was said to be better than the N95 mask in protection. It was commercialized as the world’s most affordable respirator mask that is highly durable and adheres to the highest safety standards for operating in hazardous environments. Today, the US9 respiratory mask is being used by several doctors and nurses in top hospitals across the city. "When we launched the mask, we received feedback from several users that the mask was making it slightly difficult for them to breathe. Subsequently, we improvised and came up with two more variants with better filtration and easy to breathe masks," said Saumil Sharma, head of marketing, USafe Healthcare Pvt Ltd. Following brisk business in the market, the start-up also reduced the cost of the mask. "When we launched, the price was Rs 599 for 30 filters. Now, we have reduced the cost to Rs 299 for 30 filters. This is cheaper than an N95 mask. Doctors change three-four N96 masks in a day. Our mask lasts for three days, making is a much more affordable option," said Sharma. Briefcase size non invasive ventilator helps people catch a breathAt a time when the country is gasping for breath due to the surge in Covid-19 cases, Hyderabad-based Apollo Computing Laboratories, a defence & aerospace design and development solutions provider, has developed a briefcase-like portable non-invasive ventilator – SwasthVayu. Swasthvayu ventilators are being used in various hospitals in Hyderabad and Delhi. The company is manufacturing around 200-300 units of these ventilators per day and can ramp it up to 500 based on demand. SwasthVayu delivers Oxygen through a non-vented mask tightly fitted to the face, doing away with the need for tracheal intubation or a tube being inserted through the mouth into the windpipe. The device has an LCD display and user interface buttons on the front panel to operate the machine. It also has a SD card slot, where a SD card can be inserted to store information generated by the machine. The in-built Li-ion battery provides two-to-four hours battery back-up to overcome any power transmission exigencies and the device is programmed to generate six alarms to alert the medical attendants for patient breath cycle detection. ........................................ Blockchain solution helps safe movement of Covid-19 vaccines As per World Health Organisation data, one out of four vaccines get spoiled in the supply chain. One of the major reasons for this wastage is cold chain failures. The other major concern is theft and black marketing of drugs and vaccines that have become precious cargo during this Covid-19 pandemic. StaTwig, a T-Hub incubated start-up, which recently shifted its base to Singapore, has developed a blockchain solution ‘Vaccine Ledger’ that is being used by government authorities and vaccine manufacturing companies to ensure safe delivery of life saving Covid-19 vaccines to far-off places as well as prevent its black marketing. It captures serial numbers, expiry dates, other manufacturing data using 2D Bar codes and uses them to scan the vaccines at various touch points along the journey of the vaccine. It helps to not only monitor vaccines but also alerts the suppliers about any glitches during the journey helping them to take corrective actions. Today, StaTwig’s solution is being used not just by the Telangana government but GMR Group as well for its airports handling pharmaceutical and vaccine cargo. Soon, it will be deployed in certain countries in Africa and Latin America. IoT-enabled ventilator awaits device certificationAlow-cost ventilator that can be controlled via a phone app developed by an Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad (IIT-H) incubated start-up is in the process of getting necessary certifications and approvals ahead of it’s commercial launch. When the Covid-19 pandemic hit us early 2020, the startup Aerobiosys Innovations had developed a low-cost, portable, emergency use ventilator titled ‘Jeevan Lite’. It is an internet of things enabled ventilator and can also be battery operated, enabling its deployment in areas without assured power supply. After spending a year on research and development of the product and it’s design, the startup is in the process of securing device certification from British Standards Institutions, a standards body based in the UK and a no objection certificate from the Central Drug Standard Controls Organisation, India’s national regulatory body for pharmaceuticals and medical devices. "Pursuant to device certification and CDSCO approval, we intend to start the production of the ventilator with an industrial partner. We are yet to finalise the price for the commercial launch," said Rajesh Yadav, founder and chief executive officer of Aerobiosys Innovations. Simultaneously, they are also tying up with hospitals to conduct a final check of the ventilator for its efficacy. Contactless AI-IoT device scans temperature, analyses data A homegrown startup BlueSemi, which develops low power devices, to come up with a contactless AIoT (Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things) solution called SENS. Developed just three months into the pandemic in May 2020, the sleek, contactless temperature sensing device is about 15 cm x 3cm in size and weighs just 120 gms. It gives a medically accurate temperature reading of a person, holding up their palm in front of it, within just 5 seconds. The device is paired with its own mobile app and desktop dashboard that issue risk alerts if the temperature is above a certain level, helping the security guard on the other side of the door decide whether a person should be granted entry. The solution also includes advanced data analytics that helps analyse the data logs generated by the device to help users make informed and timely decisions. SENS, which has so far done over two crore scans, learns with each scan and adjusts accuracy on a daily and weekly basis. What’s more, being a very low power device, it needs to be charged only once in 15 days. After being pilot tested at over eight railway stations last year, today it is today being deployed by corporates, including ITC, and is also being exported to Germany as well as Middle East and North Africa. Next on the radar is other countries in Europe and South-East Asia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyderabads-brightest-step-up-in-battle-against-virus/articleshow/82867911.cms||Preeti Biswas

The scheduled drug is used by many to get a high. SOG personnel were working on information about the sale of the injections to city youths. It had come to light that accused Vijay Panchal used to operate the racket under the guise of dealing in chocolates, sanitary pads and tea under the banner of Dev Enterprises. The injections are used as a painkiller and also along with anaesthesia at times. It is also used as a medication before surgeries. The drug is known to be used for substance abuse. It is known to have a series of side effects and, in some cases, these side effects can be serious in nature. Sleuths were keeping a watch on Panchal (42), a resident of Madanjhampa Road. On Friday night, Panchal was to deliver injections to one Suraj Patel (33) living in the Mother’s School area. Patel received seven vials from Panchal and was nabbed on the spot with the injections. Panchal was also found in possession of more 100 vials. He was taken to his residence and the house was searched from where 799 vials were seized. After Vijay’s residence, the police also raided the house of his younger brother Harish Panchal (37) in the Wadi area of the city. Ten empty strips out of which vials had been removed were found at his residence. SOG police inspector S G Solanki said that most who used to buy the injections were youngsters. He said that Patel had purchased the vials to use them. Solanki added that attempts were being made to ascertain the source of the drug. Sample of the accused were collected for Covid-19 tests. They would be put under arrest and questioned once the results of Covid test arrive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/racket-selling-painkiller-shots-to-young-people-busted/articleshow/82863164.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Users cite quick response to emergency requests||VIJAYAWADA: The second wave has seen social media establish itself across the state as a new support system for persons affected by Covid-19, with several groups on Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter serving as unofficial hotlines and resource centres. For instance, the Covid Help Vijayawada group on Facebook sees around 90 posts on average every day. Requests pour in from families and friends of patients looking for oxygen, hospital beds, plasma and even a cremation space. Volunteers are quick to post crucial information on hospitals that have oxygen beds and funeral support. “The response time is quite quick for any post. However, on the downside, it is important to remember that there are people who are looking to fleece for commercial gains desperate patients seeking medicines like Remdesivir or a hospital bed,” said Santhosh Panchu, who received assistance for his father, a Covid-19 patient. Each major city has in place its own social media support groups for Covid-19 patients, initiated by volunteers, doctors and IT professionals. The Vizag Covid Info group on Facebook, for example, is much more active, drawing more than 200 posts on a daily basis. It is on these groups that one can witness the ordeal faced by patients as they seek oxygen beds, drawing attention to a critical situation with ‘emergency’ and ‘urgent’ in the posts. “Despite my skepticism, the information from the group was surprisingly accurate when I sought a bed when my grandfather’s SPO levels dropped to 84 on the pulse oximeter. We managed to get him to the place just in the nick of time,” Swati Ravela, a techie in Vizag told STOI. Similar groups have also come up on Telegram, WhatsApp and Twitter. But while social media platforms have emerged as a boon for many, it has also brought with it its own set of problems for those who were fleeced for emergency needs. On the Tirupati Covid Support group in Twitter, a private ambulance service provided to a patient charged Rs 19,000 for transporting a Covid-19 victim’s body to the crematorium. In such situations, police suggest utilising social media judiciously and primarily seeking help from district Covid-19 control rooms that can offer reliable information.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/users-cite-quick-response-to-emergency-requests/articleshow/82866204.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti
---||Patna||Cyclone Yaas: Met issues yellow warning for rain, thunderstorm in Bihar||PATNA: Weather condition in eastern India, including Bihar, is expected to turn rainy in the next week under the influence of cyclone Yaas. The cyclone, which was in the form of a low- pressure area situated over east-central Bay of Bengal on Saturday, is likely to intensify into a very severe cyclonic storm by Tuesday and hit the eastern coast of the country, including Odisha and West Bengal on Wednesday. Patna Meteorological Centre has also issued yellow warning for thunderstorm with lightning at a few places in the state along with gusty wind on Tuesday and Wednesday (May 25 and 26). Rainfall with thunderstorm has been predicted at one or two places in northwest and northeast Bihar on Monday as well. Rainfall with thunderstorm is expected at many places across the state on Wednesday. Sanjay Kumar, a meteorologist at Patna Meteorological Centre, said cloud cover and rainfall are expected across Bihar on May 26 and 27. “The cyclone originated in the form of a low pressure area over east-central Bay of Bengal on Saturday. It is expected to gradually intensify into very severe cyclonic storm by May 25. While it will majorly impact Odisha and West Bengal, its induced effect is likely to impact weather conditions in Bihar as well. Rainfall and windy conditions are expected across the state on May 26 and 27,” he said. As per a special weather bulletin issued by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Saturday, the low pressure is very likely to turn into a depression over east-central Bay of Bengal by Sunday morning. Thereafter, it is very likely to move north-northwestwards and intensify into a ‘cyclonic storm’ by May 24 and further into a ‘very severe cyclonic storm’ during the subsequent 24 hours. Earlier, cyclone Taukate had stormed into western coast on May 17 as an extremely severe cyclonic storm and weakened as it moved on landmass. Though cyclone Tauktae did not have much influence over weather conditions in Bihar, overcast and rainy conditions were witnessed at many places in the state on May 20 and 21. Sanjay said cyclone Yaas would support the advancement of southwest monsoon in Bay of Bengal and further towards east India. The rain-bearing winds are expected to enter Bihar between June 15 and 18.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cyclone-yaas-met-issues-yellow-warning-for-rain-thunderstorm-in-bihar/articleshow/82866990.cms||Piyush Tripathi

Dr Bhadani, while addressing a virtual meeting organised by former additional solicitor general-cum-Patna high court senior counsel S D Sanjay especially for lawyers, said, “People should keep chapatis and other such items in the open. These things must be packed before being thrown into dustbins.” State health minister Mangal Pandey and BJP state president Sanjay Jaiswal also attended the virtual programme. Asked by the former ASG on what to do with the tsunami of remedies and knowledge doing rounds on social media by self-declared experts, Dr Bhadani said people should avoid contacting quacks and believing in social media pots when it comes to dealing with the pandemic.  “Contact a doctor for any suggestion or medication. Don’t make delay in approaching a medical expert,” he said. Dr Bhadani said those contracting Covid after receiving their first vaccine shot should take the second dose three months after recovery. “Diabetic patients should consume roughage or fibre with every meal as it decreases sudden rise in blood sugar,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/expert-keep-environment-dry-at-home/articleshow/82867190.cms||---

At present, at least 2,000 stranded labourers, sex workers and daily wage earners are getting their lunch and dinner cooked by cops. “A lot of people are stepping forward to help with ration. We plan to run these kitchens till the end of the enhanced restrictions,” said an officer. Burtolla police are running two programmes. “We are trying to feed around 800 people per day. While around 280 stranded daily labourers are provided lunch, the number almost doubles at night. We have opened our mess and appointed four cooks. A couple of police volunteers also help with cooking. We collected a healthy amount from within the police station too. I can continue to feed the stranded for the next two weeks,” said OC Debasis Datta, whose mother, wife and son have tested positive for Covid. The police station has joined hands with women and child welfare minister Shashi Panja to ensure meals for children of sex workers. Taltala police station is serving food to a sizeable population of migrant labourers, daily wage earners and child labourers. Initiated by deputy commissioner, central division, the officers and personnel prepare food packets daily by pooling resources and distributing them. Bhowanipore police have tied up with two NGOs — Manavjyot and Bit More Foundation — to feed the needy. “We had started this endeavour last year and wish to continue to provide food, masks and sanitizer to the needy throughout the period of restrictions,” said OC Sumit Das Gupta. Around 5,000 masks, 2,500 sanitizers and dry food have been distributed in the presence of Sumit Das Gupta,, Miraj Shah and Viresh Shah of Manavjyot and Kshitij Shah of Bit More Foundation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kol-police-restarts-kitchens-to-feed-the-needy-across-city/articleshow/82866409.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Vijayawada||Vijayawada Municipal Corporation sets up shelters as homeless run out of food, income||VIJAYAWADA: Homeless persons across the city will soon be shifted to shelter homes maintained by the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC). The civic body has already started accommodating the homeless in four shelters. Around 1,200 homeless persons take shelter at bus stops, dividers, footpaths, tunnels and underpasses in the city. Most of them eke out a living by begging or earn daily wages but lost their livelihood after the curfew came into force. With eateries across the city closed, food donated by voluntary organisations is the only way the homeless manage to get meals. So far, VMC authorities have shifted around 350 homeless to shelters and started distributing free food to those living on the streets. “We are committed to providing quality food and shelter to the homeless. Four night shelters are functioning and we are providing food there. But most of the homeless prefer footpaths as they are habituated to living there for years. We ensure no one sleeps hungry,” VMC commissioner Prasanna Venkatesh said. Organisations such as Mondem Helping Hands is providing 350 meals to the homeless at Prakasam Barrage, while Margam Trust is feeding 150 poor at Punnami Ghat and Maranatha Charitable Trust is feeding another 150 persons at the railway station, Venkatesh said. The Vijayawada Jain Samaj is also delivering food to the homeless sleeping on footpaths across the city. Meanwhile, the VMC plans to set up more shelters at multiple locations to ensure no homeless person suffers, said a senior official with the civic body.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/vmc-sets-up-shelters-as-homeless-run-out-of-food-income/articleshow/82866408.cms||Venu Lanka
---||Patna||Bihar: Tea garden owners rake in the moolah despite Covid||PATNA: Covid-19 may have adversely impacted several sectors, but Kishanganj-based tea farmers have a different story to narrate. The leaves plucked from farmlands are being sold at higher prices to industries for the last one year since the pandemic erupted. The owner of a 50-acre tea garden in Kishanganj, Ilyas Rahmani, claims that he has been getting anywhere between Rs 20 and Rs 40 per kg for the raw leaves since last year. Prior to that he would receive only Rs 15. Rahmani, who had entered the business two decades ago, says, “This is the best price I have got so far.” Another tea garden owner, Raj Karan Daftari, echoes similar views. “We have been selling raw tea leaves at higher prices to the industries. One of the reasons is their high demand,” he says, adding that the cost of processed tea leaves has also gone up from Rs 80 to Rs 150 per kg and Rs 300 to Rs 400 per kg. Asked about the Covid safety protocols being followed in the tea gardens, Daftari claims that the workers do not intermingle. “People, who work in the tea gardens, mainly belong to local tribes and hardly step outside as a result of which they have no contact with others,” he adds. On the other hand, Iqbal Ahmad, who owns a tea garden in Thakurganj block, is “creating awareness about Covid-appropriate behaviour among the workers” by ensuring that they cover their faces and follow social distancing norms. The exponential rise in the number of Covid-19 cases in the rural areas has become a matter of concern for them all.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tea-garden-owners-rake-in-the-moolah-despite-covid/articleshow/82866046.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Patna||As Covid cases dip in Bihar, experts seek extension of lockdown||PATNA: Favouring extension of the Covid-induced lockdown, several experts claim that the curbs imposed a fortnight back have controlled the rising graph of coronavirus cases and brought down the positivity rate. The situation has improved considerably with the number of positive cases declining from 14,836 on May 5 to 5,154 on Friday. The positivity rate dipped from 15.58% to 4.12% during the same period. Former president of the Indian Medical Association’s state unit, Dr Bimal Kumar Karak, attributes the “healthy development” to the lockdown. He says, “Lockdown alone can bring down the number of Covid cases considerably. It should, therefore, continue for at least a month.” Dr Karak advises the government to accelerate the vaccination drive in the meantime. “If all the people are vaccinated, Covid cases are likely to vanish soon,” he claims. Dr Punam Raman, a gynaecologist, echoes similar views. “The Covid positivity rate has dipped significantly after the lockdown, as a result of which it should be extended. If the cases continue to decline, the restrictions can be relaxed,” she says, adding that a large number of people from both urban and rural areas can be vaccinated during the lockdown in order to check the transmission further. Former superintendent of the Patna Medical College and Hospital, Dr Rajiv Ranjan Prasad, also claims that the chain of infections has been broken only due to the lockdown which should again be extended. He thanks the people for adopting Covid-appropriate behaviour and says, “If they cooperate with the authorities and do not step out of their houses unnecessarily, the situation will be normal soon.” Hailing the lockdown, paediatrician Dr Arun Shah points out, “The B.1.617 Covid variant can infect as many as 500 people in 30 days. Hence, the lockdown should not be lifted without significant reduction in the infection rate.” The principal of Government Ayurvedic College, Dr Dineshwar Prasad Singh, and former dean of Patna University’s social science faculty, Nawal Kishore Chaudhary, are also in favour of lockdown extension. “The lockdown, which has shown positive results by reducing the number of cases within a fortnight, must continue. Curbs should also be imposed strictly in villages where a large number of migrants have returned from other states,” Dr Dineshwar Prasad Singh says. Chaudhary, on the other hand, urges the government to “improve the state’s health infrastructure and get the maximum number of people vaccinated amid the lockdown”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/as-covid-cases-dip-in-bihar-experts-seek-extension-of-lockdown/articleshow/82866696.cms||B K Mishra

Consequently, all of them have to undergo a Covid test,” Danapur divisional railway manager (DRM) Sunil Kumar told this reporter, adding that the passengers testing positive were being isolated at a safe place by the health department. In close coordination with the health department and the district administrations concerned, the railways is carrying out Covid test at the Patna Junction, Rajendra Nagar Terminal, Danapur, Kiul, Jhajha, Ara and Buxar stations, all of which fall under Danapur division of the ECR. These are major points where a large number of passengers get off trains from Maharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi, Karnataka and Punjab every day. The DRM said, “With a view to checking the spread of Covid cases and safeguarding our frontline workers, we are making sure that social distancing norms are followed when passengers board or get off a train. People without face masks are also being penalised.” According to ECR’s chief public relations officer Rajesh Kumar, Covid detection centres have been put up at the Muzaffarpur, Bettiah, Darbhanga, Barauni, Samastipur, Saharsa and Katihar stations. Besides, thermal screening is mandatory for all passengers before they board a train. Sources claimed that hundreds of passengers were testing positive for Covid at different stations under the ECR every day. “Both the government and the railway staff are keeping a close watch on the condition of such passengers. They are being given proper medicines and taken care of,” the sources added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/covid-test-continues-to-be-compulsory-for-all-at-railway-stations/articleshow/82866144.cms||---

Police said Pawan unsuccessfully attempted to commit suicide by slitting his throat after arrest. The two incidents had remained under cover until police begun investigation on their own. One of the victims, a 16-year-old girl, had committed suicide by hanging herself at her house on May 18. As per police, she was raped by the two accused on May 16. “The two accused had also made a video clip of the rape and circulated it among the girl’s relatives, forcing the latter to commit suicide,” the police said. Police said family members of the girl cremated her body in a hurry fearing social stigma. “The brother of the first victim had lodged an FIR with police on May 22 against Pawan and Shoaib, alleging that they had raped her sister and cousin, recorded video of the act and circulated the same,” Gopalganj SP Anand Kumar said.

It is likely to be ready by next week and doctors of other branches who are involved in Covid-19 hospital duties will be trained accordingly. While doctors are not sure when, or if at all the third wave will come, the preparations are being done keeping in focus the government guidelines on children which suspects that infection rate may be higher among children in the third wave. “Our doctors are preparing a Covid treatment module for children. Based on the module we will train our doctors for paediatric patients,” said Dr Ragini Verma, superintendent, NCH, adding that it is being done as per government’s directives to stay prepared for the next wave. Along with the treatment module NCH authorities have set up a 100-bed paediatric ward in Covid-19 hospital at Kidney Hospital building. A team of doctors also did a deficit analysis of equipment and infrastructure required for the new ward. “We have ventilators for paediatric patients in our existing wards, but will need more for the new ward. Hence, we have submitted the requirements in advance,” Dr Verma added. With the gradual decline in number of active patients, NCH is closing wards in different buildings on its campus. “However, we are not removing any of the equipment from it. We will maintain the set-up so that we can start using it again in case of an emergency,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/nch-prepares-for-third-wave-with-module-for-kids/articleshow/82865186.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta
---||Delhi||Bats get spotlight in zoo webinar||New Delhi: Bats may be linked to Covid-19, but the capital’s bat species also play a key ecological role, experts said on Saturday, as part of a webinar organised by the Delhi Zoo on International Biological Diversity Day. The webinar titled ‘Bat Diversity of Delhi and their roles’ highlighted the importance of bats as natural controllers of the insect population, while also carrying out bat pollination for nearly 500 tropical plant species. While 14 bat species have been sighted in the city, six bat species have already been lost over time. Dr Sumit Dookia, assistant professor at University School of Environment Management, GGS Indraprastha University, New Delhi, said bats are often misunderstood and insectivorous bats able to eat up to 3,000 insects per night. “Bats’ bio-control globally is alone worth somewhere between $54 billion and $ 1trillion. In addition, over 500 tree and plant species depend on partial or complete bat pollination, which is an important ecological service,” Dookia said. The professor is also leading only the fourth major study on bats in Delhi, with past studies in 1962 (Brosset), 1997 (Sinha and Sati) and 2007 (Srinivasulu and Srinivasulu) identifying a total of 13 species that are found in Delhi or have been sighted in the past. In 2018, Dookia alongside Rajlakshmi Mishra added one more bat species to the list. Of the 14 species, only five are sighted regularly. Across the capital, locations such as Kotla Feroze Shah, Agrasen ki Baoli, Qutub Minar complex and Humayun’s tomb house bat species. Khirki, Wazirabad and Dwarka are other locations where bat sightings are often made. Ramesh Pandey, director, Delhi Zoo said, “Urban biodiversity is becoming important, keeping in view the increased urbanisation. Bats at present are an enigmatic species right now, especially post Covid-19 and therefore we wanted to highlight their role in today’s workshop,” Pandey said. On International Biological Diversity Day, experts say the continued decline in the global population of flora and fauna needs to be checked. Amit Banka, founder & CEO at Wenaturalists, a social network for environmental lovers, says there has been a 68% average decline in global populations of mammals, birds, fishes, amphibians and reptiles in the last 50 years. “The sheer loss of biodiversity, in large part due to human actions, is huge. It's time for us to take corrective steps. We have to be a part of the solution,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bats-get-spotlight-in-zoo-webinar/articleshow/82867908.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

---||Vijayawada||Doctors flag mental health issues during pandemic||Vijayawada: Fear of contracting Covid-19 is giving rise to health concerns such as stress, anxiety, insomnia and other psychological disorders, say psychiatrists. After a couple who had contracted the virus committed suicide, psychiatrists and psychologists have drawn attention to mental health issues that may develop out of a fear of Covid-19. While the second wave of the pandemic has seen the positivity rate touching 25 per cent, the scarcity of beds at hospitals has also added to stress among patients and their family members. Psychiatrists advise the need for counselling and guidance for family members to stay hopeful and reduce stress. “We are registering a huge number of cases of depression and anxiety. Most of these patients are family members of Covid-19 patients. Fear of contracting virus is haunting them, which is causing psychological problems. We are counselling them and prescribing necessary medicines,” said Dr K Vamsi Krishna, a psychiatrist from the city. “We have also seen suicidal tendencies in some people and such people should be treated immediately,” he added. In certain cases, psychiatrists identified severe disorders in patients who recovered from the Covid-19. Many complained of insomnia and expressed a hopelessness with their lives. The Krishna district administration, which provided a helpline in 2020 for psychiatric assistance, plans to launch a similar service that can provide free counseling and guidance for the patients. The Andhra Pradesh Psychologists’ Association has also announced that it will provide free counseling services over the phone. In the meantime, the district administration has also requested friends and families of Covid-19 patients to motivate and boost confidence levels in patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/docs-flag-mental-health-issues-during-pandemic/articleshow/82866245.cms||Venu Lanka

The isolation-cum-treatment facility is a collaboration of the Bihar circle of India Post and Aastha Charitable and Welfare Society. While the trust has tied up with the Bihar Jharkhand Association of North America (BJANA) and Pran Clinic (USA) for providing all the medical infrastructure required to meet the guidelines of the Indian Council of Medical Research, the non-medical support, including venue, logistics, furniture, food and water, are being managed by India Post. Anil Kumar, chief postmaster general of the Bihar circle of India Post, said, “We have 10 beds with 10 oxygen concentrators, several oxygen cylinders, ambulances, medicines as well as a 24-hour team of doctors and paramedics. Music system and television are also available here.” He added, “In future, if the demand falls, this facility will be converted into a post-Covid treatment centre.” Dr Uma Shankar Sinha, founder and secretary of AWCT, said, “We have also tied up with a private pathological laboratory. A patient only needs a positive RT-PCR report for getting admitted here.” Dr Chandan Chaudhary, posted in the Covid unit of the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, is also part of the team. “We have experienced doctors from the IGIMS and the AIIMS-Patna. In case, a patient needs critical intervention, he will be immediately transferred to the Covid-dedicated hospitals,” Dr Chaudhary said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/one-more-covid-care-centre-inaugurated-in-patna/articleshow/82867221.cms||---

While chairing a high-level meeting to review the performance of the energy department through video conferencing, the CM assured the officials that there would be no dearth of funds for the ongoing work of installation of prepaid smart meters. “You all should work to speed up the installation of smart meters,” he said. Nitish said the prepaid smart meter scheme was first launched in Bihar. Later, the Centre adopted it for implementation in other states. “The installation of prepaid smart meters in all households will not only provide convenience to the consumers but also stop the misuse of electricity in the state,” he said. “Union Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, while presenting the country’s Budget for FY 2021-22 in the Parliament in February this year, proposed to introduce the Bihar government’s prepaid smart meter scheme throughout the country. Then, Bihar CM had welcomed the Centre’s decision,” an energy department official told TOI on Saturday. A few months ago, the government-owned Energy Efficiency Services Ltd (EESL) entered into agreements with two power distribution companies of Bihar for the installation of 23.4 lakh prepaid smart meters in the state. Speaking at the review meeting, Nitish said his government completed the task of providing electricity connection to every household across the state in October 2018. People are getting an uninterrupted supply of power. “All people are requested to use the electricity for good purposes and don’t misuse it. The proper use of electricity is also in the interest of the environment,” Nitish said. He further asked the energy officials to work on a priority basis for providing electricity connection to farmers to supply water for irrigation to each farmland. The CM further asked the officials of the renewable energy agency to expedite the installation of the proposed two solar power plants at Kajra in Lakhisarai district and Pirpainti in Bhagalpur district. “With the beginning of generation from the two plants, there will be a sharp increase in the production of solar power in the state, which will be in the interest of the environment,” Nitish said. While reviewing the status of hydel power, Nitish said, “The multi-purpose Dagmara hydropower project was in its advanced stage, and the state would be benefited after the completion of this project.” Earlier, the state’s energy secretary Sanjeev Hans made a detailed presentation before the CM on the current status of different schemes of the department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-asks-officials-to-speed-up-installing-smart-meters-in-every-house/articleshow/82866979.cms||Madan Kumar

---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: Tipplers switch to toddy for imaginary immunity boost||VISAKHAPATNAM: The consumption of palm wine (todday) has increased in parts of Andhra Pradesh, with many falling prey to the belief that the drink can keep at bay and even cure Covid-19. Demand for fresh toddy, especially among students and youngsters, has seen a recent rise. Inseparable from the lives of many in the state, several youngsters are of the opinion that toddy, with its low alcohol content, is an ideal summer beverage. But amid the devastating effects of the second wave of Covid-19 in cities and rural areas of the state, the myth that consumption of fresh palm wine can guard against Covid-19 has taken hold. Many attribute to toddy immunity-boosting effects, alongside its benefits as a summer drink. “Youngsters and middle-aged people have been coming here for fresh toddy for the past few days. The naturally-brewed toddy remains the first choice among some youngsters and Covid-19 has pushed up toddy sales as people believe it can prevent the virus,” said M Prasad Rao, who taps and sells toddy near Bheemili in Vizag city. “The cost of toddy is also low compared to beer and liquor,” he added. Meanwhile, outlets selling toddy have been set up along the Beach Road and elsewhere along the NH-16 stretch in Vizag city. Toddy tappers say availability of the beverage will decrease after this month. “Normally I consume beer during summer but this time I have started to consume fresh toddy as my friend suggested it as the best immunity booster against the virus. The taste of toddy is really good and it brings much relief on a summer day,” said Viswanath K, a youngster. But while many strongly believe that toddy extracted from palm trees can cure several diseases, including cancer and now Covid-19, there is no scientific evidence to back up such claims. We can say that naturally extracted toddy from palm trees may have some medicinal value but it is not a medicine, clarified some medical experts. Traditionally, toddy tapping is a task that requires a certain degree of skill, as it involves climbing a palm tree thrice a day and collecting the extract from the top of the tree. “During summer, we can collect 10 to 15 litres from a palm tree in a day. On average, each toddy tapper sells around 60 to 70 litres of toddy, said P Kanaka, a toddy seller.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/tipplers-switch-to-toddy-for-imaginary-immunity-boost/articleshow/82866300.cms||Nalla.Babu
---||Patna||Bihar: Unicef bid to protect children from Covid||PATNA: The second wave of Covid has affected a large number of children in the state. Unlike in the first wave, the virus has also reached rural areas this time. According to a state government data released by Unicef, nearly 11% of infected people between mid-March and mid-May were those in the age group of 0-19 years. Health experts have apprehended that children would be affected in the third wave as well. According to Unicef, since anganwadi centres are closed, the nutrition status of children under two years of age, pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers has been compromised. Seeing the spread of Covid in the rural areas and also its impact on children in the second wave, Unicef is extending support to the state government in association with its three other partners by rolling out an awareness and community mobilisation initiative, christened ‘Surakshaagrah-Covid par halla bol’ in Muzaffarpur and Supaul this week. The Unicef has also planned to implement the initiative in Darbhanga, Madhubani, Purnia and Sitamarhi in the days to come. As part of this programme, over 600 ‘suraksha praharis’ or community mobilisers will create awareness on Covid and how one can protect oneself and others from the virus by following Covid-appropriate behaviour. “Rapid transmission of Covid-19 in rural areas is really worrisome. Almost 89% of Bihar lives in villages. More than 46% are children and adolescents, who are particularly vulnerable. Children are increasingly being infected. It is crucial that rural people, including children and youths, have the tools of correct information on how to protect themselves. Children’s safety and well-being is our top priority,” said Nafisa Binte Shafique, Unicef’s Bihar chief.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/unicef-bid-to-protect-children-from-covid/articleshow/82866948.cms||Sheezan Nezami

The Institute of Engineering and Management (IEM) and the University of Engineering and Management, Kolkata, have started waiving fees in case any of the parents has died. “We are sponsoring the entire fees for those who have lost their parents in this pandemic. We are doing this in case of both earning and nonearning parent who has died in the pandemic,” Satyajit Chakrabarti, director of both the institutions, told TOI. “Some hospitals are charging more than Rs 25 lakh. So we are helping these students who are already devastated because of the loss and are financially poorer after the loss,” he said. Fr Dominic Savio, principal of St Xavier’s College, said,: “For the last three semesters, we have been waiving the fees of those who have lost their parents and those who are not unable to pay for various reasons. Anyone whose parents has passed away due to Covid, we are ready to sponsor. The college will continue to do it with the support of the benefactors and our alumni.” Miraj Shah, senior vicepresident, Bhawanipur Education Society, which has also made similar allowances, said: “There are various ways society can help the Covid-affected families. This is just one of them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/help-for-students-who-lost-parents/articleshow/82866441.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
---||Nagpur||Covid-19: Asymptomatic positive kids may infect elderly family members, say experts||NAGPUR: The anticipated third wave may primarily involve the paediatric population, as per the current projections. This can also put at risk the elderly people whose immunity levels are lower than others. According to experts, asymptomatic minors, who are often referred as ‘Covid butterflies’, can be silent spreaders at home and neighbourhood. They can infect everyone, especially the elderly family members, while they move around meeting their acquaintances. Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, vice-president of the Academy of Paediatrics, said children are asymptomatic carriers or Covid butterflies who spread the virus without being noticed. “The children many times forget to cover their nose and mouth while coughing or sneezing because of which the droplets can spread quite far,” he said. “Most of the times the children are asymptomatic while many times parents too ignore their symptoms. They are loved, cuddled and hugged too leading to the spread of infection, especially among the elderly members of the family,” said Dr Deshmukh. Well-known paediatrician Dr Jhunjhunwala, member of the Paediatric Covid Task Force, said the viral load among children is more as compared to adult patients. “The children are mostly asymptomatic and hence the virus remains undetected most of the times. Next, their higher immunity level does not allow the symptoms to manifest easily but the disease remains transmissible,” said Dr Jhunjhunwala. “On the contrary, the immunity is quite low among elders with whom the minors spend time at home when the parents are out for work,” said Dr Jhunjhunwala. Dr Jhunjhunwala also said the parents, even if they test positive, should keep their children with them and take due precautions and care following Covid protocols instead of sending them to grandparents. “Let the vaccination of minors become successful. The parents and others should also vaccinate themselves so that they do not turn as spreaders at home,” he said. Another member of district-level Paediatric Covid Task Force, Dr Sanjay Khapekar, said children have less ACE-2 receptors in the nasal cavity which increase the virus but they can silently spread the disease as most of them do not develop symptoms. “The children can act as carriers and infect elderly members of the family,” he said. Dr Khapekar suggested parents should not avoid taking their children for testing. “Get the children or adolescents tested and isolate them if they are found positive,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/asymptomatic-ve-kids-may-infect-elderly-family-members-experts/articleshow/82867953.cms||Soumitra Bose

While chairing a high-level meeting to review the progress of different mega bridge projects via videoconferencing, the CM also asked the officials to complete the construction of the remaining 650-metre-long approach road to the Munger Ghat rail-cum-road bridge. “The foundation stone for the Munger Ghat rail-cum-road bridge was laid in 2003 by the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee at my request. The bridge is ready, but a 650-metre-long portion of its approach road is yet to be constructed. Complete this small part as early as possible,” Nitish told the officials. “The construction work on the Bakhtiarpur-Tajpur mega road bridge over the Ganga has been obstructed due to some contractual disputes. While reviewing the project, the CM asked chief secretary Tripurari Sharan to take necessary steps to resolve them,” RCD’s additional chief secretary Amrit Lal Meena told TOI on Saturday. Meena said the CM also reviewed the progress in construction of other mega bridges like Kachchi Dargah-Bidupur bridge over the Ganga, Anta Ghat-Simaria bridge parallel to the existing Rajendra bridge near Mokama, the four-lane road bridge parallel to Mahatma Gandhi Setu in Patna, Manihari-Sahebganj bridge and renovation of the old bridge near Buxar. Nitish also made inquiries about the progress made in the proposed construction of a six-lane road bridge over the Ganga from Sherpur (Maner) to Dighwara (Saran), a new bridge from Matihani (Begusarai) to Sambho and the rail-cum-road bridge from Vikramshila to Katoria in Bhagalpur district. “The proposed Sherpur-Dighwara bridge will be part of the Patna ring road,” Meena said. At the review meeting, Nitish also said several roads and bridges in the state were being constructed by the Centre. “The RCD should expedite necessary works for construction of a four-lane road bridge parallel to the J P Setu near Digha in Patna district,” the CM said. Nitish further said the maintenance works of different roads should be executed by the RCD engineers. He asked them to play a key role in the maintenance of roads. “This will lead to reduction in expenditure,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/expedite-construction-of-nine-mega-bridges-over-ganga-nitish/articleshow/82867039.cms||Madan Kumar

---||Jaipur||Extend lockdown by another 15 days, ministers tell Rajasthan CM||JAIPUR: The meeting of the state council of ministers held here on Saturday evening suggested extension of the lockdown for another 15 days from May 24 to break the chain of Covid infection. Participants of the meeting noted that despite some reduction in cases, infection rate was more than 15% in the state and death rate even higher. So it was important to continue with the lockdown to consolidate the gains in controlling transmission, they observed. The ministers were told by medical experts that the threat of the second wave had not been fully brought under control and hospitals and medical resources were still facing pressure from patients. Experiences of other countries suggested that there was not much of a difference between the second and third wave and in such a case, it would be appropriate to continue lockdown for some more time. Experts recommended that negligence in enforcing Covid protocol for a longer period after the first wave had proved costly and therefore strict curbs were necessary for some more time. Considering the advice of the experts, the council of ministers suggested that lockdown should continue for a few more days, it was informed. The meeting expressed concern on the shortage of Covid vaccines because of supply bottlenecks from the Centre. Members said because of this, the pace of vaccination drives had slowed across the state, which would ultimately weaken the efforts towards effective prevention of infection and considerable difficulty in countering the third wave. The council of ministers strongly put the demand for adequate supply of vaccines from the Centre. Expressing concern over black fungus epidemic, the attendees said necessary steps should be taken for its treatment and control. It was also suggested at the meeting that all ministers should visit the districts under their charge in the next few days to take stock of the situation of infection and medical facilities there. It was decided that another meeting of the ministers would be held shortly to chalk out further strategy. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot said the state government was also contemplating a comprehensive social security policy for families whose earning members have died or children become orphans due to infection. The meeting emphasised on the need for enforcement of Covid protocol more effectively for breaking the chain of infection, identifying patients with influenza like illness (ILI) symptoms, medical kit distribution, screening, home isolation and regular monitoring of treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/extend-lockdown-by-another15-days-ministers-tell-gehlot/articleshow/82867931.cms||---

---||India||70% of Sputnik V output may soon be from India||NEW DELHI: As the Indian ambassador to Russia, DB Venkatesh Varma, announced Saturday that local production of the Sputnik V vaccine will begin in August, diplomatic sources here said the 2 countries were looking at manufacturing anywhere between 35 to 40 million doses every month starting August-September. Elaborating on the remarks by the ambassador, sources said Russia will also send close to 18 million Sputnik doses - 3 million in May, 5 million next month and 10 million in July - before allowing transfer of technology in August for local production. Overall, according to the ambassador, the agreement between Dr Reddy's and Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) will facilitate manufacturing of 850 million doses of Sputnik vaccine in India. "More than 65-70 percent of the Sputnik vaccine produced anywhere in the world will be from India," said Varma in an interaction with local journalists during a visit to St Petersburg. He said Russian side had also proposed Sputnik Light, a single-shot vaccine. "The regulatory approvals for that in India are still not completed. But once those regulatory approvals are given, then Sputnik Light will be one more area of cooperation between India and Russia," he said. Of the scheduled delivery of 3 million doses in May, Russia has so far provided 210,000 doses in 2 separate consignments. According to sources, Russia is hoping to account for some of its vaccine commitments to other countries with large-scale production in India once the situation eases here. The double-dose Sputnik vaccine has so far been approved by 65 countries. With an efficacy of 97.6%, the vaccine is expected to play a major role in expediting India's vaccination programme. According to RDIF, the efficacy is based on the analysis of data on the coronavirus infection rate among those in Russia vaccinated with both components of Sputnik V from December 5, 2020 to March 31, 2021. Efficacy of Sputnik Light is said to be 79.4 percent, based on the analysis of data on the coronavirus infection rate among those in Russia who were vaccinated with the single dose vaccine from December 5, 2020 to April 15, 2021. According to TASS news agency, India is also working to provide Russia sample of the Indian variant of Covid-19 that originated in India for research. "The request has been received by the Indian side. Indian authorities are working on that," Varma was quoted as saying.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/70-of-sputnik-v-output-may-soon-be-from-india/articleshow/82871640.cms||Sachin Parashar

Though the top posts in the public service commission were filled after the High Court took a serious view over the vacancies, aspirants are optimistic that CM KCR will reward party loyalists with nominated posts as all direct elections to Assembly and municipal seats are completed. There are several vacancies in various corporations and commissions in the state. Backward Classes Commission chairman B S Ramulu along with its four members had demitted the office nearly two years ago. However, a full-time body has not been appointed so far. Ramulu and two of the members—J Gowrishankar and V Krishna Mohan Rao—are among the front runners for the top post in the BC Commission again. Aspirants are lobbying for nominated posts in Most Backward Classes Corporation, Breweries Corporation and Telangana State Road Transport Corporation. Even the Telangana State Information Commission is functioning with Buddha Murali holding full additional charge of the chief information commissioner post. The talk in the ruling party circles is that all these days the chief minister was busy with elections. Though he made a couple of appointments of nominated posts such as filling up vacancies to the top nominated posts in State Women’s Commission, he could not concentrate on the 20-dd corporations, commissions and other bodies where nominated posts need to be filled up. “With no other elections to come except Huzurabad Assembly constituency by-poll that too if sitting MLA Eatala Rajender resigns, hopes are among the party leaders of getting nominated posts,” said a senior leader in the TRS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/with-vacancies-getting-filled-loyalists-up-lobbying-game/articleshow/82868013.cms||Roushan Ali

The message said it is risky and illogical for the families of frontline warriors such as police constables, hawaldars and assistant sub-inspectors to be evicted from their building during the pandemic without being given alternative quarters. The message stated that cops work under tremendous pressure during the pandemic and such a notice has further increased their stress. They have requested that the evacuation order be stayed and sought time to find suitable government quarters. It stated earlier all families were assured by the joint commissioner of police, administration, that those living in dilapidated building will be shifted to newly constructed Kole Kalina quarters. DCP Chaitanya S, who is city police’s spokesman, said, “These two buildings have been declared as dilapidated by PWD. The quarters at Kole Kalyan are for officers. All the policemen are offered alternate accommodation which they are refusing and the reasons for refusal are not known. Hence, this situation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-25-cops-told-to-leave-quarters-in-pandemic-says-viral-post/articleshow/82864695.cms||---

She was on maternity leave when she was transferred, but the leave was not given at her new posting. The single bench of Justice SP Sharma issued the notice on a petition by Manisha Sharma. Anood Dhand, counsel for the petitioner, said the petitioner was selected at serial No. 3,707 for appointment to the post of nurse Gr. II after securing 64.951 while the cut-off marks for the category of general(female) was 57.869. The appointment order was issued on April 28, 2020 and the petitioner was directed to join SMS Medical College in Jaipur within seven days. The petitioner joined her services on May 2, 2020. The petitioner, who was pregnant, gave birth to a child on February 9, 2021 and applied for 180 days maternity leave from February 9, which was accepted. In the meanwhile, respondents revised the merit list and this time the cut-off marks of general female was increased to 67.089 and the name of the petitioner was in the waiting list. On February 18, 2021, a reserve /waiting list was issued and the petitioner was selected again and she was directed to join at chief medical & health office in Alwar. On joining, CMHO, Alwar, directed the petitioner to join at CHC at Mala Kheda. On March 1, the petitioner requested the medical officer at CHC, Mala Kheda, to allow her to continue on maternity leave as her child was only two months old. CHC Mala Kheda sought directions from higher officials for allowing the petitioner to remain on maternity leave. But till date no orders have been passed by the director, medical and health. The petitioner then applied for grant of two months ‘child care leave’ but that also got no favourable response forcing her to approach the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/hc-notice-for-not-giving-maternity-leave-to-nurse/articleshow/82867989.cms||---

Kamal Kishore Singhal, who is admitted to AIIMS-Jodhpur for treatment of the deadly fungus, sought help from Sonu Sood for 10 vials of Amphotericin B and social media turned out to be the life saver. Associates of the philanthropic actor from Jodhpur, Hitesh Jain and Rajveer, were asked by Sood to collect the consignment of vials from Delhi airport. “We left by road at 8.30 pm on Friday for Delhi, collected the vials from the airport and returned by 10am on Saturday,” said Hitesh, who handed over the packet of 10 vials to Singhal’s family at AIIMS an hour later. Jain said 12 more vials had been sent by Sood for Kamljeet Kaur in Sri Ganganagar, which also was collected by him and handed over to the patient 3 days ago. Shortage of Amphotericin B vial has become a cause of concern for patients in AIIMS, where about 65 patients of black fungus are under treatment and about 50 have undergone surgery. HoD (ENT) at AIIMS Amit Goyal said there was acute shortage of the vials and they are trying their best to arrange it from every possible source. But in most of the cases, AIIMS has been prescribing the vial to patients asking them to arrange from outside but at the same time claiming that it was being made available as per need. On the other hand, superintendent of MDM Hospital MK Aseri said they have no shortage of Amphotericin B vials in the hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/patients-take-to-social-media-for-mucormycosis-drugs-sood-helps/articleshow/82868016.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Cyclone Yaas: West Bengal government ready special teams, control rooms||KOLKATA: Taking a cue from the devastating effects of cyclone Amphan that had hit Bengal exactly a year ago, the state government, civic agencies and police are chalking out plans to combat the effects of Yaas, which is predicted to make a landfall on the morning of May 26. Kolkata Police plans to deploy 22 teams of disaster management groups (DMG)s to clear trees from roads and power lines in case they are uprooted. Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) and Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) have also set up teams of trained personnel from essential services department to carry out emergency repair and restoration work. All the government agencies would coordinate in every possible way to combat the effects of the cyclone, said an offical at Nabanna. Each DMG team will comprise five personnel, all trained in handling disaster. Police stations have been asked to hire temporary tree-cutters, especially those who played a crucial role post-Amphan to clear their wards a year ago. KMC has also formed borough-wise teams to cut and remove uprooted trees from thoroughfares. Taking a lesson from last time, the civic body has decided to equip its team with hydraulic ladders so that they can cut and remove full-grown trees that might lean against apartments, endangering the lives of the residents. The civic brass have instructed the drainage department officials to keep all heavy-duty pumps ready at pumping stations to flush out stormwater from flooded streets. This apart, a special control room at the KMC headquarters will function 24×7 so that essential services to citizens are not interrupted. A special disaster management team will be stationed at the headquarters. The civic body may set up shelters for residents of low-lying areas, especially areas in the port division and off EM Bypass, which might go under water if it pours heavily. CESC, too, will deploy two repair teams of seven to eight men in each ward, or 288 teams across Kolkata, to carry out repair and restoration should power lines be snapped in the storm. To prevent electrocution, power might be temporarily disconnected if high velocity winds struck the city, an official said. During Amphan, five persons had been electrocuted in Behala. Both KMC and BMC have formed quick response teams for every ward, each comprising trained civic officials and workers from essential departments. The BMC is also opening a control room at its head office. Kolkata Police is also roping in a team of HAM radio operators from the West Bengal Radio Club (Amateur Club) to assist the police’s disaster management team in relief and rescue work as it might be required in areas, where mobile network might not work. KMDA is conducting checks on flyovers and bridges to avert any disaster.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-agencies-ready-spl-teams-control-rooms/articleshow/82866639.cms||Saikat Ray

---||Hyderabad||High court bench stays DRI’s notice against city jewellers||Hyderabad: Stating that the Union finance ministry itself is waiting for some clarity on a proper officer for issuing show-cause notices to alleged violators of norms related to import and export of gold and jewellery, the high court has stayed show-cause notice issued by the additional director general of Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) to PH Jewels, Abids. A bench of Justice MS Ramachandra Rao and Justice T Vinod Kumar gave this interim order after hearing a petition filed by Sanjay Agarwal of PH Jewels, who had questioned the show-cause notice issued to them. DRI claimed the firm had bought imported gold from authorised importers for making jewellery and export them. Instead of exporting it to foreign shores, the firm sold it in the local market, which was a violation of the norm, the DRI notice said. The firm, however, said it need not pay customs duty as per norms as it was imported as duty-free gold bullion. “However, since the banks were insisting on us to pay this, we paid the same under protest. So, the Centre has not suffered any loss in our case,” PH Jewels counsel Vedula Srinivas said. He raised a technical objection on the show-cause notice issued by the additional DG, DRI. The notice should be given by only those who cleared the import of duty-free gold, the counsel said, citing the recent judgment of the Supreme Court in Canon Indias digital cameras import case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/high-court-bench-stays-dris-notice-against-city-jewellers/articleshow/82868023.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Elected reps caught in Eatala-Gangula joust||Hyderabad: Elected representatives from Huzurabad assembly constituency are on the horns of a dilemma — whether to join hands with former minister Eatala Rajender or sail with the ruling TRS. Some are playing safe by staying neutral. Veenavanka mandal praja parishad (MPP) president M Renuka and her husband Tirupathi Reddy met Karimnagar MLA and district incharage minister Gangula Kamalakar and assured him of their support to the TRS on May 16. Within two days, the couple met Eatala and said they are ready to sail with him. Renuka was not alone. Many local representatives like sarpanches, MPTCs and ZPTCs and councillors of Huzurabad and Jammikunta municipalities and other leaders holding nominated posts such as market committee chairmen are shifting camps and issuing statements on their support either to Eatala or to the ruling party. “Elections to the local bodies were held last year and we will be in power for four more years. We require the government’s support for taking up developmental works in our villages,” a sarpanch of Huzurabad mandal said. Soon after dismissal from the cabinet, Eatala has been meeting his supporters and constituency leaders seeking their support.  The TRS leadership on the other hand asked Kamalakar to speak to the local leaders and elected representatives and ensure that no leader crosses over to Eatala camp.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/elected-reps-caught-in-eatala-gangula-joust/articleshow/82868053.cms||Koride Mahesh

The accused Kavila Lucy, who hails from Mizoram, and four of her colleagues Anirudh Sangar, Meena Adarai, Parmoya Adarai and Vijay Vishwakarma reached the hospital following a brawl among themselves in which they suffered injuries. Police said that the five had gathered at a spa on University road where the fight took place. During interrogation, police learnt that there was an argument between Sangar and Meena over their wedding which escalated into a full-blown fight wherein they hit each other with glass bottles. Vishwakarma sustained serious injuries while others had suffered minor ones. At the hospital, Lucy created a ruckus and hit a ward boy. As she was getting out of control, hospital staff tied her to a railing of the staircase. Even after being tied up, she kept shouting. Eye-witnesses shot videos of Lucy’s drama and later widely circulated it on social media.Even before police had reached the hospital, Sangar, Meena, Parmoya and Vishwakarma had decided to not lodge complaint against each other. When cops reached the hospital, only Vishwakarma, who was undergoing treatment, and Lucy were present at the hospital while the other two had left the scene. As Vishwakarma refused to lodge a formal complaint, Lucy was booked under prohibition law by the Gandhigram police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/drunk-spa-employee-booked-for-creating-ruckus-at-civil-hospital/articleshow/82866678.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Men in khaki rain blows, seize vehicles for lockdown violations after CM’s snub||Hyderabad: Taking chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao’s snub seriously, Telangana police went on an overdrive during lockdown enforcement on Saturday. The men in khaki did not even spare medical, electricity staff, both exempted from lockdown curbs, and seized vehicles of food delivery executives, people heading for vaccination shots and those supplying oxygen concentrators.  However, police brass claimed they are going after people “misuing lockdown exemptions”. Till last reports came in, police of the three city commissionerates had seized 8,359 vehicles for lockdown violations and registered over 9,000 cases. People delivering food to senior citizens, oxygen concentrators or heading for blood donation were slapped challans of Rs 1,000 under Disaster Management Act. After the chief minister’s remarks during a video conference with senior bureaucrats and police brass on Friday about lockdown not being enforced properly, policemen stopped, caned workers of even essential services and seized hundreds of vehicles on Saturday. The CM’s snub had a profound effect that even director-general of police (DGP) M Mahendar Reddy personally supervised the lockdown enforcement at various places in the city and gave instructions to commissioners. Though Hyderabad police commissioner Anjani Kumar had warned law violators on Friday night itself about strict implementation of lockdown, no one expected police to seize vehicles of food delivery executives. At several places, executives of Swiggy and Zomato were caned when they tried to reason with policemen. In one video, which went viral on social media, a youngster wearing a Zomato T-shirt was caned right in front of Cyberabad police chief VC Sajjanar. “Police have stopped us even after we explained to them that we are going to donate blood for Thalessemia patients. They took away my bike key and broke the key chain when we showed them the blood donor card and ID card. They hurled abuses at us and said that they would have thrashed us if there were no CCTV cameras in the area....,” K Balaraju, a donor who was stopped near Langar Houz, said. Medical and health department officials complained to police about their staff being stopped for over an hour despite explaining that they were going for work at Habsiguda and another place in the Old City. However, the Hyderabad police chief said, “There is no question of stopping anyone or anything related to medical and health departments. We are alert and sensitive on this important issue.” At Mehdipatnam, scores of two-wheelers belonging to food delivery executives were seized between 10 am and 2pm. “We observed that some people have been misusing the exemption given to food delivery executives during lockdown. Using old ID cards and wearing T-shirts of food delivery companies, some people were roaming on the streets. Vehicles of such people were seized and cases were booked. We have allowed genuine employees of food delivery companies to travel after verifying their credentials,” Hyderabad police commissioner Anjani Kumar told TOI. “Traffic flow is like a normal day on SP Road. People are coming out with old medical records or lame excuses — attend a marriage, death ceremony or purchase medicines. Some people claim they are returning home from work. We are screening vehicles of potential lockdown violators at HPS, Begumpet, to prevent traffic jam on the main road. Over 500 vehicles have been seized and kept at HPS parking lot,” a Begumpet police station officer said. Earlier in the day, talking to the media, the DGP said: “Ëntry and exit points of all major towns and cities will be closed during lockdown period for normal traffic. Similarly, to control the movement of goods vehicles during lockdown period, traffic police have issued advisory permitting loading and unloading activities only between 9 pm and 8 am.” “All vehicles without permission will be seized and vehicles seized for lockdown rules violation will only be released after the end of lockdown. Shop owners should not allow customers after 9:30am and shut their businesses by 10am. Company managements should try and plan their employee work hours in accordance with lockdown timings,” the DGP added. Rachakonda CP Mahesh Bhagwat said that from Sunday onwards, employees going for work should travel between home to work and vice versa between 6am and 9am and 8pm and 10pm. “If any employee travels between 10am and 8pm except those who are exempted, their vehicles will be seized and cases will be booked,” Bhagwat added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/men-in-khaki-rain-blows-seize-vehicles-for-lockdown-violations-after-cms-snub/articleshow/82866703.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The helpline for the service became operational on Friday, and would work from 9am to 8pm on all working days. The free consultation service is being provided under the guidance of the senior psychiatrist and director of Deva Mental Healthcare Dr. Venu Gopal Jhawar. According to him, though it is normal to feel anxious and stressed during the Covid-19 pandemic, it has created new barriers for people already suffering from mental illness. “Many people have reported symptoms of anxiety or depressive disorder. A number of adults reported specific negative impacts on their mental health and well-being, such as difficulty sleeping or eating, worsening chronic conditions due to worry and stress over the coronavirus. Owing to the pandemic, many people are experiencing situations like job loss,” he added. He said that the situation is yet to become normal after March 2020. Everyone is feeling the heat of the pandemic, and the frontline service providers are undergoing intense stress. The Covid-19 has impacted people of all classes. “The pandemic and lockdown has brought about a sense of fear and anxiety,” he said adding this phenomenon has led to short term as well as long term psychosocial and mental health implications for the people including children and adolescents. “The quality and magnitude of impact on minors is determined by many vulnerability factors like developmental age, educational status, pre-existing mental health condition, being economically underprivileged or being quarantined due to infection or fear of infection,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/free-expert-help-on-cards-to-fight-pandemic-anxiety-fears/articleshow/82868417.cms||---
---||Dehradun||476 unreported Covid deaths added in 9 days in Uttarakhand||DEHRADUN: A total of 476 Covid-19 deaths, which took place between April 10 and May 10, were reported by the hospitals to the state Covid control room in just the past nine days. In fact, among the 134 Covid-related casualties recorded in the state on Saturday, 70 were previously unreported Covid-related deaths. Taking note of the delay in reporting of Covid deaths, secretary (health) Amit Negi said that the hospitals which don’t report deaths on time will be booked under Uttarakhand Epidemic Disease Covid-19 Regulation, 2020. The maximum number of these deaths have been reported from medical facilities in Haridwar and Udham Singh Nagar. Notably, the delayed-reporting of Covid-related fatalities by hospitals has pushed Uttarakhand’s death rate to 1.85%, 0.73% more than the national average (1.12%). According to the data shared by the state’s Covid-19 control room, 65 fatalities — which took place between April 10 and May 10 — were reported by the Covid Care Centre (CCC) at Haridwar-based Baba Burfani Hospital on May 14 and since then, the CCC has been reporting backlog deaths every day. “We recorded 25 backlog Covid deaths from Raipur Covid-19 care centre on May 15, followed by 28 such fatalities reported by Military Hospital in Roorkee on May 16. On May 17, we logged in 89 such cases, 65 of which were reported from Jawaharlal Nehru District Hospital in Udham Singh Nagar. Similarly, on May 18, the Himalayan Hospital in Dehradun notified 19 such deaths and on May 19, 17 medical facilities across the state told us of 80 backlog fatalities,” said a senior official from Covid-19 control room. The official added that 70 backlog deaths — that took place between April 10 and May 10 — were reported on May 20. Among these, 27 deaths were reported from SR Medicity Hospital in Haridwar and 19 from Central Hospital in Nainital. “The state recorded 40 and 60 backlog deaths on May 21 and 22 respectively,” the official said. Commenting on the late intimation of Covid-related deaths, Anoop Nautiyal, founder of Social Development for Communities Foundation, an organisation closely tracking the Covid-19 scenario in Uttarakhand since its outbreak, said, “The fact that many government hospitals are unable to report deaths on time in Uttarakhand is a classic example of an administrative collapse. This is indicative of a systemic rot. We need to make serious and sustained efforts to change this.” He added that among the total 5,734 Covid-19 deaths recorded in the state so far (from March 2020 to May 22, 2021), as many as 3,045 fatalities have been reported only in May this year. “The average per-day Covid-19 toll has remained above 100 in May so far. It is high time that the government takes strict action against those medical facilities which continue to report backlog Covid-19 deaths,” Nautiyal added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/476-previously-unreported-covid-deaths-recorded-in-ukhand-in-last-9-days/articleshow/82864765.cms||Ishita Mishra

---||Hyderabad||State BJP divided on Eatala||Hyderabad: The BJP state unit is a divided house when it comes to taking on the TRS in connection with former minister Eatala Rajender’s land grabbing allegations. Some leaders in the saffron party feel that the party has not been aggressive enough in cornering CM K Chandrasekhar Rao and TRS in targeting only Eatala and leaving out others when there are allegations of land grabbing by others too. A senior leader said the BJP’s not-so aggressive stand till date has the potential to harm the interests of the party in Telangana. “Though there is no serious caste war in BJP ranks, the issue of Eatala Rajender has the potential to project BJP in a poor light on caste angle. Also, there is a talk in political circles that some leaders are trying to poach or lure Eatala into saffron party’s ranks. All these do not augur well for the party which is known to have zero tolerance against corruption,” said the senior leader. However, there is another section of leaders who are not willing to buy the argument stating that BJP state president Bandi Sanjay has been aggressive enough in attacking the ruling TRS on the issue. Sanjay has also demanded a judicial inquiry against assigned land encroachment in the state against all those involved, they said. Meanwhile, BJP state chief spokesperson Krishna Saagar Rao said theirs is a national party and never indulges in caste politics.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/state-bjp-divided-on-eatala/articleshow/82868062.cms||Roushan Ali

---||Kanpur||UP CM Yogi Adityanath directs officials to set up 100-bed children’s hospital, black fungus facility||KANPUR: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath said here on Saturday that the state government aim is to prepare for the third wave of Covid-19 pandemic even while battling the second one. He also directed the officials to develop a separate facility in the district for the treatment of mucormycosis or black fungus cases in view of the surge in the number of patients. The CM, who took stock of the pandemic situation at a meeting with top officials at the KDA Auditorium, instructed them to develop Nagar Nigam’s Chacha Nehru Hospital for children. “Equip it with 100 beds and provide it with all modern medical equipment soon,” he directed the officials. As per experts, the third wave which is likely to hit the country later this year, if not tackled properly, is expected to hit children most. To recall, Kanpur Nagar mayor Pramila Pandey had on Friday last proposed to set up a Covid hospital for children at Chacha Nehru Hospital located in the Koperganj area of the city. Similarly, in order to tackle the spread of mucormycosis (black fungus), the CM asked the officials to develop a separate black fungus centre in the district. He also directed the divisional commissioner to set up 30 oxygen plants across the division. Yogi also praised the local representatives for allocating funds from MLALAD for establishing an oxygen plant in the region. While holding a review meeting with district magistrates of the five districts of the division, including Kanpur (Nagar), Kanpur Dehat, Auraiya, Kannauj and Farrukhabad, the CM said, “Every medical college should be equipped with 100-ICU paediatric beds, 100 bed for neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) with oxygen. Besides, 20-25 NICU beds should come up immediately in each district hospital of the division.” “CSC (Common Service Centre) in rural regions should also be developed soon,” the CM added. He also expressed displeasure with Ganesh Shankar Medical College authorities over the reservation of Covid beds at their institute. Sources informed TOI that the CM reprimanded GSVM authorities for allocating only 350 beds for the Covid patients at the institute which houses 1,700 beds. Similarly, the CM expressed his annoyance with the district officials of Kanpur Dehat and Farrukhabad for not replacing defunct ventilators from the government institutions. Yogi said, “The state government aims to control the second wave of the pandemic by May 30, and urged the citizens to adhere to Covid-appropriate behaviour in order to achieve that target.” For the vaccination of disabled, senior citizens, women and farmers, the government will also set up special centres for them, he said. He also said that the state government will invoke the provisions of the stringent National Security Act (NSA) and confiscating property of people involved in black-marketing of Covid medicines, besides oxygen and medical machines. “I have instructed administration and police to act tough against those who are black-marketing Covid-19 medicines and invoke NSA and confiscate their property and send them to jail,” said CM further.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/cm-directs-officials-to-set-up-100-bedchildrens-hospital-black-fungus-facility/articleshow/82867032.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

All precautionary measures will be taken on Tuesday night. But it will be business as usual till hours before the cyclone. On Monday, the airport Met office will brief us on how severe the cyclone will be and whether it will be heading towards Kolkata or not. The status will be updated on Tuesday, when we will review various factors to decide whether to suspend operations when the cyclone rages,” airport director Pulla Hezekiah said. “Airlines were concerned about damage to aircraft from flying objects. We have asked everyone to ensure all equipment used in the operational area are secured so that they do not become projectiles. All equipment will be gathered together, chained and covered.” Airlines have been asked to properly moor planes. Use of aerobridges may be suspended closer to the cyclone as they will have to be tied down securely to prevent getting blown away. A part of the hangar that had collapsed in Amphan a year ago has been removed but another segment remains due to insurance claim issues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/airport-to-take-shutdown-decision-after-tues-review/articleshow/82866681.cms||Subhro Niyogi

In this connection, the Union government has advised the state to review their preparedness for infection prevention and control, as well as hygiene and sanitation in hospitals. Since immunocompromised patients are at risk of getting mucormycosis, the Centre told the state that meticulous adherence to infection prevention and control while managing immunocompromised and Covid patients on steroid treatment, especially with co-morbidities (such as diabetes where good glycemic control needs to be established). The Centre has alarmed states and UTs on it. Directions have been issued to ensure that there are robust infection prevention and control practices in Covid hospitals and other healthcare facilities. Standard precautions are to be applied all across the hospital and health facility. Also, transmission-based precautions need heightened focus on droplet, airborne and contact precautions from the perspective of protecting healthcare workers and ensuring patient safety, says, the directions.  The Centre has also suggested to improve the environment in hospitals. Ventilation with focus on fresh air and natural ventilation wherever control systems with requisite air changes are not available. Cleaning, disinfection and sanitation of the hospital environment and frequently touched surfaces, with recommended disinfectants like 1% sodium hypochlorite or 70% alcohol.

The victim Bharat Vaghela (52) was on his way to his home in Mota Dahisara village along with his wife Bhanu when the accused Dinu Mahaliya stopped them and stabbed Vaghela. Police detained Mahaliya on Saturday and has kept him in quarantine until his Covid-19 test report arrives. The accused was angry as his sister Jignasa had eloped with Vaghela’s son Haresh and got married. Around four months ago, the couple’s families had a confrontation when they learnt about their affair. Following the fight, Vaghela’s family left their house in Varsamedi village and settled in Mota Dahisara village. But, since Bhanu’s mother lives in Varsamedi village, Vaghela and Bhanu had come to the village to meet her. Cops said that Mahaliya had learnt that Vaghela and Bhanu had come to Varsamedi village, so he waited on the outskirts of the village for the couple to leave in the evening. When Vaghela and Bhanu were on their way to Mota Dahisara, Mahaliya stabbed him. Vaghela was rushed to a hospital, but he was declared dead before admission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/man-elopes-his-father-killed/articleshow/82866578.cms||---
---||Rajkot||‘Atmanirbhar’ Valar gets power ahead of other Tauktae-hit villages||Rajkot: Hundreds of villages in Saurashtra reeled under darkness due to severe damage caused to the power infrastructure by cyclone Tauktae. But taking a leaf out of government’s ‘atma nirbhar mantra’ one village in Bhavnagar got electricity two days before other village’s got the power back. The villagers of Valar showed remarkable self-reliance as they pooled in money to clear the roads of uprooted trees, re-erect and install new poles and lay the power line. Later, they approached the Paschim Gujarat Vij Ltd (PGVCL) authorities for restoration of power to the village. The village in Talaja taluka was also severely damaged by the cyclone as many electricity poles were either uprooted or completely damaged. The access to the village too was cut-off as several uprooted trees had blocked the roads connecting it to neighbouring villages. Instead of waiting for the district authorities and staffers of PGVCL, youths from the village decided to take things in their hands. The group collected funds from every house of Valar village, which has a population of around 1,500. The group rented JCB machines to move the trees blocking the connecting roads. “Some 40 to 50 big trees were uprooted by the cyclone which we moved using the JCB machines. Clearing the roads helped the villagers to travel to neighbouring villages and to other parts of the district,” said Padubha Sarvaiya, a villager. The villagers then re-erected 11 electricity poles that had fallen and installed seven new poles that were completely damaged. “There is a 66 KV sub-station at Datha village which had electricity but as the lines were damaged, there was darkness. After erecting the poles, we laid the power lines on our own and requested the authorities to supply power to us,” said Sarvaiya. Valar village received electricity on the evening of May 20 while the remaining villages in the taluka could get power only on Saturday. “There was no point in waiting for the authorities to arrive and then start the work. We had resources and knowledge so we decided to get things done on our own,” said Divyarajsinh Sarvaiya, another villager.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/atmanirbhar-valar-gets-power-ahead-of-other-tauktae-hit-villages/articleshow/82866722.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Health department to conduct door-to-door survey to check black fungus cases in Rajasthan||JAIPUR: While Sawai Man Singh (SMS) Hospital conducted marathon surgeries of 19 debridement of black fungus cases and 22 endoscopic biopsies were done for diagnosing mucormycosis (also known as black fungus) on Saturday, the health department issued orders for conducting door-to-door survey in the state for identification of suspected cases for their early treatment. The health department will keep a watchful eye on the health of people who recovered from Covid in the past 35 days, especially those living with diabetes, cancer and organ transplant. Also, those who were given steroids while undergoing treatment for Covid will also be monitored. Chief medical health officers have been directed to prepare a list of such patients – ward-wise in urban areas and village-wise in rural areas. For the purpose, the CMHOs will contact government and private hospitals to provide a list of such patients in three days. Also, for those who have taken steroids under home isolation having diabetes, cancer and organ transplant, a door-to-door survey will be done. The list prepared by the CMHOs will be given to the teams conducting door-to-door survey. They will encourage such patients with diabetes to check sugar levels frequently. The survey teams will identify suspected patients of mucormycosis for referring them to health centres, from where they will be referred to authorised hospitals for mucormycosis treatment. Besides, Sawai Man Singh (SMS) Medical College has issued guidelines of treatment of Covid patients. At SMS Medical College, 79 admissions have already been made for mucormycosis in the last seven days, while 38 operations have been done. “In just 24 hours, we have performed marathon surgeries of 19 debridement of black fungus and 22 endoscopic biopsies have also been done. In two cases, we had to remove cheekbones, while in six cases orbital clearance of the disease part was done, while saving optic nerve,” said Dr Pawan Singhal, ENT (professor), SMS Medical College. Besides, dentists have suggested Covid patients to maintain oral hygiene, which is almost ignored when a patient is undergoing Covid treatment. “People who are undergoing treatment for Covid should maintain good oral hygiene to minimize risk of mucormycosis,” said Dr Pradeep Sharma, dentist and additional superintendent, SMS Hospital. The health department is taking measures of early detection of mocormycosis cases for ensuring timely treatment. Health department officials said in case of delayed treatment, there is higher chances of death. The health department is spreading awareness on mucormycosis, saying after recovery from Covid, people should avoid dusty and damp places, should avoid gardening and avoid handling manure. If someone has used oxygen concentrators at home, he should change nasal cannula frequently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/health-dept-to-conduct-door-to-door-survey-to-check-black-fungus-cases/articleshow/82868119.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Ramdev says lakhs of people have died by taking allopathic medicines for Covid treatment; doctors protest statement, want action against yoga guru||Dehradun:Yoga guru Ramdev has stoked controversy with a video in which he can be heard saying “allopathy is such a stupid and bankrupt (diwalia) science whose various treatments for Covid like chloroquine, Remdesivir, antibiotics, steroids and now even plasma therapy have failed and cost the lives of patients.” “I am saying a very big thing which may invite controversy but it is true that lakhs of people have died due to taking allopathic medicines during this pandemic. Their number is far greater than those who died due to unavailability of oxygen,” Ramdev can be heard saying in the video while addressing a group of followers a few days ago at the Patanjali Yogpeeth campus in Haridwar. Reacting to the comments, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) on Saturday said that the Union health ministry should take action against the yoga guru, alleging he has misled people by making “unlearned statements against allopathy and defamed scientific medicine.” The apex doctors' body further said that Ramdev should be prosecuted under the Epidemic Diseases Act as his “untutored statements are a threat to the literate society of the country as well as to the poor people falling prey to him.” The Delhi Medical Association (DMA) on Saturday lodged a complaint with Delhi Police for filing an FIR against the yoga guru, accusing him of defaming and harming the reputation of allopathic medicine. It also sent a legal notice to Ramdev asking him to tender an ‘unconditional public apology’ for his comments. A statement signed by Dr JA Jayalal, national president and Dr JM Lele, honorary secretary general of IMA said that “it is a well-known fact that the yoga guru and his associate Balkrishna have been taking modern medical allopathy treatment as and when they get into illness.” “Now to mislead the public at large, he is making false and baseless accusations so that he can sell his illegal and unapproved drugs. Enough is enough. With the pain and agony of loss of 1200 modern medicine doctors, amidst limited infrastructure and manpower, the majority of modern medicine doctors are working in the frontline with a sense of compassion,” the statement said. It added that Union health minister who “himself is a practising modern medicine allopathic postgraduate and head of this ministry, should either accept the challenge and accusation of this gentleman and dissolve the modern medical facility or boldly face and prosecute the person for his words of arson,” Meanwhile, reacting to the controversy, Patanjali Yogpeeth on Saturday issued a statement which said that “a truncated version of the video is in circulation which is totally out of context of what is sought to be conveyed by Swamijee.” The statement, signed by Ramdev’s associate Acharya Balkrishna, further said that the yoga guru was “reading out a forwarded Whatsapp message received by him and various other members who were participating in the event.” “Swamijee has no ill-will against modern science and good practitioners of modern medicine. What is being attributed against him is false and nugatory.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ramdev-says-lakhs-of-people-have-died-by-taking-allopathic-medicines-for-covid-treatment-doctors-protest-statement-want-action-against-yoga-guru/articleshow/82864849.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Rain, dust storm guide mercury south; Pali hottest at 41.6°C||JAIPUR: Many places in the state witnessed mild to moderate showers and dust storms on Saturday, two days after Cyclone Tauktae hit Gujarat and Maharashtra and parts of the state. With the prevailing western disturbances, many districts in the eastern and western Rajasthan witnessed change in weather conditions with dust storm and rainfall in the evening. Pali remained hottest in the state where a maximum temperature of 41.6 °C was recorded. Attributing the change in the weather to active western disturbances and upper air cyclonic circulation, Jaipur Met office stated that similar conditions will prevail in at least 13 districts on Sunday as well. People in Jaipur woke up to a comparatively warmer morning as a minimum temperature of 22.8 °C was recorded. It was followed by a sultry afternoon when a maximum temperature of 37.2 °C was recorded. In the evening, mild to moderate showers in scattered form were seen on the outskirts of Jaipur, including Dudu, Amber, Shahpura and Kotputli. Also, cloudy conditions prevailed in the city that also converted into rainfall at some places. The change in weather guided the mercury down by almost 2°C. Jaipur Met office, however, said from Monday, there would be no prevailing systems like western disturbances, thus mercury will take an upward swing. By the end of May many places in the state will see heat wave conditions. Since the state witnessed heavy to very heavy rainfall early this week, temperature at many places is still below 40°C. “It is quite unusual that during the last week of May we are still having places with its maximum temperatures below 40.0 °C. This is the time when we had witnessed even 50.0 °C in a place like Churu in the past years. Due to heavy rainfall there is presence of moisture, which is guiding the mercury down,” said a Met official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rain-dust-storm-guide-mercury-south-pali-hottest-at-41-6c/articleshow/82868155.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand tags black fungus an epidemic||DEHRADUN: On Saturday, Uttarakhand joined the states Telangana, Odisha, Gujarat, Karnataka, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu to declare mucormycosis a notifiable disease under ‘Epidemic Diseases Act 1897’. But the hill state, which has recorded 55 confirmed cases, 42 suspected cases and seven deaths of black fungus so far, has run out of Amphotericin B, only medication for the treatment of this deadly infection. Hospitals treating black fungus in Uttarakhand, where patients from Uttar Pradesh are also admitted, have completely run out of Amphotericin B. The govt has declared Amphotericin B as an emergency drug and hence its sale has been stopped at medical stores. The only way to procure it now is from the offices of the district CMOs, which currently have no stock of the medicine. At the office of Dehradun chief medical officer (CMO) on Saturday, the relative of a black fungus patient could be seen pleading for the drug with folded hands “Sir ek injection dilwa do, mera bhai mar jayega. Uske teen bacche hain.” (Sir, pls get me one injection or my brother will die, he has three children). Similar was the situation with may other relatives of patients diagnosed with the disease. Mehruddeen, whose uncle is admitted at AIIMS Rishikesh with black fungus, decided to walk and hitchhike all the way to Dehradun from Rishikesh on Saturday. His family has borrowed money from relatives to get his uncle to AIIMS Rishikesh from Bijnor. Doctors at AIIMS had told him to get Amphotericin B from the CMO’s office in Dehradun. “I had run out of money and didn’t have any to travel to Doon from Rishikesh. I took lifts, walked for over 20 kilometers and somehow reached the CMO’s office, only to find that the medicine is not available here,” he told TOI. Dr Kailash Gunjiyal, who has been tasked with distributing the medicine at the CMO’s office, said, “We got 30 vials on Thursday, but they hardly served the purpose as one patient needs at least 30 doses of this medicine for survival if the infection has reached the stage that requires surgery.” Uttarakhand Drugs Controller (DC) Tajber Singh told TOI that the stock given to hospitals in Garhwal ended on Friday and that the health department has already approached the manufacturers to procure more stock. “A Rudrapur-based drug manufacturer assured us of 1,000 doses, which may arrive sometime next week,” said Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/with-55-confirmed-cases-uttarakhand-declares-black-fungus-an-epidemic/articleshow/82864868.cms||Ishita Mishra

Two of my brothers have threatened to kill or implicate me in false cases since they have political backing,” Jangid said in his video prior to taking the extreme step. When contacted, a senior officer of Mahwa police station said, “He was addicted to drugs and was living alone away from his brothers while his children were taken care of by his brothers.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Critical care occupancy goes up in Thiruvananthapuram||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: While active cases in the district are dropping primarily due to the new discharge criteria, the occupancy rates in Medical College Hospital (MCH), Covid second-line treatment centres (CSLTCs) and Covid hospitals have not shown any dip so far. The weekly admission to MCH increased from 303 in the final week of April to 702 by the second week of May. The admission rates in CSLTCs rose from 314 in the first week of May to 587 by the second week. As for Covid hospitals, the occupancy peaked from 1,833 in the final week of April to 3,581, nearly double the number, by Thursday. The district has been mostly under lockdown and triple lockdown since May 4 and there has been no respite in admission rates in major Covid hospitals. The patient load under Category B and Category C has equally been alarming. The patient load under Category B, which was 145 in the first week of April, now stands at 2,606. This is the compiled figure of patients admitted in Covid hospitals, CSLTCs and private hospitals. ICU occupancy has more than doubled in the district in less than a month. There has also been no respite in rural panchayats. As on Friday, two panchayats recorded weekly TPR of above 50% while 11 local bodies recorded TPR of above 40%. Ottasekharamangalam panchayat recorded 53.37% TPR on Friday and Vilavoorkal panchayat also crossed TPR above 50%. Both these panchayats are in Kattakada taluk. Panchayats like Nagaroor, which had begun to show a slight decline, is also reporting new cases. So far 87 Covid positive cases have been reported here. Karumkulam panchayat, which has been a major hotspot in the first wave, is also falling prey to second wave. Over 100 patients are under treatment here. One major concern for the local body members and the health team is the test reluctance, which severely affects contact tracing and isolation. A ward member said that while the health team came with over 300 testing kits, only eight persons turned up for testing. “They are very reluctant to come for testing. Either they stay at home or depend on some nearby private hospitals. They do not figure in our list of monitoring and chances of transmission are high,” said a local body member. Only eight per cent of ICU beds are vacant in government sector and as for ventilators, the vacancy is just 11%. The district recorded 3,300 Covid positive cases on Saturday. Active cases have come down to 20,695. A total of 3,110 persons got infected through local contact. As many as 7,370 persons completed observation period without showing any symptoms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/critical-care-occupancy-goes-up-in-dist/articleshow/82866747.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Meet over phased easing of lockdown soon, say officials||HYDERABAD: Senior government officials said instructions were issued by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao to police to enforce the lockdown strictly with an intention to end it on May 30 and relax the restrictions in a phased manner. Officials said KCR is likely to hold a review meeting on Covid-19 on May 28 or 29. From May 31 or June 1, the government may slowly relax the restrictions from four hours to six hours and impose only night curfew later. Some states like AP are implementing the lockdown between 12 noon to 6 am. Health department officials said the number of cases per day in the state has fallen for the past one week and on Saturday, only 3,300 cases were reported. “The curve cannot be flattened immediately, but the number of cases can be brought down to below 1,000 within a week. If people start moving on roads, the situation may come back to square one. The government does not want such a scenario,” a senior official of CMO said. Sources in the government recall that the CM was reluctant to impose lockdown in the state as it would directly impact the livelihood of several sectors and lakhs of workers apart from hitting the state’s revenues. The 20-hour lockdown is being implemented to break the chain and reduce the number of coronavirus infection cases. “The government is prepared to lose revenue in view of the pandemic situation. People’s health gains credence over the state revenues,” a senior government official said and recalled that even the CM said the same during a review meeting with district collectors and SPs on Friday. “However, the government cannot go on extending the lockdown for several weeks, which may further worsen the situation. A situation may arise when the government will not be in a position to even pay salaries to the employees,” a CMO official said. The Telangana government clamped the lockdown on May 12 for 10 days and later extended till May 30. Only four hours — between 6 am and10 am — is given to people to purchase groceries and vegetables. KCR expressed unhappiness over the implementation of lockdown in the state at Friday’s meeting and asked the police to crack the whip on violators of lockdown guidelines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/meet-over-phased-easing-of-lockdown-soon/articleshow/82866730.cms||Koride Mahesh

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Swiggy, Zomato shut operations after executives fined||HYDERABAD: The police’s post-10 am clampdown, on Saturday, brought food delivery across the twin cities to a grinding halt, leaving both service providers and residents flustered. So much so that market leaders Swiggy and Zomato decided to put brakes on their operations in Hyderabad, unless further clarification from authorities on the issue. Incidentally, in the lockdown order issued earlier this month, the state government categorically mentioned that “e-commerce (delivery) of goods and merchandise including food, pharmaceutical and medical equipment” will be exempted from curbs imposed post the 6 am to 10 am period. Yet, on Saturday, scores of delivery executives complained of being stopped and fined by the police, while on duty.  “They not only seized my vehicle but also imposed a fine of Rs 1,000. They need to understand that we are out at this time to earn a living. I also showed them the orders I received on my phone and told them that the restaurants are also functioning because the government has not imposed any restrictions on essentials like food, but to no avail. The motorcycles of at least 70 delivery executives, in Mehdipatnam alone, were seized,” said Syed Osman, a Zomato employee. Some like D Prabhakar also complained of being beaten up by traffic cops. “I have been delivering food in the same route since the beginning of the lockdown and no one has stopped us. Today, they beat us up if we even questioned them. We are being punished even though we are operating within law,” the Swiggy executive said. Even cloud kitchens operating in the city weren’t spared. “We received information in the morning that we have to shut down all our outlets. When we asked why it was being done, even though the GO allows operation of our services, they said we have to shut down since they are not allowing flood delivery executives to pick up orders from restaurants,” said P Vasu, co-founder of Varalakshmi tiffins and Istah cloud kitchens in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/swiggy-zomato-shut-ops-after-executives-fined/articleshow/82866750.cms||---

Trichy collector S Sivarasu asked people to lodge a complaint with the district administration in case of fleecing in treating Covid-19 patients. “Such issues can be reported through a dedicated number which we will notify. We can even close such hospitals,” he said. President of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), Tamil Nadu Dr P Ramakrishnan said their association will warn hospitals that harass people. “This is unethical,” he told TOI on Saturday.A Trichy resident A R Yoagandran said his friend struggled to admit his 59-year-old mother, a Covid patient with comorbid conditions in a private hospital in Woraiyur recently. “The patient’s SpO2 level was 80. The hospital asked him to pay Rs 2.5 lakh in cash for admission. He managed to withdraw Rs 1 lakh from the ATM. The hospital was not ready to accept the rest through digital mode forcing him to find another hospital,” Yoagandran said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/collector-warns-of-closing-hosps-for-fleecing/articleshow/82869855.cms||Gokul Rajendran

His name was read out by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan during the daily news conference as he listed down the contributions received for the chief minister’s distres relief fund (CMDRF). Kumar decided to donate Rs 1,000 per month till his retirement to CMDRF and the chief minister acknowledged his decision in the news conference. Kumar says that it is a small sum but when he came to know about the contribution of life savings by Janardhanan, a beedi worker from Kannur, he decided to pitch in with whatever he could. “I know this is a small contribution, but when you get to hear about people giving away everything for helping others, you got to do at least this. My family was all support for this. I take care of my children and my old parents along with my wife. I am happy to do my bit,” says Kumar, who resides at Parassala. When asked whether he is not worried about loans and savings he says, “I am a middle-class government servant. I have got loans and debts like everyone else. If you think of contributing to the society after finishing off all your debts, it’s never going to happen. This was something I thought I could do on a consistent basis,” says Kumar, who joined service in 2006. He is the sole earning member of his family. Kumar had earlier donated for flood relief and is an active contributor in charity works.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/clerk-vows-to-donate-rs-1000-per-month-to-cmdrf-till-retirement/articleshow/82866757.cms||---
---||Mumbai||BMC uses ebb in second wave to boost Covid infrastructure||MUMBAI: While health authorities came in for widespread criticism for wasting the lull between the first and second waves of the Covid pandemic, the BMC is taking no chances during the ongoing ebb and is busy upgrading its pandemic infrastructure. Work on fixing the three jumbo field hospitals in underway even as four new such centres are under construction. The BMC is also in the process of setting up 16 oxygen manufacturing units in 12 of its suburban hospitals to avoid situations like on April 16 when 168 patients were moved from its smaller hospitals to field hospitals due to shortage of oxygen cylinders. In January, when Covid cases in the city dropped to less than 700 cases a day, the BMC wound many of its quarantine facilities and allowed private hospitals to close down their Covid wards and restart non-Covid operations. “The jumbo facilities were told to plan a retreat plan as it was felt that some of them could be wound up due to lack of cases,” said a senior BMC doctor. Within a month, the daily caseload started increasing and the BMC authorities had to increase beds in private hospitals as well as its own jumbo facilities. The planning for the third wave, though, began even as the second wave reached a peak in April first week. Now, for the first time in the pandemic, each of the field hospitals will get a 200-bedded pediatric unit as some experts fear children could be more vulnerable to the SAR-CoV-2 virus if the third wave occurs. In the past few months, the Dahisar field facility has seen several isolated incidents of minor fires. A survey revealed that the wires and air-conditioning systems were the weak spots that needed to be strengthened. “The field hospitals were built as temporary structures meant to last for six months to one year, but it is beyond that period now. We hence decided to take up our facilities at BKC, Mulund and Dahisar for complete maintenance work,” said Suresh Kakani, BMC additional municipal commissioner. “The administration and service staff are working overtime in the Dahisar, BKC and Mulund field hospitals to ensure they can reopen by June 1,” said a senior doctor. Even the Centre has asked states to not wind up Covid centres as cases in the second wave drop quickly. Work on four more jumbo centres, with each having a capacity of 2,000 normal beds and 200 ICU beds, is underway in various parts of the city. These facilities will come up in Kanjurmarg, Malad, Mahalalaxmi and Sion; the Mahalaxmi centre is being handled by H N Reliance Hospital, Girgaum. As on May 22, the BMC had 22,090 hospital beds and 2,880 ICU beds. Of these, 8,361 normal beds and 2,267 ICU beds are currently occupied.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-uses-ebb-in-second-wave-to-boost-covid-infrastructure/articleshow/82864962.cms||---
---||Pune||ICMR to ask states for data on hospitalisation after jabs||Pune: The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has now asked all states to ready data of those who were hospitalised with Covid after vaccination. Experts said the information will be used to explore a theory that states Covid is mostly mild after vaccination. States have also been asked to collect data on vaccination coverage, hospitalisations, treatment protocols and duration of hospital stay in the vaccinated. Senior ICMR epidemiologist Dr Samiran Panda said states are encouraged to upload the data on a common portal. “I strongly feel this data will help states understand how vaccines are helpful in reducing hospitalisation and the burden on health infrastructure," Dr Panda said. The national Covid-19 vaccination programme started on January 16. Experts said it's important to collect the states' information on a common portal as research on vaccine effectiveness can help ease hesitancy. “I would encourage all states to start the drive. The ICMR can help states understand the impact of the vaccination drive," Dr Panda added. According to information provided by the health ministry, out of 18.41 crore people vaccinated since January 16, 14.12 crore have received one dose and 4.29 crore people have completed their full two-dose schedule. In the 18-44 group, 92.97 lakh individuals have been given their first dose. Former union health secretary K Sujatha Rao said it would be interesting to know how many from this number have been hospitalised with moderate or severe symptoms after vaccination. Hospitals may seek prior vaccination information, but it's unlikely this information is being fed into a centralised database, experts said. “This data could definitely help address vaccine hesitancy," Rao said. Dr Sanjay Patil, chairman of the IMA's Hospital Board of India, Pune, said many doctors have observed that severity of Covid post vaccination is "very less". “It is very crucial to start recording the status of vaccination at this point of time. Good data will help in effective control and management of Covid," Dr Patil said. Some states have carried out small studies — especially among doctors and health care workers — to determine the severity of Covid after vaccinations. Experts said many of these vaccinated health workers may be acquiring the infection again due to the high viral load environments they work in. This group was also the first to be vaccinated in India. In Delhi, a major hospital chain - after an observational study - said 97% of those vaccinated were protected from Covid, with chances of of hospitalisation after vaccination at just 0.06%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/icmr-to-ask-states-for-data-on-hospitalisation-after-jabs/articleshow/82868259.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Hyderabad||Power staff lathicharged, min complains to DGP||Hyderabad: The enforcement of lockdown rules took a turn for the worse in Nalgonda town on Saturday when police rained lathi blows on electricity employees who, in turn, registered their protest by stopping power supply in the town for two hours. The issue snowballed into a major controversy with energy minister G Jagadish Reddy objecting to the behaviour of cops and complaining to DGP M Mahendar Reddy. Tension prevailed in Nalgonda with locals objecting to methods adopted by police to enforce lockdown. Soon after 10 am when the lockdown began, cops swung into action and resorted to indiscriminate baton charge on people. Police stopped autos and rained blows on those travelling in them. Jagadish Reddy then contacted the DGP and objected to the manner in which police beat up electricity employees. “When they have identity cards, how can they be stopped from discharging their official duties,” the minister said complaining to the DGP. The minister also spoke to DIG and district SP AV Ranganath and demanded that action be taken against cops who beat electricity employees. “We have identified the cops who behaved rashly with the electricity employees and action will be taken against them,” Ranganath said. Transco chairman and MD D Prabhakar Rao said it had come to his notice too that electricity employees were beaten up by cops in Nalgonda and Hyderabad. “The employees should not be stopped and their vehicles should not be seized,” Prabhakar Rao said in an appeal to police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/power-staff-lathicharged-min-complains-to-dgp/articleshow/82866755.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
---||Hyderabad||Lockdown leads to dip in milk consumption in Hyderabad||HYDERABAD: Milk consumption in Greater Hyderabad has come down by 20% in the lockdown. Thanks to the short window of only four hours, as against 30 lakh litres per day average consumption in the city, only 24 lakh litres of milk is consumed now. Interestingly, there has been no significant dip in milk sales or its consumption in the districts. Telangana State Dairy Development Cooperative Federation managing director G Srinivas Rao confirmed to STOI that there is a dip in milk consumption. “As the time to sell the milk and other commodities is only four hours and also the shelf life of milk being less, retailers are not taking chances. They are placing orders for a lesser number of milk packets compared to what they used to take before the lockdown,” he said. The milk business had picked up and was stabilising after the first round of coronavirus but the second wave of the pandemic has badly hit the sector. The dairy managements said the main reason for consumption of milk going down in Greater Hyderabad was due to the short window period. In addition, hotels, restaurants, tea stalls, sweet shops and other institutions which consume huge quantities of milk are remaining closed, except for four hours, due to the lockdown, they explained. “The dairy managements have informed the agriculture secretary that while there is a dip in milk consumption by 20%, sales of milk byproducts are down by 40%. They are now seeking permission for at least milk parlours to be allowed to remain open throughout the day,” said an official. Private and cooperative dairies put together sell 68 lakh litres of milk every day in Telangana. However, there is no loss to the milk farmers despite the consumption going down. The cooperative and private dairies are still procuring milk from farmers in Telangana. It is the milk farmers, cooperative and private dairies of neighbouring states like AP, Karnataka and Maharashtra which have been affected. Telangana is not self-reliant in milk production. Procurement of milk from other states has been reduced temporarily.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/lockdown-leads-to-dip-in-milk-consumption-in-city/articleshow/82866784.cms||Roushan Ali

According to the Thalassemia Society, many of its patients and blood donors coming from Lingampally were stopped near Mehdipatnam. Despite showing Thalassemia certificates, they were not allowed to proceed for blood transfusions. It was only after the Thalassemia Society appealed to the cops that they were allowed to go. A Thalassemia patient's father was slapped a challan of Rs 1,250 by Hyderabad police for bringing his ailing daughter and donor for treatment. “In the past, we have requested the city commissioners and the director general of police Mahender Reddy to exempt blood donors and patients. If Thalassemia patients don’t get blood transfusion on time, they can succumb,” said Aleem Baig, joint secretary of Thalassemia Society. He added that donors and patients should be allowed to proceed after showing patient ID card, donor card and other documents. Many donors have sought clear guidelines from the government. “On one hand, the police hold blood donation camps and encourage people to step out and donate blood for Thalassemia patients. On the other hand, they harass those who are going for blood donation. There should be a clear mechanism for this,” said a donor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/thalassemia-patients-blood-donors-stopped/articleshow/82866793.cms||Preeti Biswas

As all the shops were permitted to operate till Sunday 9pm, traders who lost business in the last few weeks were quick to reopen. Worried over the availability of various products during the complete lockdown, people were quick to throng outlets as they were not sure about door delivery of groceries during the complete lockdown from Monday. “We cannot rely on door delivery of vegetables. Last year, the availability of vegetables sold through the corporation failed to cover many parts,” said R Venkatachalam, a resident of Chinnakadai Veedhi in Trichy said. Though TNSTC and private buses were permitted to operate till Sunday to help workers and stranded people to get back home, the patronage was low on Saturday, said TNSTC officials. “We operated only 25% buses on Saturday, yet it took more than an hour to fill up the seats.

With Saturday’s addition, the state’s total caseload rose to 55.5 lakh. For a week now, Mumbai has been registering under 1,500 cases a day (1,535 cases on May 16). On Saturday, the BMC update said 1,283 cases were detected despite the usual number of tests (29,264), while there were 52 deaths. While Maharashtra’s positivity rate has dipped to 10%, the corresponding number in Mumbai was 4.3% -- a trend noticeable for the last three days. In KEM Hospital, Parel, there are 115 Covid patients who are critical. “But the daily new admissions have reduced to two or three,” said KEM Hospital dean Dr Hemant Deshmukh. Even in private hospitals that the affluent classes who form the bulk of those affected by the second wave prefer, normal beds and ICU beds are easy to get now. “We have 25 to 27 patients in the ICU at the moment, and the pressure on availability of ICU beds has eased,” said Dr Rahul Pandit, who heads the ICU department in Fortis Hospital, Mulund, and is a member of the state government’s task force on Covid. BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani said BMC’s focus right now is on preparing infrastructure for the third wave. There were many districts like Satara, Solapur, Ahmednagar, Sangli and Kolhapur that were adding nearly the same amount of cases as Mumbai and Pune. These districts continue to be a cause of concern.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-reports-decline-in-cases-for-3rd-straight-day-but-fatalities-high/articleshow/82868356.cms||Bhavika Jain

Our syllabus has also been revised in view of the disruption due to the pandemic and we had to content ourselves with remote learning in the most crucial year of our school life. Many of us are dependent on coaching institutes. However, hours of online education and lack of any social gathering are causing anxiety among many of us,” said 18-year-old Meena Singh, a Dehradun-based Class XII student. In a similar vein, Meena’s mother Bhavya Singh said, “We are trying our best to ensure that the education of our children is not affected. Even in these difficult times, we are paying the fees of coaching classes but this remote set-up cannot match conventional teaching. The prospects of higher education have also become grim for students due to the Covid-19 pandemic.” Lipika Gupta, who runs a coaching centre in Dehradun, said, “The online platform sure provides us with new and more interesting techniques but the overall development that happens in a social setting is necessary for the growth of children.” The shift to online learning has been equally difficult for primary students as well. “My daughter is five years old. I see her enjoying and dancing to rhymes but her increased screen time bothers me a lot. I am concerned about her eyesight. We cannot even take her to a park for outdoor activities due to the Covid-19 threat,” said Deepika Agarwal, a parent. Meanwhile, Dr Ram Tiwari, a child specialist who runs a private clinic, told TOI, “The attention span of children is reducing considerably due to increased screen time. Their sleep patterns are also being impacted. This is leading to behavioural problems among them. Since they cannot go out and play, kids should be encouraged to take up creative activities in their free time.” By Ashita Kapoor (Pic: Pranav Goel)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/have-adopted-to-remote-learning-but-not-uncertainty-say-students-in-doon/articleshow/82865019.cms||---

The association expressed apprehensions that unrest among LPG delivery boys and support staff may spread across the state in case of a further delay in vaccination. “The delivery boys and support staff have issued notices to LPG distributors about their inability to continue their duties if they are not recognised as frontline warriors and vaccinated immediately,” said association president M Vekateswara Rao. “In the last 30 days, we have lost 13 persons, including seven distributors, to Covid-19. Every day, reports of deaths among the distributors, delivery boys and staff trigger a shock wave. The situation is getting worse. Pressure is being mounted on the distributors for vaccination of delivery boys and other staff,” said Rao. A few states like Rajasthan, Delhi, Maharashtra, Assam and north-eastern states have already started vaccinating the LPG network staffers and recognised them as frontline workers. In order to control the unrest spreading among delivery boys and support staff, the following demands may be met immediately in the interest of the 1.2 crore families of the state and 14,500 LPG network members, he said. LPG distributors and their staff have provided uninterrupted supply of LPG refills to over one crore families in the state despite facing hardships and risking their lives during the pandemic, he said. “If this issue is not addressed immediately, it may lead to a total collapse of the LPG cylinder home delivery system. The Telangana LPG Distributors Association seeks to put the state government on notice and cannot continue home delivery beyond seven days if our demands are not met,” Rao warned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/vaccinate-staff-or-no-cylinder-will-be-lifted-lpg-assn/articleshow/82866841.cms||Roushan Ali

The artists had approached the officials for help. Each family was provided a 25 -30 Kg dry ration kit comprising flour, rice, cooking oil, dal and sugar as well as masks along with sanitisers. “Folk artists in Barmer have been facing hardships due to Covid, since no events are happening to help them earn money. In view of this, an NGO of these artists called Pragati Lok Kalyan Vikas Sansthan approached Konark Corps for any possible assistance for artists and the needful was done”, said an official. The group was assisted last year also during peak of Covid-19 pandemic. Army formations across the country have been helping during the pandemic and on Friday Sudarshan Chakra Division had set up a 50-bed hospital in Sriganganagar, dedicated to the citizens to combat the rapid surge in Covid-19 cases in the district. The facility will provide Covid care including oxygen to the citizens of Sriganganagar and adjoining areas.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Have employed two to tackle delivery demand||KOLKATA: I have actually seen a sizeable growth in business over the past one week. I cannot handle the home delivery load by myself and have now employed two men who have bikes. They are carrying grocery and other essential items to hundreds of doorsteps from my shop. My business has gone up with the second wave that saw people prefer to stay indoors. With the enhanced restrictions now in place, even those who used to come here to buy, are placing orders on phone, by either calling up or via WhatsApp texts. They send a timeline by which they want their orders delivered and I ensure that it is done according to the time of their choice. I have started getting orders from the AJ, AD, BJ, BD, BF, BH, CF, CJ and even GD blocks. Word of mouth publicity is helping and my phone just doesn’t stop ringing. Most of my customers check different brands and offers before placing their orders with me. I am also surfing the net to keep myself abreast of offers and schemes that the superstores in malls are providing. I am also asking my customers routinely at the time of delivery if they have any particular product in mind, which they would want us to procure for them. We are asking for suggestions too. If there’s an issue with the goods delivered, we have them exchanged immediately. People are liking the personalised services we are offering and we repeatedly tell them not to hesitate to place an order even if it’s a single item or very small quantity. After all, what are neighbourhood shops there for? Delivery is always free of charge. We have seen people moving away from us in favour of online shopping and big stores in malls in the past. But the current situation has brought local kirana stores back in reckoning. (Koushik Howladar, owner of a grocery store at the AH Block in Salt Lake, spoke to Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey.)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/have-employed-two-to-tackle-delivery-demand/articleshow/82866868.cms||---

Villagers complained that there is no Covid testing facility or any vaccination drive there. The doctor working at the primary health centre was also transferred elsewhere. The team spoke to the villagers and took brief about the deaths. Later, officials of the authority told the media that there were 44 deaths in the village, but it is not confirmed whether these deaths were because of Covid, as the deceased were not tested. The team also accepted that the population of the village is 13,000 and only about 300 people were vaccinated. There is no RT-PCR testing facility in the village and the patients have to go to JLN Hospital for treatment. The team said that most of the deaths were of the people who were above 60 years of age. Villagers said that they wanted treatment in the village and also a doctor. The team also appealed to the villagers not to approach any tantric or quacks when they get ill and simply go to the doctor. The team also asked the senior and respectful people of the village to encourage people for vaccination. The district legal aid authority conducted campaign in the district to make people aware, mostly in rural areas, to follow guidelines of social distancing and wearing mask.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/legal-aid-team-visits-covid-hit-somalpur/articleshow/82865081.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers’ Protection Association has put forth the demand before chief minister M K Stalin to check the feasibility of opening the sluice gates of Stanley Reservoir to go ahead with the kuruvai cultivation on 3.37 lakh acres in Cauvery delta zone (CDZ) comprising Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Nagapattinam and parts of Trichy, Ariyalur, Cuddalore and Pudukkottai districts. In a letter to the chief minister, president of the association S Vimalanathan said that the increase of water level in the Mettur reservoir above 95 feet and the rainfall in catchment areas of Cauvery river set the things right to take up the kuruvai cultivation on time this year. “With the prediction of good rainfall in southwest monsoon and the rainfall for the past two days, the distressed farmers in delta districts started preparatory work for kuruvai cultivation because they are in desperate need of money flow after being deprived of income due to the second wave of Covid-19,” said Vimalanathan. The association cited the meeting of the minister for water resources Duraimurugan in Thanjavur on May 15 with the farmers’ association leaders and his assurance to take up the suggestions of majority of the farmers to open the dam on June 12 with the chief minister. “Besides the water flow due to the rain in the catchment areas, the state government should insist the Karnataka government to give their due share of water for February, March, April and May to comfortably store the water for the irrigation,” said Vimalanathan. Moreover, the farmers’ association asked the chief minister to make the announcement by May 27 so that all the farmers can take up the preparatory works such as readying the field, gathering seeds etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/delta-farmers-rest-hopes-on-cm-to-open-mettur-dam-on-june-12/articleshow/82869987.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Covishield, Covaxin, Sputnik can all share a roof at Kanjur facility||MUMBAI: Over 1.5 crore Covid-19 vaccine doses can be stored at a time at the BMC’s new vaccination storage facility in Kanjurmarg (east). The final count, though, may depend on the temperature that needs to be maintained for a particular brand of vaccine. The facility, which opened on April 7, has come up on the first floor of the local health centre on a Rs 4.5 crore budget. It has two walk-in coolers maintained between two degrees Celsius and eight degrees Celsius. This is where the Covid vaccines Covishield and Covaxin are stored at the moment. “At a conservative estimate, we can store 60 lakh doses in each of the two walk-in coolers, but some experts believe we can even store 90 lakh each,” said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. The lone walk-in freezer here, maintained between -25 degrees Celsius and -15 degrees Celsius, will possibly house the Russian Sputnik V vaccine that the BMC is planning to import shortly. It needs to be stored at -17 degrees Celsius. “As we don't know the packaging dimensions of the Sputnik vaccine, we are unable to assess how many can be stored in the walk-in freezer, but we believe we have adequate space,” said a BMC public health official. But it should also be able to store lakhs of doses. Earlier in the week, municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal said the BMC was in the process of importing a crore doses of Sputnik V. The BMC has earmarked Rs 700 crore to buy Covid vaccines.

---||India||In U-turn, government allows companies to vaccinate staff’s kin too||NEW DELHI: Reversing its earlier policy, the government has allowed private and state entities to vaccinate not just employees but also their dependent family members. The fresh advisory, issued on Friday, came after companies and industry bodies took up the issue with the ministry of health, arguing limiting vaccination against Covid-19 only to employees was not going to help. Companies received the communication on Saturday. Several firms, both in the public and private sector, had already lined up vaccination programmes for their employees and family members. While the May 19 advisory was seen to be holding back the vaccination drive, Friday’s letter said the clarifications followed several queries and were meant for “further accelerating” inoculations. Now, the government has allowed family members and dependents — as defined by the employer — to be covered under the programme at industrial and workplace Covid Vaccination Centres (CVCs). This means the employee, spouse, their children, parents, in-laws and other dependents allowed by companies in their internal policies can be vaccinated at these centres. Employers have been advised to procure the vaccines from hospitals with whom they may have tied up. At government CVCs, beneficiaries who are 45 years or above can be vaccinated for free through doses supplied by the Centre or state governments. Beneficiaries in the 18-44 years bracket can be covered through doses directly procured by the states, the ministry said. Allowing employers to vaccinate employees was a key feature of the programme from May. In fact, companies were surprised by the ban on vaccinating family members as the Centre and state governments had earlier suggested to them to also reach out to communities around their factories. An industry chamber and its members have identified close to 50 lakh such beneficiaries, who can now hope to get vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/in-u-turn-government-allows-companies-to-vaccinate-staffs-kin-too/articleshow/82872124.cms||---

The victims — 65-year-old Dhum Singh and 40-year-old Afsari Begam — were in the forest close to the village when the elephant went on a rampage. “While Dhum Singh was picking up fuelwood, Afsari had gone to attend nature's call in the nearby forests when the tusker allegedly attacked them. The onlookers and our personnel on patrolling duty there said that a male elephant had charged upon them,” said JS Suhag, chief wildlife warden, Uttarakhand forest department. He added that the forest department has initiated the process of providing ex-gratia to the bereaved families. “The villagers saw the elephant mauling Dhum Singh around 6 pm. He died on the spot. On the other woman, only mild injuries were found on Afsari's body. She might have died of a heart attack during the elephant attack. The actual cause of her death can be ascertained only after the postmortem report comes in,” said Raghuveer Rawat, sub-inspector, Laldhang check-post. Last month, a woman was killed and another one was injured in a tusker attack in the same area. Uttarakhand forest minister Harak Singh Rawat had even gone to meet the injured woman in the hospital. The family members of the deceased were given an ex-gratia and those of the injured were given a compensation amount.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/tusker-tramples-two-people-to-death-in-laldhang-village/articleshow/82865119.cms||Shivani Azad

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Situations like this make family bonds stronger||Kolkata: It’s been a week since the beginning of our confinement at home, and we have avoided moving out of the house. We live on Chakraberia Road in a complex, that had already prepared for another round of strict restrictions the moment the partial restrictions were announced. We have arranged for our help and cook to stay with us and our driver is staying in the quarters that the complex is providing for private drivers and male retainers. Both of us are working from home and find ourselves spending the entire day attending meetings and calls on our laptops. Till Friday my son had his online classes. But now his summer break has started. He is preparing for SAT, so that is also keeping him busy. He has an asthma issue so we are doubly careful and have done video consultations with the doctor. My husband is a banker based in Mumbai. Sometimes the work pressure gets overwhelming and then we take breaks to chat and loosen up. Situations like this definitely makes our family bonds stronger. We are getting all groceries and vegetables home delivered through e-commerce vendors and fruits from the local vendor who is doing doorstep delivery within the permitted hours. Though we have a live-in cook, we also sometimes try our hand in rustling up meals after work. Even Rohan is learning to cook nowadays. Having my husband home for such a long stretch is a positive during this confinement. Last year when lockdown was announced, he could not manage flights to come over here and had to stay back in Mumbai. All three of us do breathing exercises and yoga in the morning. We are also doing online exercises to keep fit. Our boy is ready to take the leap for higher education and like every mother I too will have to go through that empty nest feeling. So I am utilising this time to be with my son as much as I can.

The 13 patients in Malegaon corporation were given 15 vials. The vials distributed as per the percentage of the active cases of the mucormycosis coming from the respective regions. Since the vials were in short supply, the state health authority has asked the collectors to form a team and check for the rationale distribution of the drug among the patients. The district administrations have also been ordered to ensure limited number of doses are given so that maximum number of patients can benefit from the short stock available.  Mandhare said, a team in the collectorate responsible for distribution of Remdesivir and Tocilizumab would also hold the responsibility of distribution of Amphotericin in times of shortage.

Pundaliknagar’s assistant inspector Ghanshyam Sonawne said that along with the junior engineer, his live-in partner and other family members have also been booked for cheating, criminal conspiracy, domestic violence. While the JE’s live-in partner has been additionally slapped with sections of IT Act. As per the complaint lodged by a 26-year old woman dentist, she got married to the 32-year-old suspect from Pathri in Parbhani in August 2020. On the day of their wedding, she started receiving intimate photos of her husband with another woman from an unidentified social media account. She said that after she spoke with her husband about this, he asked her to ignore the photos. However, the messages and photos continued. The complainant then brought the matter to the notice of her parents, following which her husband’s partner was contacted. She (the live-in partner) agreed to back off if suitably compensated. Accordingly, she was paid a sum of Rs 7 lakh. However, within a few days, her husband returned to Amravati for work and was joined by the suspect woman, who started sending freshly clicked intimate pictures. API Sonawne said the dentist had lodged a written complaint with the police station following which, efforts were made to amicably resolve the differences. “However, the suspect JE and his live-in partner were found to be misleading the dentist and her family by giving them false assurances. Left with no option, the woman lodged a complaint and the suspects were booked,” said Sonawne. He said the suspects will soon be summoned for recording their statements following which, a call to arrest them will be taken.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/mseb-engineer-others-booked-for-cheating-dentist-wife/articleshow/82863249.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||Goa: Tauktae forces trawler owners to drop anchor on fishing season||COLVA: The 61-day fishing ban is a week away, but around 70% of trawler owners have called it a day and stopped their operations, said Cutbona Boat Owners’ Development Society Savio D’Silva. The season, according to D’Silva, was satisfactory till December 2020, but with the new year it was uncertain as Covid cases started rising, the sea developed depression, Cyclone Tauktae and another cyclone Yaas is now brewing up the Bay of Bengal, which will naturally have an effect in the Arabian sea. Last year due to national lockdown which was announced in March, there was a mass exodus of labourers who wanted to get to their home towns. However, those trawler owners who managed to keep their flock together later ventured into the sea and sell their catch directly to the people in the villages as the markets were shut and transportation of fish outside the state was banned. Another trawler owner said that overall the season has been bad for them because of uncertainty. “Even before the lockdown was announced in the state on May 9, there was feud going on between the market contractor and the importers of the fish, and we were caught in the crossfire, but we managed to pull on as it is our business.” D’Silva said some of the trawler owners have ventured into the sea in a bid to cash in on the few days remaining so they can recover the costs they spent to get their staff. Though the fishing ban was lifted at midnight on July 31 last year, along the 105km-long coastline in Goa, a large number of trawlers touching almost 1,500 could not venture into the sea as the work force did not return to work even after the lockdown was lifted. Hamilton Fernandes, another trawler owner, said that they had to arrange flight tickets and send buses from Goa to Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and other states to get their people. “I have not yet folded operations, but times are difficult. Since the wholesale market was closed, our sales dropped, then the coronavirus struck again and then due to the cyclone we did not venture into the sea,” he said. He said that another feature that hampers their fishing activity is the sand bar at the mouth of Sal and Arabian Sea at Betul. “We have to waste almost 12 hours to come to the jetty with the catch or to venture into the sea as the sand bar does not permit navigation during low tide, the government was supposed to build a training wall, but that also has been suspended for almost three years now and these are impediments that stalls fishing being lucrative,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tauktae-forces-trawler-owners-to-drop-anchor-on-fishing-season/articleshow/82868483.cms||---
---||Mumbai||ICMR to ask states for data on Covid hospitalisation after jabs||PUNE: The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has now asked all states to ready data of those who were hospitalised with Covid after vaccination. Experts said the information will be used to explore a theory that states Covid is mostly mild after vaccination. States have also been asked to collect data on vaccination coverage, hospitalisations, treatment protocols and duration of hospital stay in the vaccinated. Senior ICMR epidemiologist Dr Samiran Panda said states are encouraged to upload the data on a common portal. “I strongly feel this data will help states understand how vaccines are helpful in reducing hospitalisation and the burden on health infrastructure,” said Dr Panda. The national Covid-19 vaccination programme started on January 16. Experts said it is important to collect the states’ information on a common portal as research on vaccine effectiveness can help ease hesitancy. “I would encourage all states to start the drive. The ICMR can help states understand the impact of the vaccination drive,” added Dr Panda. Former union health secretary K Sujatha Rao said it would be interesting to know how many from this number have been hospitalised with moderate or severe symptoms after vaccination. “This data could definitely help address vaccine hesitancy,” said Rao. Dr Sanjay Patil, chairman of the IMA’s Hospital Board of India, Pune, said many doctors have observed that severity of Covid post vaccination is “very less”. “It is very crucial to start recording the status of vaccination at this point of time. Good data will help in effective control and management of Covid,” said Dr Patil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-icmr-to-ask-states-for-data-on-covid-hospitalisation-after-jabs/articleshow/82868479.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Aurangabad||3 held for killing murder accused, more arrests likely||Aurangabad: A murder accused was bludgeoned to death on Friday night after being dragged out of a hotel in MIDC Waluj area. Swinging into action, police nabbed three of the eight suspects on Saturday and concluded it to be a case of revenge murder. The deceased has been identified as Vishal alias Maddya Phate (26) of Wadgaon Kolhati, a criminal on police record having cases of robbery, attempt to murder and murder registered against him. Police said that even on Thursday the accused had allegedly refused to pay for the fish he took from a shop while threatening the shop owner of dire consequences. Police said that Maddya, with the help of his three accomplices, had brutally murdered one Yogesh Pradhan on May 17, 2020 and even had smashed his face using a boulder. He had secured bail in that case around three months ago. MIDC Walujs’s inspector Amol Potdar said that arrested accused identified as Sachin Pradhan (29), his brother Ajay (23) and Atish Kale (34), all residents of Wadgaon Kolhati were arrested from Patoda village where they were hiding after committing the murder on Friday night. A manhunt for two identified and three unidentified suspects has been launched, the officer said. Yogesh’s kin and friends on Friday night upon learning that Vishal was staying at Mrungani Hotel, reached there and attacked him. After thrashing him brutally, the accused smashed his head using boulders and fled from the scene. On learning about it, Vishal’s teenaged brother Abhijit reached the spot. He along with the police rushed him to Government Medical College and Hospital, where he was declared brought dead. Preliminary probe has revealed that the accused wanted to avenge the murder of their kin by eliminating Maddya on the death anniversary of Yohesh, but could not trace him on that day. Following the incident, multiple teams have been rushed in different directions to nab the suspects. Taking cognizance of the fact that the hotel was operating despite restrictions, authorities have ordered action against the hotel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/3-held-for-killing-murder-accused-more-arrests-likely/articleshow/82863258.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: School raises Rs 4 lakh for matheran horse owners||If sisters Rida and Dania Khan, students of Mahim's Bombay Scottish School, could collect Rs 4 lakh through a crowdfunding campaign to help horses and their owners at Matheran, credit must also go to the school’s principal Sunita George. George read a recent news article in The Times of India about the toll of the lockdown on 450 equines and 235 licensed horse owners in Matheran and shared it in the school's WhatsApp group. Subsequently, the Khan sisters—Rida (class 10) and Dania (Class 8)—initiated a crowdfunding campaign. “We have already distributed 100 ration kits, of 25 kg each, among the horse owners while 50 ration kits and 15000 kgs of fodder will be distributed soon,” said Rida, praising her principal for motivating students to do social service. “Principal madam has regularly emphasized on social service. She shared the news of the plight of horses in Matheran with our class teacher who told us about it. And we got right down to crowdfunding,” said Rida. George said that under the Socially Useful and Productive Works (SUPW) programme, students are regularly told and encouraged to participate in works aimed at ameliorating conditions of the disadvantaged in society. “Now that teaching takes place online, our students use digital platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram to raise awareness,” she said. About the help which is pouring in for the horses and their owners in Matheran, George said. “I have been going to Matheran for years and was shocked by the TOI news that these horses and their owners were on the verge of starvation. I am glad our students initiated the crowdfunding campaign and collected money to buy ration and fodder.” The principal added that the school’s “Perspective-360 degree” programme engages students in debates and discussions on themes related to gender stereotyping, mental health and other social issues. “Students are encouraged to argue candidly. This helps in building confidence and enabling them to develop thinking logically,” she said. She added that the students initiated crowdfunding for drivers and conductors of the school buses too in the run-up to the recent lockdown when buses stood still, rendering their staff jobless.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-school-raises-rs-4-lakh-for-matheran-horse-owners/articleshow/82868492.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin
---||Pune||Curbs may be lifted in phases after June 1: Maharashtra health minister||PUNE: State health minister Rajesh Tope on Saturday dropped hint that the Maharashtra government might consider easing some of the restrictions in a phased manner after June 1, provided the positivity rate dropped below 10% and there was adequate health infrastructure and medicines. “The government will assess the situation in the last week of May. If the positivity rate falls below 10% and the number of active cases comes down, the state may consider easing some restrictions,” Tope said. He said the government would take a cautious approach in view of the impending threat of a third wave and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray would announce the final decision. “There is a dip in the positivity rate, but the situation has to be analysed properly. The state may slowly consider easing restrictions if the number of active cases go down and 50% beds are vacant. We have to determine what is the position of the positivity rate in the state, the active daily cases and the infrastructure. Everything must be considered if we decide on slowly reducing the restrictions in a phased manner. However, no one can let their guard down this time around and strict Covid protocols have to be followed to bring the cases down further,” Tope told TOI. After being among the states with the highest positivity rate for weeks, the state has finally managed to get its positivity rate below 15%. According to the central government health ministry’s presentation, the state’s positivity rate on Saturday was 12%. State surveillance expert Dr Pradeep Awate said the positivity rate in the state was expected to reduce further. “Present restrictions are just a pause button and collateral damages would be much more if we continue to be closed longer. As the transmission decreases, we need to open up in a steady and cautious manner,” he said. The lockdown-like curbs were first imposed in the state on April 5 and they were made more stringent on April 15. The Centre in its daily briefing on Saturday said eight states, including Maharashtra, had more than one lakh Covid cases in the country. Karnataka led the list with 5.14 lakh cases, followed by Maharashtra with 3.67 lakh cases and Kerala with 3.06 lakh cases. The positivity rate is currently more than 10% in 23 districts in Maharashtra. Tamil Nadu led the tally with 37 districts, followed by Karnataka’s 29 districts. The positivity rate is over 10% in 28 districts in Odisha and 24 in Rajasthan. On Saturday, 18 states in the country had more than 15% positivity rate. A total of 14 states, including Maharashtra (12.04%), had a positivity rate in the range of 5-15% and four states had positivity less than 5%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/curbs-may-be-lifted-in-phases-after-june-1-tope/articleshow/82868481.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Nagpur||Unclean toilets deficiency in service: Forum fines railways Rs 60,000||Nagpur: Overlooking a complaint about soiled toilets has resulted in a fine of Rs 60,000 being slapped on the Railways. The Gondia Consumer Court, in perhaps a first-of-its-kind verdict in Maharashtra, said this can be termed as “deficiency in services” and “mental and physical harassment”. The judges – chairman Bhaskar Yogi and member Sarita Raipure – asked divisional railway managers (DRMs) of Central Railway in Mumbai and South East Central Railway (SECR) in the city, to pay the amount within a month. If they fail to, they would have to pay it with 15% interest from January 27, 2020, the date when the complaint was lodged. The fine includes Rs30,000 for mental and physical harassment, Rs15,000 for the cost of complaint, and Rs15,000 to be deposited in the forum’s Consumers’ Welfare Fund. Both the DRMs were directed to institute a divisional inquiry and recover the fine from the salaries of officials who failed to perform duties. Prachi Rathod, her daughter and one family member had boarded Geetanjali Express from Kalyan for travelling to Gondia on December 25, 2017. They had booked tickets in second AC. The toilets in the coach were dirty and choked. Due to the unbearable stink, her daughter suffered bouts of vomiting, said Sudhir Rathod who pleaded the case on his wife Prachi’s behalf. She then made an online complaint and also requested railway officials on the train to clean the toilets. However, none of her requests were entertained till the next day. At Nagpur station, she lodged a written complaint with ticket examiner DP Tiwari. Yet, no one came to clean the toilets till Gondia. She then filed another complaint with the station superintendent on December 31. Even after repeatedly enquiring about the fate of her complaints, she failed to get any response from the railway authorities. She then sought information under the RTI Act, where she was informed that a Kolkata-based firm GS&TS Limited was imposed a fine of Rs1,000 for dereliction of duties. She then approached the forum with her father’s help, demanding Rs1.10 lakh compensation for the mental and physical harassment and towards the cost of litigation. The respondents contended that other toilets were available in the coach and she could have used them. They informed that Tiwari had directed subordinates to clean the toilets after her complaint. They further argued that except her, none of the other passengers complained in this regard. However, the forum reminded respondents of their statutory duties as per the ‘citizens charter on passenger service’ and ‘duties of ticket examiners and conductors’ to maintain the coaches and other railway premises clean.  WHAT CONSUMER FORUM SAID * From railways own reply it was clear that wash rooms were choked * It was also proved that those were not cleared till train reached Gondia * From RTI reply, it was evident that Kolkata firm was slapped Rs1,000 fine * Citizens charter entrusts responsibility on rlys to maintain clean premises * It’s ticket examiner duty to ensure cleanliness of coaches as per rules||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/unclean-toilets-deficiency-in-service-forum-fines-railways-rs-60000/articleshow/82865849.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Dehradun||Residents say it’s difficult to get e-pass in emergency, cops should not harass people who move out in unavoidable circumstances||Dehradun: Even as the district administration is issuing e-passes to the people who need to move out of their houses during the state-wide lockdown due to unavoidable circumstances, locals say that policemen are harassing those who step out in emergencies. Residents have also demanded that plumbers, electricians, and other maintenance workers should be allowed to move and not be harassed by cops at checkpoints. Mridul Kumar, a resident of EC Road, said, “Recently, the faucet in my kitchen broke off and the water stored in the tank started leaking. Subsequently, I persuaded a plumber to visit my home and fix the faucet. After waiting for 30 minutes, I got a call from him and he told me that he is being penalised by the cops for moving out without an e-pass. I tried to convince the cops but they fined him nonetheless. Later, I had to pay his service charges and his challan amount as well.” Another resident in Jogiwala faced a similar issue two days back after a short circuit disrupted the power supply in his house. “Firstly, no one was ready for a home visit and when one electrician finally agreed to come, he was stopped by the cops. These are emergency services too and in such cases, there is hardly any time to apply for an e-pass. Only those who cannot establish the reason for their movement should be fined,” said the local who wished to remain anonymous. The residents pointed out that people offering such essential services are not technically sound and face issues in getting an e-pass made. When queried on the issue, Dehradun district magistrate Ashish Srivastava told TOI, “Home delivery of essential services and products has been allowed for the convenience of the people.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/residents-say-its-difficult-to-get-e-pass-in-emergency-cops-should-not-harass-people-who-move-out-in-unavoidable-circumstances/articleshow/82865218.cms||Abhijeet Singh
---||Aurangabad||Maharashtra: Nanded gurdwara plans to set up med college & hospital with 50 years’ donations||AURANGABAD: Sachkhand Hazur Saheb Abchalnagar Gurdwara, Nanded, is planning to establish a super-speciality hospital and medical college by using donations received by the gurdwara board in the past 50 years. The proposal has been moved by the gurdwara high priest, Jathedar Baba Kulwanth Singhji (Babaji), and is awaiting the board’s approval. Those privy to the development said the proposal came forward after Babaji fell ill last year and was under treatment in Aurangabad. However, he had to be taken to Mumbai for treatment as his health had started deteriorating. According to the proposal, the medical facility should be established either in Nanded or Aurangabad, so that people from the region are not forced to travel all the way to Hyderabad or Mumbai for treatment. A video of Babaji proposing to utilise the gold received in donations by the gurdwara in the past five decades for setting up hospital, medical college and even educational institutes imparting quality education has been uploaded on social media. Board president Bhupinder Singh Manhas, however, said that there were enough funds with the gurdwara and the need to use gold may not arise. “Anyway, the cost of land is zero as there is enough of that,” he said. In Aurangabad, a trust has already come forward for transferring over 200 acre of land for the project while about 90 acre of land has also been earmarked in Nanded. Sachkhand Huzuri Khalsa Diwan’s president Sardar Manjith Singh has come out in support of the proposal. He said, “We have already supported Babaji’s proposal and waiting for the board’s nod.” Manhas said, “We are seriously considering the proposal. It will be taken up for discussion in the upcoming meeting.” Manhas recalled that in 2013, the 1984 batch IAS officer Vijay Satbir Singh, who was heading the board then, had proposed a hospital. “That was followed by passing of a resolution as well as paying initial process fee, but somehow things did not move forward,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/nanded-gurdwara-planning-to-set-up-med-college-hosp/articleshow/82863286.cms||Mohammed Akhef

---||Nagpur||Tauktae result of climate change, expect more cyclones in coming years: Experts||Nagpur: According to experts, climate change is a crucial factor behind Cyclone Tauktae which went on to become the fifth-strongest storm in Arabian Sea over a mere 48 hours and impacted weather systems around nine states. A detailed analysis presented by Climate Trends highlights experts’ views on what made the cyclone such a huge disaster. As per them, Tauktae has established an invariable relationship between global warming and cyclogenesis. “It is now a well-known fact that the global ocean has absorbed 90% of the excess heat generated by greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions since 1970. This has led to anomalous ocean warming in Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal, which in turn makes cyclones intensify rapidly. Heat is energy, and cyclones intensify rapidly by turning the potential energy stored in the ocean to kinetic energy,” said Matthew Roxy Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune. Normally, during May, the sea surface temperatures (SST) across Arabian Sea are around 28-29 degree Celsius. “But this season saw an unprecedented rise. Over threshold SST to the tune of 30°C -31°C across Arabian Sea gave rapid intensification to the storm,” the analysis stated. With Tauktae, this will be the fourth consecutive year of pre-monsoon cyclone over the Arabian Sea. This is also the third consecutive year when a cyclone has come very close to the west coast of India. “It is very rare that a cyclonic storm with such high intensity is seen hitting the coast. This indicates the direct impact of global warming. Above threshold sea surface temperatures across Arabian Sea, particularly over east-central and adjoining northeast Arabian Sea that is known for comparatively cooler temperatures, kept on strengthening the cyclone,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president, meteorology at Skymet Weather. Experts warn that it is now clear that India will see more frequent cyclones every year due to global warming. “The past couple of years have seen a surge in the occurrence and severity of these cyclones which were a rare phenomenon earlier. The Arabian sea has sunk the carbons we have emitted into the atmosphere leading it to be warmer and more acidic. The warm oceans feed into cyclone systems that have devastating impacts on the life people in the coastal areas. India has one of the longest coastlines of 7500 km and therefore our vulnerabilities to the cyclones are exposed every time a new cyclone makes a landfill,” said Anjal Prakash, research director and adjunct associate professor at Bharti Institute of Public Policy, Indian School of Business. Adding that the present infrastructure is not tuned into catering to extreme events, Prakash said, “Our coastal infrastructure needs to be climate-resilient.” Stating more mitigation measures, Koll said, “Rapid intensification of cyclones need to be closely monitored at higher resolution and accuracy using on-site platforms such as buoys and moorings, Improving the Indian Ocean Observing System (IndOOS) and incorporating the global warming signals in the weather models can help us tackle the challenges of intense cyclones in the future.” WHAT EXPERTS SAY - Climate change is a crucial factor behind cyclone Tauktae - Global ocean has absorbed 90% of the excess heat generated by greenhouse gas emissions since 1970 - Led to anomalous ocean warming in Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal, which in turn makes cyclones intensify rapidly - India will see more frequent cyclones every year due to global warming - Coastal infrastructure needs to be climate-resilient - Rapid intensification of cyclones need to be closely monitored||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/tauktae-result-of-climate-change-expect-more-cyclones-in-coming-years-experts/articleshow/82868507.cms||Manka Behl
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Learnt survival lessons from last year’s lockdown||KOLKATA: I have been selling fruits at Mechhua for 25 years and I am lucky to have a large number of customers who have been buying from me for years. Having gone through last year’s nationwide lockdown, we had learnt a lot of lessons in our survival battle. As a consequence, when partial restrictions came into effect this time around, we were quick to set in motion our contingency plan knowing that stricter restrictions were on the way. For the past one week, our plan has been working successfully and helping us deal with the situation. Now, I have employed quite a number of people who go out for fruit deliveries throughout the city on their cycles. I have hired a place for them to stay at Mecchua till the situation improves and I provide for their food too. We have clients in places like Burrabazar, Phoolbagan, Ballygunj and Lake Town. We take area-wise orders and send them through our men in yellow cabs that we had arranged in advance, knowing that a crisis might happen and people would not be able to come to us to pick up fruits. Our customers are happily giving us a small extra amount for the taxi fare that we are incurring and dividing it among the workers. There are families who order in bulk and get us connected to others too. People have been ordering for mangoes in large quantities from me because the Himsagar varieties have filled the market. Some families are even ordering for 20 kilos at a time so that it lasts for an entire week. We are also sending watermelons and papaya in large quantities to various households. Lichies too have just arrived and I have started getting orders for the same. Sitting here I am selling only 40 per cent of what I used to in normal times but orders are pouring in over phones and we are more than making up for the business we have lost. I am happy that I did not have to ask any of my employees to look elsewhere for a job.

---||Lucknow||Three pvt Covid hosps face FIR for fleecing patients||Lucknow: The district administration will lodge FIR against three private Covid hospitals in the city after a probe found them overcharging and fleecing patients. The decision was taken after an investigating team of officials, including SDM, city magistrate and senior doctors submitted their report to Covid-19 nodal officer Roshan Jacob. FIR will be lodged against one hospital in Gomtinagar and two on Rae Bareli road near Utratia and Mohanlalganj. The CMO will file a written complaint to police on Sunday. In the inquiry, officials found the Gomtinagar hospital was charging Rs 3,000 for RTPCR test but didn’t give the original bill. The hospital had charged fees under various heads, like ward charge, physician visit, oxygen handling, nursing, ICU and others. “The government approved Covid-19 package is Rs 18,000 per day, including treatment of hypertension, uncontrollable diabetes, bed, food, nursing care, monitoring, emergency test, visiting charges, consultancy, medical test and hemodialysis. The hospitals found charging more than approved rates will be booked under the Epidemic Diseases Act,” said an officer. Similarly, a private hospital in Mohanlalganj run by a BAMS doctor was found charging Rs 50,000 per patient for 24 hours. Investigation by SDM Sarojininagar revealed that the doctor was ICU in-charge in hospital records but no other staff was found during the probe though it claimed to have nine employees. The hospital never provided bills even though from April 1 to May 20 it admitted 58 Covid patients out of which 13 succumbed. The hospital in Utratia was found treating Covid patients though it was not a Covid facility. One corona patient died on Saturday and the kin paid Rs 6.60 lakh but the hospital gave a bill of Rs 3.93 lakh. The hospital was charging Rs 15,272 daily for blood tests, including LFT, KFT. A prominent private hospital in Dubagga was issued a stern warning after it agreed to return excess fees to the patients and filed an affidavit in this regard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/three-pvt-covid-hosps-face-fir-for-fleecing-patients/articleshow/82868510.cms||---

Bansal’s role will be to put in place a roadmap for the organisation which is expected to be an ‘evangelist’ in banking and financial services technology for the larger public good. He will also advise RBI on desirable innovations and their viability with emerging technology. Bansal has over 25 years of experience in designing technology-led population-scale payment products, electronic cash transfers, digital financial services, and digital IDs to enable inclusive development in India and multiple Asian and African markets. He has earlier served at the RBI in various capacities in the areas of technology, financial inclusion and payment systems. RBI had set up the innovation hub last year to facilitate faster innovation. The hub will be managed by a governing council with Senapathy Gopalakrishnan (Kris), co-founder and former co-chairman, Infosys as the first chairman. The hub will work on developing core capabilities in the fields like information security, analytics and electronic payments. It will also monitor and ensure that the implementation of such initiatives promotes access to and inclusion of financial services and products. It is expected to play a role beyond banking as the hub will build partnerships across regulators and government ministries for system-wide innovation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/rbi-appoints-rajesh-bansal-as-head-of-its-innovation-hub/articleshow/82870133.cms||---

His reaction came in the wake of Amarinder hinting that Sidhu might join AAP. Sidhu tweeted: “Prove one meeting that I have had with another party’s leader. I have never asked anyone for any post till date. All I seek is Punjab’s prosperity. (I) was invited & offered cabinet berths many times, but I did not accept. Now, our esteemed high command has intervened. Will wait.” On April 27, Amarinder had said in an interview to a private channel: “I think may be he is planning to join the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) or go somewhere else.. he can answer that.” Sources said even during his meeting with other Congress MLAs to pressure the chief minister to take concrete action in cases of sacrilege and police firing, Sidhu had told them that he was loyal to the Gandhi family and had no plans to quit the Congress. Party in charge for Punjab affairs Harish Rawat and Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar have said the party’s central leadership was seized of the political developments in Punjab and would soon have a communication with party MLAs. Sidhu has been critical of the chief minister after the Punjab and Haryana high court had last month quashed a probe into the 2015 Kotkapura firing incident. Jakhar had on Thursday cautioned party workers against “a few leaders” who were always trying to seek opportunities in any crisis by seeking accolades with an ultimatum to the government. He said the party high command was monitoring their actions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/navjot-sidhu-to-capt-prove-that-i-want-to-switch-sides/articleshow/82868533.cms||---

The ACB officials said preliminary probe has revealed that the complainant and Ambhure hail from the same village and knew each other. “The police officer was reluctant to directly accept the bribe amount, due to which Ambhure was roped in. We are trying to confirm whether he was roped in by the officer or the complainant,” said an officer from the Jalna ACB. Khade cited said the complainant has stated that he was framed in a false case under sections of The Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (prevention of atrocities) act and Khiradkar, the investigation officer in the case, sought bribe of Rs 5 lakh.

I will be asking the PM to help these states so that they can overcome the disaster,” he said, adding that in Maharashtra, where he hails from, farmers have faced tremendous losses due to destruction of mango trees. The seasonal Hapus mango crop was ruined due to the uprooting of hundreds of trees, he said. Once the committee formed at the Centre to study the cyclone destruction in states completes the survey, the Union government will provide necessary relief funds, Athawale said. The Centre will not be partial towards any state in providing relief, be it ruling or opposition governments, he said. Athawale said that the second Covid wave has proven more dangerous as it has taken the lives of many persons, especially young people. He said that the positivity rate is expected to decrease in the next 10-15 days. “The government is being criticised for sending vaccinations to other countries, but at that time the positivity rate in India was low and nobody knew that there will be such a scenario. The Centre had its reasons to help others,” he said. About the upcoming assembly elections in Goa, Athwale said he would be negotiating with chief minister Pramod Sawant to try and get at least two seats for the Republican Party of India (RPI) to contest. “If we won’t be given seats, then we will contest from 4-5 seats in the state, and in at other places, we will support BJP candidates,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/will-seek-centres-help-for-cyclone-relief-athawale/articleshow/82868606.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Akali Dal demands sacking of Randhawa over cheating case||Chandigarh: Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Saturday asked Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh to sack cooperation minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa immediately following registration of a cheating case against his official personal assistant. SAD leaders said the cabinet minister should not be absolved for corrupt activities in his office. Former minister and party spokesman Daljit Singh Cheema said the involvement of Randhawa’s personal assistant in a cheating case involving delivery of sugar worth Rs 74 lakh, for which only Rs 57 lakh payment was made, came to light earlier. “Even the high court, while hearing the case yesterday, asked the state bureau of investigation to constitute an SIT to probe how the accused indulged in this case as well as other cases of cheating repeatedly. The high court has also asked the government to explain why the minister’s PA, who is stated to be the mastermind behind this cheating case, has not been arrested so far,” said the SAD leader. Dr Cheema said it has been several days since the cheating case came to light. He said it was learned that Randhawa’s PA used the minister’s office to strike such deals. Despite this, the government was not arresting the PA, he alleged. “It is clear that the minister is shielding his PA to ensure that skeletons in the former’s closet do not come tumbling down,” the Akali leader alleged. The SAD has demanded a fair inquiry into the matter, saying that it cannot be done as long as Randhawa remains in office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/akali-dal-demands-sacking-of-randhawa-over-cheating-case/articleshow/82868570.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Away from homeland, no vaccination adds to Covid plight||NEW DELHI: After a Myanmarese refugee living in west Delhi died of Covid-19, the landlord asked his fellow inhabitants to vacate the house. This is only one aspect of the adversity brought upon refugees from Myanmar, Afghanistan and Pakistan by the novel coronavirus pandemic. They are ineligible for the vaccine under the current process and thus bear the social stigma of being risky communities. “They had arrived in India only a few weeks ago after the recent violence in Myanmar,” said Ruata Fanai, chairman of the Chin Refugee Committee (CRC), of the beleaguered refugees in west Delhi. “We don’t have money for tests or medicine, but more importantly, we can’t get vaccinated because the rules require specific ID papers, and there is misery all around.” Fanai said that most of the 3,200 registered Chin refugees, who hail from the Burmese province abutting Mizoram, work as factory workers, labourers and house maids in Delhi. They are Christians and most of them live in Vikaspuri, Budhela, Hastsal, Chanakya Place and Uttam Nagar. “People who have left their houses and country behind have nothing to sustain themselves during a lockdown. United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is not helping either,” claimed Fanai. Danasty Kelnilen, secretary, CRC, disclosed that four refuges had been claimed by Covid, while over a hundred have been infected. The number of Burmese refugees in Delhi has increased after the recent political upheaval in Myanmar. He added that the Chin community had set up a small isolation centre at a church in Janakpuri to help the infected individuals. With the Aadhaar card or a government IDs mandatory for registering for Covid vaccination, the refugees have no prospect of getting the protective jab. Sabber Kyaw Min, director, Rohingya Human Rights Initiative, revealed that many pleas for making the refugees’ UNHCR documents eligible for their inoculation registration have gone unheard. Min said, “Many cases of infection are being reported among Rohingyas in Delhi and Haryana. But they have been refused vaccination due to the lack of a government ID. UNHCR should help us in some way.” He also alleged that unlike last year, no ration was being distributed in the refugee camps this time. There are also complaints that landlords have increased the rents for those who are leasing rooms. It is estimated that there are around 900 registered Rohingya refugees in the city, mostly settled in Shram Vihar camp and Kanchan Kunj camp near Madanpur Khadar in southeast Delhi. While Shram Vihar houses around 100 families, the Kanchan Vihar camp has around 55 families. Most of the people work as labourers, domestic workers, grocers and ragpickers. Refugees from Afghanistan are also facing similar struggles. Surbeer Singh, a 39-year-old Afghan Sikh who fled Afghanistan last year and has since been living in Delhi, said the risk of Covid had increased so much, but he and the over 80 refugee families can only hope to receive the vaccine. “We will be grateful to the government of India if that happens. We have approached an NGO for assistance,” added Singh. Parvinder Singh Nanda, director, United Sikhs, an NGO that has helped rehabilitate the refugees, said the organisation was considering options on the issue, including approaching the local MLA and the area sub-divisional magistrate. “Since these people don’t have proper documentation, far less an Aadhaar card, it is difficult for them to get vaccinated in the current process,” said Nanda. “We have approached Aam Aadmi Party’s Tilak Nagar MLA Jarnail Singh for assistance and he has assured us of their inoculation soon. Their passports may be used as identity proof.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/away-from-homeland-no-vax-adds-to-covid-plight/articleshow/82865290.cms||Paras Singh
---||Mumbai||May ease curbs in Maharashtra if positivity rate under 10%: Rajesh Tope||PUNE: State health minister Rajesh Tope on Saturday hinted that the Maharashtra government may consider easing a few restrictions in a phased manner after June 1, provided the positivity rate dropped below 10% and there was adequate health infrastructure and medicines. “The government will assess the situation in the last week of May. If the positivity rate falls below 10% and the number of active cases comes down, then the state may consider easing some of the restrictions,” said Tope. He added that the government would take a cautious approach in view of the impending threat of a third wave and CM Uddhav Thackeray would announce the final decision. “There is a dip in the positivity rate, but the situation has to be analysed properly. The state may slowly consider easing restrictions if the number of active cases goes down and 50% beds are vacant. We have to determine the position of the positivity rate in the state, the active daily cases and the infrastructure. However, no one can let their guard down this time around and strict Covid protocol has to be followed to bring the cases down further,” Tope told TOI.After being among the states with the highest positivity rate for weeks, the state has finally managed to get its positivity rate below 15%. According to the central government health ministry’s presentation, the state’s positivity rate on Saturday was 12%. The lockdown-like curbs were first imposed in the state on April 5 and they were made more stringent on April 15. The Centre on Saturday said in its daily briefing that eight states, including Maharashtra, had more than one lakh Covid cases in the country. Karnataka led the list with 5.14 lakh cases, followed by Maharashtra with 3.67 lakh cases and Kerala with 3.06 lakh cases. The positivity rate is currently more than 10% in 23 districts in Maharashtra. Tamil Nadu led the tally with 37 districts, followed by Karnataka’s 29 districts. The positivity rate is above 10% in 28 districts in Odisha and 24 in Rajasthan. On Saturday, 18 states in the country had more than 15% positivity rate. A total of 14 states, including Maharashtra (12.04%), had a positivity rate in the range of 5-15% and four states had positivity less than 5%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/tope-may-ease-curbs-in-maharashtra-if-positivity-rate-under-10/articleshow/82870215.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Lucknow||UP: Patients’ kin demand panel to probe fleecing by hospitals||Lucknow: As complaints of private hospitals overcharging patients during the second wave of coronavirus pandemic continue to pour in, families have demanded that the district administration should set up an inquiry committee or a commission where they can lodge complaints for justice. While the district administration has already formed such a committee for grievance redressal on the directions of the high court, most people are not aware of it due to lack of publicity. Families of patients told TOI that most hospitals keep all treatment records with them. Some take only cash for treatment and do not provide pucca bills. Even prescription for drugs is not given on official letterhead. All this makes it difficult for people to substantiate that they were overcharged. Geeta Singh, mother of Ila Singh of Faridinagar, was diagnosed with Covid-19 and admitted to a hospital in Aliganj on April 29. As the centre had minimum resources for Covid management, Ila got her mother shifted to a bigger hospital within 12 hours, but she was asked to pay Rs 1.2 lakh for treatment for such a short duration. Later, her mother succumbed to the disease. “I complained to the chief medical officer (CMO) in writing and the SDM went to the facility to probe the matter. The hospital did not give us the hard copy of the bill even when asked for it and also ignored requests for the soft copy. We had no proof except that we had made a transaction through a card and are now approaching our bank to help us track the account to which the payment was made. The hospital told the SDM that we did not ask for a bill,” Ila said. “When a patient is critical, a family doesn’t think of collecting evidence. If educated families with resources like us are facing problems, just imagine the condition of the poor. There should be a commission to probe how these hospitals are fleecing patients,” she demanded. The 58-year-old maternal uncle of Sumedha Dwivedi died on May 13 while waiting to be admitted to the ICU even as the family kept trying to arrange Rs 2 lakh cash demanded by a hospital in Gomtinagar. “My uncle was first referred to a private hospital in Indiranagar but it denied admission saying the patient needed a ventilator which was not available there. We then contacted another private hospital in Gomtinagar which asked for Rs 2 lakh cash before admission,” she claimed. “I believe that if a proper inquiry is done, it will establish how much this hospital made during Covid surge,” she added. “The administration should take strong steps. An online portal for complaints should be made and inquiry should be done by a credible agency keeping in mind the fact that most families have no bills,” said Alok Kumar, whose father-in-law succumbed to Covid at a private hospital which charged a huge amount from the family for treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/patients-kin-demand-panel-to-probe-fleecing-by-hosps/articleshow/82868563.cms||Yusra Husain
---||Dehradun||Farmers’ body opens free-of-cost 30-bed Covid facility in Bazpur||Rudrapur: From businessmen to NGOs, from housewives to youths, almost every section of the society is coming forward to help others in need during the second and more deadly wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in Uttarakhand. This time, farmers of the Terai region have pooled their resources to help the Covid-infected. The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), a farmers’ association, has opened a 30-bed facility for Covid-19 patients in Bazpur town of Udham Singh Nagar district. The facility — set up in the langar (community kitchen) hall of Gurdwara Shri Guru Singh Sabha — will provide free-of-cost treatment to those in need. Jagtar Singh Bajwa, the spokesperson of SKM, told TOI, “We have been protesting at the Ghazipur border (near Delhi) against the three agri-reform laws notified last year but we always kept a tab on the prevailing Covid-19 situation back home in Uttarakhand. In such testing times, we wanted to help out people in need and thus, came up with the idea of opening a free facility for Covid-19 patients.” In a similar vein, Gurpreet Singh Rummy, president of the Indirapuram Gurdwara management committee, said, “We are planning to start such centres in Kashipur and Rudrapur towns as well. Besides, we are contacting the Gurdwara management committees in hilly areas to arrange more such facilities where people from remote areas can be administered free-of-cost treatment.” Notably, Rummy has been running drives to provide medical oxygen for free to the people in need in Delhi. Bajwa added that doctors associated with Khalsa Help International, a social organisation founded by Rummy, will look after the patients in the new Bazpur facility. “We were supported by the officials of the Gurdwara management committee who let us have the ground floor of the religious place. Subsequently, we converted the space into a Covid-19 care facility in just two days.” Elaborating on the facilities in the free-of-cost Covid-19 care centre in Bazpur, Karm Singh Padda, state president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), said, “Oxygen concentrators, cylinders, beds, emergency medical equipment and a medicine counter have been installed at the centre. We will soon be installing ventilators as well. The patients will be administered free-of-cost treatment here. We will also serve free meals to the patients and their attendants.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/farmers-body-opens-free-of-cost-30-bed-covid-facility-in-bazpur/articleshow/82865282.cms||Aakash Ahuja

Parents working for the private sector, who currently cannot afford to pay the entire tuition fee amount are allowed to plead for extra time to school authorities. Schools are, however, not allowed to debar any student from online classes or exams, over non-payment of tuition. Also, the says that schools are allowed to charge only the tuition fees, provided they are conducting the online classes, and under no circumstances can charge any other component of the fee.

---||Chandigarh||Mann, Chadha write to Modi, urge him to resume talks with farmers||Chandigarh: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi requesting him to resume talks with the farmers’ leaders opposing the agricultural marketing laws. AAP Punjab president Bhagwant Mann and Punjab affairs co-incharge Raghav Chadha wrote the letter stating that the farmers of Punjab, along with various other states, had been protesting on the Delhi borders for the last six months. They had so far lost 470 of their fellows during the agitation, they added. Though 11 rounds of talks had been held between the farmers’ representatives and Union ministers to find a solution to the problem, no conclusion had been reached. The government has not made any attempt to negotiate with the farmers since January 22, 2021, which is not in the interest of the farmers or the nation, they added. The leaders said farmers were the backbone of the country and without agriculture this country could not be imagined. They said that even during the Covid pandemic, there had been a sharp decline in all sectors except agriculture. “With the strengthening of the agricultural sector, the rural infrastructure of Punjab and the rest of the country has survived,” they said. In their letter, the AAP leaders said now that the farmers’ leaders had once again called for talks, the Prime Minister should also accept the invitation with “humility and generosity and resume talks” on the issue. The AAP leaders appealed that in the interest of the entire country and all sections of the society, the Union government should withdraw all the three laws pertaining to the agriculture sector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mann-chadha-write-to-modi-urge-him-to-resume-talks-with-farmers/articleshow/82868555.cms||---

Last year the situation was not as tense as this. The second wave has really made people retreat into their shells and they are avoiding outside food. Added to this is the fact that thousands of offices in this area, both government and private, have also shut temporarily. They made up for a large client base. We would get orders throughout the day but now we are depending only on orders that are coming from private residences. There is more than 30 per cent drop in business suddenly. We hope that business picks up once the restrictions are lifted. We are hearing that the curve is coming down and I pray to god that this becomes true. For people like us, the situation is very scary. We risk our lives and continue to keep the delivery chain alive because our livelihood depends on this. But if business dries up like this, where will we go? Towards the evening some orders flow in but they are small orders for snacks. The big lunch and dinner orders are not showing up. Most eateries are offering good discounts to attract customers and are also publicising on social media. We are also scared of the cyclone Yaas that is coming next week. We don’t know what impact it will leave for us in its trail and for how many days we have to deal with it. Normally after a disaster strikes, people think of survival first and not about ordering food from a restaurant. All delivery boys are praying that the cyclone does not leave the city devastated in the same way Amphan did last year. It will then take a longer while for us to come back on track.

The cabinet minister also said that before raising a finger on him, the Akalis should volunteer themselves for probing their own misdeeds during a decade-long rule. He added that in the dearth of any issues against him, the SAD leaders were indulging in “cheap tantrums” and “misleading people” on pretext of a former private secretary provided to him by the government. Randhawa said SAD spokesperson Daljit Singh Cheema had himself remained a minister, he forgot that Bachittar, who comes from ministerial staff, was attached with him as he is a minister and is not his personal staff. The minister said as a fact of matter, he had got Bachittar transferred out of his staff on March 3. Randhawa also said he had himself called up the director, bureau of investigation, and assured them of full support and cooperation in the matter. “I am ready for any probe into this matter as it has nothing to do with me,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/probe-your-own-misdeeds-says-minister-to-akalis/articleshow/82868603.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Lab faces action for delay in uploading test reports||Lucknow: Following complaints regarding delay of up to one month in online updation on government portal about Covid-19 cases by a prominent private pathology, the nodal officer for Covid-19 management in Lucknow, Roshan Jacob, has asked the state health administration to revoke the laboratory’s authorization to conduct RT-PCR tests. During inspection of records, it was found that the laboratory used to upload test reports of Covid-19 patients on the government portal after 15-30 days. The laboratory, which has several branches across India, was sending samples to its Gurugram-based pathology and uploaded the data on government portal from its zonal office. Sharing data of 15 random patients, officials said that in at least two cases the data was yet not uploaded though the samples were collected last month. “It was found that the private pathology clearly violated the guidelines laid down by central and state governments. Therefore, the director of state medical and health is advised to take stringent possible action against the laboratory and revoke their authorization for RT-PCR testing,” the letter, sent by the nodal officer to the state health administration said. Significantly, RT-PCR authorisation of this laboratory, along with two others, was revoked by health authorities last year in May when their labs allegedly gave false Covid-19 positive reports to some patients who later tested negative at KGMU. Later, their authorization for conducting tests was reinstated. Director-general, medical health, Dr D S Negi said, “We have not received any letter yet from the Covid nodal officer regarding testing anomalies or delay in uploadation of reports. Action will be taken after we receive the letter.” Asked why the authorization cancelled earlier was reinstated, Dr Negi said he was not at the helm of affairs at that time and would have to check the records.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lab-faces-action-for-delay-in-uploading-test-reports/articleshow/82868605.cms||---

The bridge had been washed away in rains in July last year. The Border Roads Organisation (BRO) completed its construction on May 5 this year. However, after incessant rains lashed all over Uttarakhand, an abutment of the bridge was damaged and vehicular movement was stopped on it. Sub divisional magistrate (SDM) of Munsyari Abhay Pratap Singh said that the BRO had been informed and that they would repair it soon.Vicky Chiral, a local resident, said that as the bridge was the only way to reach Munsyari from Jauljibi, vehicles are crossing a small stream, which is risky. Meanwhile, the Pithoragarh-Tanakpur national highway at Chupkot and Bhartoili were blocked on Friday evening, said a junior engineer with the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) PL Chaudhari. While the highway at Chupkot was cleared on Saturday afternoon, Bhartoli, where debris from a mudslide blocked three points on a 5km stretch, remains blocked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/bridge-damaged-in-rains-weeks-after-it-was-built/articleshow/82865296.cms||Prem Punetha

Healing touch, an initiative by these LU students has helped more than 200 families so far in 45 days. And as we know, a will to help is not enough, the ‘Healing Touch’ continued even after the teacher leading the initiative got infected. Also, student members whose parents tested positive continued to take SOS calls and provided support to infected families in the city. So far, incharge of the Institute of Management Sciences, Prof MK Agarwal and 13 LU management students have helped around 200 families in the city in the last 45 days. “Students are working round-the-clock to help infected families. From delivering food to families where everyone got infected to elderlies who didn’t have anyone to bring medicines and other essentials it was management students who rushed to help people,” said Prof Agarwal who himself got infected during the healing touch initiative and was admitted to King Georges’ Medical University for around four days after his oxygen levels dipped to 85. “I could not physically help students for around two weeks due to Covid and post Covid complications but the dedication of the students motivated me to be always available on phone,” he said. “Sir didn’t tell us that he was infected and we kept on calling him to help us with contacts of health officials. Also, like him there were other students whose parents were infected but they continued to help by taking SOS calls, researching, and contacting as many people as they can for plasma and other essentials,” said a BBA student Vaibhav Dwivedi. He said we had divided our Covid help team into four parts -- one was research team that had students Yash Vibhansh, Keshav Rai- Skand Rai, Aziz and Nihal khan who were always on the system to search and research any Covid related query asked by people, second one was the verification team that had Parul Gupta, Nandini Mishra, Vaibhav Dwivedi and Snehalata Yadav who ensured that patient was shifted to hospital only if beds were available, third was the data collection team that had Ananya Srivastava, Yash Vibhansh and Skand Rai that had all details of where and what prices the medicines, Remdesivir and oxygen cylinders are available and lastly the mapping team with Yash Srivastava, Jagriti and Aditi Singh that located patients that required help, he added. “Faculty helped us with contacts and even students had good contacts to extend help. At present, the families of two students is still infected but they are continuing with the services,”he said “A BBA student Jagriti’s father got infected and was admitted to King Georges Medical University, she took permission from KGMU officials and not only took care of her father but all elderlies in the Covid ward for 25 days.

While 186 people of the total 261 on the barge were rescued during the week, nine are still missing, and the search for them is on. Divers on board INS Makar will, at first light on Sunday, check if bodies of any of the missing men are stuck inside the barge or near it. Five of the recovered bodies are still to reach Mumbai’s shores, and of the 61 already at JJ Hospital, 43 have been identified. The city police on Saturday began collecting blood samples from the remaining 18 victims for DNA testing so that samples can be matched with relatives for identification. Police said samples of the five bodies that are on the way on naval ships may also have to be collected. In another development, Mumbai police said 9 more bodies were found washed ashore on Saturday—4 along Raigad coast, 4 at Valsad in Gujarat and one at Daman. Raigad cops claimed 8 decomposed bodies (and not 4) were found from the district’s coast. 41 bodies of P-305 personnel handed over to their familiesWhile the death toll of personnel of barge p-305 went up to 66, Mumbai police said 9 more bodies were recovered from Raigad (4), Valsad (4) and Daman (1), and Raigad police said 8 bodies were recovered from the district’s coast on Saturday. If Raigad police’s version is taken into consideration, then the number of bodies found along the coast on Saturday would be 13. The Raigad district administration has asked ONGC and Mumbai police to ascertain if the bodies are of those of people who were onboard P-305 or those on the tugboat Varaprada (which also capsized, with 11 of its men still missing) or of fishermen who were stuck in the waters when the cyclone hit the coast. Their blood samples may be taken too, police said. Raigad police said the first body was retrieved from Murud village, while the other 7 were recovered from Navgaon, Awas, Dighode and Kihim beaches in Alibaug taluka. Of the 43 bodies of P-305 staffers which have been identified, 41 have been handed over to their families. While warships INS Kochi and INS Kolkata sailed back to the naval dock on Saturday, INS Betwa, Teg and Talwar were joined by survey vessels INS Makar, Tarasa and Subhadra to locate the nine missing personnel and the tugboat’s wreckage. Coast Guard vessels, helicopters and ONGC offshore vessels have also been deployed. Mumbai police spokesperson, DCP S Chaitanya S said, “The Mumbai police has so far got 61 bodies. While 43 bodies have been identified, 41 of them have been handed over to relatives. The police are in the process of collecting DNA samples.” The blood samples of the victims and their relatives will be sent to the Kalina Forensic Sciences Laboratory. Relatives, kin and friends of those still missing continued to make the rounds of JJ Hospital, where the bodies that have been brought back have been kept. Udaram Ranawat (70), who is from Rajasthan and had come to JJ Hospital on Friday, returned to his hometown on Saturday with the body of his elder son, Pappuram (32), a crew member on the barge. His younger son, Amraram (30), who also worked on the same barge, went missing during the cyclone and is yet to be found. The family of engineer Anthony Edwin (27) had almost lost hope of getting to see his body after they got information on Saturday that the body brought to JJ Hospital could not be flown to Kerala as the flight on which it was to be taken had got cancelled. But another flight was later available, and the body was to reach Thiruvananthapuram late on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-41-bodies-of-p-305-personnel-handed-over-to-their-families/articleshow/82868633.cms||Mateen Hafeez
---||Mumbai||Three firms keen on supplying Sputnik to BMC quote Rs 1,500 for 2 doses||MUMBAI: The three companies that have expressed interest in supplying the Russian-made Sputnik V to the BMC have quoted a price of around $18-20 per vaccine, which is approximately Rs 1,500 for both the doses. While the BMC is open to shelling out around Rs 750 crore to buy 50 lakh vaccines, the civic body is now making attempts to confirm if the firms can actually supply these in three weeks’ time, as stated in its global expression of interest (EoI). While two proposals are from Indian firms, one is from a company registered in the UK. Top BMC officials held talks with the UK firm online on Saturday and asked if they would be able to meet the BMC’s delivery timeline. “All three firms have submitted their bids and the prices are around $18-20, which is around Rs 1,500. We had already expected that we will have to spend around Rs 300 crore to Rs 750 crore, depending on whether the bids were from Indian or international vaccine makers. We are now confirming if they can actually supply the given quantity and in the timeline we have specified. The price is one part, but they must be able to supply 1 crore doses in three weeks,” said P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner (projects), who heads the BMC’s vaccine procurement plan. Last week, the BMC floated a global EoI to buy 50 lakh vaccines or 1 crore doses in a bid to speed up its vaccination drive. The EoI was floated in a record time of 24 hours after it got a green signal from the state government to buy its own vaccines. On Thursday, the BMC received a fourth proposal from a vaccine maker which was also for supplying Sputnik V. The BMC is yet to receive a bid from this supplier though. Meanwhile, the BMC has requested the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) for supplying the vaccine directly. Municipal commissioner I S Chahal on Friday wrote to Kiril Dimitriev, CEO, RDIF, for direct procurement of 1 crore doses. “While we are talking to the companies that have bid in the EoI from the open market, we are also making an effort to go for government-to-government (G-to-G) procurement. So we have written to RDIF to request if they can help us buy directly from the manufacturers. So we are making efforts from both ends, the open market and government-to-government too,” Velrasu said. Sputnik V is developed by Gamaleya National Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology. RDIF is marketing the vaccine abroad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-3-firms-keen-on-supplying-sputnik-to-bmc-quote-rs-1500-for-2-doses/articleshow/82865329.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

They said that their initial priority was to temporarily provide power supply to households, and they are now aiming to erect new poles and pull transmission lines before the onset of the monsoons. Siddesh Velip, junior engineer at Benaulim sub-station, said that in his jurisdiction of Varca, Benaulim, and Colva, as many as 40 poles has been destroyed by the fierce winds caused by Cyclone Tauktae at various places. “I have submitted a detailed report to my superiors and the modalities are being worked out on procurement of poles, cables and labour,” he said. The junior engineer said that once he is provided the equipment, he will be racing against time to repair the present fragile power situation in his area. His counterpart Govind Bhat, junior engineer at Carmona sub-station, had a similar story to tell. He said that 38 poles in his area comprising three villages of Cavelossim, Carmona and Orlim have either been uprooted or broken. “I have already had a meeting with assistant and executive engineers, and the logistics are being worked out for speedy restoration of the poles and transmission,” he said. “A sizeable number of the poles run through fields and low-lying areas, hence we will start on a war-footing to restore these areas as it would be very difficult to take up work in the monsoon,” he added. Assistant engineer of these two sub-station, Nicolau Morraes said work is going to commence soon as he has already managed to identify and engage a contractor who will begin the work immediately along with his own staff. He also said that they have sufficient stock of poles, cables, insulators in the stores and hence its procurement will not be an issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/officials-race-against-time-to-fix-salcetes-power-damages/articleshow/82868651.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand government to give Rs 3,000 per month to Covid orphans||DEHRADUN: The Uttarakhand government on Saturday announced the Chief Minister Vatsalya Yojana to take care of those children, who lost their parents or the sole earning member of the family to Covid-19 infection. Under the scheme, the government would make arrangements for the education and training of these children till they attain the age of 21 years. According to the provisions of the scheme, an amount Rs 3,000 per month would be given to them. Besides, the district magistrates have been asked to ensure that their share of ancestral property is not sold till they turn adults. Also, such kids will be provided with 5% horizontal reservation in Uttarakhand government jobs. Chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat has directed the authorities to compile a list of such children at the earliest. “We are preparing a list of such children. Losing a parent or head of the family is a big loss and affects the growth and future of a child. Therefore, the government has decided to help these kids in all possible manner,” the CM said. Before Uttarakhand, several other states/UTs — including Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, and Delhi, among others — have announced such schemes. Earlier this week, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also announced that his government will take responsibility of those children who have lost their parents during the second wave of the Covid-19 in Uttar Pradesh. Meanwhile, CM Rawat, in a review meeting on Saturday, directed officials to remain prepared for the third wave and asked them to put a special focus on the health of children. He added that a detailed record should be maintained at block and district levels to keep a tab on the health of children. “In the past few days, we have recorded a decline in the number of Covid-19 cases but we need to remain careful,” the CM said. He added that the district magistrates need to have a village-wise plan ready for the third wave of the virus. CM Rawat also stressed on the need for proper biomedical waste disposal. “The department of urban development in municipalities and the panchayati raj department in rural areas should ensure proper biomedical waste disposal,” the CM said. “Necessary action should be taken to prevent black marketing. Compliance of norms like wearing a mask and social distancing should be strictly followed,” he added. The CM also laid thrust upon the need to focus more on the rural areas. “Effective implementation of decentralised planning should be ensured. The Asha and the ANM workers should be properly trained. The primary and the community health centres should also be prepared,” said Rawat. “To contain Covid-19 cases in rural areas, officials should involve gram sabhas as well. People living in remote areas should be provided with facilities like mobile testing vans, mobile labs, sampling vans for remote areas. Medical kits should be provided in rural pockets and quarantine centres in villages need to be equipped with necessary facilities,” he added. He further said that proposed and under-construction oxygen generation plants should be completed soon. “The oxygen supply has improved a lot in the state. Now, all our ICUs must be made operational soon. A real-time data entry of information related to Covid-19 needs to be maintained,” CM Rawat said. Meanwhile, chief secretary Om Prakash, during the meeting, said that there is a need to increase the testing, especially in rural areas. “Those coming from other states should be tested on priority. The participation of village committees in public awareness should be ensured,” said the chief secretary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarakhand-govt-launches-vatsalya-yojana-to-look-after-minors-orphaned-during-pandemic/articleshow/82865347.cms||Kautilya Singh

The family members of the deceased, Faisal, son of Mohd Islam of Bhatpuri locality of Bangarmau, alleged he was severely beaten up by two policemen — Vijay Chaudhary (constable) and Satya Prakash (home guard) — on Friday afternoon following which he succumbed to injuries. Both Vijay and Satya Prakash were suspended on Friday while another constable, Seemavat, was also suspended on Saturday for alleged involvement in the case. An FIR was filed against them under murder charges. Superintendent of police, Unnao, Sureshrao A Kulkarni said, “Faisal sustained head injury and eight contusions on his body. We are seeking medico-legal opinion to find out if it has been caused by assault. A named FIR has been lodged against the three accused.”  Around 2 pm on Friday, police constable Vijay Chaudhary and home guard Satya Prakash, posted at Bangarmau Kotwali police station of the district, had allegedly hit Faisal with a stick because he was found violating the corona curfew norms by selling vegetables on footpath at the local vegetable market. When Faisal resisted and tried to argue with the policemen, they took him into custody and brought him to Kotwali police station on their two-wheeler. Around 3.45 pm, Faisal’s family, waiting outside the Kotwali police station, came to know that his condition has deteriorated and he is experiencing severe pain in his chest. The police along with the family members rushed him to a nearby Community Health Centre where doctors stated his condition to be critical, and advised them to take him to the district hospital or some other better health facility. “While they were preparing a referral letter, Faisal died,” said his family member Sufiyan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/vegetable-vendors-death-3-cops-charged-with-murder/articleshow/82868641.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
---||Navi-mumbai||Maharashtra: Captain was confident cyclone wouldn’t affect barge, says survivor||NAVI MUMBAI: Anil Waychal (40), a Navi Mumbai resident, who was on board P-305 when it sank, was one among those fortunate to be rescued by the Navy on Thursday. Waychat, who worked as a quality assurance and quality control manager for Afcons, and his co-workers remained afloat for 9 to 10 hours before managing to swim to the naval vessel that rescued them on Monday. Narrating his experience in the choppy waters, Waychal said, “On May 14, we received a cyclone alert and our barge was moved to a safe location. As per our barge specification and weather report, our captain was confident our barge will not be affected by the cyclone wind and choppy sea as our barge had more than 50 mm diameter anchor with steel cable wires. The lifesaving equipment onboard was triple the number of men. We trusted the captain’s decision, given his experience, and waited on the barge in the rough weather.” “At around 2 am on May 16, five out of eight anchor steel cable wires snapped due to the gusty winds. Our vessel started dragging in the sea. Later, at around 3 am, our barge hit the ONGC platform. As the barge suffered damages, it was filled with sea water and we received orders to abandon it at 9.30 am,” said Waychal. The crew tried to launch lifesaving draft equipment but due to the cyclonic winds, all drafts deflated and drifted in the sea. “A Navy rescue team was communicating with us, but they claimed due to rough weather, they were unable to reach our barge and even if they attempted, their vessel too would get damaged. When the rescue vessel did not reach us till 5.30 pm, we all jumped into the sea wearing life jackets. Several of us formed groups while floating so Navy team could spot the groups. It was a horrifying experience,” he added. Waychal said, “Our group tried twice to reach the INS vessel but in vain. Also, the anchor wires were creating obstacles for us to swim. So we split further into two groups and swam separately. That enabled us to reach near the INS vessel at 10.30 pm.” - George Mendonca||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/maharashtra-captain-was-confident-cyclone-wouldnt-affect-barge-says-survivor/articleshow/82868667.cms||George Mendonca
---||Lucknow||UP govt: Panchayat polls didn’t trigger Covid spurt||LUCKNOW: The Uttar Pradesh government has stoutly rebutted claims it was not carrying out adequate Covid tests, particularly in the rural heartland, which was reeling under the pandemic after panchayat polls. Reiterating that the elections were held under the guidelines of the high court, additional chief secretary (information) Navneet Sehgal said, since March 31, the government conducted 1 crore tests, of which about 70% were carried out in rural areas. And the government had been maintaining the testing pace to track virus spread even before the four-phased elections kicked off, he said. On Saturday, the state’s positivity rate slipped to 1.97% even as the government carried out over 2.5 lakh tests per day over the week, mostly in rural areas. Sehgal said, the last phase of panchayat election was on April 24-25 and counting began from May 2, when cases dipped. “Soon, we witnessed a steady decline in active cases. On April 23-24, UP touched a peak of 3.1 lakh active cases. Since then, despite ramping up testing cases dipped. This shows the system put in place by the government has been functioning well,” he said. With 3.06 lakh tests conducted in a single day on Friday, the highest done by any state till now, Sehgal said, UP conducted 4.6 crore tests since the start of the pandemic and the positivity rate too had been falling. “The positivity rate on Saturday was 1.97% and a day earlier it was 2.4%. The state’s average positivity since the start of Covid has been 3.6%. The death rate is around 1%,” he said. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has also touring villages, he said, reviewing implementation of Covid care and this is showing results. “From May 5, more than 60,000 monitoring committees have been conducting house-to-house testing, distributing medicine kits and identifying people with infection. Aggressive testing, isolation and treatment have led to a phenomenal fall in UP’s cases,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-govt-panchayat-polls-didnt-trigger-covid-spurt/articleshow/82868658.cms||Neha Lalchandani

---||Patna||Bihar govt to appeal against HC’s Senari massacre verdict: Law minister||PATNA/MOTIHARI: Law minister Pramod Kumar said in Motihari on Saturday that the state government will challenge the Patna high court verdict on the Senari massacre in the Supreme Court. He said he gave his opinion to the government on the case after discussing it with state advocate general Lalit Kishor. “After getting the final nod from the chief minister the appeal proceedings will begin in a day or two,” the minister said. The advocate general said he has recommended an appeal against the judgment by filing a special leave petition (SLP) in the Supreme Court. Kishore said the high court should not have interfered with the trial court judgment as it convicted only those who were identified by the witnesses, while the charge sheet was filed against more than 30 people. He, however, admitted that the investigation into the case was not conducted properly as it ought to have been. The AG said the high court acquitted by giving the benefit of doubt to the convicts on the ground that the police investigation was faulty. It cast doubt on the identification of the convicts due to the absence of light to enable the witnesses to do so and lastly that convicts were identified in course of trial after several years in court by the witnesses. Altogether 34 upper-caste men were dragged out of their homes at Senari and were killed by slitting their throats and tearing their abdomen one by one after tying their limbs by the now-defunct Maoist Communist Centre extremists on the night of March 18, 1999. The massacre was said to be a fallout of the Laxmanpur-Bathe massacre in which 58 lower caste people, including women and children, were killed on the night of November 30, 1997. A massacre at Shankarpur Bigha had also taken place on January 25, 1999, in which 22 lower caste people were murdered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-govt-to-appeal-against-hcs-senari-massacre-verdict-law-minister/articleshow/82867344.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Gangwa is the ancestral village of Ranbir Gangwa, deputy speaker and in-charge of Hisar district for Covid-19 infection control, and despite that no isolation centre has been set up here due to lack of funds. Although rooms in two schools of the village have been identified and cleaned, there are no beds and bedding are available. Gangwa village health centre’s multipurpose health worker (MPHW) Subhash said 16 out of the 18 active patients had been isolated at their homes, while two were undergoing treatment at the hospital. However, an isolation centre was yet to be set up here, he added. Village secretary Randhir said rooms of Government Senior Secondary School had been identified and were cleaned to set up an isolation centre in the village, but the panchayat had no planks and beds and there was budget problem to buy new beds and planks and the market was also closed due to lockdown, so the isolation centre has not been set up in the village. The school watchman said he had received orders to clean the rooms, but there was not a single bulb in any of the rooms. Gangwa village comes under the Mangali community health center (CHC) and the village has four panchayats, but the isolation centre has not yet been established here also. Sajjan Singh Bairagi, Paramjit Pammi, Ravindra Poonia, Sonu, Rajendra, Ramesh of the Hausla Welfare Society of the village said that Covid-19 care center could be built in the village hospital but the authorities did not set it up. Every day 10 to 15 villagers are infected with Covid-19, but the villagers do not get them tested and treated as typhoid and the department is also not making any arrangements. About 70 people had died in the Mangali village in May, but it has not been recorded in the official records, they claimed. Dr Aruna Garg, senior medical officer (SMO) of Mangali CHC, said an isolation centre has not been set up in the village and she had no information in this regard as the work was being looked after by the panchayat department. Zila Parishad chief executive officer Jaideep said isolation centres had been set up in 52 panchayats so far in Hisar district. On the question of the list of villages with isolation centers, he said that he will be able to provide it only tomorrow. Difficulty in getting cannula installed Talking about the health facilities in Mangali village, Parjeet Pammi, a village resident, said 12 days ago when his father tested Covid-19 positive, he had to go to a private hospital in Hisar to get a cannula installed. After this, when he brought him home, the cannula was removed, so it had to be a lot of effort to get it reinstalled again. On the question of a kit worth Rs 5,000 announced by the Haryana government, he said that the health department had not given anything to his father so far. ‘50 centres set up in Fatehabad, 210 villages identified’ Fatehabad district development and panchayat officer Baljeet Chahal said isolation centres had been set up in 50 villages of the district and the places had been identified in 210 panchayats.

One is find the nine crew members still missing of the barge that sank around 38 nautical miles (70 km) off Mumbai coast on May 17 and to go closer to Satpati port, where the tugboat Varaprada sank on May 18 around 10 nautical miles (18 km) off the coast and whose 11 personnel are yet to be traced. INS Makar is accompanied by two more naval ships: INS Tarasa, which is used for SAR (search and rescue operations) and can sail in shallow waters, and INS Subhadra, a patrolling vessel which is used as a launch platform. “INS Makar has formed six teams that include at least five to six divers and helpers,” said a Navy official. The official said INS Makar has got a side-scan sonar that is used to create images of large areas of the seafloor when visibility is poor. “These sonars are used to create a 3D model photo below the sea. Now that the sonar has located the wreckage on the ocean floor, divers will be deployed to retrieve bodies, if any,” said the official. Navy Chief PRO, Commander Mehul Karnik, said, “INS Makar is on its mission. After completing the first mission, she will head to the location where the tug capsized and locate its wreck and conduct diving operations.” Officials said the primary role of the ship is to undertake hydrographic surveys required for production of nautical charts and publications aimed at improving navigational safety at sea. The ship is equipped with an array of modern surveying equipment and also undertakes limited oceanographic surveys to provide marine environmental data. She also carries on board survey motorboats, autonomous underwater vehicles and remotely operated vehicles for carrying out surveys. INS Makar is further fitted with a range of survey equipment including sounding systems, bottom profilers and an advanced electronic positioning system. The indigenously built INS Makar was commissioned into the Indian Navy on September 12, 2012. It has accommodation for six officers and 44 sailors. INS Subhadra has sensors and processing systems, search and navigation radar and can carry Bofors anti-aircraft guns, machine guns, Dhanush ballistic missile, and helicopters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-after-locating-barge-ships-to-look-for-9-missing-tug/articleshow/82868675.cms||Narayan Namboodiri
---||Pune||State seeks 2L amphotericin shots to fight mucormycosis||Pune: The Maharashtra government has now sought allocation of over 2 lakh amphotericin B injections from the Centre in view of the 1,500 reported cases of mucormycosis in the state, health minister Rajesh Tope said on Saturday.Tope said he has spoken to Union Minister of State for Chemicals and Fertilizers, Mansukh Mandaviya, for swift allocation. “We have received only 9,000-10,000 injections. We have contacted manufacturing companies, but they are yet to distribute the injections as it has to be centrally allocated,” he said. He added that the state urgently needs these injections to deal with mucormycosis. “The department of Chemicals and Fertilizers should immediately make the allotments to the state. We are ready to pay the amount, but no timeline has been provided for delivery,” Tope said. In a tweet late on Friday, Mandaviya said the Centre has roped in more Indian companies to manufacture amphotericin B. The Centre has said that five more manufacturers have been given the license to make the drug in the country with existing production capacities also being ramped up. Tope said Maharashtra has had several cases of mucormycosis and depending on severity of infection, a patient may need anywhere between 60 to 100 injections during course of treatment.While the state task force has prepared a detailed list of guideline for the treatment of mucormycosis, officials said training programmes are also on the cards for all districts, the health minister added. All states have also been advised to establish and activate hospital infection control committees. Facilities have been told to enforce transmission-based precautions with focus on droplets, airborne spread and contact to protect healthcare workers and ensure patient safety.In the PMR, due to supply shortages, amphotericin B is now being sold in the black market for anywhere between Rs 4,000 and Rs 7,000; its actual price is between Rs 1,500 and Rs 2,000. One injection vial contains 50mg of the drug — a patient would need 5mg per kilogram of body weight. So the daily cost of amphotericin B for a patient weighing just 40kg can be as high as Rs 28,000 for just four vials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/state-seeks-2l-amphotericin-shots-to-fight-mucormycosis/articleshow/82867043.cms||Nisha Nambiar

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Three detained with 5kg of ambergris||AHMEDABAD: Anandnagar police have detained three persons with 5.3kg of ambergris (sperm whale vomit). The seized product is valued in the international market at Rs 7 crore. Ambergris costs Rs 10 lakh per kg in the Indian market, according to police. The three were arrested near Seema Hall on Anandnagar Road on Friday evening. Deputy commissioner of police (Zone VII) Premsukh Delu said that acting on a tip-off, police kept watch and intercepted the three with the ambergris. The three revealed that they had acquired the ambergris form Junagadh. Delu said that at present the three have been detained on suspicion of theft, but they expect 10 or 15 persons more persons to be involved. Delu said they called forensic science experts who after examining the material said that it prima facie appeared to be ambergris. Detailed analysis is going on at the FSL. The three detained are Sumer Soni, 40, who was staying in a hotel located in Titanium City Centre and was originally a resident of Udaipur. The other two are Khalid Ali Ofi, 50, a resident of Bhavnagar, and Sharin Ismail Cheda, 46, a resident of Kehod in Junagadh district. Investigators said the three said they had got the ambergris from Junagadh, but officials said that as whales are rarely seen along the Gujarat coast, the possibility of smuggling cannot be ruled out. The investigation will reveal how people in Junagadh got hold of the ambergris. Officials said that they had a specific tip-off and the car was then intercepted. Ambergris is a solid waxy odorous substance obtained from the sperm whale. It is used to make perfumes. Chemically it contains ambrein, ambroxan, ambrinol, and ambroxide. Ambergris has a market in Arab countries and China.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/3-detained-with-5kg-of-ambergris/articleshow/82867051.cms||---

With no interaction with family for nearly four to five days, he started feeling depressed. Anupama Lad, the ICU in-charge, said that Baxi would always ask about his family members.  “He would ask the sisters in the ward about his daughter and wife and also his parents. So, we decided to take a chance and allowed his wife to visit him. That one visit did wonders for him and with some counselling, he could recover well," said Lad. Visit by relatives of coronavirus-affected patients are generally not encouraged by hospitals due to the fear of infection. Hospital authorities said that exception is made for patients who need mental support.“We allow young healthy relatives with all necessary precautions to attend to patients' emotional needs,” said Sudhir Patsute of Naidu hospital. Some hospitals also connect patients with their relatives at home through video calls to boost their confidence. At the Jehangir Hospital, patients undergo regular counselling. Farzana Mulla, head of Jehangir Centre for Neuropsychology, said, "We have made therapeutic counselling available to Covid-19 positive patients in wards and ICUs as well. Aniket Joshi, president, Association of Physicians of India, Pune unit, said, “Music therapy also works wonders and we are seeing great results among Covid patients.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hospitals-help-patients-connect-with-family/articleshow/82867055.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Delhi||Covid-19 claims 92 Delhi govt school teachers so far||NEW DELHI: Hindi teacher Raj Bala was due to retire in June after a career in the Hari Nagar government school for 23 and a half years. Tragically, before she could look forward to a life of rest, Covid-19 claimed her on May 3. Her symptoms started with a dry cough and quickly led to a precipitous drop in oxygen saturation level. The family had difficulties before finding a hospital bed, but it was in vain. There are 91 other teachers of Delhi government schools who couldn’t survive the coronavirus infection. After the pandemic broke out last year, the schools closed. But the city’s 1,100 government school teachers were exposed to the virus, deployed as they were at ration distribution centres, in containment zones, as personnel conducting Covid surveys and on other duties. Ramchandra Singhare, additional district deputy education officer, also the nodal officer for compensations to teachers killed by Covid, said, “We have verified the case and the list is now almost ready. So far, 92 government school teachers have lost their lives.” The Government School Teachers’ Association, however, contests this figure, saying it is actually much higher. Sudhir Yadav, Bala’s husband, told TOI, “She had corrected the exam answer sheets and I will submit them to the school once it opens.” The family no longer has a bread winner. The factory that had hired Yadav was closed down and their 30-year-old daughter is unemployed. Virendra Arora, 54, who taught accountancy at Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya, Mansarovar, couldn’t fight back the infection either. Akshay Arora, his son, said, “We couldn’t get a bed in Delhi, so we took him to AIIMS, Jhajjhar. On April 26, he lost his fight with the virus. He did not have health issue as such.” Perhaps Pushpendra Kumar Fulwa, 40, got infected while on Covid-related duties. The teacher at Government Boys’ Senior Secondary School, West Patel Nagar, has left behind a nine-year-old and a two-and-half-year-old daughter. Gayatri, Fulwa’s wife, said, “For six months last year and this year too, he was posted on Covid duties. Many of his colleagues also tested positive.” Fulwa had to travel to Jhunjhunu in Rajasthan on April 27 when Gayatri exhibited Covid symptoms. But by the time he reached home, his own oxygen level had dropped. He was taken to Jaipur for a ventilator but succumbed on May 6. Arjun Singh too left behind a wife and two children. He was a commerce teacher at the government school in Dilshad garden. “He was a person with disabilities, so hadn’t been allotted any duties. Yet he still died on April 26,” said Singh’s wife. His two sons, one 23 years old, the other a Class XII student, haven’t accepted their father is no more. With so many families affected by the death of earning members, Government School Teachers’ Association wants help for them. “Families that do not have an eligible dependent to join service in lieu of their deceased parent/spouse must get a deferral on the appointment and receive salary compensation till then,” said Ajay Yadav, GSTA general secretary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/92-government-school-teachers-sadly-fail-the-coronavirus-test/articleshow/82867069.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Nashik||4 Sinnar villages under lens due to high positivity rate||Nashik: The Sinnar health authorities have started rapid antigen tests (RAT) in four villages where the positivity rate is still high to contain the spread of Covid-19 through asymptomatic patients. “We are focusing on the villages with higher positivity rate. We are taking all the measures to ensure that the infection rate is brought down at these places,” Mohan Bachchhav, the taluka medical officer of Sinnar, said on Saturday. The number of Covid-19 patients in rural areas seems to be gradually rising as active cases that dipped to about 8,000 a couple of days back have increased to 9,260 now. The talukas of Nashik rural, Sinnar and Niphad are the contributors for the rise in coronavirus cases. In Sinnar, the health officials have thus picked up about six villages — Nandur-Shingote, Sonambe, Konambe, Manegaon, Chaas and Vavi — with higher positive cases. “There is a higher numbers of Covid patients in these areas. Most of these people have business contacts with Akole, Sangamner and Kopargaon (Ahmednagar). Hence, the health officials are increased their vigilance in these villages,” said Bacchav. The administration is carrying out RAT to zeroe in asymptomatic patients, treat them and also do contact tracing to ensure that none of their family members who may be positive go undetected. The process of random RAT and the RT-PCR for symptomatic patients will be carried out to cut down the rate of infection, said the officer. Bacchav said the action has been taken in the backdrop of the agriculture producing market committees being allowed to function from Monday. “These are farmers and they often have to visit the market for their needs and trading which could result in the rise in the number of patients,” said the officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/4-sinnar-villages-under-lens-due-to-high-positivity-rate/articleshow/82863586.cms||Abhilash Botekar

After taking permission from the court, investigating officer of the case, inspector Prashant Srivastava, visited Banda jail to record Mukhtar’s statement. A jail official said only Srivastava was allowed to go to Mukhtar’s cell to take his statement. “A worker was killed while another was badly injured in a clash over the construction of a road in Erakhurd village of Azamgarh in 2014. An FIR was lodged against Mukhtar and eight of his accomplices in this connection. After the approval of the then DM of Azamgarh, Gangster’s Act was also slapped on Mukhtar and his aides. While all other accused are in jail after chargesheet was filed, Mukhtar was yet to be questioned,” Srivastava told TOI, adding that he would visit Banda jail again as and when required. After being brought from Ropar to Banda jail on April 7, Mukhtar, during a hearing through video conference on April 22, had pleaded innocence before the court in the 2014 murder case. He told the court that he was lodged in Agra jail at the time of the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ansari-grilled-in-7-year-old-murder-case/articleshow/82868677.cms||---

---||India||Gurdwara plans hospital with donations of 50 years||AURANGABAD: The Sachkhand Hazur Saheb Abchalnagar Gurdwara, Nanded, is planning to establish a super-specialty hospital and medical college by using donations received by the gurdwara board over the past 50 years. The proposal has been moved by the gurdwara high priest, Jathedar Baba Kulwanth Singhji (Babaji), and is awaiting the board’s approval. Those privy to the development said the proposal came after Babaji fell ill last year and was being treated in Aurangabad before being taken to Mumbai as his health had begun to deteriorate. The proposal envisages a medical facility established in Nanded or Aurangabad so that people from the region are not forced to travel all the way to Hyderabad or Mumbai for treatment. A video of Babaji proposing to utilise the gold received in donations by the gurdwara over the past five decades for setting up the hospital, a medical college, and even educational institutes imparting quality education has been uploaded on social media. Board president Bhupinder Singh Manhas, however, said there were enough funds with the gurdwara and the need to use gold may not arise. “Anyway, the cost of land is zero as there is enough of that,” he said. In Aurangabad, a trust has already come forward to transfer over 200 acres of land for the project while about 90 acres has been earmarked in Nanded. Sachkhand Huzuri Khalsa Diwan’s president, Sardar Manjith Singh, has supported the proposal. “We have already supported Babaji’s proposal and are awaiting the board’s nod,” he said. Manhas said, “We are seriously considering the proposal. It will be taken up for discussion in the upcoming meeting.” Manhas recalled that in 2013, a 1984-batch IAS officer, Vijay Satbir Singh, who headed the board at the time, had proposed a hospital. “That was followed by the passing of a resolution as well as paying initial process fee, but somehow things did not move forward,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/gurdwara-plans-hospital-with-donations-of-50-years/articleshow/82872493.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: 2,000 new classrooms, 3,500 teachers required for Class XI||AHMEDABAD: With mass promotions for Class X students, many schools are likely to face the challenge of adding more classrooms before the schools reopen on June 7. According to the initial estimates of the Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB), about 2,000 new classrooms need to be added to accommodate the large number of students admitted to Class XI. This will require an addition of 3,500 teachers for Class XI. Of the 7.92 lakh regular students, 60.64% or about 4.80 lakh students cleared the Class X board exams last year. This year, however, 8.57 lakh regular students are eligible for admission to Class XI, said an official of the GSHSEB. “Even if we take into account students who are likely to pursue ITI or diploma courses after Class X, about 2,000 new classrooms will be needed for Class XI for the academic year 2021-22,” the official said. Each classroom can accommodate up to 66 students, the official said. He said these estimates are made after considering the fact that many schools will have room to accommodate more students in the existing classroom infrastructure. There are about 7,000 higher secondary schools in the state, including government run, grant-in-aid, and private. “The moot question is that how will the schools manage to build classrooms in such a short time,” said a source in the state education department. “Schools are ready to reopen early next month and a quick resolution to this issue does not seem in sight.” About 1.42 lakh students are likely to enroll in Class XI science stream this year; the figure for Class XI general stream is likely to be 3.5-4 lakh students, according to sources. “Another major challenge will be the recruitment of 3,500 teachers for Class XI this year to keep the prescribed student-teacher ratio intact,” said a source in the GSHSEB. The Federation of Self-Financed Schools, Gujarat, had recently asked all its associated schools to submit their requirement for additional classrooms to the state government before the schools start on June 7. The state government has announced the cancellation of Class X board exams due to the Covid-19 situation in the state, in line with the CBSE’s decision to cancel its exams. The government had earlier declared mass promotions for Classes I to IX and XI. The government’s decision to give mass promotions covers only regular students and does not include about 3.6 lakh external students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/2000-new-classrooms-3500-teachers-required-for-std-xi/articleshow/82867075.cms||Bharat Yagnik
---||Nashik||Infection among Nashik’s younger population doubles during 2nd wave||Nashik: Covid infection among children and youth across Nashik district, including within the city, was two times higher during the second wave of the pandemic, the district administration has said. A report prepared by the district administration shows that the infection count doubled in the 0-12 years age group and in the 13-25 years age group it was even higher during the second covid wave that began around February 16, 2021, in the district. Resident medical officer Dr Anant Pawar said 12,282 children in the 0–12 years category were infected in the second wave. The number of children infected in the first wave — between March 2020 and February 15, 2021 — was 6,121. In the 13-25 years age group, the number of patients increased from 17,054 in the first wave to 43,745 in the second wave. Moreover, more boys/men have been infected than girls/women across both the age groups.“The mortality rate did not increase proportionately. In fact, the death rate dropped in the 0-12 years category and there was only a slight rise in the next age group. Better immunity among the younger population and early intervention are the reasons for this,” Dr Pawar said. The rise in the number of Covid cases among the youngsters has been attributed to two factors — parents who were infected and the careless attitude of some youths. “For almost one year now, most children have hardly stepped out of their houses. They have not even been allowed in the common areas of buildings. Most children who caught the infection had got it from their parents,” said Dr Mohan Bachchav, the Sinnar taluka medical officer. Among the youths, the infection sources have been parents and friends. Or they have got it from the community while stepping out to go to markets or other places. “In some cases, youth have had to step out of their homes to make a living. In other cases, helping family members in getting things from the market or helping the friends’ families in need of Covid support have exposed them to the virus. But patients were the ones who had been roaming around with the belief that nothing would happen to them,” Dr Pawar added. “Since youths have better immunity, there should be lower chances of fatality. Parents have to be cautious. It is best not to neglect symptoms and keep a healthy mental state just as you would treat a flu, cough or cold,” Dr Sonanis, the IMA president of Nashik unit, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/infection-among-nashiks-younger-population-doubles-during-2nd-wave/articleshow/82863607.cms||Abhilash Botekar

In response to a PIL filed by Child Rights Network, Gujarat, which sought to secure basic rights for migrant labourers, the labour and employment department has stated that it has launched Mukhyamantri Audhyogik Shramyogi and Industrial Housing Aavas (MASIHA) Yojana to construct hostels for labourers in GIDC estates to solve the problem of residence for them. In addition to residential facilities, the scheme also envisages providing food at reasonable rates, establishment of entertainment, yoga centres and additional rehabilitation centres in labour hostels, the department said. The department further said that there are 35,000 institutions registered under Factories Act and 8,60,311 shops under Establishment Act. There are nearly 40 lakh workers registered in these establishments. It further said, “During the first wave of the pandemic, migrant workers faced many difficulties due to lack of accommodation, transport, food and nutrition, difficulty in working in shift duties etc.” To address this problem MASIHA Yojana has been launched for construction of hostels on PPP model in GIDC estates, to begin with six GIDCs in Sanand, Mehsana, Ankleshwar, Sapar-Veraval, Becharaji and Morbi and thereafter such hostels will be established in other GIDC estates. The government has decided to complete establishment of these hostels within 28 months. It has also laid down conditions for the private parties to implement the project.

Closer home, in Pune, a woman was allegedly molested by a driver while her Covid-infected husband was being taken to the hospital. Such instances — likely just the tip of the iceberg — prompted Ninebee, an NGO, launch an initiative dubbed ‘Stree Safe’, which offers an ambulance service operated by women for women. The NGO trains and provides safety equipment to the crews of the ambulances. “We found out that some of our female volunteers, who were delivering oxygen concentrators, were being misbehaved and had to ensure that they didn’t go on deliveries alone. Many associated doctors also shared sordid stories of sexual harassment. We also heard from other NGOs about women calling helplines to talk about how they faced harassment during and how reaching out to police wasn’t possible at the time,” Amarpreet Singh, co-founder and director of Ninebee, said. Singh said Stree Safe was a free service. Lakshmi Belpavar, driver of the first ambulance, is the sole breadwinner of her family. Before the pandemic, she drove a school bus. “In my family, women are never given the respect they deserve. The gratitude expressed by passengers has made me realise that what I am doing matters.” To avail yourself of this service, contact Ninebee on 8007776088.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/a-free-safe-ambulance-service-by-women-for-women-in-covid-times/articleshow/82867070.cms||---

Narsimha Reddy worked as the head of Mahatma Gandhi University in the previous term. Similarly, Dr B R Ambedkar Open University former VC K Seetharam Rao has been re-nominated for the same post for the second time. He worked as VC between 2016 and 2019. Nizam College principal Lakshmikanth Rathod has been appointed as VC for Palamuru University at Mahbubnagar, and Telangana Higher Education Council former vice chairman Prof Mallesham has been chosen to head Satavahana University at Karimnagar. Kavitha Daryani has been appointed as VC of JN Architecture and Fine Arts University, Hyderabad. The state government had been facing criticism over the delay in appointing new VCs and continuing with senior IAS officers as in-charges. Even the Telangana high court had pulled up the state government on the delay. Various political parties also complained to the governor, who is the chancellor of the universities, to instruct the state government to appoint VCs. While most of the VCs demitted their office in the middle of 2019, the government appointed search committees in September that year. No meeting was held for almost one year due to series of elections, model code of conduct and also Covid-19 pandemic. Sources told TOI that the search committee panels recommended the names a few months ago, but the CM could not take a call due to byelections, Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation elections and MLC polls. The chief minister’s office (CMO) said the selection process was taken up in tune with the UGC guidelines and recommended names. The delay in appointing new VCs was attributed to the Covid-19 pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/two-yrs-on-10-t-univs-get-vcs/articleshow/82868865.cms||Koride Mahesh

The Shiv Sena has held the government-run explorer Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) responsible and sought to know if Union petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan will take moral responsibility for the incident and resign. The state BJP, on the other hand, has alleged that the Maharashtra government is trying to save Afcons, the company that chartered the barge, and that a police complaint has been filed against the barge captain to derail the investigation. A delegation of Akhil Bhartiya Navik Sangh led by BJP leader Ashish Shelar met Mumbai police chief Hemant Nagrale, highlighting the alleged negligence on the part of Afcons that led to the incident. In an editorial in Saamna, the Sena said the deaths were not caused due to a natural disaster, but it was a case of culpable homicide as ONGC did not take the cyclone warnings seriously. Shelar said, “How can you hold the captain who is still missing solely responsible ? The contractor company Afcons is responsible for this incident, they did not withdraw the vessel despite warnings regarding the cyclone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sena-blames-ongc-bjp-targets-afcons/articleshow/82868742.cms||---

As part of its probe into the Sunrise Hospital fire at Bhandup’s Dreams Mall, police have sought answers to several key questions on the alleged lapses by the fire brigade in granting a fire NOC to the hospital and subsequent inspections. In the questionnaire sent to deputy chief fire officer Santosh Sawant, ACP Mulund division Priya Dhakne has asked the fire brigade if it had inspected the mall after issuing it a notice in November 2020. “The mall submitted compliance in February 2021 but who carried out the inspection to verify this? And if this inspection was not carried out, then which officer is responsible for that?... If this was not done, then is the concerned officer guilty?” she asked.  BJP corporator Vinod Mishra said the BMC’s report is an eyewash. “The entire provisional occupation certificate (OC) was given via a WhatsApp group.

---||Patna||Bihar: It’s existential crisis for artists amid pandemic||GAYA/BHAGALPUR: The two back-to-back waves of Covid-19 pandemic have led to existential crisis for some indigenous arts in the state. For instance, the artists at Patthakatti village under Atri block in Gaya district, which is famous for stone craft, is bearing the brunt of the pandemic. More than 50 villagers are involved in making idols of Lord Vishnu, Buddha and other Hindu deities from white marble at the village. Deepak Gaud of Patthakatti, who deals in stone craft idols in Bodh Gaya, said the pandemic has forced them to think about an alternate source of livelihood. “These craftsmen depend on footfall of tourists in Bodh Gaya and those performing pindadaan rituals. Although the art is still alive, the next generation is looking for other options. The craftsmen face problems in getting raw material. Earlier, white marbles were being brought from Palamu in Jharkhand. However, the same is now being brought from Jaipur and the craftsmen have to pay more,” he said. Craftsmen involved in Manjusha painting, Bamboo art, the famous Tussar silk and Sikki art are also hit. Dilip Kumar, a resident of Sahpur village under Sahkund block in Bhagalpur district, who had received training in Sikki art at Madhubani, is now trying to popularise it here. However, the Covid pandemic and the consequent lockdown have served a big blow to his efforts. Alok Agarwal, president of the Eastern Bihar Industries Association, said though Sikki art is not confined to this area, survival of art and crafts is not high on government’s priority in today’s scenario. Similarly, Patwa toli at Manpur in Gaya district, once known as ‘Manchester of Bihar’, is also facing existential crisis as production of fabric has stopped here. Magadh Bunkar Kalyan Seva Samiti president Prakash Ram Patwa said only Khadi Gramodyog and Jeevika are main buyers of the cotton fabric for preparing masks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/its-existential-crisis-for-artists-amid-pandemic/articleshow/82866734.cms||Kumar Rajesh
---||Patna||Bihar: Wholesale textile, ‘khaja’ traders worst hit in lockdown||BIHARSHARIF: Though the Covid induced lockdown has adversely affected everyone, the Sohsarai-based textile wholesale business and the famous Khaja from Silao in Nalanda district seem to be the worst hit. The Sohsarai wholesale textile market, popularly called mini Surat, is estimated to be incurring a loss of over Rs 1 crore a day, while Khaja traders at Silao have been losing over Rs 5lakh a day due to the lockdown since May 5. Besides the loss of turnover, thousands of employees either lost their jobs or compromised with curtailed salaries. According to Sohsarai Kapda Kalyan Samiti president Praduman Kumar, the textile market with over 540 outlets and an estimated annual turnover between Rs 350- 400crore suffered huge loss due to Covid induced lockdown in March last year. "The market was still recovering from last year's losses when it suffered another blow due to the fresh lockdown. The season of textile sale is mainly from March to June. In addition to the loss of turnover, the traders are paying salaries to the employees, minimum fixed electric bills, shop rents, GST filing charges among others," he said. He added that the supply of goods, mainly women's wear and shirting, are fulfilled from manufacturers based in Surat, Ahmadabad, Jaipur, Mumbai, Varanasi and Kolkata, which are in turn sold to retail customers in Bihar, Jharkhand, Bengal, Nepal and Eastern Uttar Pradesh. "Like many other trades, this too is based on a one-bill-credit system on both sides. It will take much time for the market to recover once the functioning starts," Kumar said. While the owner of the famous Sri Kali Sah Khaja at Silao Sandeep Kumar, who is the only online supplier of Khaja even during the lockdown, said there are 75 manufacturing and selling units of famous Khaja at Silao whose cumulative estimated turnover is Rs 5 lakh a day. He said his trade was severely hit as many small traders found it extremely difficult to make both ends meet under the circumstances. He said if things don't improve soon several of those directly or indirectly associated with the sweet meat business may face starvation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/wholesale-textile-khaja-traders-worst-hit-in-lockdown/articleshow/82866936.cms||Farrukh Nadim

He was identified as Varghese, 47, a resident of Aruviyodu, Kunnathukal. He is survived by wife and two sons. The incident happened on May 12. Varghese ran a coffin shop attached to his house. Sebastian, 55, who resides opposite the shop had filed complaints with local authorities saying that the shop functioned in an illegal manner and that it should be demolished. The local authorities did not act on the complaint after finding no merit in it. This infuriated Sebastian and he allegedly hurled petrol filled bottles at Varghese who was in his shop and also flung fire stick. Varghese suffered burns and he was rushed to the MCH. Owing to the serious nature of injuries, he died on Saturday. Sebastian, who tried to escape from the scene after hurling petrol bottles, was chased down by locals and he was handed over to police. The police had earlier registered a case under Section 307 IPC and following the death of Varghese, Section 302 was registered. State commissionerate for disabled demanded further probe by a higher level official into the matter. The commissioner also demanded that appropriate compensation shall be levied from the accused for the family of Varghese.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/disabled-man-succumbs-to-burn-injuries/articleshow/82867153.cms||---

We have instructed our other staffers residing in official quarters to report for duty in jail. Inmates testing positive have been shifted to isolation yard, hosptials, Covid care centres and hostel.

---||Hyderabad||HCA officials at odds over rep to BCCI SGM||Hyderabad: In what has now become an established pattern with issues pertaining to the Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA), everything the secretary R Vijayanand says or does is contested by its president Mohammed Azharuddin. First, it was the appointment of an officer on special duty (OSD) to Ombudsman and ethics officer. Then it was the appointment of the CEO. The latest issue concerns the HCA representative at the Indian Board’s (BCCI) special general meeting (SGM) on May 29. While secretary Vijayanand declared that the HCA AGM in April has nominated former BCCI interim president N Shivlal Yadav as its representative for the BCCI meet, Azharuddin slammed the move on Saturday, saying that the former India spinner does not qualify to attend the special general meeting. “We have sent an email to the BCCI informing the decision and requesting them to send the virtual password to Shivlal Yadav to enable him to attend the virtual SGM,” Vijayanand said. Azharuddin contended that the emergency special general body meeting on October 3, 2019 had already decided that the president will represent HCA at BCCI meetings. That meeting with a single point agenda saw Azhar’s name being proposed by Purushotam Agarwal, representing Vijayanand Cricket Club and seconded by Vikram Mansingh of Roshanara Recreation Club. Quoting the rule book, Azharuddin said: “With all due respects to my senior colleague in the cricketing area, I would like to affirmatively state that Shivlal Yadav has completed 17 years of cumulative tenure as an office-bearer. He served as joint secretary from 1992 to 2000 and as secretary from 2000 to 2008.” As per rule 6(5)(f) of the HCA constitution, “a person shall be disqualified from being a representative to the BCCI if he/she has been an office-bearer of a state association or the BCCI for a cumulative period of 9 years.” Shivlal countered Azhar’s statement. “There is no bar on a person who completes nine years at the state association from attending the BCCI meeting as a representative. If it were so, how are Niranjan Shah and Brijesh Patel amongst others attending the BCCI meetings even though they are not eligible to contest elections in their state associations? Only if a person completes 70 years of age, he cannot go to the BCCI. Hence, I will be attending the meeting and I am going to ask the BCCI to give Hyderabad some good matches in the T20 World Cup,” Shivlal told ToI. Shivlal added the BCCI legal department will decide whom to invite for the meet. “Azharuddin walked out of the AGM without completing the agenda and that could go against him,” he said. CEO appointment flayed Azharuddin also hit out at the secretary regarding the appointment of the CEO. “Do these folks even know how to conduct interviews and assess the efficiency of a potential candidate? They just want to use their majority and ensure that their proxy control is continued by installing a puppet CEO,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hca-officials-at-odds-over-rep-to-bcci-sgm/articleshow/82868089.cms||Solomon S Kumar

State health minister Mangal Pandey on Saturday tweeted that the decision was taken on chief minister Nitish Kumar's direction. He further said all patients with mucormycosis will be given free medicines. The notification was issued by the additional chief secretary (health), Pratyaya Amrit after, a recommendation by an expert committee, and would remain valid for a year from the date of issue. Now, all cases of black fungus will have to be reported to the government for monitoring. As per the notification, both private and government facilities will have to inform about suspected as well as established cases of Black Fungus to the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) of the health department via the civil surgeon of their respective districts. The number of black fungus cases remained on the rise in government hospitals of Patna even on Saturday. IGIMS superintendent Dr Manish Mandal said 43 mucormycotic suspected patients had been admitted till Saturday and it included 19 covid negative and 24 positive patients. "Two patients underwent surgery as the line of its treatment," said Dr Mandal. "At AIIMS Patna, 36 patients with suspected mucormycosis came for consultation, of whom seven with a serious condition were admitted for further investigation and treatment," said Dr Sanjeev Kumar. He informed that over 200 patients with black fungus symptoms have visited AIIMS-P this week. In Ruban hospital, one patient was admitted on Saturday. "It is a quite rare disease. I used to have not more than four patients in a year, that too among most immuno-compromised health condition," said Dr Rakesh Singh, head of ENT department of IGIMS. Dr Anil Kumar, head of trauma and telemedicine department of AIIMS said according to medical literature, the rate of occurrence of mucormycosis worldwide is 0.5 to 1.7 per 10 lakh population. “Even a slight infection in eyes or nose in otherwise all fine health status with no history of Covid infection or diabetes have made people worried and they are calling even in odd hours to confirm it could not be a case of black fungus," said Dr Kumar. Dr Satyajeet Singh, MD of Ruban Hospital said he had never seen any case of mucormycosis in over four decades of practice. “It is the second wave that made it from rare to common and even a dreaded disease. In serious condition this disease needs multi-speciality treatment," he added. Dr Vivek Kumar of the ENT department of PMCH also admitted that he never had any patient of mucormycosis in his five years in Patna and added, "It is an opportunistic fungus as the treatment used for Covid-19 patients, including the use of steroid and administration of humidified oxygen allowed it to grow."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-notifies-black-fungus-as-epidemic-to-give-free-medicines/articleshow/82867112.cms||Sheezan Nezami

District immunisation officer Dr Manoj Choudhary said more than 3,21,000 people have been vaccinated in Bhagalpur so far. “Intensive immunization drive in rural and urban areas is required,” he said, adding the target is to vaccinate at least 55% of the total adult population in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/door-to-door-survey-to-ramp-up-vaccination-drive-in-bhagalpur/articleshow/82866422.cms||Kumar Rajesh

An experimental quest for a low-cost daily solution to aerial photography led IIIT-H researchers from the Process, Architecture, and Technology Research in Internet of Things (PATRIoT) lab to design a complete lightweight system that can be affixed to any ordinary kite for capturing images. Since a kite depends on wind, the team led by student Abhinav Navnit under the guidance of Aftab Hussain, first conducted an in-depth study of flight dynamics. “The normal Indian kite has a weight of 10-15 gm. In order to lift it and anything else mounted on that, one requires appropriate wind force. We figured out that normal wind conditions can carry about 50 gm, of which 10 gm is the weight of the kite itself. So our entire system had to fit into approximately 40 gm,” said Hussain. Using two ultra-light and flexible lithium polymer batteries that weigh only 4.65 gm each, the complete setup weighed 42 gm, which was below the maximum limit required for lift-off.  In it’s first flight, the KiteCam revealed its superiority over drones in terms of energy consumption by successfully flying for 35 minutes, during which a total of 4,356 images were captured.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/iiit-h-designs-kitecam-as-alternative-to-drones/articleshow/82868036.cms||---

Saptashrungi Shikshan Sanstha and Haribhau Gite Foundation have started the helpline for. The ‘Kovale Kiran’ helpline is aimed at stimulating the emotional world of children, who have not been out of their houses for the last one and half year and with the likelihood of the third wave of Covid affecting children . The helpline number is 0253-3554404. “It has been observed the children are the worst affected due to Covid, directly because of infection,or losing their loved ones to the infection. They can’t do any outdoor activity resulting in stress,” said collector Suraj Mandhare. The organisations headed by Ganesh Gite, the chairperson of Nashik Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) standing committee and Himgauri Adkethe, former chairperson,, have formed a taskforce with the help of the gynaecologists, ENT surgeon, psychiatrist to deal with the issues of the children and the women especially. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/2-ngos-set-up-helpline-for-covid-hit-kids/articleshow/82863710.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The management of Republic Primary School registered a complaint with Khokhra police in this regard. Tabasum Ismail, who works as a clerk in the school, told police that the thieves had stolen original documents from the school. The complaint stated, “On May 13, the school office was locked around 2.30 pm. However, when Tabasum went to school on May 17, she found that someone had broken open the lock. She checked the office and found that several documents had been stolen. She called principal RA Kothariya and informed him of the theft.  When she came back to school the next day to process school leaving certificates, she found that files with documents, including admission forms and even birth certificates, had been stolen from the safe. When the management checked CCTV footage, they saw that three youths had entered the school by jumping over the gates around 11.40 am on May 15. The Karanj police registered a case under Section 380 (theft), 454 (house-breaking) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/three-steal-records-from-school/articleshow/82867161.cms||---
---||Mumbai||‘Fake’ masks sold online, NGO seeks checks; Bombay HC issues notice to Centre||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court (HC) has issued a notice to the Centre, seeking its response to a public interest litigation on manufacture and sale of “fake/spurious” medical grade face masks on e-commerce sites. A PIL by an NGO, Friends of Wadala East, urged the HC “to ensure that unregulated manufacture and sale of medical grade face masks does not go unchecked in view of the fact that a proper mask is perhaps the only manner in which transmission of coronavirus can be prevented”. The NGO cited its experience with Amazon when it placed a bulk order on May 2 for 400 surgical masks for BMC healthcare workers. The masks were delivered on May 8, but did not conform to the description advertised. The website represented it would be of ‘The Mask Lab, 3 ply surgical face mask – international ASTM level certified for virus, dust, air borne particles, pollution.’ On receipt, the petitioners found the same were “shoddy and of substandard quality, poorly packaged and nowhere close to what they described on the portal of Amazon”. The NGO could not distribute the masks. The manufacturer said it had not manufactured the masks that had been delivered. “There is gross misrepresentation on e-commerce websites and the public at large are being sold masks that do not conform to the specifications they claim to be,’’ the PIL adds. The PIL points out that Amazon US has strict quality checks in place, mandating approval by Food & Drug Administration. On Amazon India, a seller just has to provide GST, PAN and bank details “without having to upload certificates, permissions and approvals”. The NGO verified listing requirements of other e-commerce entities and found that “Flipkart and Snapdeal also do not have any system of checks and balances in place and follow a procedure similar to Amazon.” The PIL said unsuspecting citizens end up buying fake/spurious masks due to unfair trade practices of unauthorised vendors and e-commerce sites like Amazon “which leaves them with a false sense of belief that they may rely on such spurious masks for protection against the Covid19 and its spread.” On Thursday, after the non-profit’s advocates Amrut Joshi and Sujit Lahoti informed a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni about the public interest litigation, they issued a notice to the ministries of health and consumer affairs and posted the hearing for June.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/fake-masks-sold-online-ngo-seeks-checks-bombay-hc-issues-notice-to-centre/articleshow/82868786.cms||Rosy Sequeira

The all-woman police (east) said the girl, a Class XI student, was in love with the 24-year-old construction worker. “He raped the girl for the first time on January 19 at his residence. He then continued to have physical relationship with her and recorded their intimate moments using his mobile phone camera,” a police officer said. Meanwhile, the girl’s parents came to know about the affair and advised her to end the same. “She subsequently avoided him for the past two months, despite his repeated requests to continue the affair. Enraged, he shared an obscene photo of the girl with his friends on WhatsApp and threatened the girl,” the officer said. The girl lodged a complaint with the all-women police (east) inspector, Amutha, who registered a case against the construction worker on Saturday under Section 376 (3) of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 5 (l), 6, 9, 10, 11(v), 12, 13(c) and 14 (1) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. “Since the accused has gone into hiding, we have formed a special team to nab him,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/man-rapes-minor-girl-blackmails-her-with-obscene-pics/articleshow/82867172.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kochi||CFR over 1% in 13 local bodies in Ernakulam: Report||KOCHI: Some local bodies in Ernakulam have recorded a case fatality rate (CFR) of over one per cent, indicating the severity of the pandemic spread. As per the analysis report of the health department till Tuesday, the CFR of more than 13 local bodies are above one per cent. It includes Covid deaths declared by the government and non-declared ones. The highest CFR has been reported from Kadungalloor panchayat (1.56%), which is one of the local bodies that witnessed the highest number of Covid cases during the first wave. This is followed by Tripunithura (1.39%) and Choornikkara (1.31%). It indicates one out of every 100 infected persons in these local bodies has died of the infection. The CFR of Kochi corporation stands at 1.27% with the local body reporting 533 Covid deaths. “As per the declared deaths, the CFR of Ernakulam is only 0.2%. If we consider all Covid deaths, including the ones not declared by the government, it would come to around 0.86%. In our report, we have also included the deaths that occurred within one month of recovery from Covid-19. We intimate every Covid death reported to us by hospitals to the government, which takes a final call on whether the person died of Covid or not. However, considering the course of the infection so far, Ernakulam could manage the spread and treatment despite the presence of various mutants, including the Indian double mutant, UK, Brazil and South African variants,” said a district health official. The report also shows that the test positivity rates (TPR) of Choornikkara and Chellanam touched 61.72% and 60.76% respectively as on Tuesday. “The infection has spread equally across the state. The CFR of Kerala should be more as we don’t miss many cases. But the state has suppressed many Covid deaths. They don’t release the data on public domain. They have not declared the actual number of Covid deaths in Ernakulam. Maximum deaths are declared in Thiruvananthapuram, where the CFR is 0.65%, which also is not the correct figure. Considering the poor health infrastructure in Palakkad, Kasaragod and some other districts, there would be more Covid deaths. But this is not reflected in the government data. The government has declared only less than 10 Covid deaths in Kasaragod in the past two months. I think the CFR of Kerala comes to around 1%,” said internal medicine expert Dr Arun N M. As per the analysis report, cases per million is highest in Chellanam with 1,12,304. Active cases per million is highest in Varapuzha with 24,199.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cfr-over-1-in-13-local-bodies-report/articleshow/82867171.cms||T C Sreemol

The tiff leading to the assault began when the accused told his father to wash his hands before touching things in the kitchen. Pratapsinh Zala, a resident of Sachin Tower on the 100-Feet Road, said in his complaint filed on Friday that on Thursday he had entered the kitchen for some chore. Zala said his son Mahipalsinh was already in the kitchen. Zala said that on seeing him, Mahipalsinh let out a torrent of abuse and asked Zala to stay away from the kitchen. Zala stated that they had a heated argument after which his son picked up a table fan to attack him. Zala came out of the kitchen and was sitting at the dining table when his son hit him and threatened to kill him. Zala said that his wife Nita scolded Mahipalsinh, who then went to his room.

---||Delhi||100 doctors die of Covid in Delhi, says IMA||NEW DELHI: Delhi has been losing innumerable doctors to a resurgent Covid, Indian Medical Association data shows. On May 17, the toll was 28, but just five days later, it had risen to 100. So far, around 420 doctors have died across the country due to the coronavirus, 100 of them in Delhi, followed by 96 in Bihar. Explaining the rise in the death numbers, Dr Neelam Lekhi, senior vice-president, Delhi Medical Association, said, “We have been collecting data from various hospitals through our centres since April. When the earlier data was released not all the hospitals had responded. Currently, the Delhi toll stands at 102, these deaths having occurred in the last 50-60 days. Each case of a doctor’s death is verified before we include it in the list. Among those who lost their lives, 80% were above the age of 50.” Dr Ajay Lekhi, former DMA president, felt that neither the fraternity nor the government was prepared for the resurgence of Covid. “Moreover, the doctors are overburdened, overworked. And working for hours in a PPE suit is very uncomfortable,” said Lekhi. “Some doctors did not die of the infection per se, but because they did not get a hospital bed or due to oxygen shortage. The government does not have a system for infected doctors. While some get admitted to the hospital they work in, not everyone has such access.” Lekhi also pointed out how a WhatsApp message of a doctor asking for funds went viral, forcing the state government to say it would take care of the expenses. “Why wasn’t a system already in place?” he asked. Lekhi also noted that some of the deceased doctors had taken both the doses of the Covid vaccine, yet had succumbed to the virus. “One must look at the vaccine efficiency too. The deaths were an eye opener,” he added. A doctor at a private hospital treating Covid patients rued, “We lost so many doctors and paramedic staff in the current wave. Some could have been saved. The government can build 5,000 or 10,000 or 50,000 beds but they will be of no use without doctors and paramedic staffers to take care of them. We must look at the specialised manpower we are losing.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/100-doctors-die-of-covid-in-capital-says-ima/articleshow/82867182.cms||Sakshi Chand
---||Nashik||Covid treatment permission of 2 hosps terminated||Nashik: The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has terminated the permission given of two private Covid hospitals in Nashik city following allegations that they had not given the auditors access to the bills of the patients.NMC commissioner Kailas Jadhav on Saturday said: “The administration was forced to take this extreme step against the two hospitals which did not allow their bills to be inspected by the auditors. I have ordered the lodging of the first information reports (FIRs) against the hospitals under The Epidemic Disease Act.” The municipal commissioner on Saturday said that the civic body had appointed auditors who would go around the hospitals to check the bills that have been generated by the hospitals for the treatment of the common public members. The auditors are to ensure that irrational charges are reversed. “Our auditors have been regularly visiting the two hospitals and have been asking for access to the bills. Since the hospital administrations were not cooperating, a series of notices were also issued to them. But they have failed to explain their stand. Therefore, we were forced to take the extreme step,” the civic commissioner said. He also added that the hospitals were reluctant to share the occupancy of the Covid beds on the 80:20 ratio where the patients admitted to 80% of the beds were to be charged as per the government orders. “They did all this despite several reminders. Both these hospitals cannot take in Covid patients for treatment any more. They can treat people for other diseases,” the municipal commissioner added..||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/covid-treatment-permission-of-2-hosps-terminated/articleshow/82863754.cms||Abhilash Botekar

The CBI has called for mobile call details and service record of these two officers, and DCSCO is yet to probe the details. The amount demanded has been recovered from Gautam, and Mohan had allegedly consented to the acceptance on his behalf by phone.The CBI also informed the court that after filing of the complaint, one Shashi Paul of CDSCO allegedly threatened the complainant on the phone.The investigating agency also submitted that Rs 13.9 lakh cash was recovered from Gautam’s residence and Rs 11.4 lakh was recovered from Mohan’s house, which shows they both habitually demand bribes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cbi-court-denies-bail-to-cdsco-officers-in-graft-case/articleshow/82867169.cms||---
---||Nashik||Students with mild fever can sit for MUHS exams||Nashik: The Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS) will allow students having mild symptoms of fever, cold and cough to appear for the upcoming health science examinations that will take place offline between June 10 and 30. More than 40,000 students will be appearing for winter 2020 first, second and third-year (undergraduate) exams of all the health science courses and certificate course in modern pharmacology and modern mid-level service provider certificate course.Although a section of the examinees were demanding that either online examination be held or students be promoted to the next class without exams given the pandemic situation, state medical education minister Amit Deshmukh has made it clear that the examinations will be held offline.Ajit Pathak, the varsity’s controller of examinations, told TOI that the MUHS will be following the University Grants Commission (UGC) guidelines in allowing students with mild symptoms of fever, cold and cough to write the exams. “Such students will write their exams in a separate room and the invigilator can be provided with PPE kits if there is a need. But the students have to get a proper medical certificate sying they can appear for the examination,” said Pathak.Even during practical exams, said Pathak, if an examinee is unwell, a separate schedule will be made for him/her after the student is cured.MUHS will also provide Rs 3 lakh to the bereaved family if anyone associated — examinees, teachers or even non-teaching staff on exam duty — succumbs due to Covid-19 during the exam period. The varsity will provide a grant of up to Rs 1 lakh for treatment if such stakeholders contract the infection during this period.According to Pathak, during the final-year UG health science examination, in March-April 2021, there were five examinees who were allotted separate rooms as they were asymptomatic Covid patients. Similarly, the varsity held separate practical exams for 15 Covid-positive students as they could not appear on the scheduled date.“We want to assure the examinees that the varsity will be taking all necessary steps to ensure that Covid-appropriate behaviour is followed during the examination. We are being constantly guided by the medical education minister, the varsity’s acting vice-chancellor Nitin Kalmalkar, varsity registrar Kalidas Chavan and all other MUHS departments,” said Pathak.According to Pathak, only one examinee would be allowed on each bench, unlike earlier when two were allowed on a bench. Moreover, the number of examinees in one room would not exceed 30.“MUHS has provided Rs 20,000 to each of the 185 centres for the purchase of sanitisers and sodium hypochlorite solution,” he added.Pathak added that the university is confident of conducting the exams smoothly despite the Covid pandemic. “The university had conducted a similar examination in the summer 2020 session. We made all arrangements keeping the Covid safety protocol in mind,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/students-with-mild-fever-can-sit-for-muhs-exams/articleshow/82863778.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

---||Delhi||Groundwater role in Delhi tremors?||NEW DELHI: The alarmingly frequent earthquakes in Delhi-NCR last year may have been the result of rapid groundwater extraction in the region, according to a study. Carried out by researchers from National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, the research simulated groundwater extraction data alongside data on GPS-derived vertical displacement, rainfall and earthquake frequency in the Aravalli-Delhi fold belt and observed a reduction in seismic activity after the monsoon rains. Bhaskar Kundu of NIT Rourkela, who led the study, told TOI that while groundwater extraction was not the only factor for the earthquakes, it did appear to influence seismic activity in the region. “Earthquakes have been found to be largely occurring in the top 25 km of the surface and a relation has been found between the withdrawal of water from aquifers and the subsequent destabilisation of faults underneath the aquifers, as a result of compression and extension,” explained Kundu. In academic idiom, the study puts this as: “The low magnitude but moderate seismicity rate of Delhi region on the stable plate-interiors domains of India exhibits significant variation, both in short-term at the annual seasonal scale and in long-term at the decadal scale. It correlates with the anthropogenic groundwater pumping for extensive irrigation, urban activities, and seasonally controlled hydrological loading cycle of the Indo-Ganga Basin-hosted freshwater aquifers.” V K Gahalaut of National Geophysical Research Institute, one of the researchers, explained, “We found that once the aquifers were recharged, they actually stabilised the plates underneath them but when water was extracted, it led to plate movement and creation of stress. This is what destabilises the tectonic plates underneath.” Gahalaut added that there was a connection between the monsoon rains recharging the aquifers and a reduction in earthquake frequency. To identify human-induced earthquakes, over 700 cases have been documented in the past few decades in a database called ‘HiQuake’, which Kundu said was strengthened by adding the possibility of groundwater extraction-based seismicity around Delhi. “Exploiting the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data, surface subsidence rate, hydrological models, coupled hydro-mechanical simulation and poro-mechanical analysis of basement fault, we have reported significant variation in the seismicity modulation in Delhi region both in the short term and the over a decade,” said Kundu, adding that while the fault movement is generally tectonically driven, human interferences can also cause slips or modulate seismicity in the crust. According to Kundu, data showed a steady decline in the groundwater table at 1.9cm per year from 2002 to 2009, though this stabilised later. The study was co-authored by Deepak K Tiwari, Birendra Jha and Naresh K Vissa of NIT Rourkela and Gahalaut, who informed that the study took nearly three years, with rainfall data of over 20 years considered and that of earthquakes of over 50 years. “We studied last year’s data too when earthquakes began occurring frequently from April onwards. However, when the monsoons came, the earthquakes ceased. Data shows a 20-30% reduction in seismic frequency post-monsoon rains,” said Gahalaut. The Bureau of Indian Standards has classified India into four seismic groups: Zone II (low intensity) to Zone V (very severe). Large parts of NCR, including Delhi and Haryana, fall in Zone IV (severe), making them particularly prone to earthquakes. Delhi in the past has recorded several strong historical earthquakes, including in 1720, 1831, 1956 and 1960. “Interestingly, the seismicity of the Delhi region exhibits strong semi-annual periodicity. Moreover, during the seasonal loading period (June-September, i.e., during the monsoon), the seismicity is lowest, whereas it is relatively high during the unloading period,” the study adds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/groundwater-role-in-capital-tremors/articleshow/82867179.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

Despite 2,377 people getting discharged on the day, again highest in a day, the number of active cases crossed the grim figure of 30,000 to touch 30,104.The total number of people cured rose to 1,03,809, keeping the recovery rate at 76.9%.Thirty-two people died due to the virus, which is the highest number of deaths declared in a single day, taking the toll to 999. Of the 32 people declared dead, four were in the 40s, five in the 50s and nine in the 60s.As per the media bulletin, there are 401 ordinary beds, 22 free oxygen beds and one ICU bed. However, finding a bed for even non-oxygen requiring patients turned out to be an uphill task on Saturday. Some patients waited at Coimbatore Medical College Hospital for seven hours for a bed, only to be refused. With more beds being added in Covid care centres, there are 539 vacant beds.To handle the growing number of calls to 1077, the district administration has set up two more triage units including one at corporation community centre at Ramanathapuram and St Francis School near CMCH.While the administration said there were 129 oxygen beds vacant at CMCH, the needy could not find them.There are 221 oxygen beds and 29 ventilator beds in private hospitals. Officials said there were 13,067 beds in total. The number of people in home isolation also grew to 17,900.The district administration will on Sunday administer 400 doses of Covishield for people aged above 45, who need their second shot. They have also distributed 9,464 vaccines to 13 private firms that are still functioning. This includes LMW plants at Kaniyur and Periyanaickenpalayam, Aquapump Industries at Thudiyalur, Emerald Jewellery, NPT College in Pollachi, Roots Industries at Kinathukidavu and Kovilapalayam. This is based on the chief minister’s instructions to vaccinate people working in industries. People including cab drivers, food delivery boys, e-commerce staff, petrol bunk employees, bus drivers, pharmacy workers and restaurant employees between 18 to 44 will get priority in the vaccination drive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/3165-fresh-cases-take-tally-to-30104-death-toll-at-32/articleshow/82867191.cms||---

The two nurses, who have been working at the centre—World University Services—on contract basis for the past five years, have demanded action against the doctor. In a joint letter sent to chief medical officer Sunil Thakur recently, they alleged, “As you know we are working in night shifts, we are facing problems with Dr PK Sahoo who drinks on duty and troubles the nurses by continuously calling them on phone and knocking on the door of their room without any reason. His behavior is intolerable for us. We are not feeling safe doing night shifts with him.” However, Sahoo has denied the charges and termed them as “false”. “There is an entirely different story to the incident. But I do not like to defame women so I will not say anything on the matter. I respect women,” claimed the doctor. Thakur did not respond to calls and messages from TOI. However, an official at the health centre said that the matter was being looked into. “As the CMO had contracted Covid and was away for a few days, there was some delay in looking at the matter,” said the official further. Meanwhile, three executive council members—JL Gupta, Seema Das and Rajpal Singh Pawar—have also written to DU vice-chancellor PC Joshi asking him to take action. The letter stated, “This is to bring to kind notice that one of the doctors appointed on contract basis in WUS, Dr PK Sahoo is not performing his job in the manner in which he was entrusted to...He is often seen roaming outside, instead of seeing the patients. Above all, an act that is inexcusable was observed recently on April 26 in a complaint of two nurses on night duty. It is reported that on night duty, he was drunk, he knocked on the door of two nurses on duty and he telephoned them without any reasons. Such an act is unwarranted, unpardonable, demotivating and intimidating the women paramedical staff on duty at WUS.” They have demanded an inquiry into the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2-du-health-centre-nurses-allege-harassment-doctor-denies-charge/articleshow/82867199.cms||Shradha Chettri

He first visited Goa in 1983 to attend the Paryavaran Chetana Saptah. He toured various places in Ponda, Salcete and Bicholim urging the youths to work unitedly to protect the Western Ghats forests, from where most of the region’s rivers originate.  Bahuguna visited Goa again in 1986, where all the members of the save Western Ghats movement converged at Bandora. In his speech, he deliberated on a strategy to protect the Western Ghats for posterity.  Kumar Kalanand Mani, who was the founder secretary of Peaceful Society, a Gandhian voluntary organisation that was instrumental in the Save Western Ghat movement in 1986, told TOI, “Sundarlalji inspired us to start a movement to save the Western Ghats. He visited Goa in 2009 and in 2010, which was his last visit to the state. His works and words are indeed a source of inspiration for generations.” When Bahuguna visited Goa three decades ago, he recorded his observations on the environmental impact of the mining activity in Goa. “Goa was one of my dreamlands before I actually visited here. But when I came, instead of a clean sea and green hills, I saw polluted sea and brown hillocks, scars created by the mining industry on the body of mother Earth. My dream was shattered. Nature has been beautiful to us, but human beings have in return been cruel to her,” Bahuguna had once said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bahuguna-inspired-goans-to-preserve-western-ghats/articleshow/82868872.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar

Kannan of KG Garden City Apartment at Nagarajapuram had left for Arunachal Pradesh a few months ago, leaving behind his 65-year-old father Arjun, mother Sundari, elder sister Kavitha and her two school-going children. He was a teacher at a private school in the northeastern state. Kavitha supplemented the family income by working as a maid at a house in RS Puram. But the second coronavirus wave caught them unawares. While Kannan was rendered jobless due to the lockdown and was stranded in Arunachal Pradesh, Kavitha’s employers insisted she stay with them to reduce the chances of becoming infected. As a result, Arjun, who is partially paralysed, and Sundari, had to take care of Kavitha’s children. The family was in a precarious situation after running out of food two days ago.The crisis prompted Kannan to post a distress tweet tagging the Coimbatore rural police. Cops responded to his tweet and alerted district superintendent of police S Selvanagarathinam, who instructed the Vadavalli police to help the family.M Kumaravel, head constable attached to the special branch, and Vadavalli police head constable Kumar visited the family with 10kg rice, cooking oil and vegetables on Saturday. “It will be sufficient for the family for a week. I will bring grocery items for the family till total lockdown is relaxed,” Kumaravel said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/alerted-by-tweet-police-extend-helping-hand-to-hapless-family/articleshow/82867188.cms||A Subburaj

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Getting medicines or Covid tests done in villages a Herculean task||JAIPUR: Forty-two-year-old Premaram of Pura Baikheda village under Bharatpur’s Bayana tehsil was forced to first go to Bayana and then to Alwar to get his wife tested for Covid-19. Two days later when her condition worsened, he had to come to Jaipur to get admission at a government-run Covid care centre. This is not a sole case as similar conditions prevail in many villages of Rajasthan where primary health centres, community health centres and sub-health centres lack resources and staff. TOI on Friday spoke to many people in villages to know their plight. Sometimes they are compelled to travel to distances as long as 200kms to reach district headquarters for basic things varying from Covid test, investigations to medicines. “I have been suffering with fever, body pain, cough and cold for a fortnight. I got my Covid-19 test done which was negative. The primary health centre here has no facilities. I have been asked to go for HRCT test for which I will have to travel to Sriganganagar (200km from the village). I attempted to go with my cousin on a bike but police stopped us,” said 30-year-old Satpal Bishnoi, a native of 365 head village situated near Indo-Pak border in Sriganganagar district. Bisnnoi added that he is surviving on some medicines he had arranged initially and now is planning to visit Sriganganagar. Similarly, residents of Dantla Meena village near Jamwaramgarh on Jaipur outskirts have no option but to visit Jaipur or Dausa to get treatment. “Our primary health centre in the village is closed for past four years. Those who are getting symptoms are sent to Jaipur or Dausa. There are many who are not coming out openly to share their symptoms,” said Mukesh Kumar Meena, sarpanch of Dantla Meena. Amidst lofty claims by health department on door-to-door distribution of medical kits, Umlesh Solanki, sarpanch of Pura Baikheda village in Bharatpur, said, “We have not received any medical kits. People with symptoms are either going to Bayana or to Alwar to get their tests, investigations done and to get medicines. We have been urging people not to hide their symptoms and self-medication can be dangerous.” “We are told that if our oxygen level is not below 92 a Covid test is not required. From calling our public representatives to others we are trying our best to get proper diagnosis and treatment for those with symptoms,” said Harkesh Meena, a native of Sapotara village in Karauli district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/getting-medicines-or-covid-tests-done-in-rural-areas-a-herculean-task/articleshow/82867192.cms||Ashish Mehta

These deaths include 12 alone from Nari village, including a young man who died on Saturday. “Locals say that they are finding it difficult to undergo test and to get medicines. Those even with 50% of the symptoms are not being tested or getting medicines,” said a local. “A family has lost a son due to Covid and the mother died while grieving the death of her son,” said a villager, who added that the present situation has sparked a sense of fear in the villagers, due to which people are not preferring to come out in open and are hiding their illness.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/25-deaths-in-20-days-in-hudera-panchayat-in-fatehgarh-due-to-ili/articleshow/82867201.cms||---

Given the extensive reforms in the industrial sector, it managed to control the emissions leading to moderate growth. Vehicles remain the major contributor of PM2.5 emissions, followed by industries,” the report stated.Sectoral share (the percentage share of emissions per sector) illustrated that transport and vehicular movement-induced re-suspended dust accounted for more than 50% of the particulate load in PMR in 2019-20. Residential and industrial sectors contributed identically. The report stated that densely populated central areas accounted for higher emissions.The report also compared the growth rate of PM2.5 and PM10 during 2013-2020 in PMR with the growth rate with Delhi-NCR (2011-18). PMR’s growth rate was found to be 10% (PM2.5) and 8.7% (PM10) per year, while for Delhi, it was around 2% (PM2.5) and 4% (PM10) per year.While conceding that PMR’s higher growth rate was a matter of grave concern, IITM scientists said the region’s magnitude of emission (gigagrams/year), compared to that of Delhi-NCR, was still significantly lower.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmrs-emissions-up-60-70-in-past-seven-years-report/articleshow/82867204.cms||Neha Madaan

---||Jaipur||50% villages in Kota & Sikar districts have Covid cases||JAIPUR: At least 50% of villages in Kota and Sikar districts have recorded Covid cases since April 24, reflecting the rapid spread of the virus in rural areas and also the lack of coordination between the district headquarters and the villages, which have one PHC for every 3-5 villages, making it difficult to provide emergency services. The absence of testing and poor health infrastructure is forcing villagers to either stay indoors or to look for private healthcare, thus hiding the real picture. The district administrations in both the districts have neither refused nor accepted the grim reality of the struggle they are facing. Consider the case of Chechat village in Ramganjmandi area, which has a PHC and a doctor for over 30 villages forcing patients to look for private treatment. “The PHC receives over 100 patients with ILI symptoms daily. It doesn’t have enough space and doctors to even check them properly, forget about conducting RT-PCR tests,” said Mustaq Ali, a local scribe, whose views were confirmed by a health worker. Kota has an active caseload of 6,119 cases, which is the 4th highest in the state. The district with 866 villages and 156 gram panchayats has several villages without basic facilities. DM Kota Ujjawal Rathore has confirmed that 300 villages have recorded positive cases in the second wave. CMHO Kota Bhupendra Singh Tanwar said they have started recording the cases in every village. “Officially, the figures will be released only after Monday,” said Tanwar. Sikar has 1,183 villages and almost half of them have Covid cases. Villages are facing unending deaths. “Data corroborated by independent sources and local NGOs from the Asha Workers and anganwadi workers say that Covid has spread its wings in over 50% of the villages in Sikar. Also, the actual number of deaths in these villages are very high and can be attributed to the infection,” said Ashfaq Kaimkhany. Commenting on the trend, DM Sikar Avichal Chaturvedi agreed that a major concentration of positive cases are in the villages, but they have no data to comment on the villages. He said, “Existing infrastructure has improved massively and the supply chain of oxygen cylinders has been strengthened,” said Chaturvedi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/2-districts-where-50-villages-have-covid/articleshow/82867202.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Delay in RT-PCR test reports impeding corona treatment||JAIPUR: Delay in RT-PCR test reports in villages is impeding the treatment of Covid patients by up to 8-10 days in several districts, leading to a risk of high mortalities. Health rights groups say people in several villages in Bicchiwada tehsil of Dungarpur have to wait for 3-4 days for sampling and then another 6-7 days for getting reports. Similarly, in Sanawada village in Jaisalmer, which is at least 10-km away from the closest settlement, the sampling vehicle arrives when more than five persons are ready for RT-PCR tests. Bicchiwada has 42 panchayats with a sampling centre on a rotational basis. Khajuri villagers have to go for RT-PCR test every Thursday while residents of Rampura Mewara can undergo the test on Monday. “If any Khajuri villager comes up with any Covid symptom, he/she has two conditions — either they have to travel to reach the sampling team or have to wait for seven days. One needs around 10 days to get the report,” said Madhulika of Covid support Dungarpur, who is setting up an isolation centre in Bicchiwada with the administration. Complaining about the delay, Asha Manat, sarpanch of Chapi gram panchayat, said they are lucky that Bicchiwada is just 2km. “The result usually comes in 3-4 days and distribution of free medical treatment takes 1-2 days. In many cases, the delay led to severe health issues,” said Manat. People of Roru Badi village in Sikar, which has seen 15 deaths in the last 20 days, have to struggle for a test. The villagers with symptoms have to either go to Laxmnangarh Tehsil, which is 11km away or wait for the sampling team. Mahendra Singh Gujjar, sarpanch of Roru Badi village, said since lockdown is in place, many who still has symptoms have not gone for a test. “Even at Laxmangarth, the test is limited and many a times, villagers have to return barehanded,” said Gujjar. Since the test is not done, medicines are not delivered to those with symptoms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rt-pcr-test-becomes-difficult-in-villages/articleshow/82867193.cms||---

She threatened for massive protest against such mismanagement during time of pandemic.Bhadel on Saturday evening went to district collector and alleged that recently one of the BJP woman young corporator also died in the JLN Hospital and BJP demanded probe in her death but nothing was done. It is the duty of district administration and hospital to see that no one should died because of the carelessness. The hospital is responsible for management in wards and therefore the technical fault is also the onus of hospital management. She demanded to register a case in police station. Bhadel said that Ghalot government is not providing facilities to patients but extorting money on the name of imposing penalties to common man.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/chaos-at-jln-hops-as-oxygen-supply-falters-briefly/articleshow/82867209.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Cyclone Yaas likely to turn into a very severe cyclonic storm, says Met department||KOLKATA: Cyclone Yaas has started forming over east central Bay of Bengal and seems imminent to turn into a cyclonic storm by May 24 and subsequently, into a very severe cyclonic storm over the next 24 hours even as it roars into north Bay of Bengal on May 25. The cyclone was likely to strike the Bengal coast, either East Midnapore or South 24 Parganas, said the Met office. It hasn’t ruled out the possibility of Yaas hitting land near north Odisha or the Bangladesh coast. At the time of landfall on May 26 morning, the cyclone is predicted to have a wind speed of 155-165 km/hour. Kolkata may start receiving drizzles from Tuesday morning under the impact of the approaching cyclone and the rain could intensify subsequently across south Bengal as Yaas strikes land. “We expect a spell of very heavy rainfall in Kolkata and the rest of south Bengal between the night of May 25 and May 26 as the cyclone passes through the district. Subsequently, the rain will lose intensity as the cyclone moves into the land but depending on the track that it takes, the weather may remain cloudy,” said Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) director G K Das. The Met office added Yaas would be less intense than Amphan, which was a super cyclone. After turning into a very severe cyclone, Yaas would continue to move north-northwestwards, intensify further and reach north Bay of Bengal close to the Bengal, north Odisha and Bangladesh coasts. “It is very likely to cross Bengal and adjoining north Odisha and Bangladesh coasts on the evening of May 26. While we can’t yet pinpoint the exact location of its landfall, East Midnapore and South 24 Parganas look vulnerable. Going by its movement so far, Yaas seems headed for the Bengal coast but it may change over the next 48 hours,” added Das. Ruling out suggestions that since the time gap between the formation of the cyclone and its expected landfall was short, the storm could be less intense, Das said it was predicted to move coastward at a reasonable pace and would gather enough strength to turn into either a very severe or a severe cyclone. “As of now, we expect it to be more than just a cyclone. Depending on how the system forms and moves, its intensity will be determined. But our meteorological indications suggest it will be more than just a cyclone,” added Das.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/yaas-likely-to-turn-into-a-very-severe-cyclonic-storm-met/articleshow/82867220.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Pune||Comedians, singers raise funds for Covid relief||Pune: Hemkunt Foundation, a nongovernment organisation (NGO) that works for Covid relief initiatives, has collaborated with local comedians and musicians to raise funds for providing relief and assistance to patients. The artists started putting up a series of online shows from May 15 for The Togetherness Project and all proceeds will be donated towards Covid-19 relief, including providing oxygen to patients. The artists who have come on board are performing for free. Online live shows will be conducted every Saturday till June 12. Pooja Khera, a happiness coach, who facilitated the initiative, said, “There has never been so much feeling of despair, helplessness, uncertainty and gloom all around. But people still want to come forward and help. I wanted to do something that would make people feel happy and forget about their worries for a short while.” The proceeds will be used by the NGO to purchase oxygen cylinders, oxygen concentrators and supply them to Covid patients. Talking about the role of live entertainment at a time when social media is flooded with news of loss of lives due to shortage of oxygen, medicines, beds etc, Gurpreet Singh, a stand-up comedian, said, “This show helps people to overcome pain, grief and suffering. Having recovered from Covid-19 recently, I intend to donate my plasma as soon as I am allowed to do so. Although the rising death toll and cries for help from families affected by the pandemic are deafening and emotionally taxing for everyone, I believe that some sort of escape, even for a brief moment, is extremely crucial for mental health.” Aakash Mehta, another stand-up comedian participating in the project, said, “My biggest concern is that in a lot of charity events, all the proceeds do not go to the NGO, but in this case, I was assured that the funds can be audited, which made me confident of being associated with the initiative.” Singer Bismil added, “As artists, we can help people heal. I’m trying to use my music to help people relax and unwind for a short while as stress levels are so high. The feeling I get that I touched hearts and brought smiles gives me a sense of purpose.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/comedians-singers-raise-funds-for-covid-relief/articleshow/82867211.cms||---

No casualty is reported in the incident. A source with the hospital said the vehicle went up in flames while the ambulance staff was changing oxygen cylinders in the vehicle. “The fire was caused by a short circuit behind the driver’s seat. The fire soon engulfed the entire vehicle, which was completely destroyed. Some pure oxygen that was released while changing the cylinders also fuelled the fire. The ambulance staff quickly got out of the vehicle with the patient, averting any casualties.” The fire and rescue service personnel, who were stationed outside the hospital, sprang into action immediately and put out the flames within 15 minutes. CMCH dean Dr A Nirmala and district collector S Nagarajan later took stock of the situation. The crowd in front of the hospital was cleared as smoke enveloped the area. 108 ambulance authorities said they were investigating the cause of short circuit, despite regular maintenance of the vehicle. “There are lots of wires and fuses running through behind the driver’s seat. The vehicle’s ignition was on when the wire burst, and the technicians were changing the oxygen cylinder,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/108-ambulance-goes-up-in-flames-in-front-of-cmch/articleshow/82867203.cms||---

The HRCT score of the patient was 17 and a sample for RT-PCR test was taken on Saturday, said paediatrician Dr Harish Chauhan. At present, the condition of the child is stable. In the last one month, 6-7 such kids were admitted and discharged after treatment. He said that in the last 15 days, around 60-70 children have been infected, but most of them were asymptomatic and these children were identified through contact tracing, but this is the first case with 17 score in HRCT who has been admitted. Expecting a third wave, Covid wards are being prepared for children at the district hospital. To save children from the third wave, revenue minister Harish Choudhary has directed the district administration to set up a 25-bed special Covid ward at Baytoo CHC in Barmer. He said the work has been started at the hall on the second floor of the CHC and a second temporary isolation ward will also be set up. All necessary equipment and medicines will be available here. A team of local doctors has also been appointed to save children from the infection. On the other hand, the Barmer district administration has also started preparations to prevent the third wave, in which the experts have said that it would affect children the most. District collector Lok Bandhu has directed to follow the guidelines issued by Rajasthan state child protection commission. He said that at present arrangements have not been made for vaccination for children and in such a situation all measures have to be taken to protect them from the deadly virus. He said directions have been issued to ensure basic facilities like ventilator, oxygen, doctors, nursing personnel etc., at the children’s hospital and children’s ward in general hospital. He said all institutions related to children, child welfare committee, juvenile house and hostels have been asked to buy pulse oximeters so that the health condition of children can be monitored. Dedicated Covid care centres for children will be set up at sub-division, block and gram samiti level in the district, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/barmer-prepares-for-3rd-wave-as-infection-spreads-in-kids/articleshow/82867214.cms||---

While their number has been increasing daily, more and more Good Samaritans are pitching in to feed them and ensure no one is starving. The emergency food response team in Coimbatore has identified about 14 hunger spots in areas such as Kavundampalayam, Vellalore, Puliyakulam, Chettipalayam and CMC Colony, where daily wagers are found in large numbers. The team has been distributing more than 3,000 food packets daily. Padmanaban Gopal, founder, No Food Waste, said they had set up one each centralized kitchen at Uppilipalayam, Puliyakulam and Nirmala College for Women. “We are involving members of self-help groups to cook food, which is distributed to the needy through the volunteers. We are also distributing food to the people in home quarantine, but only on request. While people sponsor grocery items that are required for the meals, we take care of other expenses.” Pointing out that they have involved 20 volunteers in the distribution process, he said all the necessary steps have been taken to ensure their safety.Similarly, Jamaat e Islmai Hind (JIH), along with the Students Islamic Organization of India, is distributing food packets to 600 people daily. Abdul Hakkim, youth wing president, JIH, said they had set up a centralized kitchen at Masjidul Ihsaan, a mosque at Karumbukadai, to prepare food. “We have publicized our helpline number and been distributing food to the people in slum areas based on request and the destitute. We are also serving three meals to the people in home isolation.” The situation is almost the same in the neighbouring Tirupur. Indira Sundaram, founder of Indira Sundaram Charitable Trust, is distributing more than 700 food packets to both the frontline workers and the homeless people. “I first increased the number of food packets to 200 when the government announced that eateries could function only for a fixed time during the lockdown. Within a few days, the number of food packets being distributed touched 700. I have started to distribute dinner, for which I have been receiving requests.” She used to serve only lunch until recently. Indira has distributed about 100kg rice and grocery items to the transgender community at Samaickenpalayam in Coimbatore a few days ago. Dr Nithyanandan Devraj, chairman, Shri Avinashiappar trust, and his wife Dr Guhapriya are distributing food to the homeless people in and around Avinashi in Tirupur. They have tied up with a mess in that locality. Despite her busy schedule, Guhapriya manages to distribute breakfast to the needy, while they have roped in five to six volunteers to distribute lunch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/volunteers-unite-to-drive-away-citys-hunger-pangs/articleshow/82867222.cms||Nivedha Selvam

With dreams in his eyes, he bought an autorickshaw in December 2019 after taking a loan of Rs3 lakh from a bank. But a few months down the line, his dream fizzled out. Telgote was forced to slam the brakes on plying his vehicle after lockdown was clamped. Without any option in sight, he started selling lemons to provide for his family and pay instalments of his vehicle..As lockdown was eased after a few months, Telgote started plying his autorickshaw again. Things started looking up for him and he was hopeful of better days ahead. But as tighter restrictions were put in place this year and his passengers dwindled, Telgote was forced to discontinue plying his vehicle again. Now, he is back to square one, selling lemons on Salunke Vihar Road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/autorickshaw-driver-back-to-selling-lemons-at-street-corner/articleshow/82867224.cms||Joy Sengupta

Residents will start receiving water at higher pressure from the next week. The pipeline network will reduce the daily water shortage,” said Ashwini Kishor Pokale, the local corporator.The residents of Dhayari and other areas, facing water shortage for the past few months, had demanded urgent solutions. Temporary arrangements were made to increase the supply by lifting water from the Mutha canal, but it was not sustainable for a long time. The civic body then decided to lay another pipeline.Pokale said, “Till now, water is being supplied through a single pipeline. It has been proving insufficient during the three months of summer and depleted water levels in the dams. A proposal was discussed with the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC)’s water supply department to make provision for additional pipeline to draw more water from the main line up to a well that supplies water in the Dhayri area.”He said, “In addition to laying 16-inch pipeline, two more pipelines of 12-inch and eight-inch diameter are also being laid to supply water up to the overhead water tanks at additional pressure. The infrastructure will augment the water supply to around one lakh residents in the area.”Prasad Khare, an officer-bearer and a resident of DSK Vishwa said they had been facing water shortage every summer and the ongoing infrastructure augmentation could boost the supply and reduce the dependence on water tankers.An official from the PMC’s water supply department said, “Most of the work pertaining to the laying additional pipeline has been completed. The additional connection will reduce the dependence on the water canal and water would be supplied at adequate pressure.”Sandeep Karpe, a resident of the Raykar Mala area, said the additional line would address at least 50% of the water issues. “We have suggested some more measures. The elected representatives and the civic administration should work together on these measures to reduce the hardships of citizens,” Karpe added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hint-of-better-water-supply-in-dhayari-from-next-week/articleshow/82867237.cms||Sarang Dastane

According to the district collector, 56 of them are in the zero to 12 years age group, while the remaining are between 12 and 18 years. They contracted the infection from their Covid positive parents and are now recovering. The child panel has asked the administration to set up dedicated Covid wards for children and essential infrastructure for treatment. Rajasthan State Commission for Protection of Child Rights chairperson Sangeeta Beniwal said, “Some media reports said over 500 children were infected with Covid in past two weeks in Dungrapur, but when I spoke to the district collector, he said the actual number was around 200. This number is also quite high and children are between 14-17 age group. I have asked the administration to set up dedicated Covid ward for children with adequate facilities. I have also asked them to send me a list of children who are infected. This has been asked from all districts as well.” Meanwhile, the district administration officials claimed that the number of children getting infected has remained constant in the last three months. District collector Suresh Ola said, “I have seen the data of the number of children who were Covid positive in March, April and May, which shows that there has no been no drastic increase in the number. On an average, we get around 3-4 cases of children daily, but only one child has been admitted to a hospital in the last six months while the remaining have recovered at home. In last 12 days there were 56 children between 0-12 years who were covid positive while the remaining children were older” Ola visited the children’s ward at the district hospital on Saturday to take a detailed report . According to guidelines apart from setting up of separate ward for Covid infected children, the district administration needs to ensure all children hospitals/wards have adequate facilities like ventilators, oxygen cylinders and medical staff. The state health department also said around 3% of the total patients are children. A senior official said, “Around 3% of the cases, which are being reported, are children in the age group of 0-10 years. It has been observed that in the second wave, almost all family members get infected.” However, Dungarpur CMHO Dr Rajesh Sharma said speculations on the third wave having affected children in the district are baseless. “ In over two weeks, only 60 children were found positive. All of them were asymptomatic and they were tested because of contact tracing. Either their parents or relatives had been positive and hence the children contracted the disease,” Sharma told TOI. He added that Dungarpur was the first district to begin campaigns for door-to-door screening and distribution of medical kits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/udaipur/child-panel-writes-to-dungarpur-collector-after-200-kids-test-positive-in-12-days/articleshow/82874114.cms||Yeshika Budhwar

A TNSTC official, who didn’t want to be named, said, “We decided to operate buses to the districts such as Salem, Madurai, Trichy and Theni from Singanallur and Gandhipuram bus stands, taking the demand into consideration. We are operating at least 10 buses to each district and each bus will make two trips, which will be increased based on the demand.” He said that shortly after the chief minister’s announcement, buses were kept ready for service under the monitoring of supervisors and other staff. “We have directed the conductors to fill only 50% of the seats in a bus to reduce the chances of virus transmission from one passenger to another.” As of 6pm, the official said, seven buses had left Singanallur bus stand and not even 50% of the seats was filled. “The passenger traffic may increase on Sunday. Since the announcement came in only afternoon, the public might take their time to decide and make arrangements to travel back to their hometowns. As the complete lockdown was already in force with only select industries allowed to function, many outsiders would have already returned home. The transportation service has resumed only to assist the ones who had missed the opportunity to return home earlier.” The official said they had also made arrangements to operate about 150 town buses in the district on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/tnstc-ready-to-operate-buses-at-short-notice/articleshow/82867239.cms||Nivedha Selvam

Sravan, who is also Congress in-charge for the Khairatabad assembly constituency, along with former Secunderabad MP Anjan Kumar Yadav and local leaders visited Khairatabad UPHC and highlighted the apathy of TRS government towards the hospital. “CM KCR, during his visit to Warangal, has announced that he will construct a hospital after demolishing Warangal central jail. He had earlier announced that the old dilapidated building of Osmania Hospital in Hyderabad would also be demolished but nothing has been done. CM KCR should first make use of the existing health infrastructure facilities to deliver Covid-19 treatment, as people are suffering severely due to lack of beds and advanced care facilities,” Sravan said. The 50-bed UPHC at Khairatabad was constructed during former CM Kiran Kumar Reddy’s government in the undivided state. Sravan also demanded that industries minister KT Rama Rao, who is heading the Covid-19 taskforce, visit government hospitals to take stock of facilities and turn them into Covid-19 hospitals and save people from the clutches of corporate hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cong-convert-khairatabad-uphc-into-covid-centre/articleshow/82867241.cms||---

While some of the shopkeepers are in favour of markets remaining shut till the situation normalises, others suggest that businesses should be allowed to open on weekdays with restrictions. Rakesh Yadav, general secretary of Bhartiya Udyog Vyapar Mandal, said the government could allow opening of shops on odd-even basis and for limited hours. “We had a virtual meeting where traders from 150 prominent markets and organisations participated. If the government allows the opening of markets, we would support a night curfew. They can also engage civil defence volunteers to stop violation of norms. Vaccination camps should be held in market areas for traders and their workers so that they won’t become carriers,” said Yadav. Confederation of Trade and Industries (CTI) claimed to have conducted a survey to understand the opinion of traders, restaurant owners and others on opening of markets.

Also, the positivity rate, which was around 35% in early April has now reduced to 11%. While the recovery rate has improved from around 83% to around 89%. Sapna Thackeray, the chief medical officer of MMC, told TOI, “For the first time, during the second wave of Covid, we registered zero cases on May 19. The daily cases, which were around 150-200 last month, are less than 25 to 30, at present. Despite the reduction of daily cases, we are continuing to conduct around 250-300 tests per day” Most of the patients currently undergoing treatment at various Covid hospitals in the textile town are from either rural parts of Malegaon or neighbouring talukas, she said. The Covid hospitals in Malegaon, including the ones managed by the civic body, had faced torrid time following acute shortage of medical oxygen amid the rise in demand of the gas in Nashik, which usually supplies it to Malegaon. The oxygen supply from Dhule was also affected. The distributors managed to procure refills from Aurangabad. Even the availability of oxygen and ICU beds in hospitals was a huge problem. State agriculture minister and local legislator from Malegaon Dada Bhuse, had held a series of meetings with government and civic authorities in the last couple of months to resolve the issues related to Covid. “We will continue with aggressive testing to identify and treat Covid patients since there is a prediction of the third wave,” She said. Mayur Shah, former president of IMA, Malegaon, said daily Covid cases in Malegaon town have reduced “But the flow of Covid patients from rural parts are continuing in the textile town for treatment and many are succumbing as they are being brought in late for treatment,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/covid-indicators-in-malegaon-show-significant-improvement/articleshow/82863950.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

These vehicles have the provision to keep medical kits and oxygen cylinders. One part of the vehicle, where the patient will be kept, is covered from above so that the vehicle can ferry them even in rain.Nandurbar is the first district in north Maharashtra where the bike ambulances have been introduced. Padavi said these vehicles will benefit people residing in the mountainous terrain of talukas like Akkalkuwa and Dhandgaon. He stressed on the need to replicate the project in districts like Palghar, Gadchiroli and Raigad.Nandurbar collector Rajendra Bharud told TOI that there are many remote locations in the two talukas that cannot be accessed by the four-wheeled ambulances.“People often have to trek long distances carrying patients like pregnant women, those bitten by snakes etc. on bamboo-made stretchers from those remote locations. These bike ambulances will be able to reach such places,” said Bharud.The bike ambulances will ferry the patients to the nearest health facility and depending on the patient’s condition, s/he can be shifted to bigger hospitals in four-wheeled ambulances. The district administration had over 42 ambulances during the pandemic, which were funded by state government, MLA fund and under Corporate Social Responsibility.“The drivers of the bike ambulances are local residents of the two talukas. They will immediately come to know through their contacts if there is any need to ferry a patient. Since they know the terrain, it would be easier for them to reach the location,” added Bharud.Each of these drivers will be paid Rs 13,000 a month, including Rs 3,000 for fuel cost and maintenance of the vehicles. The district administration will train them on how to administer medical oxygen and how to use the medical kit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/ten-bike-ambulances-to-ferry-patients-in-nandurbar/articleshow/82863938.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

---||Delhi||O2 case: Police plea for Kalra custody gets rejected again||New Delhi: A Delhi court on Saturday rejected the Delhi Police’s plea seeking five days’ custody of businessman Navneet Kalra in connection with the alleged blackmarketing and hoarding case of oxygen concentrators. After hearing submissions on behalf of the police and the accused, duty magistrate Vasundhara Azad said, “PC (police custody) is not warranted.” Earlier, public prosecutor Atul Shrivastava had sought five days of Kalra’s custody to confront him with evidence collected so far. He said some people who bought the machines from Kalra had asked him to refund them as concentrators had turned out to be faulty. Shrivastava further submitted that according to an opinion taken from AIIMS doctors, the machines were useless for Covid-19 patients. Kalra’s custody was also required now that his phone’s mirror image had been created, added the prosecutor. Appearing for Kalra, advocate Vineet Malhotra said that his client had cooperated with the police and was willing to continue doing so. “When state prosecutes someone, it is supposed to act fairly,” he said, pointing out that the grounds raised for the custodial remand were identical to the arguments raised earlier and the same were rejected by a duty court on May 20. A duty court on May 20 sent Kalra to 14 days of judicial custody after rejecting the police’s remand plea. Malhotra further stressed that after seizing the machines from Matrix Cellular, a company that had procured these concentrators, the machines were given to Covid centres. The counsel also said that Kalra had never claimed that the machines were of German collaboration – an allegation of the prosecution. Meanwhile, Kalra appeared from jail and addressed the court stating, “I am a famous optician. I had taken machines from Matrix to facilitate them to friends and family. Police bought these machines for Covid centres from me. I have messages where people have said the timely help has saved lives. They say there are 23 bank accounts but I have only one account. I am famous, that’s why they are just trying to put it on me. I am not the manufacturer. When the machines were not functioning, I exchanged them.” Kalra also said if the police had created the mirror image of his phone, then why wasn’t it showing the positive messages sent by people who had procured the machines from him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/o2-case-police-plea-for-kalra-custody-gets-rejected-again/articleshow/82867312.cms||Aamir Khan

According to a health department source, the cases of black fungus in the state are "yet to be compiled and could be in hundreds". Meerut's divisional surveillance officer Dr Ashok Taliyan said, "Till now, 86 cases have been reported in the district. It includes those arriving here from other cities. Six deaths have been reported and five surgeries have taken place so far." The UP government, on Friday, declared black fungus as a "notified disease in the state". On Saturday, Meerut's chief medical officer Dr Akhilesh Mohan said, "After the disease got notified we set up a dedicated ward in Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial (LLRM) Medical College, though there is no specific count on the number of beds as of now." When contacted, LLRM Medical College principal Dr Gyanender Kumar said, "We have created a 20-bed facility for black fungus patients. We will increase the beds, if the need arises. There is enough stock of medicines. We will get 200 more vials of amphotericin from Lucknow by Sunday." Senior surgeon in Anand Hospital, Dr Subhash Yadav, said, "Mucormycosis is a fungus present in the form of microscopic spores in the air. Once inhaled, it enters the sinuses and afflicts if one has high blood sugar level." “During treatment, some Covid patients are given high doses of steroids [many without a prescription and monitoring] and this increases sugar level. Also, mucor flourishes on Ferritin [blood protein], which is high in Covid patients.

---||Chennai||Suspect in 2014 MGR Chennai Central station bomb blast case arrested||CHENNAI: Police on Friday arrested a terror suspect involved in the 2014 bomb blast at MGR Chennai Central railway station in which a woman software engineer was killed. A team from the Periamet police station had arrested Rafique, 38, recently in a robbery case. Police inquiries revealed that he was an active member of Al-Umma, a banned outfit, and that the National Investigation Agency (NIA) was searching for him in connection with the 2014 blast case. Following this, police informed NIA officials. The bomb blast happened in the S-4 and S-5 coaches of the Bengaluru-Guwahati express train that was on platform 9 after arriving at the Central station around 7am on May 1, 2014. Software engineer Swathi, 24, died on the spot as one of the bombs exploded under her seat, while 14 other passengers were injured in the incident. A team from the special branch-CID was questioning Rafique, who was also called Noorudin alias Ismail, at a secret location. On May 5, Rafique and his associate Sabiyullah Yasin snatched Rs 7.5 lakh and 282 grams of gold worth Rs 9 lakh, from Suraj, a jewellery shop owner, when the latter was returning from his shop on a two-wheeler near Allikulam market behind the Periamet police station. The Periamet police nabbed Yasin with the help of CCTV camera footage a few days ago. Based on his confession, police arrested Rafique from a hideout in Thiruvottiyur. The police team seized 74.6 grams of gold jewels, a car and a bike from him before he was remanded on Friday. Police, who had nabbed Yasin in connection with the case and seized Rs 6 lakh from him, took him into two-day custody on Friday for further investigation. In 2016, the NIA had arrested some suspects involved in the 2014 Chennai Central railway station blast. They were also involved in another terror case and were lodged in a jail in Madhya Pradesh. However, Rafique had absconded. A senior police officer said that Rafique had started his criminal career as a fake currency agent in the city and that he had links with anti-socials and fundamentalists based in Bengal’s Malda district. A police officer, who had caught Rafique for smuggling fake currency at Kodungaiyur a decade ago, said Rafique had visited Bangladesh and Pakistan too to procure the fake currency notes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/suspect-in-2014central-stationbomb-blastcase-arrested/articleshow/82867300.cms||A Selvaraj

The area comes under the Amboli-Dodamarg forest range, one of the seven ranges along the Western Ghats declared conservation reserves by the Maharashtra government last year. Divisional forest officer (Kolhapur) Vishal Mali said, “A truck driver, who had gone to Konkan from Kolhapur to bring laterite stone, spotted the tigress and the two cubs in the Phonda Ghat region. The truck driver could capture a video showing the cubs jumping upon a tree. He shared the video clip with the forest office.” Mali said, “We have informed the Sawantwadi foresters about the spotting of the big cat. Altogether 30 trap cameras will be installed in the Radhanagari wildlife sanctuary to confirm its existence and prohibit human interference in the area.” Forest department officials had in the end of April spotted a tiger for the first time in one the conservation reserves along the Western Ghats of Maharashtra. The forest officials had said the sighting of a tiger was of major significance as it highlighted the purpose for which the forest ranges were declared conservation reserves. In December last year, the state wildlife board headed by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had given the conservation reserve tag to the seven ranges — Amboli-Dodamarg, Chandgad, Ajara-Bhudargad, Gaganbawda, Panhalagad, Vishalgad and Jor-Jambhali — along the Western Ghats. These conservation reserve now connect the protected forest areas such as Sahyadri Tiger Reserve, Radhanagari Wildlife Sanctuary and Tillari Wildlife Sanctuary that are already protected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/tigress-spotted-with-2-cubs-in-w-ghats-conservation-reserve/articleshow/82864060.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

Now Khanpur has 9 oximeters, 100 thermometers, masks, santitisers, zinc and vitamin C tablets as well as other medicines that are being distributed freely to villagers. Over 200 boys and girls have formed social media groups to coordinate efforts towards finding hospital beds, oxygen, ambulances. Local residents said 20-25 people have fallen to Covid in the village in the last one month, but it was the death of Santosh Sharma, 66, a disabled English teacher that hit the youngsters hard, eventually bringing them together. Sharma, who taught at a private school and took tuition, fell ill towards April-end and died within a week, gasping for breath as she was turned away by several private hospitals. Sharma had spent her life teaching village kids and helping shape careers of many of her students. “She is a revered figure here. Other than her English tutorials, her life itself was a lesson for us, and so was her death,” said her former student Abhishek Chikara, 27, an engineer with an automobile company in Gurgaon who coordinated with other village youngsters to set up a Covid self-help team. The youngsters now not only clean the village daily, but apart from the ever growing stock of medicines have also converted the local school into a six-bed isolation ward. “She was the only English teacher in our area, including neighbouring villages. She taught two generations here. Almost 99% of students from our village have learnt whatever English they know from her,” said Shawal Choudhary, 30, a primary school teacher. A few originally from Khanpur but now settled overseas have also pitched in now. “The death of our teacher due to lack of oxygen was the trigger. These kids have now taken things in their own hands as they help people around them who do not have access to proper healthcare,” said Amit Chikara, 40, a native from Khanpur who now lives in London. Sushil Kumar, husband of village pradhan Shakuntala Devi, said. “The children have done good work. They have been contributing physically, mentally and financially."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/shaken-by-teachers-death-youth-in-up-village-mount-unique-covid-war/articleshow/82864088.cms||Piyush Rai

The facility was being run by one MG Khan, who was using ‘MD’ with his name to fool patients, said district administration officials, who raided the premises. When asked, nursing home staff said that “MD means managing director because Khan is the owner of the nursing home”, said officials, adding that a register showed visits by renowned doctors of the town, while in reality, not a single doctor had visited the nursing home ever. After getting complaints from several patients about “sub-standard medical services” at the nursing home, city magistrate Abhishek Kumar and officials of the health department raided the nursing home and found several irregularities. Officials said that they found stamps and letterhead bearing the name “Doctor MG Khan, MD” from the nursing home. The city magistrate said, “The nursing home was registered with the CMO office long ago. During the inspection, we didn’t find any qualified staff or doctor. Besides, Khan was also not present at the nursing home.

---||Hyderabad||1/3rd of urban Indians Covid positive by December 2020: Sero audit||HYDERABAD: Thirty one per cent of people had tested seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies till December 2020, an audit of Covid-19 serology data done in 12 cities, including Visakhapatnam in AP, has revealed. This would mean that one-third of urban dwellers were exposed to coronavirus, experts said. Experts also claimed that seropositivity will be significantly more than 31% in the second wave of pandemic, which is six times bigger in terms of the number of positive cases. The audit report was collated from 4.4 lakh samples taken from a chain of private labs. According to the audit, 33.8% of those tested in Visakhapatnam had antibodies. The researchers said: “We found a remarkably high seropositivity rate to SARS-CoV-2 approaching half of all adults in self-referred populations in selected major cities in India. The results were consistent with Covid-19 mortality data and previous serological surveys done in more randomly-selected populations.” Researchers from the Centre for Global Health Research, University of Toronto, Canada, and A Velumani and C Nikam of Thyrocare Labs conducted the study. In the entire country, 31%of self-referred people tested in over 2,200 collection points turned seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The researchers found higher seropositivity in women (35%) than in men (30%) in all age groups. “Seropositivity has reduced in areas with higher childhood measles vaccination,” they added. Rajeev Jayadevan, former president of Indian Medical Association, said in a series of tweets that the samples collected were from self-referred people and from relatively higher socio-economic class. “Different cities had different peak phases of the pandemic. Delhi had Covid-19 peak phases in June and December, while Chennai cases peaked in July and Pune in September,” he said. He said the overall peak was in mid-September. Pune had the highest seropositivity of 69%. “These 12 cities accounted for 1/3rd of cases in India. If we add the massive second wave, the percentage of those exposed to the virus by now will be significantly greater than 31%. The high secondary attack rate seen in 2021 will push this even higher,” he observed. Jayadevan said circumference of more than 77% of households in India is less or equal to two rooms in size. “This leaves almost no scope for social distancing. With increased transmissibility, SARS-CoV-2 could well be more than 90 per cent in such settings,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/1/3rd-of-urban-indians-covid-ve-by-dec-20-sero-audit/articleshow/82867349.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Rising Covid deaths a cause for concern, says Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Saturday said the increasing number of Covid-related deaths in the state is a matter of concern and that the disease severity has been increasing after the second wave reached its peak. “This is a crucial time for hospitals and strong safety measures are required to deal with this phase. Our primary duty now is to save lives and we will do everything possible to ensure it. The second Covid wave has taught us some new lessons. While there is a strong possibility of a third wave, the government will immediately initiate strong measures to evaluate these experiences in detail and prepare for a better defence. The stringent vigilance of the people helped us contain the second wave and we should continue to do so in a similar manner for some more time,” he said. Restrictions will be tightened in Malappuram district, where the test positivity rate is still high. An action plan will be implemented for the district. About 75,000 sample tests will be conducted on Monday and Tuesday. More police officers have been deployed in the district to ensure effective implementation of the existing regulations under the triple lockdown. Police have been directed to take all legal action against those violating the regulations. Disasters such as floods or landslides caused by heavy rains may affect the operations of Covid first-line and second-line treatment centres (FLTC & SLTCs) designed specifically to deal with Covid patients. In view of such a possibility, a comprehensive list of all health centres vulnerable to floods and landslides is being prepared, the chief minister said. Vijayan said the government would conduct a medical audit of Black Fungus cases being reported in the state. Availability of medicine would be ensured for those battling the disease at any cost. The CM, however, reiterated that there was no need to panic over the fungal infection and said the deaths due to the disease were not higher than what it used to be in the pre-Covid-19 period. Mass causality triage system, the protocol for the handling of major crises, would be introduced in all major hospitals. Surge capacity plans on how to handle the situation if the cases surge beyond the capacity of the respective hospitals would also be put in place, he said. Since the possibility of a third Covid wave is not ruled out, it is important that those who got vaccinated should also keep following the Covid-19 protocol for an extended period, he said. The hospitals will also prepare and train an emergency response plan to help respond to emergencies in a flawless manner. A communication system will also be set up to ensure proper coordination in such situations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/rising-covid-deaths-a-cause-for-concern-says-pinarayi/articleshow/82865866.cms||---
---||Goa||Overharvesting of wild mushrooms can trigger another pandemic: Researcher||PANAJI: Botanist professor Nandakumar Kamat, on Saturday warned that if the indiscriminate harvesting of the local mushroom variety, the roen olmi, in Goa is not stopped, the next pandemic can be triggered from the Western Ghats. He was speaking at a Goa State Biodiversity Board (GSBB) event to mark World Biodiversity Day. Kamat, a consultant to GSBB on microbial biodiversity, appealed to the people of Goa not to encourage consumption of the seasonal termitomyces mushrooms, locally known as roen olmi. “If we do not stop the indiscriminate harvest of these mushrooms, we are headed towards another pandemic starting from the Western Ghats,” he said, explaining briefly how the disease agents are contained by the forest ecosystems. He said our destructive actions can lead to epidemics and pandemics. Kamat also stressed on the need to document the different uses of microbes in day to day activities and on why we should not to tamper with our ecology and environment, especially within the context of the ongoing pandemic. He said measures need to be taken to safeguard future generations from any further pandemics by ensuring that we conserve our environment and biodiversity. Wild, edible mushrooms, locally known as ‘roen olmis’, make an appearance in Goan markets within a few weeks of monsoons hitting the state. The ‘roen olmis’, called so because they grow on anthills (‘roen’ in Konkani) are considered a must-eat seasonal delicacy by the people of the state. But, scientist Dr Nandkumar Kamat, among the rare researchers to have spent 32 years unraveling the mysteries of this termitomyces species, warns that Goans by overharvesting this mushroom variety are digging the proverbial grave for Goa’s ecology. The species and the ecology it supports have evolved over a period of 400 million years, according to researchers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/overharvesting-of-wild-mushrooms-can-trigger-another-pandemic-researcher/articleshow/82869156.cms||---

While calling for a white paper on the employment scenario in Goa, the party has also demanded that the government take action against industries that employ residents of other states while Goans await job opportunities. Congress general secretary Amarnath Panjikar said Sawant’s revelation that these 5,000 workers enter Goa daily exposes that BJP is working for the welfare of residents of other states. “We demand that the BJP government take strict action on all those industries that have recruited outsiders by denying job opportunities to Goans,” said Panjikar. “We demand that labour and employment minister Jennifer Monserrate release a white paper on Goa’s employment scenario with details of Goans and non-Goans working in various industries and business firms in the state.” The party’s general secretary has also demanded that Monserrate tell the state about the efforts made to provide employment opportunities to Goans in private industries. He said Sawant’s statement that the state government could not restrict people from entering and working in Goa is “irresponsible and shocking”. “If the chief minister himself accepts that almost 5,000 workers enter Goa daily, it is clear that more than 15,000 to 20,000 jobs in Goa are currently taken by non-Goans,” Panjikar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/congress-for-action-against-firms-that-pick-outsiders/articleshow/82869179.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Shops selling groceries and vegetables too will remain shut during the lockdown period. A team of medical experts constituted by the state government had suggested intensifying Covid-19 control measures. Stalin also chaired a meeting with the committee of MLAs representing various parties before announcing the decision. “In view of the total lockdown, the government has permitted all shops open till 9pm on Saturday (May 22) and between 6am and 9pm on Sunday (May 23). All public and private buses will be allowed to ply on Saturday and Sunday,” Stalin said. Malls will not be allowed to open during the total lockdown. Vegetables and fruits will be supplied by horticulture department through vehicles during the lockdown period. Earlier, speaking at the meeting of MLAs representing various parties, Stalin said the Covid-19 spread had not been brought under control yet. “The government announced relaxations for people to buy groceries and vegetables, but some of them have taken it for granted and started roaming on the streets. They did not obey lockdown norms despite instructions from police”, the chief ministersaid. “Total lockdown was for people’s benefit and to save their lives. It was saddening when people treat lockdown as a holiday and not as an emergency caused by Covid,” Stalin said. To bring the pandemic under control, every individual had to take an oath that he or she would not spread the infection, he said. “Fear of coronavirus is evident while members of the public speak about the disease, but it does not reflect in their actions,” Stalin said, recalling how Covid-19 took away many lives and put the future of many families in question. Former health minister C Vijayabaskar said the chain of transmission could be broken only if total lockdown was imposed. He said the government should focus on early intervention and diagnosis and take up a multi-disciplinary approach on a warfooting by setting up additional Covid care centres, hospitals and screening centres in districts to avoid crowding in specialty hospitals. “Top-most priority should be given to oxygen supply. Post-Covid recovery clinics should also be set up and infrastructure should be ramped up to face the third wave,” the AIADMK leader said.

---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh villagers fear vaccine, turn away health staff||BHOPAL: District administration and health staff in the districts of Bundelkhand region in Madhya Pradesh are facing a tough time convincing villagers to get vaccinated against Covid-19. Villagers believe they would die if they take the vaccine and are turning away health staff. In several places in rural areas, vaccine teams were abused, manhandled and chased away. Earlier this month, health workers campaigning in the villages of Niwari district were attacked by the villagers. They pelted stones on four-wheelers fitted with loudspeakers spreading the message of getting vaccinated. Villagers also attacked the bikers who were visiting the by-lanes of the village motivating the people to get vaccinated for coronavirus protection. Two days ago, district collector of Niwari, Ashish Bhargava, had to face the wrath of the villagers when he tried to persuade them for vaccination. A woman resisted and argued against the vaccine saying that, “we will die, if we take it.” The collector who was accompanied by the health workers and other administrative officers tried to convince her, but failed. In the end, the collector had to guarantee her that she will not die after taking the vaccine. He told villagers, “I take the guarantee that no one would die, get vaccinated.” The block medical officer of Niwari Dr RC Malaaria told TOI, “there are so many misconceptions in the minds of the villagers that it is difficult to convince them for vaccination. Still, we are trying our best.” Niwari and neighbouring Tikamgarh had witnessed a huge surge of coronavirus during the second wave. In both the districts large number of coronavirus patients are reported from the rural areas of neighbouring UP, where the just concluded panchayat elections are also allegedly being blamed for the Covid surge. So far, only about one crore people have been vaccinated in the state and the number of rural folks contribute a very small number of these.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/mp-villagers-fear-vaccine-turn-away-health-staff/articleshow/82867381.cms||Deshdeep Saxena

RSK has asked the officials to furnish details by May 26. In a circular, RSK stated that process of admission under free education will start soon. “Officials are instructed to complete the work regarding the selections of schools under RTE and others. Details furnished after may 26 will not be entertained,” stated the circular. Under RTE provision, It is obligatory for the Government to provide free and compulsory elementary education to each and every child in a neighbourhood school within 1 km, up to class 8 in India. No child is liable to pay fee or any other charges that may prevent him or her from pursuing and completing elementary education. Free education also includes the provisions of textbooks, uniforms, stationery and special educational material for children with disabilities in order to reduce the burden of school expenses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/admissions-under-rte-to-start-soon-in-mp/articleshow/82867419.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||No vacancy at ENT hosp as black fungus cases spike||Hyderabad: A constant increase in cases of mucormycosis (black fungus), has led to the flooding of patients at the Government ENT Hospital in King Koti that ran out of beds on Saturday. This after the facility reported over 100 admissions between Thursday and Friday alone. Doctors said they have even put other surgeries on hold, to attend to these cases and have performed over 30 surgeries for debridement (surgical removal of parts of nose and eye) over the last three days. “In majority of the cases of severe infection, surgically removing the infected part becomes essential. We have stopped all ENT surgeries except some emergency ones. We are doing 10 to 12 surgeries (related to mucormycosis) each day now, after which the patients are put on antifungal medicines,” said Dr Manish Gupta, resident medical officer at the hospital. Meanwhile, with all its 225 beds occupied — and the corridors brimming with patients especially from neighbouring districts — hospital sources said that they are now being forced to turn away patients. “We waited in the queue for close to three hours on Friday, hoping to get a bed but was finally told that there are no vacancies. We had to shift my relative to a private hospital subsequently,” said Mustafa Sheikh, the patient’s relative. That the hospital has had no discharges over the last four days, since it was declared as the nodal centre for treatment of mucormycosis cases in the state, has only added to the shortage. “Patients suffering from this require at least three to four days of hospitalisation after surgery, before they can be discharged. So, we might begin some discharges tomorrow (Sunday),” Dr Gupta. The back fungus is an opportunistic fungal infection which is being seen among Covid-19 recovered patients who are diabetic or have been in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). “Certain drugs called immunomodulators used to treat severe cases of Covid-19 can cause immunosuppression. ICU admissions with long-term oxygen inhalation may result in a drop in oxygen mask hygiene. If the patient has pre-existing, poorly controlled diabetes, he or she is more at risk of developing mucormycosis,” said Dr Tarjani Vivek Dave, senior ophthalmologist, oculoplasty specialist at L V Prasad Eye Institute.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-vacancy-at-ent-hosp-as-black-fungus-cases-spike/articleshow/82867396.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Witness neighbour’s testimony in court gets mishap victim’s kin Rs 72 lakh||MUMBAI: Eyewitness testimony by a neighbour who saw how a car driver lost control and rammed into a resident who lived in his housing complex, has ensured that his bereaved family was awarded a compensation of around Rs 72 lakh (with interest). The 47-year-old victim, Govinda Gavare, an artisan working for MSRTC, and earning a monthly salary of Rs 33,000, was near his home at Dombivli when he was run over by the four-wheeler in 2014. The Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (MACT) has held that only because the eyewitness was a neighbour, his evidence could not be discredited. The compensation will be paid by the car owner, Varkey Leenamol, and Reliance General Insurance Company Limited, the insurance firm. Govinda’s family — wife Seema Gavare (42), mother, Shakuntala Gavare (80) and two children — moved the tribunal in April, 2015. It was submitted that on December 29, 2014, around 11.30 am, Govinda was walking on the road in front of Lodha Heaven, Dombivli, when a car came at high speed and in a rash and negligent manner and dashed Govinda. Due to this, he fell down and sustained serious injuries to several parts of his body and the left leg. It was submitted that Govinda was moved to three hospitals during the course of the day. However, he died around 9.30 pm while undergoing treatment. The car owner did not respond to the claim and the tribunal proceeded ex parte. The insurance company sought dismissal of the the “inflated claim”. Govinda’s wife too deposed before the tribunal. She submitted that the car driver did not take proper precaution and failed to apply the brakes effectively. Seema also said that a criminal offence had been registered against the driver at Manpada police station, Thane, for causing death by negligence. During her cross-examination by the insurance company’s lawyer, she admitted that she had not seen the accident. She also denied that her husband was carelessly proceeding on the road and that he was responsible for the accident. The neighbour too deposed and said that he was at the window at the time of the accident. He said that after driving at high speed, suddenly the car driver lost control and the vehicle started proceeding in a zigzag manner. The witness said that the car rammed into Govinda who was walking on the side of the road. He went on to add further that the car went ahead and got stuck in a gutter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-witness-neighbours-testimony-in-court-gets-mishap-victims-kin-rs-72l/articleshow/82869224.cms||Rebecca Samervel

Shops selling groceries and vegetables too will remain shut during the lockdown period. A team of medical experts constituted by the state government had suggested intensifying Covid-19 control measures. Stalin also chaired a meeting with the committee of MLAs representing various parties before announcing the decision. “In view of the total lockdown, the government has permitted all shops open till 9pm on Saturday (May 22) and between 6am and 9pm on Sunday (May 23). All public and private buses will be allowed to ply on Saturday and Sunday,” Stalin said. Malls will not be allowed to open during the total lockdown. Vegetables and fruits will be supplied by horticulture department through vehicles during the lockdown period. Earlier, speaking at the meeting of MLAs representing various parties, Stalin said the Covid-19 spread had not been brought under control yet. “The government announced relaxations for people to buy groceries and vegetables, but some of them have taken it for granted and started roaming on the streets. They did not obey lockdown norms despite instructions from police”, the chief ministersaid. “Total lockdown was for people’s benefit and to save their lives. It was saddening when people treat lockdown as a holiday and not as an emergency caused by Covid,” Stalin said. To bring the pandemic under control, every individual had to take an oath that he or she would not spread the infection, he said. “Fear of coronavirus is evident while members of the public speak about the disease, but it does not reflect in their actions,” Stalin said, recalling how Covid-19 took away many lives and put the future of many families in question. Former health minister C Vijayabaskar said the chain of transmission could be broken only if total lockdown was imposed. He said the government should focus on early intervention and diagnosis and take up a multi-disciplinary approach on a warfooting by setting up additional Covid care centres, hospitals and screening centres in districts to avoid crowding in specialty hospitals. “Top-most priority should be given to oxygen supply. Post-Covid recovery clinics should also be set up and infrastructure should be ramped up to face the third wave,” the AIADMK leader said. Earlier, BJP floor leader and former minister Nainar Nagendran said the government should pay adequate attention to rural areas, ensuring isolation and adequate food supply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/full-lockdown-in-tn-till-may-31-grocery-veggie-shops-too-shut/articleshow/82874095.cms||Pushpa Narayan

---||Pune||Duo held on charge of abduction, search on for 2 moneylenders||Pune: Two persons were arrested on Friday on the charge of abducting a student after he failed to pay the promised instalments to two moneylenders, both on the run. The student, a resident of Jambhulwadi, had lodged a complaint stating that the four men had abducted him on Tuesday morning and had kept him in confinement for two days. According to the Bharati Vidyapeeth police, the complainant had borrowed money from the two suspects on the run. The student failed to pay the equated monthly instalments (EMIs) as decided by the suspects for the past few months. Irked over it, the suspects allegedly abducted him and kept him in confinement in a flat in Ravet near Dehu Road for two days. The police rescued the student, having his roots in Bihar and pursuing BE from a city college, from the flat on Thursday. Senior inspector Jagannath Kalaskar of the Bharati Vidyapeeth police said, “We arrested Deepak Pradeepkumar Singh (20) and Nikhil Nandkumar Kadam (23), both residents of Katraj, on the charge of abducting and keeping the victim in confinement. We have also invoked provisions of the Money Lending Act.” He said, “The two arrested men and the duo on the run operate hostels and paying guest facilities in various parts of the city. They know many students personally.” Kalaskar said, “The rescued student stays in a rented flat. He borrowed Rs1 lakh from one of the suspects on the run and Rs40,000 from the other. He had promised to return the money through EMIs of Rs20,000 to the duo. It is a case of illegal money lending.” He said, “In the past few months, the student had failed to pay the EMIs. The suspects kept on demanding money from him. Irked over the non-payment of EMIs, they repeatedly called him and issued threats, but the student did not have money to pay them.” Kalaskar said, “The four suspects then decided to abduct the student to teach him a lesson.” On Tuesday afternoon, they called him to a spot on the Jambhulwadi road. “From there, they took him to a housing society in Ravet in a car. The suspects then called up his father and demanded extortion, who promised to send them some money,” Kalaskar added. The four men then allegedly locked the student in a room of the flat for two days but allowed him to use his phone.  “The student then contacted his father, who, in turn, informed the police about the abduction and the demand for money,” the senior police inspector said. A police team went to the spot after tracing the location of the cellphone of the abducted student. The police personnel in the team then rescued him from the flat on Thursday, a source in the police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/duo-held-on-charge-of-abduction-search-on-for-2-moneylenders/articleshow/82867444.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Bhopal: Cyber crimes spiral during second surge of Covid, 197 cases this month||BHOPAL: There has been an exponential rise in the number of cyber crimes during the ongoing corona pandemic. Along with fraud, there are extortion cases which have also increased. The state cyber cell and city cyber-crime branch have been receiving many such complaints on daily basis. Police said that in most of the cases the cyber-crimes were committed by online thugs sitting in other states. Speaking on the type of cyber-crime cases being reported, DSP Richa Jain, posted at state cyber cell, said, a large number of ‘nude video call’ extortion cases are being reported in which the online thugs befriend the victims over social media platforms. The accused then lure the victims to nude video calls, wherein they record the obscene video of the victims using screen recording software and blackmail them to pay money. Jain said, a large number of financial frauds are also being reported. Many relatives and family members of Covid-19 patients have been duped to the tune of Rs 20,000 to Rs 1 lakh on pretext of booking oxygen concentrators and other equipment. Most of the cases are not reported as victims are busy taking care of their patients. These online thugs even share the photographs of Covid-19 patients posing themselves as members of NGOs helping patients in Covid-19 treatment and collect money from people online on pretext of donation. DSP said, cyber criminals are now targeting healthcare institutions like hospitals, doctors and pathology labs etc., impersonating as army personnel, posted in some distant part of the country, requesting to get Covid-19 and other tests done for their family members. In the garb of advance payment for the tests, money is stolen from the hospital or doctor’s account by these cyber criminals. Jain said that normally state cyber cells receive around 300 complaints of online fraud per month, which have now gone up to 450-500. DSP Neetu Thakur, posted at cyber-crime branch, said, in the last one month, cops have registered 197 online fraud cases. Highest number of cases were related to social media in which either the cyber criminals hacked the accounts of victims and demanded money or demanded extortion money. She said, many UPI or online payment wallet related frauds were also reported.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/cyber-crimes-spiral-during-second-surge-of-covid-197-cases-this-month/articleshow/82867439.cms||Sudeept Mishra
---||Kochi||Kerala: V D Satheesan confident of reviving UDF||KOCHI: Radiating confidence that he would be able to revive the UDF, V D Satheesan, who has been elected as the opposition leader, pledged unconditional support to the LDF government in its fight against Covid-19. At the same time, he made it clear that the UDF will point out the flaws in government policies and other important issues in the assembly and outside. Satheesan told a news conference in Kochi on Saturday that the UDF would be in the forefront of the fight against all kinds of communalism whether it is the one promoted by majority or minority. “The decision to elect me to hold an office which had been held by stalwarts like K Karunakaran, A K Antony, Oommen Chandy and Ramesh Chennithala surprises me. I am taking over the post with confidence that Congress and the UDF could be revived from the current crisis. I clearly understand that this (opposition leader’s post) is not a floral crown,” Satheesan said. It is not the not duty of the opposition to challenge a government which has got the people’s mandate. “We will stand by the government during the time of pandemic. People want all of us to stand united to fight Covid-19. At a time when the people are finding it difficult to make both ends meet during the lockdown, it is unwarranted to take the course of conflict. An initial action that will give a message to the public that the UDF is with the government in finding solutions to the issues the public face will be taken,” Satheesan said. The UDF will rise to the occasion and discharge the duties as per the wishes of the people. Changes in tandem with the changing times will be assimilated, he said. There will be a change of generation in Congress as well, he said. “There was a change in the Congress leadership in the 1970s after the failure of the Congress in 1967. A new generation of leaders evolved by questioning the then leadership. All the leaders and workers of Congress and the UDF will be taken into confidence. The UDF will not challenge the government just for the sake of opposing it, rather it will act as a creative opposition,” Satheesan added. He also made it clear that the opposition will not allow the government to function in an authoritarian manner. “In the course of democracy, there are some ladders. That ladders are the way to autocracy. It is the duty of the opposition to prevent the democratically elected rulers from climbing that ladders to autocracy,” the Congress leader said. The opposition will take the cross section of people, including the middle class, into confidence. The UDF will seek reports from all the candidates, block committees and district committees on election results. The Congress central leadership also will review the election results, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/satheesan-confident-of-reviving-udf/articleshow/82865949.cms||---

The state’s premier health facility now has six patients with the black fungus. Dean Dr S M Bandekar said that four of the patients have undergone endoscopic debridement surgery, while the other two may not be required to be operated on. He also said that the state has placed an order for 2,000 Liposomal amphotericin-B vials, which will be received shortly. GMC had recently received 100 vials from the Centre. On Saturday, the state was informed that it would receive 50 more. Currently, no private pharmacy or hospital in the state has the crucial drug in stock. The state has seen two deaths to the black fungus, Bandekar said, adding that the patient who died in GMC had severe Covid-19 with severe lung infection and high diabetes. “When lung involvement is very high, the logical conclusion would be that he has succumbed to Covid,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-orders-2k-vials-of-key-drug-to-treat-black-fungus/articleshow/82869230.cms||---
---||Pune||PMC seeks NCC cadets’ help to control crowds at vaccination centres||Pune: The civic body wants to deploy 200 NCC cadets at vaccination centres to manage crowds. The decision comes close on the heels of 200 cadets being deployed at the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) vaccination centres. Pune municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar has sent a letter to this effect to the NCC Group Headquarters in Pune. Brigadier Suneel Limaye, Group Commander of NCC, Pune, told TOI on Saturday, “We have to get a statutory sanction from the NCC directorate before agreeing to the request by the civil administration. Currently, 200 senior division cadets have been deployed at PCMC vaccination centres.” All these cadets are vaccinated and their parents have given their consent. The PCMC authorities have arranged for the daily commute of cadets via PMPML buses. The buses pick them up and drop them off at the NCC Group Headquarters each day. Eight cadets, along with an NCC official, are deployed at each vaccination centre. Cadet Amit Bhigwankar, a second-year B Com student from SP College, who leads a team, said, “We perform our duties from 10am to 4pm. Our main task is to maintain social distancing among beneficiaries and address their queries related to vaccination. It’s been a learning experience for us as we could witness the condition of people from all walks of life and their approach towards vaccination.” The responsibilities are distributed among cadets during a review meeting that is held before they leave the headquarter each day. Air cadet Chinmay Badhkar, a mechanical engineering student, said, “Earlier, our task was to manage the crowd at vaccination centres. Over the days, we have been helping people and the health staff in all possible ways — such as helping beneficiaries register, helping senior citizens and more. It’s been a wonderful experience for me.” Colonel Vinay Chavan said, “Cadets will mainly learn a sense of responsibility. Such a role will enhance their abilities to handle different situations in their careers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-seeks-ncc-cadets-help-to-control-crowds-at-vaccination-centres/articleshow/82867691.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: SSC students to be graded on scores of classes 8 & 9?||MUMBAI: Even as confusion continues to prevail over whether or not the SSC exam will be held, the state government plans to evaluate students on the basis of previous years marks. The Bombay high court is likely to pass an order on holding the SSC exam that was cancelled last month. The state has to go back to court with its plan for the students. “Principals had suggested that students’ performance in class 8 and 9 may be considered besides the current academic year for evaluation,” said an official from the state education department. Boards like CBSE and CISCE are assessing students based on previous years’ average marks. However, state-aided schools have expressed difficulty in assessing students based on performance of the current academic year. For the earlier two academic years, students had appeared for exams offline and can be assessed. Schools in rural areas too are open to evaluating students based on class 8 and 9 performances, but cannot evaluate them for the current academic year, as they had issues of internet connectivity, said an official. Private schools have assured the state that they can evaluate students for all three years. State officials said that internal assessment would be preferred over an exam or entrance test, provided the court agrees to the suggestion. The state’s feedback from students on a common entrance test was positive. However, students from rural areas may not be able to appear for a CET as COVID cases continue to rise in those areas, said the official. Principals say more weightage must be given to class 8 and 9 marks. “The class 10 internal assessment is not taken seriously as students focus on boards,” said the principal of a school in Andheri. School heads said that the evaluation plan should be drawn up keeping the next academic year in mind. “The government needs to plan for the next year too. Schools should be given clear guidelines on conducting internal exams and assessment for the next year,” said the principal of a school in Mahim.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-ssc-students-to-be-graded-on-scores-of-classes-8-9/articleshow/82869266.cms||Sandhya Nair

---||Nagpur||Ayurveda practitioners push for blend of traditional and modern medicines to treat Covid||Nagpur: There was a time when hydroxychloroquine, a tablet used in malaria treatment, was high in demand after the Covid-19 pandemic struck last year. Even the then USA President Donald Trump demanded the medicine from India for treatment of Covid-19. Today, hydroxychloroquine is nowhere. Experts have declared it does not have clinical benefits in Covid-19. The same has happened with ivermectin, azithromycin and many other medicines. Experts have also recommended against the use of Remdesivir, and Tocilizumab injection has failed in the Phase 3 trial for Covid-19 conducted by its developer Roche. Very recently, the ICMR removed the much-hyped ‘Plasma Therapy’ from Covid treatment protocol. These instances are enough to show that the modern school of medicine is following the ‘trial and error’ method and doctors are trying the treatment that proves beneficial for their set of patients. Leading ayurveda practitioners in the state are now asking why not recognize traditional medicines and therapies which are proving “highly beneficial” and have the “least side-effects”? According to ayurveda practitioners, a balanced mix of traditional medicines along with recognized modern medicines will save patients not only from the virus but also post-Covid complications. On the other hand, associations of modern doctors, including the IMA, have launched scathing attacks against ayurveda in the past. “The present scene is that doctors are conducting experiments and patients have become guinea pigs,” said Dr Nitin Awasthi, ayurveda consultant, and centre head, Baidyanath Life Sciences. Citing example of steroids, he said their efficacy in Covid-19 treatment is still not confirmed but side-effects are already here in the form of mucormycosis. “Our medicines are at least safe. They don’t have such deadly side-effects,” he said. On arguments that ayurveda therapies have no scientific data, Dr Awasthi presented his own paper published in the World Journal of Pharmaceutical Research (USA). “Baidyanath’s Covid kit cured 70% of the patients within 3 to 5 days. This research was based on experiences. But doctors of modern medicine do not consider it. At the same time, they continue to prescribe Remdesivir and plasma therapy just on the basis of patient experiences,” he said. For Dr Mohan Yende of the National Integrated Medical Association (NIMA), the scientific method of controlled randomized trials should be made available for ayurveda medicines. “We (ayurveda vaidyas) have been portrayed as people who give only herbs and kadhas. Ayurveda has mineral preparations too. We have proper medicines, ras aushadhis, bhasmas and even heavy metals. Unfortunately, only their chronic side-effects are highlighted a lot. But no one will speak about side-effects of drugs like Tocilizumab,” he said. Ayurveda practitioner Vaidya Swanand Joshi said that since traditional medicine is better in treating chronic conditions doesn’t mean it is useless in acute conditions. “Lack of government support to ayurveda and blame-game by modern medicine practitioners certainly have caused more sufferings to Covid patients. Most of the believers who took balanced/mixed medication recovered from the disease as well as post-Covid weakness without experiencing any adverse reactions,” said Vaidya Joshi. Ayurveda doctors are confident about their medicines and eager to get them tested on allopathic parameters, but the proposal hasn’t got any attention from modern medicine practitoners. Infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde, who has been treating Covid-19 patients using modern medicines only, said that Covid-19 is a new disease and newer treatment modalities are being tried. “Modern medicines have at least some data based on which we form our opinion. Many lives are being saved all over the world due to modern medicines,” he said. Dr Shinde asked how many ayurveda doctors in the country really practice it. “Ayurveda is a fancy stuff used in non-critical patients where the outcome doesn’t matter much. Modern allopathic medicines are used in critical patients to save lives,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ayurveda-practitioners-push-for-blend-of-traditional-and-modern-medicines-to-treat-covid/articleshow/82867447.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Mumbai||30% non-SSC pupils prefer college seat in their current school||MUMBAI: About 30-40% of students of non-SSC boards — like CBSE and CISCE — will continue their college with their current education boards and more specifically in their current schools. R N Podar School, Santacruz, of CBSE board welcomed its class 11 batch of around 450 students. “Every year around 30% students join colleges after class 10. This year, with uncertainty over college admission, many parents wanted their children to continue with us,” said director-principal Avnita Bir. Last month, these boards cancelled class 10 exams. Students of other boards compete with their state board counterparts to join FYJC. At St Xavier’s College, Fort, last year 48% students of other boards got admission in the arts stream, said principal Rajendra Shinde. While students choosing science and wanting to pursue competitive exams like JEE, NEET may continue in their schools, those looking at humanities and commerce, look for colleges, said Rajeev Garg, principal, Datta Meghe World Academy (CBSE), Airoli. With more parents and students willing to continue till class 12, the school has increased its intake capacity by around 80. “Our 60% students take admission to colleges every year. This year, parents are keen their children study with us,” said Garg. Dr Ashok Wadia, principal, Jai Hind College, Churchgate, pointed out that while the science stream in his institute has SSC students (72%), arts and commerce classrooms have more students of other boards. Last year, the arts faculty had 57% students from ICSE, CBSE. Commerce stream had only 35% state board students. Parents are encouraging their children to extend their school life as most CBSE and ICSE institutes have started the new academic year or are likely to complete admissions by early next month. Neelu Lamba, principal, Hiranandani Foundation School (ICSE), Thane, said, “We are starting the academic year from June 15. Admissions of class 11 will be done by June 10.” She said class 11 admission for colleges may not happen before October or November. Retired principal Rupa Dey said, “Students wait to get out of school uniforms and enjoy college life. With studies expected to be online in 2021-22, college will remain a distant dream.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-30-non-ssc-pupils-prefer-college-seat-in-their-current-school/articleshow/82869299.cms||Sandhya Nair

Its active cases stand at 18,243. The case positivity rate went up to 36%, which was 32% on Friday. Dr Jagadish Kakodkar, head of the department of preventive medicine at Goa Medical College (GMC), said their latest surveillance reports showed that Covid infections have spread to peri-urban and rural areas, and 206 hotspots scattered across the state have been detected. Most of the primary health centres that largely have jurisdiction of rural villages now have cases over 500 and more, revealed the health bulletin. The state has been seeing a dip in infections, while the case positivity rate has declined – the weekly positivity rate has been 37.7% - which is still the highest in the country. Kakodkar said that rules will not help unless people follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. “The message we are trying to give the public is - don’t neglect your symptoms, immediately consult a doctor,” he said. Out of the total 39 deaths reported on Saturday, 19 occurred in GMC, 15 died at South Goa district hospital (SGDHs), two were recorded by Dharbandora primary health centre, and three lost their lives at a private hospital in South Goa. Of these, two patients had been vaccinated with the first dose and one was fully vaccinated, revealed the mortality bulletin. Eight persons died within few hours after they were shifted to hospital. A 33-year-old woman from Vasco having comorbidities was the youngest person to die due to Covid infection on Saturday. She was admitted at SGDH two days after she was detected positive. The eldest was a 100-year-old man from Navelim, who was under home isolation after testing positive earlier this week. Others were too under home isolation and rushed to the hospital only after their condition had worsened.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gmc-covid-cases-have-spread-to-peri-urban-rural-localities/articleshow/82869263.cms||---

The Fatorda MLA was particularly enraged as a large number of migrant workers employed in pharmaceutical companies in Verna industrial estate had queued up for vaccination. Storming into the vaccination centre, Sardesai confronted the health officer of the Margao urban health centre, Anju Kharangate, and demanded an explanation over how non-Goans from Verna could avail of the vaccination at Margao. He pointed out that in other states only residents of that particular area are allowed in the respective vaccination centres. He demanded that a separate facility for vaccination be made available for the frontline workers at the Verna industrial estate instead. Speaking to reporters later, Sardesai said that he had no objections to workers from pharma industry being classified as frontline workers for giving priority for vaccination, but stressed that they be given the jab at a separate facility. “There are no locals here (at the Margao urban health centre), all are outsiders,” Sardesai said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gfp-chief-fumes-over-outsiders-queuing-up-at-margao-jab-centre/articleshow/82869280.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||After petition in high court, Haryana says teachers, lectuers will be vaccinated, given PPEs||Chandigarh: School lecturers or postgraduate teachers (PGTs) working in Harhyana’s state-run schools will be vaccinated and given personal protective equipment (PPE) kit before being assigned Covid-19 duties. Information in this regard was given to Punjab and Haryana high court by the state government in response to a petition filed on the issue. During the case hearing, advocate general (AG), Haryana Baldev Raj Mahajan submitted that the grievance of the petitioner would be examined by the department concerned. “According to the AG, directions have been given to all senior surgeons to vaccinate and provide personal protective equipment to persons assigned duties in the field. In view of this assurance given by the AG, Haryana, we need not to further delve in the issue. Petition is hereby disposed of,” observed the HC while closing the petition. Matter reached the HC on a petition filed by Haryana School Lecturer Association. On May 11, Haryana government ordered deployment of school lecturers/PGTs in chemistry, physics and biology along with other PGTs on the frontlines to perform Covid duty under Haryana Villagers General Health Check-up Scheme (HVGHCS). They were told to report to civil surgeons. The petitioners stated that neither were lecturers/PGTs vaccinated, nor did state authorities take safety measures. “Because of this, the lives of lecturers/PGTs have been put in danger in the circumstances when Covid-19 pandemic is spreading at such a large scale. It was further submitted that lecturers/PGTs are bound to serve under the officials, who are much lower in pay scale and ranks like Asha workers, Anganwari workers, health workers, junior engineer etc. Even the monitoring team supervising them is also on a lower pay scale in comparison to lecturers/PGTs, causing enormous moral degradation and hierarchy of designation. The lecturers come under group-B category and a gazette post,” the counsel for the petitioner told the HC. Responding to the petition, the AG Haryana informed about the vaccination and PPE kit for lecturers/PGTs and submitted that the grievance of the petitioner shall be examined by the department concerned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/after-petition-in-high-court-haryana-says-teachers-lectuers-will-be-vaccinated-given-ppes/articleshow/82872580.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Distress calls to hospitals down after infrastructure step-up||KOLKATA: A week into the restrictions imposed by the state government, the number of distress calls to hospital requesting for a bed has gone down dramatically. The crisis for beds has gone down, with some of the hospitals that would even 10 days ago have full occupancy now having some beds vacant. Health experts said that while restrictions have controlled the infection rate to a certain extent, factors like safe homes, oxygen parlours and oxygen on wheel services have brought relief to patients, reducing the hospital dependency. “The distress calls have reduced substantially. Even as the pressure is still there on ICU beds, earlier we would have 10 patients lined up for one vacant ICU bed. It has now reduced to say two patients waiting to take up a vacant ICU bed at a time. So, we are able to arrange one for the other patient in a few hours,” said R Venkatesh, zonal director (East) of Narayana Health. On Saturday, out of its 261 Covid beds at RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences, 233 were occupied. “Earlier, we would maintain a list of patients who needed beds and called them up as soon a bed became vacant. We used to see a line of ambulances queued up even before we could discharge the recovered patients. We still maintain such a list but it has become shorter,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. The occupancy at Belle Vue Clinic had gone up as high as 110% on certain days as the hospital had to accommodate more than its available beds. On Saturday, its occupancy was about 95%. “No more elections, a lower number of people on the roads and the vaccination coverage could be some of the reasons that have helped reduce the number of the infected,” said Belle Vue Clinic CEO Pradip Tondon. On any given day, CMRI would have around 35 Covid patients waiting for hospital care. The hospital currently has some general beds empty. “There is a very positive pattern in the past one week. We no more have a waiting list of patients. But we are not reducing our Covid beds for now as we need to observe this pattern for a longer duration,” said Simmerdeep Gill, COO of CK Birla Hospitals CMRI. Apart from government safe homes and private hospital satellite facilities, many organisations have set up several Covid care facilities with oxygen support, reducing burden on hospitals. “The restriction has controlled the infection rate to a certain extent, delaying the transmission temporarily. But we need to have such measures for at least two more weeks, including more stringent restrictions in rural areas, for better management of the situation,” said public health specialist Anirban Dalui at Swasthya Bhawan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/distress-calls-to-hosps-down-after-infra-step-up/articleshow/82865983.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

---||Kochi||His bold stand cost him a cabinet berth in 2011||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: If you are going to continue as opposition leader, then I would certainly challenge it, V D Satheesan is learnt to have said on the face of Ramesh Chennithala days before the parliamentary party meeting. Satheesan is known for his straight talk and the tough decisions he takes within the party. He had flayed the party leaders who have been visiting the community leaders for getting plum posts in the party and also in the government. This had cost him dear as he lost the cabinet berth in 2011. At the time of the formation of the government, it was almost certain that Satheesan was all set to become minister. But surprisingly a much junior leader and first-time legislature, V S Sivakumar, made it to the Oommen Chandy cabinet, which had raised many an eyebrow then. Had he been ready to visit a particular community leader, he would have been in the cabinet. Even his senior leaders had advised Satheesan to go and meet this person. “I do not want a cabinet berth at the mercy of a community leader,” Satheesan had told those leaders. However, Chennithala offered the speaker post to Satheesan, who politely turned it down. Instead, he said it should be given to senior leader and his guiding force G Karthikeyan. Satheesan had always been an undesirable man for the community leaders. That was the reason a leader camped in his constituency Paravur to campaign against him once. “He has a strong attitude and is a man of clarity. We have never seen him going back from what he says,” said political observer Jacob George. Even though his electoral battle began in 1996, it is after 25 years and winning five consecutive elections that he is getting a position with a cabinet rank. “He is known for his well-studied approach in all crucial issues. He has even earned the respect of his opponents. Satheesan always used to take on Thomas Isaac in the assembly. But they always maintained a mutual respect,” added George. Satheesan started getting recognition in the party after Rahul Gandhi took over the party reins at the national level. He was given the KPCC vice-president post, paving way to strong speculations that he would soon be elevated as KPCC president.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/his-bold-stand-cost-him-a-cabinet-berth-in-2011/articleshow/82865979.cms||Rajiv G
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Global tender floated to buy vaccines||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Kerala Medical Services Corporation Ltd (KMSCL) has floated a global tender for procuring three crore doses of Covid-19 vaccine. The move comes following a government decision in this regard. The technical bid will be opened on June 5. As per KMSCL specifications, the bidders should meet the requirements of manufacturing legislation and regulation of vaccines in the country of origin, meet internationally recognized standards for safety, efficacy and quality and conform to all WHO specifications. The bidders should be Covid vaccine manufacturers or importers or the Indian partners of foreign manufacturers and also should have a valid license from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI). The vaccine being supplied must also be as per Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines. In addition, the companies should be able to maintain and provide the cold storage requirement, if the vaccine demands it. The containers should be provided with temperature variation indicators or the consignment should be provided with data loggers for recording the temperatures during transit, the software of which also should be provided to all the warehouses. To tide over domestic shortage, the state had decided to go for a global tender to purchase vaccines that have been approved by WHO for use in various countries. The KMSCL has been given the nod to purchase three crore doses from DCGI-approved manufacturers. The vaccines thus procured will be utilised to vaccinate 1.5 crore citizens in the 18-44 age group. The aim is to vaccinate the entire population as early as possible. Eleven other states –– Odisha, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Delhi, Karnataka, Andhra, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra –– have already floated similar global bids.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/global-tender-floated-to-buy-vaccines/articleshow/82866000.cms||---

She had been admitted to the facility couple of weeks ago, after developing Covid-19-induced complications. Sravanthi’s father, KS Govind, who retired as supervisor from TSRTC has also tested positive and is still undergoing treatment Only couple of days back Indian cricket captain, Virat Kohli, contributed Rs 6.77 lakh towards her parents’ treatment after her precarious financial situation was highlighted by the Indian fielding coach, R Sridhar. Other members of the sporting fraternity too had chipped in with support. Speaking to the media, subsequently, the former cricketer said: “...I thank the sporting fraternity for their immediate response.” However, post her mother’s death, the corporate hospital where she was being treated is said to have waived off the medical bills — amounting to Rs 5.28 lakh — following an intervention from former Andhra Pradesh cricketer-turned-vice-president of the Telangana Badminton Association, V Chamundeswaranath, and principal secretary (IT), Jayesh Ranjan. “Sravanthi’s mother was in a critical condition for about two weeks before she breathed her last today (Saturday). Her father was also suffering complications, but we are informed that he is doing better now,” Sravanthi’s friend and former Indian cricketer Archana Das told STOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/help-pours-in-but-sravanthis-mother-succumbs-to-virus/articleshow/82867464.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kochi||Will V D Satheesan’s entry mark the end of group politics?||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: After leading the party in four assembly elections 2006, 2011, 2016 and 2021 Oommen Chandy-Ramesh Chennithala duo is making way for a new leadership in the party and UDF. Under the duo, the front lost three assembly elections and had won only once that too with a slender margin of just two seats in 2011. They can boast of only the three Lok Sabha elections where the UDF had put up an impressive show. “If Pinarayi Vijayan wanted a successive communist government in 2011, the UDF would have lost that election too. The LDF lost that election since Vijayan, the then state secretary of the CPM, did not want to give the V S Achuthanandan government a continuity. Otherwise the CPM had almost won it,” said a senior Congress leader. In 2004, Chandy took over as the chief minister and in 2005 Chennithala became the KPCC president. Ever since both these leaders have been ruling or dictating terms in the party. Those who were not part of these two camps never made it to any position in the party or in the legislature. They never entertained a second line of leadership also. By appointing V D Satheesan as the opposition leader and ignoring the lobbying made by both the ‘I’ and ‘A’ groups, the high command has sent a clear signal to the old war horses. “Now, it is the question whether to survive or perish. More than the change in leadership, what the AICC might have looked at would be the existence of the party here,” said political analyst Prof J Prabhash. .Political observer Jacob George said that it was strange that these leaders wanted to stick on even after such a huge defeat and that was the reason why the groups jointly opposed a leadership change. However, history has proven that no leader has survived if they do not have the backing of Chandy-Chennithala duo. V M Sudheeran was the perfect example for this as he had to step down from the KPCC president post due to the serious differences he had with these leaders. While quitting the post he had said no one can survive in the party if they don’t have the blessings of Chandy or Chennithala. KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran also has no say in the party since the duo has been dictating terms be it in the selection of the candidates or in selecting the party office-bearers. Hence, Satheesan has to take both these leaders into confidence if he wants to survive and lead from the front.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/will-satheesans-entry-mark-the-end-of-group-politics/articleshow/82866004.cms||Rajiv G
---||Goa||Goa: Pharmacists await notification on frontline worker status||PANAJI: Despite working 24x7 and at a high risk of getting infected, pharmacists and their co-workers have been facing difficulties getting vaccinated. Despite chief minister Pramod Sawant announcing that this category would be considered frontline workers, an official notification is yet to be issued by the government. This has resulted in pharmacists and their support staff having to return from vaccination centres after being denied the vaccine. Sawant on May 14 announced that the government has decided to consider workers employed in pharmaceuticals/medicine supply chain, from production to retailing, as frontline Covid healthcare warriors to be considered on priority for vaccination. However, without the official notification, vaccination centres are not agreeing to vaccinate this group of frontline workers who closely interact with patients. President of the Chemists’ and Druggist’s Association of Goa, Albert D’Sa said the association says they are thankful to the chief minister for declaring them as frontline workers. “Ours is the only state in the country that has declared pharmacists as frontline workers and we are grateful to our CM. We are waiting for the official notification. Until then, many of our workers are facing embarrassment and forced to return from vaccination centres without getting vaccinated,” he told TOI. “We face one of the highest risks. Instead of relatives, the patients themselves visit pharmacies for medicines. The wholesaler moves out and goes to Covid hospitals and pharmacies to ensure that medicines are delivered. We should have been given top priority for being vaccinated,” he said. There are around 8,000 pharmacists and co-workers in the retail and wholesale sector, of which 90% are under the age of 44, D’Sa said. He told TOI that there have already been two deaths in the fraternity of a wholesale owner and worker. Meanwhile, the All India Organisation of Chemists and Druggists have threatened to join the lockdown along with other trade members if they are not given priority for vaccination to protect and save the lives of its members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/pharmacists-await-notification-on-frontline-worker-status/articleshow/82869296.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: But more cases of black fungus add to worry in Covid season||KOLKATA: Apart from the death of a 32-year-old woman suspected to be a case of black fungus or mucormycosis — as an aftereffect of Covid — at a city government hospital on Friday, a case of black fungus has been confirmed at a city hospital on Saturday. Two more confirmed cases were reported from Bankura Medical College, and the condition of one is critical. A third person with clinical symptoms is undergoing treatment at the same centre. While the woman from Haridevpur died at Shambhunath Pandit Hospital on Friday, a 62-year-old man is fighting for life with the infection at Belle Vue Clinic. His condition is stated to be serious. Health department sources said another patient from the state is undergoing treatment in a nursing home. Earlier, at least four cases of suspected black fungus have been reported in the state, but the patients were from neighbouring states. With states like Maharashtra and Rajasthan declaring mucormycosis an epidemic, doctors have been flooded with calls from panicked patients who have recovered from Covid. Black fungus happens in the mouth and is triggered by a mould found in soil or decaying organic matter. Victims get the disease by breathing in the fungal spores. Air humidifiers in homes and hospitals and water tanks breed black fungus. The Belle Vue patient had been infected with Covid a month ago. He has had a renal transplant, suffers from diabetes and had been on steroids. “We observed a slight swelling of the left jowl area below the left eye. On examination, it was seen that the upper premolar teeth and the adjoining palate were black. Biopsy revealed mucormycosis,” said Belle Vue internal medicine consultant Rahul Jain. Along with Jain, a team of six doctors — including Anuradha Agarwal, Uttam Agarwal, S Kazi, Uzma Nafis and Kamlesh Kothari — has been formed for the patient’s treatment. In the past week, ENT surgeon Abhik Ghosh of Apollo Hospital has seen about 12 patients suspecting they might have been infected by the fungus. “Patients who are diabetic and have been on ventilation or oxygen support for long, along with steroids, during Covid treatment are susceptible. It can be fatal in case it is not detected early and treated in time,” said Ghosh. Arjun Dasgupta, ENT surgeon at CMRI, also stressed on timely detection and medical intervention for successful treatment. “Most cases I am seeing are due to panic. But people need to be aware of the symptoms so that detection and treatment is not delayed. A nasal endoscopy can raise the alarm about the fungus, which can be confirmed by a biopsy report. And such devices are now easily available in rural places,” said Dasgupta. Black fungus can be deadly and has a high mortality rate. It is treated with amphotericin B and the final option is surgery. Immuno-suppression, prolonged use of steroids and chronic diseases of the kidney and diabetes are ideal for black fungus to strike, according to Institute of Post-Graduate Medical College and Research professor Diptendra Sarkar. “Those with Covid or those who have just recovered from Covid are particularly vulnerable due to their low immunity. Those who have undergone renal transplant are also susceptible,” said Sarkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/but-more-cases-of-black-fungus-add-to-worry-in-covid-season/articleshow/82866001.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

It includes 1,08,368 people belonging to the age bracket of 18 and 44 years and a total of 32,063 beneficiaries belonging to the age bracket of above 45 years. Vaccination of beneficiaries aged above 18 years has started in the state on May 5. Initially it was scheduled to start from May 1, but it could not be started then, due to unavailability of vaccine. Vaccines for beneficiaries aged between 18 and 44 years is being procured by state government while the vaccines that are being administered to beneficiaries aged above 45 years is being provided by the union government.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Rising fuel prices pile more misery||KOLKATA: At Rs 93.16 and Rs 86.7 a litre, petrol and diesel prices have gone up 10 times in the last 21 days. The successive rises have a far-reaching impact on the prices of commodities at a time when people are facing financial hardships and personal tragedies. Since May 4, prices of both petrol and diesel have been on the rise after an 18-day poll respite. The diesel became costlier by Rs 3.11 a litre and petrol by Rs 2.56 per litre. “The amount may not be very impressive. But it hurts us badly,” said Tapan Bandyopadhyay, joint secretary of the Joint Council of Bus Syndicates (JCBS). It is worse for goods transportation. “From Mumbai to Kolkata, a truck burns 1,100 litre of diesel one way, just imagine the fuel bill. Moreover, there is no exemption of toll this time. Last year, we got a moratorium on bank EMIs and toll exemption,” said Sajal Ghosh, general secretary of the Federation of West Bengal Truck Operators’ Associations. The impact of fuel price rise has had a profound impact on the prices of essential goods. Right from pulses to edible oils, prices are northbound, burning a hole in the pockets of consumers. “I was checking out my account book as I have the habit of writing down every penny I spend a day. I saw a straight jump of 30%-45% on account of household expenditure,” said Abhirup Roy, a teacher of statistics. “Higher household expenditure means smaller savings and cutting corners in important areas like education, nutrition, health, travel and leisures. Thus, it is going to be quite claustrophobic for people when everything will open up. All these above sectors, which are manpower intensive, will suffer,” said economist Arindam Guha. The record rise has left a large number of Kolkatans fuming. “My salary was meagre. The lockdown led to a 30% cut. I was checking that in the last two months, my fuel cost has doubled, even though I have been travelling the same distance everyday. This is unacceptable,” said Barun Dewanji, a sales executive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rising-fuel-prices-pile-more-misery/articleshow/82866027.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Nagpur||Plasma is ‘orphan’ as it doesn’t get any support from the pharma giants: Experts||Nagpur: Convalescent plasma therapy, which was very popular among doctors across the country and used on many Covid-19 patients to date, was removed from the Covid management guidelines of AIIMS-Delhi and ICMR, the premier research body of our country, earlier this week.Now, a group of transfusion medicine professionals and researchers with convalescent plasma therapy in the Covid-19 pandemic in India has written to the principal scientific advisor of the government to reinstate it in the clinical management of the virus. For the first time, the group has clearly mentioned about ‘pharma companies’ in their letter.“The safety of convalescent plasma is proven for centuries. It is a cheap and safe alternative to patients having liver or kidney failure where other popular drugs like Remdesivir / Tociluzumab is contraindicated for their toxicity. It is an irony than an orphan drug is always an orphan as it doesn’t get any support from the pharmaceutical giants,” reads the letter undersigned by 16 renowned doctors of modern medicine across the country.The letter further shares details of at least eight recent international as well as the Indian peer-reviewed publications of randomized control trials (RCT) which have shown plasma to be effective to reduce mortality, morbidity as well as minimizing the cytokine deluge if it is applied at the appropriate time. Dr. Harish Warbhe from Nagpur, one of the members of this group, said that despite the ICMR recommendation, doctors are using plasma. “The ICMR move does not stop clinicians from rational use of plasma for saving the lives of their Covid-19 patients on ‘emergency use authorization’ basis. Many clinicians continue to use it for their Covid patients,” he said, adding that he is still getting demand for plasma from all corners of the state. According to Dr Warbhe, the way ICMR’s move was highlighted in the media has created confusion among doctors and people. “No one can be denied of survival benefits of plasma therapy. All treatment options must be available to the patient, be it Remdesivir or plasma. There must be strict rules to avoid irrational and indiscriminate use,” he added. NO PLASMA THERAPY?Plasma is dropped from Covid Management Guidelines of AIIMS-Delhi and ICMRThis does not stop clinicians from rational use of Plasma on Covid-19 patients on an emergency use authorization basis Many clinicians still continue to use plasma for their Covid patientsIrrational and indiscriminate use of plasma must be stopped Same must be applicable to drugs like Remdesivir, Ivermectin, Flavipiravir, Steroids, Tocilizumab etc||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/plasma-is-orphan-as-it-doesnt-get-any-support-from-the-pharma-giants-experts/articleshow/82867619.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The Keralite religious persons who lost lives due to Covid-19 include a bishop, 42 priests and over 45 nuns.  The bishops who died are former Sagar diocese bishop Mar Joseph Pastor Neelankavil from Thrissur, former archbishop Anthony Anandarayar of Pondicherry archdiocese and former Jabuva bishop Basil Bhuriya. According to the data, nine priests from Thrissur archdiocese, two from Thalassery diocese, one from Kanjirappally diocese have died. Most of the priests and nuns served as missionaries in north Indian villages and they are from various religious congregations, said church sources. Church officials attributed various reasons to the large number of Covid-19 deaths of priests and nuns during the second wave. “Most priests and nuns were pastorally active. Nuns, who were working in hospitals and clinics, got infected and died. Priests got infected while they went to help the poor, burial of faithful, etc. A few were late to reach the hospital, and lack of proper medical care, which is easily available in metropolitan cities, was not available to them. A few were seniors with comorbidities. Besides, young priests and nuns were not vaccinated. These are the major reasons for the deaths of religious people,” said a Church official. Fr Mathew, chief editor of Indian Currents (IC), a national English weekly published from Delhi under the patronage of Capuchins of Krist Jyoti Province of north India, said, “During the pandemic, European countries published the data of priests and nuns who died due to Covid-19. But in India the data was not available. Hence, I sent a request letter to all congregations and dioceses for the details and collated it. The list is incomplete and continues to grow.” Kerala Catholic Bishop Council (KCBC) deputy secretary Fr Jacob Palakkappilly said that the Church has directed all dioceses and congregations to provide the data of Covid-19 deaths of priests, nuns and laity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/virus-claims-over-300-priests-nuns/articleshow/82866059.cms||Sandeep Thomas
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: High norm-flout rate in office areas||KOLKATA: Roughly one out of every three vehicles booked for flouting restrictions in the past week was in the Exide crossing-Park Street-Esplanade-Dalhousie belt. The nearly deserted office district has seen the maximum number of vehicles being seized or challaned with two other locations reporting a high number of challans — Ultadanga and Jadavpur. Out of the 1,477 vehicles challaned under IPC 188 and Motor Vehicles Act, the headquarters traffic guard and the south traffic guard — which together cover the Dalhousie-Esplanade and Park Street belt — accounted for 445 challans, almost 31%. The headquarters traffic guard seized 231 vehicles and the south guard 214. The east traffic guard — comprising areas in Beniapukur and Moulali and a portion of the Maa flyover, seized 206 vehicles and the Jorabagan traffic guard seized 125 vehicles. The Ultadanga traffic guard has seized 74 vehicles in the past four days while the Jadavpur traffic guard has seized 75 vehicles. In comparison, the three traffic guards covering Behala-Haridevpur, along with Ballygunge, Alipore and Regent Park-Garia have had the least number of challans. Garia reported 13 seizures, Kasba 23 and Behala 74. ACPs and OCs have cited a number of reasons why certain areas — especially those in the central business district — have been reporting such high numbers of violations. Given the regular volume of traffic, there are more nakas here and, since most market movement happens through these primary routes, there are more rule breakers here. “We keep shifting our nakas to keep the drivers guessing,” said an officer. OCs said areas like Behala, Alipore and Ballygunge have more self-discipline among residents since they are some of the worst-hit by Covid. Additionally, nakas have been starting late. “After the special checks till 1am, it is not always possible to hold early morning checks. The lacuna is visible between 8am and 9am when cars and bikes go virtually unchecked,” said an ACP. “The central business district usually has cop presence everywhere and it is not easy to skip surveillance here,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/high-norm-flout-rate-in-office-para/articleshow/82866031.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

When compared with the average fatalities over the past three years, at least 1,500 more people had died last month in the city. The Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) had issued 6,107 death certificates in April 2021. It was 4,104 in April 2020, 4,789 in April 2018, and 4,885 in April 2019. The average deaths for the month of April for the past three years was 4,592. In April 2020, when the pandemic had just started impacting the state, the official death count due to the infection in the city was less than 25. When TOI contacted city health officer Dr M Jagadeesan who handles death and birth statistics, he did not respond to calls or messages. Another official in the GCC’s health department, however, said they were conducting continuous audits to reconcile Covid-19 death data with the directorate of public health (DPH) records. On Friday, anti-graft NGO Arappor Iyakkam sent a missive to the state government alleging gross under-reporting of Covid-19 deaths, pointing to long queues at mortuaries of government hospitals and crematoria. A relative of one of our volunteers died after being admitted to an ICU for Covid-19. But he tested negative when he died and his death was not marked as Covid-19 death,” Jayaram Venkatesan, convenor of Arappor Iyakkam, said. J Amalorpavanathan, a public health expert and former state health department official, said several Covid-19 deaths go unreported as patients with Covid-like symptoms such as shortness of breath and fever may not have tested positive under RT-PCR test. “Tamil Nadu government should follow the criteria stipulated by World Health Organisation (WHO) when recording Covid-19 deaths,” he said. Some people deemed to have recovered from Covid-19 but died soon after must also be included in the registry for Covid-19 deaths, he added. A sanitary inspector working in central Chennai told TOI that the high number of deaths would also include those who died due to preexisting health complications aggravated by Covid-19, but were not tested for Covid-19. “Only if test reports show positive, we deem them as Covid-19 deaths,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/1500-more-died-in-april-than-citys-avg-fatality/articleshow/82867477.cms||Siddharth Prabhakar

The students have also reached out to other Delhi University colleges and its alumni for support. Students of the Enactus society at SRCC have initiated the project, which is one of the many steps started by DU and its students in the past few weeks to fight Covid-19. Arushi Mahajan, a second-year student, said, “We planned to set up the plant as an SRCC Enactus initiative. But then we realised that a larger student community needed to come together for a bigger impact. Hence, we have collaborated with ‘Doctors for You’ for the oxygen plant.” She added that the primary objective was to supplement their efforts by funding the oxygen plant. “We hope to generate Rs 35 lakh with the help of the students, faculty, alumni of SRCC and DU within a month. Once established, the plant will be sufficient to save around 20-30 lives at a time.” Shruti Gaggar, a second year student, said that, with the help of 220 donors, including both alumni and contacts of fellow students, they had managed to collect over Rs 8 lakh so far. Mahajan said they had promoted the campaign at other DU colleges and hoped to get their support. “We are also trying to organise an online event where we can get artistes to perform, which will entertain people and they can also contribute to this cause.” Mahajan, who is the president of SRCC Enactus society, said they were already in touch with the Commonwealth Games Centre, which is managed by Doctors for You. “Our college administration has been supportive and is also reaching out to the alumni for help.” Meanwhile, the students have also initiated a ration distribution drive in a few of slums. Last year, they had provided employment opportunities to women slum-dwellers of Lal Bagh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/srcc-students-work-on-o2-plant-at-cwg-centre/articleshow/82867471.cms||Mohammad Ibrar

With the party high command opting for a generational shift in the Congress parliamentary party, a leadership change is almost certain in Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) as well. Sources said the high command expected both the opposition leader and the KPCC president to step down soon after the election results came out owning responsibility for the humiliating defeat. However, both chose to continue much to the high comman’s chagrin. The AICC had sent its emissaries to the state to know about the opinion of MLAs and MPs on their choice of leaders both at the parliamentary party as well as in the KPCC. Most of them advocated for a total change in the leadership and to put an end to the dominance enjoyed by internal factions. Party strongman from Kannur K Sudhakaran has been eyeing the KPCC president post ever since the party suffered a setback in the local body elections. Apart from K Sudhakaran, K Muraleedharan’s name is also under consideration for the KPCC chief’s post. Earlier, there were reports that former CM Oommen Chandy has thrown his weight behind K C Joseph to replace Ramachandran. Ramesh Chennithala also had extended his support to him but both the leaders have figured that the party high command will not back them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/mullappally-says-hes-ready-to-quit/articleshow/82866088.cms||---
---||Nagpur||‘Healthy, emotionally strong women shouldn’t let the pandemic derail family planning’||Dr Payal Agrawal, a gynaecologist and obstetrician as well as an infertility and IVF specialist, has been part of a team which treated over 50 Covid positive pregnant women at Kingsway Hospital since the outbreak of the pandemic. Many need hospitalization and even ICUs during the second wave. In an exclusive interview to TOI, she talks about the challenges gynaecologists face and the patient’s ordeal. Excerpts... Q. How badly has the second wave hit expecting women? A. There are no statistics available regarding the number of pregnant women hit by Covid across India. But, from anecdotal references, we have seen it was worst during the second wave. As per an article in Lancet, the number of maternal deaths has increased. The article states that more number of maternal and still births took place as compared to the pre-pandemic times. Similarly, we also noticed a little increase in maternal deaths in Nagpur district. Yet, Covid per se doesn’t affect pregnant women only but the incidence was the same as seen in the general population. The need for critical care and ICUs was more due to complications. Q. Should teleconsultation still remain a preferred option? A. Teleconsultation is good to a certain extent. But, if patient is not educated and not compliant, then a personal visit is required. First and second trimester there is nothing to worry but if a woman has comorbidity she should go to the hospital and consult the doctor. Generally, third trimester is more risky. Q. What were the challenges of prenatal care management in the second wave? A. There were two aspects. One is patients were reluctant visit hospitals because of the infection fear and doctors too recommend that they must limit their outings. This led to some challenges in routine prenatal care. Possibly, some complications may have gone unnoticed, including maternal and fetal. The other aspect is the surge. As a general scenario, hospitals were not prepared enough to deal with the kind of patient load seen in the last two months. In peri-urban areas, hospitals were not even equipped to handle Covid-related complications in pregnancies. So, the referral load increased in city hospitals. This included infrastructure and manpower. Q. Was there a lack of proper planning for pregnant women? A. It was unpreparedness absolutely. People were going wherever they got a bed. I am not sure if they got a chance to consult same doctor whom they had been consulting since the start of pregnacy. Ironically, Covid patients couldn’t go to their doctors while nursing homes got converted and couldn’t call their patients who were Covid-free. A gynecologist friend of mine was Covid negative. She was under treatment of some doctor whose nursing home was converted into a Covid hospital. At the last moment, she got shifted under my care and we successfully delivered her. Q. Were the exclusive healthcare facilities not enough? A. Certainly, enough healthcare facilities for ANCs are available in Nagpur district. But they were occupied with non-Covid ANCs as they too are equally important. Where would they have gone if these too were converted into Covid hospitals. Q. How did you manage to treat pregnant Covid positive patients? A. Patients who came early were successfully managed, either in the form of home monitoring with some video consultation and medicines. We managed them successfully if they had a moderate disease requiring O2 support. Some patients even required ICUs and they came out without any harm to the fetus. Some cases reported reduced quantity of amniotic fluid because of Covid. This lead to preterm deliveries. In the first trimester, the number of pregnant women having miscarriages increased in the last two months. Either directly due to Covid or due to its symptoms. Q. What kind of precautions is necessary? A. As such there is no special care other than the universal formula of SMS (social distancing, mask and sanitizer).We must ensure that expecting women don’t get infected and are early in reporting symptoms. Keeping a watch on bothersome symptoms like SPO2 less than 94 , persistent fever for more than 4 days, breathlessness or chest pain is the key to keep yourself safe. Q. Ahead of a possible third wave, what is your advice for family planning? A. Conception (pregnancy) is deeply a personal choice. Multiple factors play a key role in the pregnancy decision like social, environmental, psychological and financial. During this time of uncertainty, the best people to guide regarding your conception plans are your partner, your support persons, your own self and of course your doctor. Here, we feel the virus is still very new. We don’t know its major impact on pregnancy and its outcome. However, there are a few things a couple needs to keep in mind — mental and physical health and social and financial planning. Q. Should couples talk to doctors at least once? A. Generally, 10% of women experience anxiety during pregnancy which has increased to more than 30 % during pandemic times. Isolation, quarantine, all these can aggravate anxiety. Anxiety can lead to depression, which makes it difficult to manage and any healthy pregnancy can get complicated. We don’t know how long Covid will last. So, if women who are reasonably healthy and can manage emotional challenges of pregnancy should not allow this pandemic to derail their family planning. But, if somebody is suffering from any physical or mental health then they should consult their doctor while planning and have proper preconceptional counselling.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/healthy-emotionally-strong-women-shouldnt-let-the-pandemic-derail-family-planning/articleshow/82867489.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Raise compensation for kin of Covid dead, says PCC chief Kamal Nath||Ujjain: PCC chief Kamal Nath on Saturday punched holes into Madhya Pradesh government’s plans to offer financial assistance to families who lost their kin to Covid-19 and said that under-reporting of cases will leave thousands of eligible candidates bereft of the benefits. Nath also asked chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan to raise the compensation amount announced to the families of deceased to Rs5 lakh and relax norms for submission of death certificates to avail the benefits. “Shivraj ji has announced Rs1 lakh compensation to families losing their kin to Covid. I am asking him to raise the amount to Rs5 lakh. Also, I would like to know what certificate you will consider while distributing the compensation,” Nath told the media in Ujjain. The former chief minister, who earlier offered prayers at temples in Ujjain, also addressed a press conference. He said the government has made several announcements for families of Covid victims. “But the question is that the state government figures show around 7,000 deaths in the second wave, whereas the actual numbers are far high. How are the rest of the families going to get the benefits?” he said, adding that thousands will be left out. Several deaths have occurred due to post-Covid complications. “Would these families be included in the list of beneficiaries? How will the orphaned children get the death certificates of their parents?” Nath said, asking the government to reveal the exact number of Covid casualties in the state.  Referring to state home minister Narottam Mishra seeking evidence that the government is under-reporting Covid cases, Nath said, “You have the records with you. Make them public and tally with the registers found at crematoriums and graveyards. Prove me wrong, I will apologise.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/raise-compensation-for-kin-of-covid-dead-nath-to-govt/articleshow/82867484.cms||---
---||Nagpur||‘Allopathic doctors not open-minded, don’t accept other schools of medicine can treat Covid’||Nagpur: Vaidya Jayant Deopujari, chairman of the Central Council of Indian Medicines (CCIM), feels the basic education of modern medicine doctors is a reason for non-acceptance of other schools of medicines. In a straight talk, he shares with TOI his views on ayurveda treatment for Covid-19 and why associations of modern medicines are vehemently opposing it. Q. If allopathic doctors are asking for research and data, what’s wrong with it? A. Nothing wrong with asking for research, but following the data blindly is a major problem. This problem comes from their education model. Modern doctors have been taught to use the data and research but hardly taught to conduct research and generate data. People have faith in these doctors who follow someone else’s data blindly. Many times, they follow data influenced by pharma companies. They lack open-mindedness which is a must for any researcher. Good things should come from all directions, at least when the disease is completely unknown. Q. There is strong opposition to ayurvedic medicines like Coronil from modern doctors. A. They can’t believe that other schools of medicine can find a remedy. I can confirm that all protocols were followed like any allopathic medicine trial while conducting the Coronil trials. The makers should have published the data scientifically. Unfortunately, they came into the public domain, thus giving an opportunity to create a mess. But that doesn’t mean that medicine is useless or trials were fake. Q. Were the trials of Ayush 64 conducted in the same manner? A. In the case of Ayush 64, we conducted research in a big hospital of modern medicine and followed all protocols. Data on aswagandha and giloy was also presented. The data is positive but modern medicine doctors are not ready to accept. Q. Your opinion about government support to ayurveda doctors? A. There is support and we have a separate ministry too. Telangana has allowed ayurvedic vaidyas to treat Covid and post-Covid patients. It is proving beneficial to all. A big research on 1.5 crore citizens and their experience with ayurveda is underway and we will soon come up with big data. Q. Your suggestion to common patients? A. Don’t be blind followers. The medicine that was a lifesaver till yesterday and you were dying to get it from the medical store, goes out of protocol the very next day. As Covid-19 is a new disease and no pathy has medicine on it, all are at the same level. An integrated approach should be promoted. All must come together to end this pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/allopathic-doctors-not-open-minded-dont-accept-other-schools-of-medicine-can-treat-covid/articleshow/82867499.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Government units to revive vaccination drive, private hospitals struggle||KOLKATA: With two consignments of more than 3 lakh vaccine doses having arrived in the city this week, government hospitals and centres are getting ready to revive inoculation — including the 18-44 age group in some cases — in a major way from Monday. However, private hospitals, which must purchase their share directly from manufacturers, haven’t received enough doses to spike the number of recipients significantly. In fact, several have no stock at all. AMRI Hospitals, for instance, has been purchasing consignments sporadically as and when supplies are available. “At the moment, we have enough to cater to a reasonable number of second-dose recipients. We don’t have surplus to inoculate all age groups and have no idea when the next consignment will arrive,” said CEO Rupak Barua. RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) expects to receive 50,000 doses of Covishield “early next week”. “We will allocate 8,000 doses for those waiting for their second dose. The remaining will be used for the 18 and above group,” said RTIICS zonal director R Venkatesh. At ILS Hospitals, vaccine stocks are yet to arrive. “We expect the stocks to reach us by Sunday. Once we get it, we will be vaccinating those in the 18 and above age group. Our supplier has a good amount of stock with them so we expect a steady supply in the weeks to come,” said ILS group vice-president Debashis Dhar. Peerless Hospital, which had to shut down vaccination after government supplies stopped on May1, is expecting a consignment next week. “We have paid for 12,000 doses and expect the batch to reach next week. Depending on demand, we will divide the stock among recipients,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Sen. Medica Superspecialty Hospital, however, isn’t hopeful of reviving vaccination in the near future. “Our stock has been nil since the beginning of this month. Despite efforts, we have failed to strike a deal with a manufacturer. We are at it, though, and hope to be able to break through soon,” said chairperson Alok Roy. The dwindling stocks have forced private hospitals to call off their off-site vaccination programmes. Only three hospitals — Woodlands, Charnock and Apollo — still have off-site vaccination along with on-site drives. “Unless there is a major spurt in the manufacture and supply of vaccines, which looks unlikely in the near future, private hospitals will struggle to inoculate their registered and legitimate recipients. The worst-affected could be the 18+ population, which is vulnerable in the second wave and those waiting for their second jab,” said an internal medicine consultant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/govt-units-to-revive-vax-drive-pvt-hosps-struggle/articleshow/82866058.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Goa||Covid-19: Third wave may hit Goa in September, state braces to protect kids||PANAJI: Even as Goa grapples with the second wave of Covid-19, epidemiologists have warned that a third wave may hit the state in September. And when it does, experts said there’s a good chance that it will affect a large number of children. “We have two months to prepare,” said Goa Medical College dean Dr S M Bandekar, who heads an expert committee set up by the government that will submit suggestions on how to keep the paediatric population safe. The state is looking at a paediatric population of about 3.5-4 lakh, including around 2.5 lakh children less than 12 years of age. But Dr Jagadish Kakodkar, nodal officer and head of the department of preventive and social medicine at GMC, said there should be no misconception that the third wave will affect only children. “Everybody is likely to get affected by the third wave but the proportion of children getting an infection is likely to be more,” said Kakodkar. “That proportion will depend on various factors such as the virulence of the organism, infectivity, whether schools re-open or not, and it will also depend on whether people will turn complacent and attend crowded gatherings,” he said. Kakodkar said the pattern of Covid infectivity seen among children in Goa during the first and second wave was similar to the pattern seen in other parts of the country. About 7-8% of those infected were children during the first wave, and this number rose to 12% during the current wave, though the severity of symptoms is much less. Kakodkar said there are 101 neonatal ICU beds in the state and it was decided that 10 beds in GMC and five at the North Goa district hospital would be added immediately. There are also 36 paediatric ICUs, and if need be, 20% of adult ICU beds would be converted to paediatric ICU beds. It was also suggested that if cases increase, one paediatric hospital in each district can be taken up for Covid patients. The Indian Academy of Paediatrics (IAP), Goa chapter, will communicate to the committee on this. The committee comprises chiefly paediatricians from government and private hospitals and will place its suggestions before a specially established task force, which had its first meeting on Friday. “The expert committee members (also) felt that the home monitoring mechanism has to be strengthened for the third wave by involving anganwadi workers, councillors and teachers. The moment an escalation in the condition of a baby is observed, it has to be shifted to a higher facility,” Bandekar said. He said so far, it has been rare for children with Covid-19 to have a cytokine storm, but that they have a different condition—multi-system inflammatory syndrome. “In such a condition, not just the lungs, but the whole system of the child can get affected,” he said. The expert committee also deliberated on what kind of medicines would be required, as the drugs currently used for treating adult Covid-19 patients can’t be administered to children. The expert committee has agreed to follow the protocol set by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Covid paediatric cases. The immediate decision of the expert committee was also that lactating mothers having children below two years of age and women in the 18-44 age group having comorbidities are vaccinated on priority, so that their children are protected. “The suggestion was placed before the directorate of health services, and it will be intimated to the task force,” said Kakodkar. “We want to be prepared in all aspects by ramping up the infrastructure before the third wave becomes reality,” said Dr Harshad Kamat, a leading paediatrician and member of the committee. “We have taken stock of the situation. We are looking at the worst-case scenario but hoping that it doesn’t happen. But looking at the second, it is better that we are fully prepared,” Kamat said. Private paediatricians have also shown willingness to work in GMC or either of the district hospitals if the need arises, Kakodkar said. Besides, training of paediatricians will be conducted. For North Goa, Dr Maria Silveira, head of the paediatrics department, GMC, along with Dr Chetna, will conduct a webinar for paediatricians. For South Goa, Dr Ira Almeida, nodal officer for vaccination at Hospicio, will conduct the seminar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/third-wave-may-hit-goa-in-sept-state-braces-to-protect-kids/articleshow/82869322.cms||Bindiya Chari
---||Goa||Govt begins work to amend Goa Co-op Societies Act||PANAJI: The state government is mulling to amend the Goa Co-operative Societies Act to strengthen cooperative organisations and to try and keep a check on fraudulent activities in cooperative bodies which are in a bad shape, said minister for cooperation Govind Gaude. Gaude told TOI a state-level committee consisting of domain experts and MLAs has been constituted to examine and recommend amendments to the Goa Co-operative Societies Act, 2001. The committee has already met once while the second meeting is slated for May 27. “The high powered committee has some experts from the cooperative field and there are two MLAs from the opposition parties too. We will hear them out and see what else can be done to improve the Act,” said Gaude. For many years Goa’s cooperative sector has been ignored and has been riddled with financial irregularities and erosion of depositor’s funds. One of the objectives behind the proposed amendment, said sources, is to bring in checks and balances to prevent malpractices and bring in transparency in a sector which is the backbone of the state’s rural economy. MLAs Aleixo Lourenco, Wilfred D’Sa and Vinod Palyekar are on the committee along with chairman of the Goa Bagayatdar Sahakari Kharedi Vikri Saunstha Maryadit Narendra Sawaikar. Prakash Velip, Vallabh Salkar, chartered accountant R K Pilke and representatives from the Goa State Co-operative Union and Goa State Co-operative Bank Ltd are also part of the committee, said registrar for cooperative societies Arvind Khutkar. The department of the registrar of cooperative societies has already submitted certain changes in the Act. “In the coming assembly session the amendment will be introduced but before that we will upload it on the website for public feedback. Once the high powered committee finalises the changes, we will keep it open for 15-20 days for suggestions,” Gaude said. The department has been trying to bring in reforms in the sector for the last few months, by asking cooperative credit societies and VKSS societies to appoint professionals to run the societies and to implement core banking solutions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-begins-work-to-amend-goa-co-op-societies-act/articleshow/82869340.cms||---

Teams led by district labour officers are visiting all local camps and areas to record the numbers eligible for vaccinations. Ernakulam district with a total of 47,296 persons has the highest number of guest workers, followed by Kannur with 27,279 people. According to the labour department, most are in the age group of 18-44 years. Most of them do not have any comorbidities. Awareness drives are being conducted among the migrants, especially plantation workers on the need for vaccination. Notices have been issued with call centre numbers in Hindi, Tamil, Odia, Bengali, Assamese and Telugu. “When we have adequate vaccinations, we will ensure that they are also vaccinated. As of now, all Covid patients are given utmost care in the domestic care centres set up for them and their families. District collectors are tracking their health and welfare,” said S Chitra, state labour commissioner. Officials have been told to coordinate with local bodies to ensure facilities for their treatment. Interestingly, employers have also come forward wanting to vaccinate their staff. “We are also looking at tie-ups with private hospitals to get it done. As for the general organized and unorganized sectors, we plan to make the bookings and direct the guest workers to respective hospitals on fixed dates so that there wouldn’t be much confusion,” Chitra said. The funding for the health welfare and vaccination would be done under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY). Labour department officials said that the influx of workers into the state has come down a little. Many who had gone home for Ramzan and elections in West Bengal and Assam are yet to return. They suspect it to be due to the lockdown and triple lockdown. However, to ensure that those who stayed behind don’t lose out on the welfare benefits, guest workers are being given food provision kits worth Rs 800. The kits, unlike those being given to local residents, have more wheat flour, dals, potatoes, onions and vegetable oils suited to their cooking. Over 70,000 food provision kits have already been distributed. The kits for distribution were made available by the civil supplies department and kits were prepared accordingly. Regional joint labour commissioners are overseeing the distribution in the three zones. Orders for 31,330 kits were received in the central region, which includes Kottayam, Idukki, Ernakulam, Thrissur and Palakkad districts. The northern region of Kozhikode, Kannur, Kasaragod, Wayanad and Malappuram districts have been allotted 25,423 food kits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/labour-dept-to-register-guest-workers-for-jabs/articleshow/82866129.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

The court held that since the accused was a cop there was high chance of him pressurising and threatening the woman. The court also observed that it was unfortunate that his family members had helped him fabricate evidence against the nurse. “The prints of the WhatsApp chats produced by the complainant on record sufficiently show that she was not willing to abort the child. The applicant (accused), however, forced by threatening and emotionally blackmailing her that he may commit suicide,” the court said. The accused, a constable, had befriended the woman on a social networking site in June 2019. The woman lodged a complaint in October 2020, after she allegedly received threats from the accused, his wife and other family members. The court observed, “The consent (for sex) was obtained by giving false promise of marriage. There was intention to deceive the complainant from inception.” (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-bail-for-cop-who-promised-marriage-and-raped-nurse/articleshow/82869344.cms||---
---||Delhi||Out of business, Delhi eateries get rent shove||NEW DELHI: The second wave of the spread of the novel coronavirus has jolted the restaurant industry. With staff and diners battling Covid-19, imposition of restrictions by the government and almost no orders, many outlets have shut operations rather than looking at surviving merely on deliveries. However, some outlets have started receiving rent reminders from malls and standalone property owners for the month of May. With almost no business for a month and the near future also looking bleak, National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) has written to over 138 malls across 51 cities and an open letter to property owners seeking rent waiver, opting for the revenue-sharing model going forward and no fixed rent guarantee. In another letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, NRAI requested for prioritising hospitality workers just like healthcare and frontline workers for vaccination. The letter stated that since a majority of workers were aged between 18-44 and the nature of their work entailed interacting with people, their safety would give confidence to diners. NRAI also added that restaurants would be willing to meet the vaccination costs of their employees. Emphasising that the resources of restaurants had depleted, NRAI said the F&B industry needed all possible support to stay afloat. Some of the main demands put forth by NRAI included complete waiver of rentals and common area maintenance (CAM) charges till the time businesses were shut for unrestricted dine-in. It also sought revenue sharing till operations were restricted, which means only having permission to deliver food, limited hours of operations or limited capacity utilisation. Another important demand was no minimum guaranteed rent for six months. NRAI president Anurag Katriar said restaurants would need active assistance from all stakeholders to survive, just like last year. “For the survival of the F&B industry through this second wave, revenue sharing is a fair model that will ensure that malls don’t lose out if we see an unexpected early surge in business volume. I’m fairly certain that as long-standing business partners of ours, the property owners will once again extend their support during this unprecedented crisis,” he added. Echoing the sentiment, Rohit Aggarwal, director, Lite Bite Foods, which has multiple outlets of Punjab Grill, Zambar and YouMee across the country, said negotiations with property owners would start now and they would put forth their demands of no minimum rent guarantee, reduced revenue share and CAM. He added, “A lot of our business is now dependent upon deliveries. We are already paying commission to the aggregators. We cannot afford hefty rentals.” Terming the next 12 months as crucial for the restaurant industry, Vishal Anand, founder, Moonshine Food Ventures that has outlets Cafe Staywoke and Saga, said survival would depend on there not being any more coronavirus waves like the current one. “With the support of property owners, restaurants can hope to recover to pre Covid times in 2-3 years. As of now, the impact on the industry has been catastrophic,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/out-of-business-eateries-get-rent-shove/articleshow/82867511.cms||Amin Ali
---||Goa||Goa government to hire Ayush doctors as it fails to get MBBS physicians||PANAJI: The directorate of health services’ second attempt in the last one-and-half month to hire MBBS doctors has been unsuccessful. Only four candidates showed up last week when it conducted walk-in-interviews for 50 posts. The response has been poor even after dropping the eligibility criteria of residence certificate hoping that at least candidates from neighbouring states will respond. Last month, it drew nil response. “We will now appoint Ayush doctors,” director health services Jose D’Sa told TOI. The government has been on a spree to hire doctors and nurses to fill the glaring shortfall felt in hospitals as the number of Covid-19 cases skyrocketed. People aware of ground realities said that it is not easy to hire doctors, because the majority may be preparing for National Eligibility-Cum-Entrance Test (NEET) and secondly, there is hardly anybody available locally who is without a job. Panaji-based Dr Govind Kamat said that even if it is considered that Goa produces 150 doctors — Goa Medical College (GMC) offers 180 seats — considering failures and other factors — every year, the majority pursue higher studies. “They aren’t interested in joining at the entry-level. Of these, 15% will be from other states. Once they get their degree from Goa University, they will either go back to their home state or take admission for post-graduation,” Kamat said. The pool of doctors available for hire is very narrow, Kamat said. The few who are interested in joining are likely to be discouraged because they will be posted on Covid duty immediately after joining, a senior government official said. “We happily joined government service for two decades at whatever salary was offered to us then, but I don’t think the salary of Rs 65,000 is attractive to the present generation of doctors who are ambitious,” he said. Goa Resident Doctors Association (GARD) president Dr Pratik Sawant said that the availability is meagre as fresh graduates are serving their bond after getting their degrees. Over the last decade, it has also been difficult for private hospitals to hire MBBS doctors as residents unless they are willing to offer an attractive pay package. Most private hospitals appoint either ayurvedic or homeopathic doctors as residents as they join for a salary of about Rs 40,000, while a doctor with an MBBS degree will not join for a salary of less than Rs 60,000 to Rs 65,000. Manipal Hospitals’ Dr Shekhar Salkar said that after completing their MBBS, most of them concentrate on their further studies, also a considerable number of them leave the state for better careers. It is not just doctors, but hiring nursing staff is also not easy. “Few of our nurses quit to join contract jobs in the government service, recently,” Salkar said. Another doctor attached to a private hospital said, “Whenever a government hires nurses and even if appointments are contractual in nature, nurses serving in private hospitals choose the former not because of pay disparity, but hoping that one day their service will be regularised. Many private hospitals have nursing staff from bordering districts of neighbouring states.” Starting salary for a fresh nurse in the private sector is likely to be Rs 15,000 to 20,000, while in government, she will draw about Rs 30,000 a month, even if the appointment is contractual.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-to-hire-ayush-docs-as-it-fails-to-get-mbbs-physicians/articleshow/82869336.cms||Bindiya Chari

---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh notifies black fungus an epidemic, cases cross 1,000 mark||BHOPAL: Cases of black fungus or mucormycosis crossed the 1,000 mark in Madhya Pradesh on Saturday. Amid the surge in number of black fungus cases, the state government notified it an epidemic under the the Epidemic Diseases Act and the Madhya Pradesh Public Health Act. A disease notified under the epidemic diseases act is required by law to be reported to the government authorities. The collection of information allows the authorities to monitor the disease and provide early warning of possible outbreaks. The order came after chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan held a meeting on Friday evening, an official statement said. Meanwhile, a total of 1,044 cases of black fungus have been reported in the state, so far. Till Friday, the government had information of only 610 cases of black fungus patients who were being treated at the five medical colleges of the state. After the declaration of the disease as epidemic, more information regarding patients admitted at various private hospitals was also received. Experts said black fungus mainly affects those patients whose immune system has been compromised. The excessive use of steroids and antibiotics in Covid-19 patients, has adversely affects the immune system of patients, thus they have become vulnerable to the disease. Now, like Covid-19, information pertaining to the black fungus will have to be provided to the chief medical and health officers of the districts. Thus, the government will be able to maintain a record of all such cases and ensure proper treatment, said sources. As of now, treatment of the disease is done free at five medical colleges in MP, however state is facing shortage of amphotericin injections, only around 5,000 jabs have been received by the state wherein orders for around 24,000 injections have been placed by the govt, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/mp-notifies-black-fungus-an-epidemic-cases-cross-1k-mark/articleshow/82867514.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||In black and white: Immunity is the key||AHMEDABAD: After the dreaded mucormycosis, several patients in the city and state also recorded prevalence of aspergillosis in some patients – caused by the Aspergillus fungus. To differentiate it from the ‘black fungus,’ it’s named ‘white fungus’ but the experts said that such classification could be misguiding. Moreover, it’s more than black or white fungus – as the immunocompromised patients are susceptible to other fungal infections as well, they added. “Fungus are everywhere – and it doesn’t affect everyone equally. Our immune system fights it off. But it’s opportunistic. If the patient has lower immune system coupled with co-morbidities like diabetes, it gets the chance to grow,” said Dr Neeraj Suri, an ENT surgeon with Gandhinagar GMERS Medical College. “We have recorded instances of both mucormycosis and aspergillosis in recent times. But recently, we have also seen cases of other fungal infections such as rhizopus. The bottom line is – one must not let the guards down.” Dr Nina Bhalodia, head of the ENT department at Sola GMERS Medical College, said that one cannot rule out the prevalence of other fungal infections. “Even in the case of aspergillosis, without biopsy it would be difficult to differentiate. But what I want to convey to the citizens is, except severe cases of mucormycosis, other fungal infections have very low fatality. The patients should not panic,” she said. The experts pointed out some conducive factors that helped fungal growth in patients – especially among Covid-recovered ones. They said that coupled with low immunity and pre-existing comorbidity, use of steroids and presence of blood clotting can cause the proliferation. “The ferritin level is invariably high in these patients. One of the markers for Covid-19 as well, the levels show inflammation in body,” said Dr Bhalodia, who recently treated three cases of aspergillosis. Dr Suri warned against using liposomal amphotericin B as ‘miracle drug’ for mucormycosis. “Mere injections don’t save the patients – the management starts right from locating the fungal spread and removing it completely. The key is to prevent further proliferation,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/in-black-and-white-immunity-is-the-key/articleshow/82867662.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Nagpur||Mucor claims one more life amid shortage of key anti-fungal drug||Nagpur: A 53-year-old woman became the 32nd victim of mucormycosis in the city on Saturday amid the acute shortage of Amphoterecin B, an anti-fungal injection needed to treat the disease. Around 700 injections of Liposomal Amphotericin B were distributed by the collector’s office to different hospitals on Saturday. The demand was for around 7,000 vials. There are 580 persons who have been affected by the black fungus that causes mucormycosis. Of them, 230 have been cured so far. Depending on the situation, each patient may require 60-120 injections. The relatives of the deceased patient who was admitted to Orange City Hospital blamed the hospital for not providing Amphotericin B injections. As they turned aggressive, the management had to take police help from Wednesday.As per the hospital management, they had made it clear before admitting the patient that the medicine is in short supply and the relatives should make arrangement for it. Dr Anup Marar, one of the directors of the hospital and convenor of Vidarbha Hospitals Association, said the kin have to sign a consent form in which they agree that they shall arrange Amphotericin B. Instructions in this regard are displayed at prominent spots at the hospital, he said. “The hospital admitted the patient only after the relatives agreed to bring Amphotericin B. The relatives brought some doses which we administered to the patient. Later, health complications led to the death but doctors and hospital became target due to the drug shortage,” said Dr Marar. “The government has asked us to proceed with surgery at the earliest without waiting for availability of the drug,” he said. In the meanwhile, the medical fraternity has expressed concern over unavailability of Amphotericin B injection, followed by Posaconazole and Isavuconazole as add-ons or substitute. Dr Harshawardhan Bora, internal medicine and critical care specialist at Kingsway Hospital, said the medical fraternity is torn between ‘Risk of the drug’ versus ‘Risk of the disease’ due to the shortage Amphotericin B compelling them to use other antifungal drugs like Posaconazole and Isavuconazole as substitutes. “Doctors are under stress as the drug shortage has now hit our line of treatment and procedures against mucormycosis. We are forced to compromise and use whatever is available. The best we can do is to remove the fungal load and reduce the infection spread to some extent,” he said.Dr Nandu Kolwadkar, a well-known ENT surgeon, said if radical debridement of the dead (necrosed) cells is not done and fungal load is not reduced, then the infection may spread to the brain and eye leading to fatalities. “In absence of Ampho B, which is almost indispensable, we are merely keeping the show on with Posaconazole and Isavuconazole,” he said. Another well-known ENT surgeon Dr Shailesh Kothalkar of Seven Star hospital said the procedures may have to be postponed indefinitely in future if the drugs are not available in adequate quantity. “The focus is to debride the dead tissues and reduce the fungal load. Till the normal tissues are encountered, we are supposed to administer whatever drugs are available with us,” said Kothalkar. He too said the hospital is allowing admission only if the patient’s kin can arrange for Amphotericin B. “The drugs are costly too. The price of Isavuconazole is around Rs22,000 for seven tablets. The price of Posaconoazole tablet was earlier Rs8,000-10,000 but it has shot up to Rs21,000 now,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mucor-claims-one-more-life-amid-shortage-of-key-anti-fungal-drug/articleshow/82867522.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Hyderabad||WFH caused techies’ stress levels to shoot up: Study||Hyderabad: The Covid-19 pandemic has led to a significant increase in working hours duration among software professionals in Hyderabad, resulting in an increase in stress levels. This was revealed in a study conducted by faculty members of department of community medicine, Mamata Academy of Medical Science, Hyderabad published in Annals of Community Health, a peer-reviewed journal. Researchers studied the psychosocial impact of the pandemic on 240 software professionals in Hyderabad between May and June 2020. The study found that 71% had moderate stress levels, 12% had high stress levels and 17% had low stress levels. Higher level of stress was attributed to continuous pandemic, lockdown, work from home and multiple responsibilities. Women showed significantly higher stress levels when compared to males, which might be due to multiple roles they had to juggle during the pandemic. “Last year, during the lockdown, many societies like ours had denied entry to maids. Therefore, we had to manage household chores along with our office work. This added to a lot of stress as we were working 24x7 with fewer breaks,” said Bhagyashree M, a graphic designer working with a multi-national tech firm. Many software professionals also reported having a significant rise in working hours. The study indicated that 66% admitted to working more than eight hours per day. Increase in working hours during pandemic was attributed to rise in distractions and decreased concentration while working from home. “Working from home has blurred the line between personal and professional lines. Many companies have augmented their projects, IT services were ramped up as everyone started working from home, which resulted in massive increase in stress levels among software professionals,” said Praveen Chandrahas, general secretary of Forum of IT Professionals in Hyderabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/wfh-caused-techies-stress-levels-to-shoot-up-study/articleshow/82867520.cms||Preeti Biswas

The Chapel of Our Lady of the Monte, built in 1519, may be in for an “avoidable tragedy” is corrective action isn’t taken immediately, said Fr Alfred Vaz, president of the Se Cathedral chapter. The monument was lying in ruins around 20 years ago, but high-profile restoration work funded by Fundacao Oriente ensured it got a new lease of life, as project managers stitched, grouted and strenghtened the partly-cracked edifice back into shape. The monument is now known as the venue of the eponymous Monte music festival, held the first weekend of every February. But in recent years, the roof of the chapel, one of the oldest structures in the former capital, had been dilapidated for some time, and gush of the Goa monsoon may have gradually impacted it stucturally. “The condition of the monument has worsened, as more tiles have blown off due to Tauktae. If timely attention is not accorded to urgent repairs, we may be in for an avoidable tragedy,” said Vaz. The chapter led by Vaz, which oversees religious services at the chapel, has been pursuing the matter of its conservation with the directorate of archeology for two years. “More cyclone damage to the roof and the gushing rain water seepage may have weakened the vault above the altar,” said Glean Cabral, secretary of the chapel committee. Fundacao Oriente’s 30-month restoration project is considered unique in India, as it was the first private organisation to carry out this kind of work on a historic monument, which as matter of policy would be done by the department. Closely supervised by the DoA, Portuguese and Indian specialists worked together to restore the chapel with Baroque style and Mannerist influences to its finery with minimal intervention. “The major structural problem was development of a longitudinal crack at the crown, and quarter points in the 21m long vault over the nave,” wrote S C Deshpande and Sandhya Savant in a paper on the project. This paper discussed concepts, methods and details adopted for the restoration. “Rehabilitation works involved foundation strengthening, placing 50mm-diameter stainless steel ties at intervals, stitching and grouting,” they wrote. A DoA official said a Rs 3 crore tender for the chapel’s restoration was delayed due to some technical problems triggered by the cyclone. On Saturday, a contractor worked out modalities at the site for immediate attention to the monument. “Temporary measures are proposed to protect the monument during the monsoon,” a source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-tauktae-battering-historic-monte-chapel-in-urgent-need-of-repairs/articleshow/82869356.cms||Paul Fernandes

Mohonda, whose AK 47 rifle was seized, was learnt to be a part of the Maoist action team which had orchestrated the blast at a nullah at Jambhulkheda in which 15 jawans and their civilian driver were killed. The jawans were heading to Purada where the Maoists had set on fire almost 27 vehicles of a road construction company and two site offices earlier in the day on May 1, 2019. Mohanda, who was part of the Maoists’ company four formation, had gone to Paidi village near Kotmi on Thursday to address a public meeting of tribals related to tendu collection. He was accompanied by the Kasnasoor dalam. The four members of the company four formation and the Kasnasoor dalam had returned to a hillock in Paidi forest to rest in the night where the C-60 commandos zeroed in on them early morning, eliminating 13, including seven women cadres. According to DIG, Naxal range, Sandip Patil, Mohonda was one of the key players of the Jambhulkheda blast whose body was traced at the site of the Kotmi encounter during the searches. “We had earlier come across information that it was Mohonda’s accurate use of the IED switch at the Jambhulkheda ambush which had triggered the blast just when the jeep with 15 QRT jawans was crossing the small culvert over a nullah,” he said. “Several other accused in the blast have been already arrested and handed over to the national investigating agency (NIA) which is conducting the probe,” said Patil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/maoist-leader-who-triggered-blast-in-jambhulkheda-neutralized-in-kotmi-firing/articleshow/82867553.cms||Soumitra Bose

Justice Chandiwal was appointed on March 30 to look into Singh’s allegations of corruption against Deshmukh. Deshmukh confirmed receipt of the notice and said he is in the process of submitting his contention before it. After his unceremonious exit, Singh had maintained a discreet silence, but when Deshmukh said that his performance was dismal and could not be pardoned, Singh wrote a long letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray alleging that the home minister had set a target of Rs 100 crore from 1,750 bars and restaurants in Mumbai and that the task was given to Waze. Deshmukh quit the cabinet, following which Thackeray appointed Justice Chandiwal on March 30 to go into the charges of corruption and irregularities. Initially, it was an inquiry committee, but on May 3, the state government granted the committee all the powers under the Commission of Inquiry Act. Now, Singh will submit on oath his charges against Deshmukh and he will have to submit relevant documents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-chandiwal-panel-sends-notices-to-deshmukh-singh/articleshow/82869377.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

Speaking to reporters, Vasavan said the government is also considering linking the bank to the local self-government institutions too. The aim is to make it to the number one position in the state. Currently, the bank occupies second position, he said. In order to achieve this, various loan and deposit schemes will be launched. Steps will be taken to provide cheap agriculture loans, he said. He also said that currently the funds from NRIs are deposited in nationalised banks, and it benefits only the big corporates in north India. Once the bank manages to attract these deposits, the funds will be spent in the state itself, he said. “Regarding default in repayment of loans, as chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has assured, those who do not have any other property other than the house they live in will not be evicted,” he said. Such defaulters will not have to face the threat of confiscation of their properties. Vasavan also slammed the central government for taking an approach not favourable to the cooperative banks. He said the state government will strongly oppose acts like the Sarfaesi Act. As part of the modernization process all the cooperative banks will be linked to a single network. Regarding registration department, Vasavan said that online procedures in the department will be made more efficient.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/steps-to-attract-nri-deposits-on-way-min/articleshow/82866179.cms||---

After setting up three such Covid care centres in Serilingampally zone and one in LB Nagar zone, three more such centres are soon going to be operational in Kukatpally zone in the next few days. One of the three centres will be inaugurated on Tuesday, while the remaining two will be operational from Wednesday, officials said. To set up these centers, the civic body has identified 30 buildings – one per each GHMC circle in the city. “These centres are being set up for people who are unable to isolate themselves due to space constraints at their homes and those who are unable to take care of themselves when they are infected. These centers will have all the necessary facilities, including assistance by doctors. Each centre will have capacity of about 70 to 100 beds,” said V Mamatha, GHMC zonal commissioner for Kukatpally zone. Apart from round-the-clock monitoring of health by doctors, these centres are provided with ambulance facilities, oxygen concentrators and healthy food for those in isolation in the Covid-19 care centers. “We also have a list of hospitals to shift the patients under isolation in case of emergency,” said Mamatha, who along with other officials inspected three proposed isolation centres located in Kukatpally, Moosapet and Alwal circles recently. To run these three centres, theGHMC has entered into an agreement with Hope Foundation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/3-more-free-covid-19-care-centres-in-city/articleshow/82867560.cms||---

Educational institutions were already closed for students amid the pandemic. They will now remain closed for a month for teachers and other staff too. Singla said the state government has continuously been taking precautionary measures for the safety of people. He said apart from taking steps to ensure safety, the government has worked hard to uplift the standard of education in schools, which, he said, was visible from increase in admissions and improvement in results. Since the closure of schools last year, teachers of the education department have been teaching students with the help of online modes, including mobile applications and TV channels, said the minister. He added this year, teachers have also been helping students in every possible way to complete the remaining syllabus. He appealed to teachers to stay connected with students during the vacations and make both students and parents aware of safety protocols to be followed to avert Covid infection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/summer-break-from-may-24-to-june-23-in-punjab-schools/articleshow/82872609.cms||---

While the hospitals are still performing operations to remove the fungus, majority accepted that follow-up of the patients has become a challenge. Thus, patients get admitted to Civil Hospital or other hospitals hoping to get regular supply of medicines. Namisha Gandhi, vice-president of Sterling Hospital, said that the drug supply has been interrupted for the past few days. “We arranged for injections till we could, but then we had to tell patients to wait till supply resumes, or they could try to get it. It’s a good move on the state government side to channelize supply, and we are hopeful of getting injections soon,” she said. Some hospitals are now asking patients’ relatives to agree to the arrangement where they would have to get the injections to get the treatment started, or not to blame the hospital at the time of adverse events during treatment due to want of drugs. Dr Nishita Shukla, group COO of Shalby Hospitals, said that the patients who are in dire condition due to mucormycosis are admitted for surgery. “In several cases, the relatives shift the patients wherever there is availability of the medicines – recently a patient got shifted to Vadodara from the city. We are attempting to procure the medicines,” she said. Likewise, at Apollo Hospitals, the hospital is relying on the stock as well as help from the relatives. Dr Balaji Pillai, COO of the hospital, said that surgeries are going on but follow-up medicines are not available 100% as needed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hospitals-admit-mm-patients-dont-guarantee-medicine/articleshow/82867643.cms||---

Senior AAP member and MCD in-charge Durgesh Pathak claimed that corporations have cleaned only 30-35% of the drains. “Delhi government cleans the big drains under it, but the corporations are playing with the lives of the people,” he said on Saturday. Reacting to the allegation, South Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Anamika Mithlesh said the waterlogging happened due to inaction of Delhi government’s PWD. “PWD has failed to clear silt from major drains, which has resulted in waterlogging. Despite limited resources during the pandemic, SDMC has achieved 50% target of desilting, while remaining will be done ahead of monsoon season,” said Mithlesh.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Composer Laxman of Raam-Laxman fame dies||NAGPUR: Music director Vijay Patil, popularly known as the Laxman of the Raam-Laxman duo, whose frisky tunes enlivened Dada Kondke’s Marathi superhits and the early Salman Khan blockbusters, passed away following a heart attack on Saturday. He was 78. His chartbusters came in films such as Tarana, Maine Pyar Kiya, Hum Aapke Hain Koun, Patthar Ke Phool and Pandu Havaldar (Marathi). Among those who mourned his demise on social media were the peerless Lata Mangeshkar and Bollywood star Salman Khan. Production house Rajshri, for whom the music director was a regular, also posted their condolences. “Rajshri will always remember him for his immense contribution to the music industry,” it tweeted. Apart from Khan, Raam-Laxman’s music also boosted the early career of Mithun Chakraborty films such as Tarana and Hum Se Badhkar Kaun and gave a second wind to S P Balasubramanyam as Salman’s playback in late 1980s and early ’90s Bollywood. The music of Raam-Laxman was based on the basics of orchestra and took the legacy of Laxmikant-Pyarelal forward. Melody, even in foot-tapping numbers, was a special feature of their music. Use of traditional Indian instruments along with the typical orchestra set-up made their songs popular. Patil, born and brought up in Nagpur, started as a singer and instrumentalist in the city’s popular orchestra groups. Later, he shifted to Mumbai to become a music director. With his friend Surender ‘Raam’ Kadam, Patil formed a team which was given the sobriquet ‘Raam-Laxman’ by Kondke. It was the well-known Marathi filmmaker-cum-actor who gave them their break in the film industry with ‘Pandu Havaldar’ in 1975. Even after the death of Kadam, soon after the pair bagged its first Hindi film ‘Agent Vinod’, Patil continued to provide melodies to more than 75 Hindi, Marathi and Bhojpuri films as ‘Raam-Laxman’. Rajshri Productions’ songs in ‘Maine Pyar Kiya’ (Filmfare award), ‘Hum Aapke Hain Koun’ (many awards) and ‘Hum Saath Saath Hain’ proved to be super-duper hits. ‘Lovleena aa gaya main’ from ‘Agent Vinod’ in 1977 and ‘Deva ho deva, Ganapati Deva’ from ‘Humse Badhkar Kaun’ in 1981 stand out in his oeuvre. Patil composed several chartbusters during the 1980s and 1990s before the advent of Nadeem Shravan and Anu Malik. Ten years ago, a brain stroke made it difficult for Patil to sing and compose. He shifted to Nagpur and lived with son Amar who too is into music. Patil kept away from the media and lived a quiet life in the Untkhana area of the city. Family members said Patil was not a Covid-19 patient and had taken both doses of the vaccine. On Friday night, he complained of chest pain. Before he could be shifted to a hospital, he got a severe cardiac arrest and died at home around 2am. People from Nagpur’s music industry were the first to pay tribute to Patil. “He was a dear friend. I will remember his association with Kader Orchestra. When we started a music academy, I had invited him to inaugurate it. Despite being unwell, he came,” said singer M A Kader.  Bharat Ratna Lata Mangeshkar said, “Felt very sad hearing the news about talented and popular composer Raam Laxmanji (Vijay Patil). He was a nice person. Many songs composed by him and sung by me became very popular. My sincere tributes to him.” In 2018, Raam-Laxman were bestowed the Lata Mangeshkar Puraskar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-composer-laxman-of-raam-laxman-fame-dies/articleshow/82864205.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The study was jointly conducted by experts from Ayush, ISM, and from Sitaram Ayurveda Pvt Ltd at the camps for guest workers in Thrissur district in 2020, and was led by Dr P Salajakumari, who is the Ayurveda DMO. Dr Salajakumari said the dhooma choornam was found to be effective in reducing the fungi belonging to the species mucor and rhizopus, which are found to cause mucormycosis or black fungus, in the indoor air of labour camps of guest workers. “The study found that the total bacterial and fungal count were reduced by 99.25% and 98.92% respectively, after the third day of fumigation,’’ she said. Salajakumari said that counts of fungi belonging to eight species were measured during the nine-day long study which included three days prior to fumigation, three days during fumigation and three days after. Dr Sajakumari said that antibacterial and antifungal activity of aparajitha dhooma choornam remained as such up to 24 hours of fumigation. “Within 72 hours after the completion of fumigation, the bacterial or fungal activities were found to be very low in the rooms,” she added. The study report was submitted to the health minister, Ayush secretary, director of ISM and to the district collector, who had suggested the study.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/choornam-fumigation-can-reduce-fungus/articleshow/82866223.cms||T Ramavarman

Soon after infection rate got intensified during the second wave migrants began vacating Rasoolpura and the adjoining slums. Their numbers shot up once the lockdown came into force on May 12. Though chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao assured financial assistance of Rs 500 and 12 kilograms of rice or wheat flour, the migrants in Cantonment area did not receive this dole. “Perturbed with the negligent attitude of the state government over 30,000 migrants living in my ward (no.II) left the city. Perhaps this is one area in the city which houses the largest number of migrant population,” said former Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) member S Keshava Reddy. Thousands of migrants live in Rasoolpura, Annanagar, Chandrababu Naidu Nagar and about half-a-dozen slums in ward no.II. Many of them belong to Bihar, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu and Telangana districts. “Of the 1.5 lakh migrants here, 60% of them are masons, hamalies in the Bowenpally and Monda markets, servant maids etc. Surprisingly, even after the government announced sops to migrants, none of the officials visited this area. The SCB officials also did not bother to sanitize the slums. I used my own vehicle for this purpose,” Reddy said,||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/with-no-help-coming-many-leave-cantt-area/articleshow/82867587.cms||Sunil Mungara

While the stolen phone has been seized, Lohani’s accomplice is still at large. The GRP found CCTV grabs of the two men running away. On Thursday, the STF, which had circulated CCTV grabs among its informants, received a tip-off that the prime accused was to arrive at Goregaon station. The STF combed Goregaon station but Lohani had left. “He was later found in the area outside the station and was arrested.

---||Goa||Goa: During blackout, solar power users had their moment in the Sun||PANAJI: While their neighbours groped in the dark for three to four days at a stretch after Cyclone Tauktae, few far-sighted green citizens with their own rooftop solar hybrid systems were largely unaffected by the power disruption. In fact, they turned into mini grids and were able to reach out and share the surplus solar power generated by their rooftop solar plants with their neighbours. Merces resident Madhusudhan Joshi charged his neighbours’ phones, laptops and helped pump water to their overhead tanks too. All this while he continued to use his own appliances at home, including the fridge, washing machine, water purifier etc. “It’s pollution-free, noise-free, renewable energy,” he said. He admitted he paid 50% more for the hybrid system that works as a two-in-one when compared to a regular on-grid system which completely shuts down when the department’s power supply fails. His works both as an on-grid system — supplying excess power back to the grid and nullifying his bills — as well as an off-grid system in case of power failure, where the same solar panels charge his batteries and through a hybrid inverter, power his house. During the blackout in his area, all the excess solar power generated during the day went to his battery backup instead of back to the grid. A professor of pharmacology at Goa College of Pharmacy, Joshi decided to put his lessons on non-conventional and renewable energy into practice when building his house in 2018. His rooftop solar installation has not only allowed him to supply surplus power to the grid and nullify his electricity bills, but he has been receiving credit from the state department too. “I’m very happy with this investment. Uninterrupted power supply made my life hassle-free over the past week. I didn’t miss out on my routine activities at home and I was also able to help my neighbours to some extent. If I had more ideas, I could have helped them more,” he told TOI, adding that a smart battery monitoring system allowed him to supervise the charge of his battery and consume power accordingly. Most people have just the on-grid system. The subsidy offered by the government for an on-grid system and a hybrid one is the same, but a combination helps a consumer reduce his bills as well as provides a backup system in the case of power failure, said Anish Sousa who installs solar power systems. Consumers are not left in the lurch during prolonged power outages and can continue using solar power as long as they ration their supply and don’t consume more than they generate, he added. If Germany can do it, a tropical country and state like Goa with bountiful sunlight can, too. In the quiet village of Betalbatim, Eleanor Viegas also didn’t have to stumble for her torch when power supply was cut off on the night of the cyclone — all thanks to her seven-year-old rooftop solar plant. She too came to the rescue of her neighbour who charged his phone at her house. “I would have been in total darkness for five days and life would have been very difficult,” she said. She is now looking at upgrading her plant after the cyclone experience. “This cyclone was a big shock to everybody. I’m now trying to update my system to be one step ahead of climate change that we are experiencing. I’ve never seen such wind. It makes one stop and think that you can be left without anything so quickly,” she told TOI. Hers is an eco-friendly house with natural material, where she tries to live in harmony with the environment. Getting back to nature is our survival, she said. “I support solar power and we need to have more of it. It’s wonderful to see hotels working on solar power and turning into health resorts. Everybody wants to come to Goa as it’s such a beautiful place. Goa could, in fact, lead the way. It’s all about getting back to nature and that’s really what many had to do during the cyclone,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/during-blackout-solar-power-users-had-their-moment-in-the-sun/articleshow/82869410.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Delhi||Property tax app: Details not up yet||New Delhi: The three municipal corporations launched an app on Thursday that will allow residents to file property tax and avoid visiting zonal offices during the pandemic. The three civic bodies—north, south and east corporations—said the robust system, developed with help from National Informatics Centre, is error-free and easy to use. However, they have not uploaded the details of taxpayers yet, so those willing to use the app will have to wait. Last year, the south and north corporations had made online registrations and submission of information mandatory before filing the tax on their portal. But, after several people complained of issues in furnishing all details, the taxpayers were also allowed to file tax through cheques. A senior south corporation official said that taxpayers who had successfully registered and submitted information about their properties online will be able to use the app facility. “Others will have to file in the conventional manner or first register on the portal,” said the official. To make the registration process easier as most taxpayers in the city are senior citizens and not tech-friendly, the civic agency said they used in-house staff to upload details. “We are expecting the process to end by September-end, after which the applicant will be able to access his/her property tax details, payment made in the past, etc, by simply registering through numbers provided in the records,” said a corporation official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/property-tax-app-details-not-up-yet/articleshow/82867651.cms||Vibha Sharma

Union cabinet ministers will interact with education ministers of all states and Union Territories to chalk out future roadmap regarding the pending exams. So far, Std XII board exams have simply been categorized as “postponed” by all major boards. Defence minister Rajnath Singh will chair the virtual meet, along with minister for education Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’, minister for women and child development Smriti Irani and minister for information and broadcasting Prakash Javadekar. From Maharashtra, school education minister Varsha Gaikwad will be joining the meeting. In Maharashtra, HSC exams have been postponed, while SSC has been cancelled. Pokhriyal had earlier written to states/UTs, that “Department of School Education & Literacy, Ministry of Education and CBSE are exploring options regarding the conduct of examinations, keeping in mind the safety and security of the students and the teachers”. An official note from the Union government said the department of higher education is also deliberating upon the finalization of dates of examinations for institutions of higher learning. The letter has noted that the Covid-19 pandemic has affected various areas including the education sector, particularly board and entrance exams. In view of the prevailing situation, almost all the state education boards, CBSE and ICSE have postponed their Std XII examinations. Similarly, National Testing Agency (NTA) and other national exam conducting institutions have also postponed entrance exams for admissions to professional courses. The official press release mentioned that “as the conduct of Std XII examinations impacts state board exams and other entrance exams across the country, and to reduce uncertainty among students, it is desirable that a considered decision based on inputs of different state governments and UT administrations is taken about Std XII CBSE examinations in the interest of all students”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/std-xii-exam-high-level-meet-of-top-ministers-today/articleshow/82867631.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

The Horticorp had already started the procurement of vegetables from the 'vegetable hub' of Vadakarapathy, Eruthiampathy, and Kozhinjampara in Chittur taluk. They have also started procuring Mango from Muthalamada 'mango city'. But the farmers said that the corporation procured only small quantities that will not help many farmers. They wanted the entire vegetables to be procured at the support price announced by the state government. The farmers were distributing the vegetables free of cost in some areas as there were no buyers. In some cases, the vegetables were destroyed and cattle were allowed to graze the vegetable farms. The agriculture department officials said that the procurement of vegetables in Elappully Grama Panchayat will soon begin to help the farmers in dire straits. Total lockdown in nine panchayats from tomorrowMeanwhile, district collector Mrunmai Joshi has ordered to close down nine more local bodies to control the spread of Covid-19 from Wednesday. In the nine grama panchayats, the test positivity rate is above 35%, and even after a week of lockdown the rate had only increased by about 10%. The borders of the grama panchayats -- Malampuzha, Karimpa, Nalleppully, Tarur, Kadampazhipuram, Thenkara, Kozhijampara, Paruthur and Thachampara -- will be closed. On Monday, 1,898 fresh cases and 3,156 recoveries were reported in the district, leaving 21,461 active cases. The test positivity rate in Palakkad on the day was 21.54%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/horticorp-to-procure-vegetables-in-palakkad/articleshow/82866205.cms||---

Even as Goans counted their losses, many came forward to help them temporarily tide over the crisis. Menino Fernandes from Davorlim had a pile of unused Mangalore tiles left over after setting up his roof. When the cyclone blew the mud-baked tiles off people’s roofs, he sent out a broadcast message over WhatsApp, offering the tiles free of cost. “I received over 100 calls from people, and all the 1,200 tiles were distributed in no time. About 80% of these calls were from families in Aldona, Mapusa and Tivim,” he said. As more requests kept pouring in, there were also calls to help with contribution towards his cause. “There are some families that have kept extra tiles like I did, and I am borrowing these tiles from them to give away to people who have sent me an SOS. I am willing to personally deliver the tiles, and will only charge the delivery cost,” he said. Similarly, an earthmover company offered to clear out uprooted trees free of cost. Till Friday, it attended around 35 calls from distressed citizens. Ankit Chaudhury, who co-owns a beach resort at Morjim, offered free accommodation for a few days to those underprivileged families whose huts were damaged or blown away due to the cyclonic storm. Right from a dog shelter to people seeking accommodation for their house-helps, he received several requests. “We don’t mind giving complimentary rooms to people that genuinely need them, especially at a time like this when there is already so much sorrow due to the pandemic. Ours is a pet friendly hotel, so we don’t mind if people even come here with their pets,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/spirit-of-goa-helps-people-pick-up-life-after-cyclone/articleshow/82869437.cms||Nida Sayed
---||Ahmedabad||Researchers read corona outbreak signs in wastewater||Ahmedabad: How do the authorities such as the state and central government decide on the spread of Covid-19 in a specific region? There are several markers – for starter, the test positivity rate (TPR) indicating how many persons are testing positive out of every 100 persons tested on rapid antigen test (RAT) or RT-PCR. It could also be the footfalls at the general practitioners or hospitals for telltale Covid symptoms.But what about employing a method which goes beyond these statistics? Prof Manish Kumar, a member of the faculty of earth sciences at IIT Gandhinagar (IIT-Gn) along with other collaborators including Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre (GBRC), is attempting to break the code through wastewater monitoring. Several papers on the topic later, Prof Kumar says that it could be an effective way to forecast a possible surge.How does the Covid-19 virus end up in wastewater in the first place? The experts explain that ACE2 receptors, associated with binding of Covid-19 virus in human body, are also found in the intestines. Thus, fecal matter from Covid-19 patients can carry the virus. Can the virus spread through fecal matter? It’s a question overwhich several studies are being conducted.“But our current focus is on the presence of the virus in wastewater. The regular analysis at multiple sites is giving us unmistakable data on the concentration and even gene types (ORF, N, S, etc.). The data from the analysis matches with that on the ground – for example, the high concentration shows higher number of cases,” said Prof Kumar. “At the times when even RT-PCR tests are not able to detect the presence of the virus directly, and there is large number of asymptomatic patients, such method can be useful.” The team’s latest publication highlighted that the treatment of wastewater doesn’t completely remove the virus’ presence. “Our method breaks down the RNA to find the presence of the virus. But the study pointed out that disinfection seems less effective than the adsorption and coagulation processes for SARS-CoV-2 removal. We would need more effective method to treat the water,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/researchers-read-corona-outbreak-signs-in-wastewater/articleshow/82867647.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Kochi||Kerala: Tanker with oxygen has eventful journey||KOCHI: Deprived of food, sleep, and toilet facilities, a four-member team drove a cryogenic tanker 2,400 km traversing four states to bring 9.65 tonne of oxygen to the state. On Thursday morning, KSRTC drivers Joby PG, TJ Viju, and Antony Joy along with assistant motor vehicle inspector KM Anish reached Kochi with the state’s first inter-state oxygen shipment made by road. Their journey to the Steel Authority of India plant at Panghat in West Bengal had been smooth. They were airlifted from Sulur Air Force Station in Coimbatore on May 15 and had their tanker filled and ready to hit the road on Sunday night. But it was the road trip that began before dawn on Monday that has left a lasting impression on the four men. En route, cramped in the vehicle’s cabin, they witnessed officials trying to seize the oxygen tanker and people rushing to buy essentials with no care given to Covid protocols. Joby tells their story: “We had started our journey at 2am (Monday). We only had some snacks and hoped to buy food on the way but no shops were open and we couldn’t find even lodging to wash or sleep.” They relied on toilets at fuel stations and mangoes and bananas from roadside vendors. “We were stopped at several places for checking and had to convince them that we were transporting oxygen to Kerala,” said Joby, “but the real problems arose when we entered Odisha.” “A police vehicle intercepted us and then a district collector turned up and demanded the tanker. They said they would refill the tanker and release it after their order arrived,” said Joby. Anish says a further delay would have resulted in the tanker being taken away. “I called P B Nooh, transport commissioner in-charge, in the middle of the night apprising him of the situation. He spoke to the Odisha officials and convinced them of the need to transport the oxygen to Kerala,” said Anish. They were stopped at five-six other places in Odisha. Then there was a technical snag upon reaching Srikakulam in Andhra Pradesh that meant the men had to sleep on the roadside. They faced another hurdle at the checkpost at Walayar. “It was a bitter experience for us during this journey. We told those at the toll gate that we were transporting oxygen while they kept telling us to wait for the police. As they were relentless, we forcefully lifted the gate and continued to Kochi,” said Anish. Two other tankers that left the SAIL plant on Wednesday night are expected to reach Kochi on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/tanker-with-o2-has-eventful-journey/articleshow/82866331.cms||T C Sreemol

On Saturday, Delhi reported 2,200 fresh Covid cases with a positivity rate of 3.5%, as compared to 26,169 cases on April 22 with a positivity rate of 36.24%. After several days, Covid fatalities in the city went below the 200 mark with 182 deaths being reported in the past 24 hours. Covid cases had crossed the 2,200 mark towards the end of March and kept on increasing each day over the next two months. According to the state government’s health bulletin on Saturday, the capital conducted 63,155 Covid tests, which included more than 43,000 RT-PCR tests. The number of people who have recovered from the novel coronavirus is three times more than the number of fresh cases. This has been the trend for the past few days and has resulted in a fall in active Covid cases. Currently, Delhi has 31,308 active cases, which had risen to nearly 1 lakh towards the end of last month. So far, Delhi has conducted over 1.8 crore Covid tests, since the pandemic broke out in the country. The capital, at around 4,000 tests per million population, has consistently been testing more than many other states, including Uttar Pradesh (1,300 tests per million population) and Gujarat (1,500). The hospitals infrastructure is also under much lesser stress at the moment. Among the 24,964 available Covid beds, only 10,501 are occupied and nearly 14,500 beds are vacant. The occupancy of ICU beds is also comparatively lower. Over 18,000 people are currently recovering under home isolation and many among them are getting oxygen concentrators from Delhi government after prior evaluation by the doctors. Delhi has so far reported 14 lakh Covid cases, while 13.6 lakh people have recovered so far. A total of 23,013 people have died of the deadly virus. The capital currently has 48,429 containment zones, most of which have been turned to micro zones. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal at a press conference on Saturday said the infection rate in the city had declined in the past 24 hours, coming down to 3.5%. The CM, however, warned that the dangers of the virus has just been stalled. “Covid still persists. We have to take every measure to save ourselves from the coronavirus,” Kejriwal stated. Meanwhile, Delhi government is keeping up its efforts to further strengthen the existing healthcare infrastructure and improving the services so that the government is better prepared to handle the situation in case another wave hits the country. Health minister Satyendar Jain visited a healthcare facility annexed to GTB Hospital on Saturday and reviewed the arrangements. “Doctors and staff are treating patients with great care and devotion. I salute all the healthcare workers who are providing their services during this pandemic,” the health minister later tweeted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cases-go-under-2-5k-for-1st-time-in-2-mths/articleshow/82866242.cms||---

---||Delhi||Two rare black fungus cases found at Delhi hospital||NEW DELHI: Two rare cases of black fungus infection in the intestine were noted at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital on Saturday. While in one case, around a foot of the small intestine had to be removed, in the other, doctors excised 2.5 feet of the intestine. The treating doctors were taken aback because the fungal infection usually affects the nose, ears and brain, not the intestine. “Both patients complained of abdominal discomfort and only CT scans showed us that the intestine was perforated,” said Dr Ushast Dhir, senior consultant, surgical gastroenterology. “While one of the patients had not been given any steroids for Covid, the other was given steroids for a week. Luckily, both of them are doing well now but require monitoring.” One of the patients, a 58-year-old man, had lost three members of his family, including his wife, to Covid and had just completed the last rites when he started experiencing stomach pains. The other, a 68-year-old and a Covid patient like the first man, was a diabetic and had been treated with steroids. The 58-year-old thought his abdominal pain was due to gas and self-medication only worsened the situation and delayed medical care by three days. Dr Dhir suspected that the patient’s pain could be something other than Covid and advised an immediate CT scan. “The scan showed his small intestine (jejunum) had been perforated. Due to Covid, his condition was deteriorating and he required a ventilator,” said Dhir. “The ulceration of the jejunum also raised my suspicion of fungal disease and the patient was immediately started on antifungal treatment. We operated upon him and sent the removed portion of the intestine for a biopsy.” The older patient had initially been happy to learn that his father had recovered from Covid, but he was soon discomfited by abdominal pains. The patient had diabetes and had been on steroids. The examination of the 68-year old man showed a similar small intestinal perforation. He too was operated upon and the excised intestine sent for a biopsy. Dhir told TOI, “The biopsy confirmed our worst fear of mucormycosis of the small intestine in both patients. The duo was diabetic and both had contracted Covid. But only one of them had received steroidal medication.” Given their cases, Dhir cautioned against ignoring any bodily pains and self-medicating at home. Dr Piyush Ranjan, senior consultant, medical gastroenterology, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said that while the black fungus usually infected the eyes, ears or brain, the CT scans of the two patients showed perforated intestines that were later confirmed to be the result of mucormycosis. “Intestinal or GI mucormycosis is a very rare disease and commonly involves the stomach or large intestine. Most such patients would be immune-compromised,” explained Ranjan. “The majority of GI mucormycosis cases involve organ transplant recipients. These two cases are unique because both had Covid and the small intestine rather than stomach or colon) was affected in both.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2-rare-black-fungus-cases-found-at-city-hosp/articleshow/82866261.cms||Sakshi Chand

And this despite their meagre earnings and tough living conditions.  With no financial support from their families, these workers say that they have no choice but to slog it out here so that they can return the money borrowed during the last lockdown. “I borrowed Rs 50,000 during the first wave of pandemic when I left Hyderabad and went home with my family—wife and four children,” said Noor Alam Khan from West Bengal who used to earn Rs 4,000 a week by working at a boutique.  Now, during the lockdown, his income has dropped to zero. “I don’t want to go back to my home town. I will somehow survive here,” Khan said adding that he has requested the moneylender for some relief this month so that he can he repay this month’s interest over the next couple of months. Caught in similar situations, some have left their families behind in their home towns and staying alone in town till the lockdown is lifted.  “The last time around we not only struggled to return to our home town, but has a tough time for seven months after that as there was not much work to do. I don’t want to repeat the same mistake. I am staying alone now and will patiently wait for the lockdown to be lifted so that I can resume work,” said Lakshmi Nisad, a migrant worker from Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh adding that he had to borrow money to survive at his hometown in 2020. But now with no income, he too has no other option but to default on paying interest for this month. But despite the struggle many like Shashi Kumar from Bihar, who returned to the city about a month back, say that they prefer to stay back in the city as he also struggled in his home town as couldn’t manage to get work.  “Here I at least know that I will start earning once the lockdown is lifted. If I go back, I will not have any work and will not be able to survive,” said Kumar, a construction worker.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/debts-force-many-migrants-to-stay-back/articleshow/82867622.cms||Nirupa Vatyam
---||India||Barge found on seabed, toll 66; 13 other bodies washed ashore||MUMBAI: The death toll of personnel of barge Papaa (P-305) that sunk off the city’s coast in the wake of cyclone Tauktae went up to 66 after six more bodies were recovered on Saturday. While 186 people of the total 261 on the barge were rescued during the week, nine are still missing, and the search for them is on. Five of the recovered bodies are still to reach Mumbai’s shores, and of the 61 already at JJ hospital, 43 have been identified but 18 are not. The city police on Saturday began collecting blood samples from the 18 victims for DNA testing so that samples could be matched with relatives for identification. Police said samples may also have to be collected of the five bodies that are on the way on naval ships that conducted search operations. Five bodies were also found washed ashore along the coast in Murud and Alibaug talukas on Saturday. One body was found in Murud, two in Navgaon and one each at Awas beach and Dighode beach in Alibaug. The Raigad district administration has asked ONGC and Mumbai police to ascertain if the bodies are of those on P-305 or those on the tugboat Varaprada (which also capsized, with 11 of its men still missing) or of fishermen who were stuck in the waters when the cyclone hit the coast. Their blood samples may be taken too, police said. Of the 43 bodies of P-305 staffers which have been identified, 41 have been handed over to their families. While warships INS Kochi and INS Kolkata sailed back to the naval dock on Saturday. INS Betwa, Teg and Talwar were joined by survey vessels INS Makar, Tarasa and Subhadra to locate the nine missing personnel and the barge and tugboat’s wreckage. Coast Guard vessels, helicopters and ONGC offshore vessels have also been deployed for the rescue mission. Mumbai police spokesperson, DCP S Chaitanya S said, “The Mumbai police has so far got 61 bodies. While 43 bodies have been identified, 41 of them have been handed over to their relatives. The police are in the process of collecting DNA samples of the remaining bodies for identification.” The blood samples of the victims and their relatives will be sent to the Kalina Forensic Sciences Laboratory and the bodies handed over to families once the DNA samples match. Relatives, kin and friends of those still missing continued to make the rounds of JJ Hospital, where the bodies that have been brought back have been kept. Udaram Ranawat (70), who is from Rajasthan and had come to JJ Hospital on Friday, returned to his hometown on Saturday with the body of his elder son, Pappuram (32), a crew member on the barge. Ranawat has two children. His younger son, Amraram (30), who also worked on the same barge, went missing during the cyclone and is yet to be found. The family of engineer Anthony Edwin (27) had almost lost hope of getting to see his body after they received information on Saturday that the body brought to JJ Hospital could not be flown to Kerala as the flight on which it was to be taken had got cancelled. But another flight was later available, and the body was to reach Thiruvananthapuram late on Saturday. “He will be buried with honours on Sunday morning in Kollam,” said Edwin’s uncle Joseph Daniel. Meanwhile, the Director General of Shipping has sent notices to the owners of Gal Constructor, SS-5 and Sagar Bhushan – the other three vessels that had gone adrift because of the cyclone and whose staffers were all rescued and brought back to shore by six Navy warships -- to carry out immediate repair work on the vessels for the damage they have suffered. “The notices havee been issued so that there will be no oil spill. Also, immediate measures were asked to be taken to clear Gal Constructor that ran aground with 137 personnel onboard,” said a source from DG Shipping. The Yellow Gate police on Thursday registered an FIR against the barge captain, Rakesh Ballav, and others on a complaint made by chief engineer Mustafizur Rehman Shaikh (47), who is among the survivors. The captain is still missing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/barge-found-on-seabed-toll-66-13-other-bodies-washed-ashore/articleshow/82872611.cms||Mateen Hafeez

The newspaper had on Friday reported about entrepreneur Anil Bhardwaj who was waiting for the approval for the drug for his wife admitted at Max Saket.  When TOI asked him on Saturday if the hospital managed to get the drug, he said ‘yes’ but the approval came for just seven vials. “My wife has been advised seven vials a day for at least 10 days to start with.

AfterA senior doctor working at a private hospital in the city said, “Amphotericin-B is in severe short supply and there is huge black marketing going on. Hospitals were not even getting half of the supplies demanded. It is quite a bad situation. The sad part is that the drug is available in the black market and we don’t even know whether it is authentic. It is a sorry state of affairs for such a life threatening disease. We are not getting the medicines in the correct way. I think that is a major management failure on part of all the stakeholders.” Other private hospitals in the capital reeling under the shortage and inadequate supply are Fortis and Apollo among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hospitals-still-face-scarcity-of-drug-people-allege-available-in-black-mkt/articleshow/82866279.cms||Sakshi Chand

Police began investigating after a complaint was lodged in Loni on May 12 by a couple that claimed their 15-day-old child was abducted from their house by a man and a woman who had visited them on the pretext of renting a flat. “The complaint was lodged by Fatima and Fariyad, residents of Dabur Talab area. Based on an initial investigation, we concluded that it was highly unlikely that a child could be abducted in that way,” said Atul Kumar, circle officer, Loni. “However, upon further investigation, it came to light that it was not just a case of abduction but that of a baby-selling racket. In this case, Fatima and Fariyad had agreed to sell their newborn to the accused but lodged a complaint with the police when the buyers hoodwinked them and took away their child without paying the agreed amount,” he added. Five of the 11 arrested in the case are local resident Wahid, Delhi-based couple Asmit Kaur and Gurmeet, and Lucknow resident Alok Agnihotri. Three more accused in the case are on the run. Police have identified Asmit and Gurmeet as the kingpins of the racket they ran through Wahid, whose primary job was to spot poor and vulnerable couples and convince them to have a baby and subsequently sell them off. “Asmit and Gurmeet attracted potential customers through their website, Sulekha. They used to charge up to Rs 5.5 lakh from childless couples for a newborn,” said Kumar. In the case of Fatima and Fariyad, Wahid had struck a deal with the couple and offered them Rs 2 lakh for their baby. “But Wahid, along with another woman, visited the couple’s house on May 12 and took away the baby when they were busy with household chores, without paying them a penny. The baby was taken straight to Asmit and Gurmeet in Delhi, from where the accused couple boarded a flight to Lucknow and delivered the baby to Alok Agnihotri for Rs 5.5 lakh,” the circle officer said. In fact, to crack the case, the Ghaziabad police had formed three teams and activated local intelligence units. “We first arrested Wahid who spilled the beans and named all those involved in the racket. Eventually, 10 more people were arrested, including eight women and three men. Lucknow resident Agnihotri is among those held for buying the baby for his childless sister,” said Iraj Raja, SP (rural). Police have, however, not yet pressed any charges against the complainants in the case, Fatima and Fariyad. “Efforts are on to nab the other three accused in the case,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/gzb-gang-selling-babies-to-childless-couples-busted/articleshow/82867695.cms||Abhijay Jha

A city-based activist said he is waiting for the state or central government to allow a dedicated centre or home vaccination for them. “It is impossible to wait in long queues. Even as the state government had announced priority vaccination for us, there is no effort,” he said. Bombay High Court told the central government to file a reply by Wednesday on what measures it has taken to comply with its assurance on reviewing its policy to not allow door-to-door vaccination. Activists are hoping that the government will take a favourable stand. Ramchandra Rangolle, a visually-challenged activist, said that he has been waiting to get vaccinated as he is afraid to step out into the crowd. “I will need help and during these times there is no one around,” he shared Rafiq Khan, spokesperson, Prahar Apang Kranti, said that the state is only making announcements about catering to the differently-abled. “Many differently-abled tried waiting in long queues but they were sent back due to vaccine shortage.

The civic body maintained that these hospitals’ cases fall under individual interest and cannot be exempted in the name of public interest. The civic body had earlier issued notices to many clinics and hospitals for absence of valid BU permission and cited the HC order passed in response to a PIL demanding implementation of fire safety norms after the Shrey Hospital fire tragedy. On May 11, the HC had ordered AMC to hear and decide on five hospitals, which have been sealed in parts by AMC for not having valid BU permission. Some 45 hospitals and clinics are before the HC against AMC’s sealing drive because they were issued notices for violation of building byelaws. They have been represented by the Ahmedabad Medical Association. Since the HC had ordered AMC to decide on the sealed hospital’s representations, the civic officials gave hearing to Dr Deval Parikh of Jagmohan Hospital Pvt Ltd, Dr Mihir Mehta of Rugved Orthopedic Hospital, Dr Dinesh Modh of Vidhi Diagnosis and Pathology Centre and Dr Nilesh Patel of Jaini Surgical Hospital. After hearing, AMC concluded that the hospitals did not have valid NOC and ordered action against them as per the law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amc-acts-against-four-hospitals/articleshow/82867814.cms||---

While the maximum temperature was recorded at 35.1 degrees Celsius — five notches below normal — the minimum was nine degrees below normal, at 18 degrees Celsius. India Meteorological Department officials said that wind speeds touched 50km/hr at night, with gusty winds blowing due to an active western disturbance, which is still influencing parts of northern India. Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at IMD and head of the Regional Weather Forecasting Centre, said that while overcast skies are likely to be seen on Sunday as well, the chance of rain is less. “Some parts may see a drizzle, however, it will mostly be overcast skies. From Monday onwards, clear skies are set to return once again,” said Srivastava. IMD data showed Delhi received 18.6mm of rainfall between 8.30am on Friday and 8.30am on Saturday. Ayanagar received the most rainfall across the city at 34.6mm. Other stations such as Palam and Lodhi road received 21.8mm and 22.6mm of rainfall, respectively. While the all-time record for May rainfall was in 2008, when 165mm was recorded through the month, Delhi has already received 144.8mm of rainfall so far this May. IMD’s seven-day forecast shows the possibility of thundery development on Sunday, with clear skies over the next five days. Increased wind speed is expected on Tuesday, in the range of 25km/hr. Rains this week brought Delhi’s air to the ‘good’ category temporarily, with AQI falling below 50 before gradually rising. The AQI was in the ‘satisfactory’ category on Saturday, with an overall AQI of 94, according to the CPCB. Agencies forecast air quality to remain between ‘satisfactory’ and ‘moderate’ in the next few days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-rain-likely-today-clear-skies-back-from-monday/articleshow/82867739.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Now, get vax in your locality; NMC seeks to up numbers||Nagpur: With the number of beneficiaries turning up for vaccination going down and also to ensure inoculation for all eligible, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) is launching the ‘vaccination in your locality’ drive from Monday. It will be held at 336 different places up to Saturday. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B told TOI that all ten zones are identifying and analysing areas where the response for the vaccine was poor. “They will suggest measures to enlist more numbers and identify areas to conduct the drive. Till then, we will move the Covid-19 Vaccination Centres (CVC) to all localities. They will operate for two days in one area,” he said. Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari has urged people above 45 years to take benefit of the drive. Currently, the NMC is operating 98 CVCs. No vaccination will take place in many of these centres between Monday and Saturday. According to NMC chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar, “Teams engaged at these CVCs will be present at the 336 sites. A decision on extending the drive will be taken after analysing the experience of the first week.” In the week gone by, number of beneficiaries has gone down to a great extent in the district. On May 15, the number was 24,379 and 7,046, 9,539, 7,439, 5,756, 5,231, 5,449 and 4,209 on the following days. As per state public health department data, the estimated population of the district is 52,72,665 and around 30% (15,81,800) are likely to be above 45 years. Around 50% people from the 45-plus age group have taken the first dose as on May 22. Around 8 lakh eligible people remain for the vaccination. The NMC and zilla parishad (ZP) are operating 221 centres. Around 300 can be vaccinated at each centre in a day. Thus, the total capacity of the centres in the district is 66,300. The number of beneficiaries has dropped to below 6,000 per day. Guardian minister Nitin Raut and divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar had set a target of 20,000 per day. Hence, now the NMC is trying to get the number up with new ideas. The two centres of drive-in vaccination which started last week are continuing. Activist Narayan Ahuja termed ‘vaccination in your locality’ as a nice move. “All eligible people should take the first dose. Those due for the second should go too. Its been observed that people crowd a centre when it is launched and then the it thins out,” he said. The number of beneficiaries have also gone down due to increase in interval of two doses from 6-8 weeks to 12-16 weeks. Also, 3.2 lakh people from the district were tested positive in the second wave from March to till date. They will have to wait for three months as per latest guidelines of the government. A majority of these affected people are from 45-plus age group. IN A NUTSHELL * NMC is administering vaccine at 98 centres currently * Beneficiaries reducing daily despite 50% of total population above 45 years are yet to take the jab *Inoculation will be held for two days in a locality where very less number of people vaccinated *NMC planned vaccination in this manner at 336 locations in six days from Monday to Saturday *In these six days, team engaged at existing 98 centres will go to these 336 locations *Similarly, vaccination will be planned in other areas after next week||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/now-get-vax-in-your-locality-nmc-seeks-to-up-numbers/articleshow/82867686.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

---||Kochi||Wayanad farmer bags biodiversity award||KOCHI: Shaji N M, a farmer from Wayanad, who took up farming tuber crops as a solution to fight lifestyle diseases and poverty, has won the prestigious India Biodiversity Award (conservation of domesticated species – individual), on the International Day for Biological Diversity.The India Biodiversity Awards was founded in 2012 jointly by the ministry of environment, forest and climate change and UNDP-India. Over an area of seven acres, he cultivates 200 varieties of tuber crops, earning the nickname ‘tuber-man’. “There are rare varieties I conserve here, which include elephant yam which grows above the soil, on the plant itself,” Shaji said. Further, he grows 100 types of vegetables including ‘valli kanthari’, the chilli pepper that grows like a long beans vine, rather than a shrub we usually grow. At one point of time, he had 100 varieties of chilli alone, but much of those were destroyed during the 2018 floods. Shaji also grows 52 varieties of rice in a leased plot of 15 acres. “We have a special variety of rice that could be harvested within a period of 27 days,” he said. A native of Arattuthara near Mananthavady, Shaji started farming two decades ago but turned towards serious conservation of plant varieties 16 years ago. “While working for pain and palliative care of Wayanad, the second such society in the state, I noticed that it was mostly the younger people who were affected by lifestyle disease. However, the older generation in our area was relatively unaffected and they guided me to their food pattern dominated by tubers. Hence I took this up,” said Shaji who had won the Plant Genome Saviour Farmer Rewards in 2014. It was Kerala Agricultural University that nominated Shaji for the award and its IPR Cell headed by retd professor C R Elsy, the then coordinator, had done the documentation for the award application. With the fame spreading, Shaji started getting visitors from the rest of the country and overseas as far away as Brazil, Germany and Australia.  During the peak season, the number of monthly visitors touches 400, who are mainly students pursuing a project at college or university.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/wayanad-farmer-bags-biodiversity-award/articleshow/82866342.cms||Shenoy Karun

The health authority also mentioned that the trust was given permission to shift Covid facility to its new building. The authorities and the Bombay Welfare Society have filed affidavits in the Gujarat high court in response to a PIL by advocate Amit Panchal seeking action against those responsible for the negligence in implementing fire safety norms that resulted in the tragedy. The trust has asserted that it had to re-start its Covid facility under pressure of law despite being reluctant to do it. Its resistance to start the designated Covid unit was not heeded by the authorities. The hospital administrator asserted that when the Covid unit was first started in November 2020, a joint inspection of Fire Safety Audit and Electrical department explicitly for the new Covid Care facility (ground floor) was conducted. The trust also maintained that a representative from the district collectorate conducted an independent survey of the Covid facility on April 3. The state government had last week claimed that the trust had been running its Covid-19 ward in its new building, which did not have valid fire NOC and BU permission. Therefore, Bharuch fire brigade that visited the spot on the day of the incident had not inspected the new facility and instead surveyed the old building only. However, the Bharuch General Hospital RMO and in-charge CDMO supplied a document to HC which showed that the trust had sought permission to shift its Covid facility in November 2020, and the permission for shifting was granted and certain recommendations were made to avoid such accidents. But later, the hospital was dis-empanelled in January when number of Covid cases came down. With the surge in Covid cases, the hospital was asked to restart its Covid facility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bharuch-officials-knew-covid-facility-was-in-new-building/articleshow/82867813.cms||---

Despite a police complaint against a woman and three youths, the family alleges local police has done little. The distraught man has now appealed to UP CM for help and has decided to approach him if police do not find them. Local police said Shaukeen’s eldest daughter, 20, had eloped and married on her own. “She even approached the high court for protection. The two minor daughters left home because their father and brother blamed them for their elder sister’s elopement. Efforts are on to trace them. Their location has been traced to Delhi,” said a police officer. According to locals, Shaukeen’s eldest daughter had disappeared three months ago and married her boyfriend, Azad. But her father had lodged a police complaint against Azad, his brother Zubair, and their father Abrar, who live in the same village, for “abducting” his daughter. But a new twist was added to the case when the man’s two minor daughters, aged 14 and 15, went out shopping a day before Eid and never returned home. Shaukeen is convinced that all his daughters have been abducted by the father-sons trio and approached police for help. During investigation, police learnt that Shaukeen’s elder daughter had sent a copy of her marriage certificate to the high court while moving an application for anticipatory bail for her husband and his family. Yogesh Sharma, station house officer of the Nagar Kotwali police station, said, “We have registered two cases in the matter. In the first case, we have booked five accused – Azad, Zubair, Abrar and their relatives Firoz and Taki. We have arrested Firoz and Taki and sent them to jail. In the minor girls’ disappearance case, we have registered a missing complaint and a police team has been sent to Delhi to bring them home.” Jitender Singh, investigation officer of the case, said, “It has been revealed that both minor girls had gone to Dehradun in search of work and later, moved to Delhi. Before leaving home, the girls had told their teacher that they were fed up of being blamed by their father and brother for helping their elder sister elope. We have traced their location to Delhi.” Efforts are on to find all the three girls, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/3-girls-2-of-them-minors-disappear-from-home-in-3-months-man-appeals-to-up-cm-for-help/articleshow/82864400.cms||Mohd Dilshad

He claimed 350 beds have been reserved for paediatric Covid-19 positive patients and efforts will be taken to increase the number to 700. The minister also directed the officials to look for any cases of white fungus in the district. He also rued the “short supply” of medicines for treatment of mucormycosis from the central government. Raut held meeting with officials including divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B, CP Amitesh Kumar, collector Ravindra Thakare, CEO of ZP Yogesh Kumbhejkar and District Paediatric Task Force on Saturday. After the meeting, Raut told TOI that the district implemented restrictions as per order of the state government. Citing example of Amravati where cases increased after relaxations in restrictions, Raut said no chance should be taken here and SOPs need to be prepared before any decision is taken by the government. “Testing of shopkeepers, hawkers, vendors, home delivery boys etc will be done as part of preparations towards easing of restrictions,” he said. The district on Saturday registered 1,086 positive cases which were slightly more than that recorded on Friday (1,000). But the numbder of tests (19,637) conducted on Saturday were more than that on Friday (19,109). As against 33 deaths on Friday, the toll was 26 on Saturday. Also, 2,872 patients recovered on Saturday. Recoveries have been more than new cases for the last 23 days. Active cases dropped to 15,242 on Saturday. Raut said directives have been given to officials for increasing paediatric beds to 700 and creating necessary infrastructure by using CSR funds of Rs25 crore facilitated by the energy department. “No one should relax, instead continue prepartions for the projected third wave,” he said and added that Covid hospital will be soon started at ESIC Hospital and Haj House. “Police and NMC have been told to continue testing people roaming on roads without valid reasons and ensure people venture out of homes only in case of essential or emergency work. Officials have also been told to complete works to make the district self-sufficient in oxygen supply,” he said. The minister has also facilitated Rs25 crore CSR funds for strengthening medical infrastructure in rural areas. “There are complaints about rural patients not getting beds. GMCH and IGGMCH should work it out and provide the data soon,” said Raut. He stated the Centre is not increasing the supply of medicines for mucormycosis despite repeated requests. “I have asked the officials to take regular follow-up with the centre for increasing the supply,” said Raut. When NMC officials raised the issue of private hospitals not giving information in related to complaints of excess bills, the minister urged the hospitals to extend the necessary help. “Ï appreciate the contribution and efforts taken by the private hospitals in first and second wave. Only a few of them have erred for which the entire medical fraternity cannot be blamed. The complaints need to be addressed,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-relaxations-in-district-till-state-govt-decision-says-raut/articleshow/82867743.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Many expats who have come back to the state from the Gulf after receiving the first dose of vaccine mostly the Chinese vaccine Sinopharm or Pfizer-BioNTech are in a fix as the vaccines are not available in India for their second dose. “Large number of expatriates had to come to the state from the Gulf before taking their second dose. We are receiving numerous calls from expats on what they should do to get the second dose of the vaccines they had taken in the Gulf. There is no clarity in the health department on what to do regarding the second dose of such expats,” said Malabar Development Forum president K M Basheer. For instance, Vipin Kumar, an expatriate who had to return home on a family emergency from Ras Al Khaimah in UAE on April 8 after getting the first dose vaccination from UAE is clueless on what to do for getting the second dose. “My second dose of Sinopharm vaccination is due and the date of my return to UAE is uncertain due to the current flight ban. Also, my wife is not returning with me and we are clueless on what she will do to get the second dose of Sinopharm,” said Kumar, a Feroke native. He demanded the government intervention to ensure that expatriates who travel between India and the Gulf can take second dose vaccinations without trouble. Expatriates who have come home on leave to the state have been demanding their inclusion in the priority list for Covid-19 vaccination as delays in getting vaccinated would affect their return to the Gulf. The chief minister had said that the government would consider providing vaccinations to those who want to travel to foreign countries for job and studies if that is compulsory and would include passport numbers in the vaccination certificates, if needed. Also, many Gulf countries are likely to provide exemptions to vaccinated persons from undergoing institutional quarantine on their return once the existing travel restrictions for flights from India are lifted. Expatriate organizations and political parties, including IUML, had also raised the demand to include expatriates in the vaccination priority list.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/expats-caught-up-in-varied-vaccine-regimes/articleshow/82866404.cms||---

She was among the rare teenage girls in the 200-student-strong class of Mumbai's fabled and fiendishly punctual harmonica man Phiroze Damri, who would charge eight annas per session but taught her for free owing to her talent. The talent shone recently when Kasad's beautiful lips coaxed the tune of "Neele gagan ke tale" from "the world's tiniest harmonica" in front of a camera. "Granny, you are a celebrity," teased her 22-year-old twin granddaughters in Dubai, who had eagerly shown off her online videos to their friends: Such things are fuel for Kasad who has asked both her sons to make sure that "my last breath comes out of a harmonica". Similar last wishes bind the 60-odd members of Mouth Organists Mumbai, which is hosting the first virtual meet of Indian harmonica players on World Music Day on June 21 next month. Formed in 2016 by retired Air India commercial director and incorrigible harmonica enthusiast Vijay Casshyap whose left pocket always boasts a comb, a magnifying glass and a "little lady harp", MOM would be playing in each other's company after a nearly two-year-long Covid-induced gap. The first Covid wave halted their monthly jam sessions in Casshyap's "non-judgemental" living room in Khar where players would come armed with bongos and lip balms to watch the masters achieve nuance through techniques like "tongueing"__which refines the music and "warping"__which directs the air through moving fingers. Participants would include 41-year-old US-based, Mumbai-bred, "note-bending" blues harmonica player Aki Kumar--who had once escaped a ticket from a blues-loving traffic cop owing to the box of harmonicas in his car--and 80-year-old Andheri-based music teacher Rustom Karwa, who has not only played the mouth harp for Kamal Haasan's character in 'Ek Duje Ke Liye' among many other Bollywood actors but also seen harmonica players return heartbroken with envelopes bearing Rs 500 from shows that paid the guitar and keyboard players upto Rs 5000. "Since you can't see the instrument," says Karwa, "it's taken for granted." The invisible harmonica has made visible changes in the life of 62-year-old retired engineer Sudesh Shetty. Besides making his Matsyagandha Express journeys to his native town, Mangalore, less lonely affairs, it has recently "elevated" his image in his locality. Hearing melodies such as 'Waqt's' "Aage bhi jaane na tu.." emanating from his smoker's lungs as he performs in his balcony--a ten-minute daily lockdown ritual since March 2020--seems to have softened the moustachioed retiree's rough reputation as "an angry man who probably owns a bar like any other Shetty". "Is that a revolver?" a friend had asked him recently on seeing what looked like a gun lying amid the collection of 50 harmonicas in Shetty's WhatsApp display picture. The clarification that ensued about the gun-shaped harmonica has imbued Shetty's retired life with purpose: a first-of-its-kind homegrown harmonica manufacturing company which he's nurturing with five mouth-organists his age. "It's our way of giving back," he says. To impress this jolly group, you must drop the name 'Trossingen'--the small town in Germany which houses Hohner, the largest harmonica manufacturing company. Almost every mouth organist from Kasad to teenager Rohan Singhal has performed in Trossingen or dreams of going there. While Singhal, an award-winning player of the diatonic harmonica--a trickier instrument to master than the slider-sporting chromatic harmonica--is busy fine-tuning his talent through video-exchange lessons from Grammy-award winning musician Harvard Levy, software engineer-turned-blues artist Kumar is looking forward to virtually reuniting with the players of MOM, a club that gave him a lifetime achievement award some years ago. Like Kumar, who used to suffer from asthma and bronchitis as a child, many players in the group thank the instrument for their increased lung power. Which begs a beautiful question from Kasad's beautiful lips: "Instead of blowing into three different tubes (spirometers) after recovering from Covid, why don't people blow into mouth organs?"||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-starved-of-jam-sessions-mouth-organists-to-host-unique-virtual-meet/articleshow/82869578.cms||Sharmila Ganesan Ram
---||Kochi||Kerala: Young volunteers of Velur create Covid dashboard||KOCHI: A group of young volunteers working for an anti-substance abuse NGO in Velur in Thrissur district used their professional qualifications to build a user-friendly Covid dashboard for their panchayat. Caught in a lockdown for several days now, before it moved into a triple lockdown, these youngsters decided to make a portal which is mobile-friendly and packed with information for any local resident of the panchayat. With 17 wards, Velur in Kunnamkulam taluk has been seeing a rising number of Covid-positive cases which forced the authorities to lock down the panchayat to control the rising numbers. The NGO, Gramya Samskriti Velur, shortened to Grasway, works to address addiction among youth. “We found that there is a need to network the information as most people didn’t have numbers of rapid response teams, ward members, helplines, taxi drivers, ASHA workers, etc. Everybody had one or two contacts. Also, there were a lot of rumours doing rounds about the number of Covid cases, deaths, etc,” said Manuraj Rajamanikandan, an IT professional who built the website (https://www.grasway.org/covid-focus). Manuraj who works with Cognizant technologies and volunteers with Grasway said that the GoK dashboard had fascinated him to plan one for his panchayat. After the launch of the portal, there’s been an overwhelming response. Now they have been getting calls from other panchayats asking to develop the same for them too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/young-volunteers-of-velur-create-covid-dashboard/articleshow/82866407.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

With state administration relaxing the curbs imposed during the second wave of Covid infections, social distancing norms and crowd control measures conveniently went for a toss. A huge crowd of labourers looking for work gathered at the labour market in Thakkar Bapanagar area of the city. Bhadra Plaza on the other hand saw swelling crowds; whereas the vegetable market and clothing markets at Ratanpol area of the city too were seen with people maintaining no social distancing, many improperly or not wearing masks at all. Relief Road was jam-packed with vehicular traffic, while in western Ahmedabad, in sharp contrast, shops and commercial streets bore a deserted look. Shops across CG Road, Anandnagar Road bore a deserted look with barely a soul in sight. “Footfalls are barely there as markets resumed operations. People are scared and extremely apprehensive of contracting infection and therefore, are not stepping out of their homes easily,” said Dilip Patel, a retailer on Anandnagar Road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/markets-open-to-public-social-distancing-goes-for-a-toss/articleshow/82867815.cms||---

But the Navy rescued us and we are on the way to Mumbai. Don’t worry anymore. I will explain everything when I reach home.” These were the words of Tiju Sebastian (31), one of the survivors of the ONGC barge accident off Mumbai coast, when he phoned his family in Kochi immediately after he was rescued from the cyclone-ravaged Arabian Sea where he battled huge waves in pitch darkness for more than 10 hours to stay afloat and survive. Tiju, son of Sebastian of Bhaskaran Colony in Irumbanam, was a safety officer on board the ONGC barge P 305 that sank in the cyclone fury, killing 51 persons on Monday. Though he left the hospital in Mumbai and reached his house in Kochi on Saturday noon, he is yet to recover from the trauma. When he recounted his miraculous escape to his family members, they could not hold their tears and thanked God for saving him. “When he said it was like in the “Titanic”, a movie he watched countless times, during his phone call, we did not bother about it much as we were so relieved to know that he was safe. But when he told us what he went through and how he escaped death multiple times in the sea, we understood the real magnitude of it,” said Tincy, his sister. Aleesha Swarna, Tiju’s wife, received the last message from him hours before the barge went adrift in the cyclone. Though Tiju, in his last call, assured that he was safe, the family was tense as they received the news about several barges having been affected by the cyclone. And when they confirmed that Tiju’s barge sank, they had tried all possible ways to reach him but in vain. “He was so sure the barge would be safe as it was heavy and had eight anchors. But when they received the reports that the anchors had given away one after the other, they felt like as if their countdown has begun. He clung onto the barge as it went adrift, hit a platform and started to sink. Though others were jumping off from the ship he didn’t lose the grip until he realized there was no other option. He jumped into the freezing waters and managed to stay afloat with the life-jacket. The waves swept him away and took him into the ocean depths but somehow he managed to come up again. He said he could see bodies of his friends floating around though saltwater had begun to burn his eyes,” said Tincy. Tiju told them that while floating in the sea he never thought he would see his family again. “He is physically stable now but is still in shock. He has to stay in quarantine as his Covid test result is yet to come,” Tincy said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/it-was-like-in-titanic-recounts-survivor/articleshow/82866427.cms||---
---||Delhi||With 7 biodiversity parks, Delhi records revival of its ecosystem||NEW DELHI: Built around two ecological systems in the capital — the Yamuna floodplain and the rocky Aravalli landscape — Delhi’s seven biodiversity parks have been crucial in reviving native flora species. Besides, fauna that had either reduced in numbers or had disappeared from the Ridge completely has also returned. On the International Day for Biodiversity on Saturday, this importance of the seven Delhi Development Authority parks to the environment was recalled and emphasised. The biodiversity parks organised a webinar to observe International Day of Biodiversity on Saturday. Among the participants were Dr Rajeev Tiwari, DDA principal commissioner, and Dr T Rabikumar from the forest department of Jammu & Kashmir government. The two oldest biodiversity parks — Yamuna Biodiversity Park (YBP) in Wazirabad, which opened in 2002, and Aravalli Biodiversity Park (ABP) in Vasant Kunj, opened in 2005 — have now seen more than a decade of revival. YBP currently has 915 terrestrial plants compared with 90 species in 2002, while there has been an increase of 166 bird species and 18 of mammals. Similarly, ABP now has 950 plant species against 150 when work began there, while 167 bird species and 16 mammal species have made the park their new home over the years. Dr Faiyaz Khudsar, scientist-in-charge, YBP, pointed out that sightings of Seibold’s water snake, last sighted in Delhi in the 1940s, or the regular nesting of the black-crowned night heron, which is not found in other parts of the capital, are good indications of the return of fauna, mainly due to restoration of native flora. “Over time, the reintroduction of native species and the development of mini ecosystems led to the creation of predator-prey base,” said Khudsar. In 2016, YBP attracted a top carnivore: the leopard. Meanwhile, at ABP, the India pitta was sighted after 70 years, the pied hornbill after 40 years and the black eagle after 90 years. “The leopard gecko, the striped blue crow butterfly and the spot swordtail butterfly are all rare sightings made at the park after the area was restored,” said M Shah Hussain, scientist-in-charge, ABP. The other five biodiversity parks in Delhi are at Neela Hauz, Tilpath Valley, Tughlakabad, Kamla Nehru Ridge and Kalindi in Okhla. While all five parks have been developed only in the last six years, data from these nature hubs show a sharp increase in the flora and fauna count. Professor C R Babu, head of the Centre for Environmental Management of Degraded Ecosystems, observed that over 3,000 native species are now flourishing across the seven biodiversity parks, a healthy restoration of Delhi’s vanishing flora and fauna. “All these species are native to the capital and their evapo-transpiration rate is low, thereby reducing any adverse impact on the groundwater,” added Babu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/with-7-biodiversity-parks-delhi-records-revival-of-its-ecosystem/articleshow/82867854.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

The free residential coaching camp will be run by NGO Lift for Upliftment (LFU) based in Pune and Dr Prakash Amte’s Lok Biradari Prakalp in Bhamragarh taluka of Gadhchiroli district. LFU has a proven track record of coaching tribal students in Melghat for NEET, through their previous collaboration with the tribal welfare department. Formed by a group of young doctors, LFU aims to provide the platform resources to students from marginalized communities for joining medical institutes. Founder-president Dr Atul Dhakne said, “From this August, we will shift our base from Melghat to Bhamragarh. All students will be provided lodging and boarding at Dr Amte’s project campus in Hemalkasa village.” For the August batch, 30 students will be chosen. “The students will come from both Melghat and Gadchiroli. Our selection criteria remains the same, so it’s open for those coming from marginalized communities,” said Dr Dhakne. The teaching format is also going to be unique. Dr Dhakne said, “Every weekend, two doctors or senior medical students will be at Bhamragarh to take physical classes for NEET preparations. From Monday-Friday, we will conduct online classes through a more systematic format.” LFU is in the final stages of completing a special studio in Pune for online teaching. “This studio will have a large screen where students can be seen by the teacher and the feel will be almost like a regular class. Apart from this, we have made a list of teachers who will visit Bhamragarh. So, every minute detail has been thought of already,” said Dr Dhakane. Currently, selection of students is going on and LFU is encouraging academics and aware citizens to provide the information to students who fit this criteria.

---||Rajkot||Gujarat: Cyclone Tauktae pushes mango farmers a quarter century back||RAJKOT: Until last week, 42-year-old mango farmer Vallabh Patoliya, who owns a 23-bigha orchard in Ankolwadi village in Talala of Gir-Somnath district, was counting the golden eggs he had steadfastly been collecting in his basket over 25 years now. The calculations, hinged on the hope of getting another good harvest from his orchard this season irrespective of climate changes and unseasonal rains, included marrying off his daughter Trupti this year, and helping his son Prabhat graduate in science in another two years from Rajkot. But in all this, he had discounted fate, which too, was silently doing its own maths — of throwing the biggest curve ball in the form of Tauktae that left Patoliya’s basket totally ravaged. In a matter of 20-odd minutes, two and a half decade’s of relentless toil was swept clean on that fateful night of the cyclone. “I had 300 mango trees, each 20 years old, standing on my farm. High winds at 150 kmph speed uprooted half of them in front of my eyes. I was in my orchard when the storm struck and my life’s dreams too got uprooted with my trees,” standing amid the ruins, Patoliya told TOI. “I started planting mango trees 20 years ago soon after I had passed my Class XII exams. I had decided to grow Kesar mangoes in my orchard, an investment that I had thought would would pay me off in later years. Today, I feel as if the cyclone set my clock 25 years back,” said the farmer while his moist eyes scanned the barren vastness that lay yawning in front of him. He’s not the only one. Kesar mango farms across the Kathiawar peninsula, especially from Mahuva to Madhavpur, display the cyclone’s destructive trail. Farmers rue that hundreds of orchards have been swept away, and the trees that Tauktae could not destroy have been rendered useless as their branches are no longer able to provide flowering. The worst affected Kesar mango farms are from Bhavnagar’s Ghogha, Mahuva, Rajula, Jafarabad, Una, Gir-Gadhada, Talala, and Kodinar among other coastal areas of Saurashtra. Patoliya said that that saplings cost around Rs 1,000 a piece, while the cost of nurturing these to full grown trees is around Rs 800 annually per plant. “I have adopted an organic farm with no pesticides. It takes years to grow a quality mango orchard. Each fully grown tree was giving Rs 5,000 return every year. Two and a half decades later, today I can’t think what I will do next,” Patoliya said. The pain for the mango farmers does not end with uprooted dreams. Removing the waste is also posing as a serious issue as this would cost them more than Rs 800 per fallen tree. “Earlier, we used to earn Rs 1,500 for 50 kg of dead wood. But now, dead wood are lying across farms. Who would pay us for it?’’ a farmer asked. Sosiya village of Talaja taluka of Bhavnagar, lying adjacent to Alang ship-breaking yard, is known for its Kesar mangoes. Today, its lush-green mango orchards have, however, all gone with the wind. Bhagvatsinh Gohil, farmer from Soliya village told TOI, “Trees as old as 35 years fell to the ground due to the high velocity winds. Mango farmers too will not be able to stand on their feet for the next 10 years from this irreparable catastrophic loss. Over 100 mango trees got uprooted in my farm which were more than 20 years old.’’||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/mango-farmers-blown-a-quarter-century-back-this-cyclone/articleshow/82866533.cms||Vijaysinh Parmar

The Vaishnav Innerfaith Pushtimargiya Organization (VIPO), a spiritual organisation, has distributed nearly 1,300 oxygen concentrators in small and big towns of Gujarat apart from small towns of other states which are struggling to meet oxygen demand for Covid-19 patients. Within Vadodara, nearly 150 oxygen concentrators have been gifted to hospitals including state-run SSG Hospital. “Currently, with the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic, VIPO Global has been actively supporting its affected citizens with oxygen concentrators in collaboration with several organizations in the United States and Canada,” said an office-bearer of the organization. Over 3,312 units of oxygen concentrators have been distributed across the country including rural towns and villages, government hospitals, non-governmental organizations and individuals who are home quarantined, are of five litres capacity. “We have also provided 10-litre oxygen concentrators to help rural areas of Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh. Besides oxygen concentrators, we have decided to provide much needed medical supplies such as hand gloves, PPE kits, disposable masks, face shields, sterile gowns, thermometers and nasal cannulas to the rural hospitals which lack these basic supplies,” said the office-bearer. Inspired by Shashthpithadishwar Dwarkeshlalji Maharaj, spiritual head of Kalyanrayji temple, Vadodara, VIPO Global is also planning to build an oxygen plant with a capacity to produce 1,000 litres of oxygen per day especially for rural areas around Vadodara. During the pandemic, VIPO Global has also been involved in encouraging citizens for Covid-19 vaccination conducting multiple vaccination drives, providing needy families with basic groceries for one month, ventilator donation and providing medications and other medical equipment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/nri-donors-gift-3300-oxygen-concentrators-to-small-big-towns/articleshow/82863241.cms||---

Speaking to reporters here, Narayan said, “The state government is very selective in providing vaccines to constituencies ruled by the BJP. The government is allotting more vaccines to the assembly constituencies ruled by the JMM, even if the requirement there is low, but the vaccine allotment to the BJP-dominated pockets has been deliberately reduced.” He added that after Ranchi, Bokaro has the highest number of registrations for vaccination but only a few doses have been allocated to the district. “Bokaro is one of the five most populated districts of Jharkhand. This is an injustice to the people here,” he said. He also pointed that the basis of vaccine allocation is beyond comprehension as many districts with half the population of Bokaro have been allocated more number of doses. “Why the discrimination against the people of Bokaro? Residents here are actively participating in the vaccination campaign run by the government but there is a shortage of doses, which is creating panic among the beneficiaries. This will only weaken the campaign,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bjp-mla-accuses-cm-of-discrimination-in-vax-distribution/articleshow/82865890.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Guru Gobind Singh Public School in Kamre said any child facing financial problems in education because of the sudden demise of either of his or her parents due to Covid-19 will be provided free education for Class XI. The school said that the last few months have been very difficult because of the second wave of the pandemic. It said, “Apart from prayers for the affected families, the school management has decided to go a step further to help needy students in their studies.” School official Gopal Nandan Pathak said, “The application will be scrutinised by the principal before taking a decision.” Tender Heart School said that it will provide free education for such students of both Classes XI and XII. Meanwhile, DAV Kapildeo appealed parents and alumni to register as Covid warriors and floated a link on its website. “Those who are vaccinated could provide oxygen cylinders or food at the doorsteps of the Covid-19 patients. They could also check the well-being of people who are struggling with the disease alone,” an official of the school said. The official added, “So far 30 people have registered themselves on the portal. Our principal M K Sinha has undertaken this campaign to promote social cohesion.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/pvt-schools-to-give-free-edu-to-covid-orphans/articleshow/82866084.cms||Sanjay Sahay

Police suspect it to be of the workers of the barge P-305 that sank off the Mumbai coast during cyclone Tauktae early this week. A couple of bodies had life jackets on them, said police. The bodies have started decomposing and it was difficult to do the identification, said police. The bodies have been sent for postmortem and based on the report, police will carry out further investigation. According to police, two bodies were found on the sea coast near Dungri village while three were found at Tithal beach near Valsad. Locals alerted police about the bodies after which police launched a search in the area to check if more bodies had washed ashore. “Till now five bodies have been found and we have started patrolling along Valsad coast to check if other bodies have washed ashore. We have also alerted the fishermen watch group to report any sighting of any body on shore or in sea,” Valsad superintendent of police, Rajdeepsinh Zala told TOI. “From the uniform and life jacket it appears like the bodies are of workers who were on the barge that sank near Mumbai. Only after investigation, we can confirm it,” said Zala. However, no identification details were found on the bodies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/five-bodies-found-on-valsad-shores-may-be-of-mumbai-workers/articleshow/82865242.cms||---
---||Ranchi||16 stranded workers return from Nepal, 26 in Karnataka seek help||DUMKA: Even as 26 workers stranded in Nepal are on their way back to the district with the state government’s help, 16 other migrant labourers, stranded in Karnataka, have contacted the Dumka district administration seeking its help for their return. Deputy commissioner Rajeshwari B said all 16 workers hailed from Masaliya block of the district. Two days ago, 26 labourers, who were stranded in Nepal, had uploaded a video on social media requesting the district administration to facilitate their return as neither their employer nor the Nepal government is helping them. The state government promptly responded and after coordinating with authorities concerned, sent a bus to the Nepal border to bring them back. They are now on their return journey. Sources said five of them are infected. In the latest incident, the 16 workers said they are stuck in Karnataka and were working for a private company named G K Coding since February. They were engaged in pipeline laying work in Chitradurga district of the southern state. Sources said a labourer identified as Sanjay Murmu somehow managed to directly contact Rajeshwari for help saying they are battling there without proper food and help and that they want to return. The DC said, “I have contacted my counterpart of the Karnataka district Kavitha S Mannikeri on Saturday. She has assured to provide all necessary relief to the labourers currently staying in Kundadhunta village under Prashantpur panchayat.” Rajeshwari further said her counterpart also assured to provide all help for the stay of the labourers if they want to work there after the completion of the lockdown on May 30. "If they want to return, they will be sent back to Dumka by train or by any other means,” she quoted her counterpart as saying.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/16-stranded-workers-return-from-nepal-26-in-ktaka-seek-help/articleshow/82866022.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey
---||Ranchi||‘Govt doesn’t want CBI probe in OC death case’||Ranchi: Opposition BJP on Saturday charged chief minister Hemant Soren with shying away from a CBI probe in connection with the alleged suicide of Rupa Tirkey, then officer-in-charge of Sahibganj women police station early this month and said it would move the court if needed to ensure justice to the bereaved family. Ruling JMM, however, dismissed the charge and said the government is ready for a probe by any agency if the family members made a formal demand. Addressing a press conference at the party office here, BJP leader Babulal Marandi also accused Soren’s political aide in Sahibganj of engaging in all kinds of “illegal acts” in the Santhal Pargana region and police have remained a mute spectator. It may be noted that Tirkey’s body was found hanging from the ceiling of her house in Sahibganj. Her parents, who are based in Ranchi’s Mandar block, have termed it as murder and named three persons, including Pankaj Mishra, the CM’s political aide in Sahibganj, as the key conspirator. Since the incident, Tirkey’s parents have been demanding a CBI probe even as the district police dubbed it as a case of suicide based on their investigation and held a sub-inspector, Shiv Kumar Kanauja, on charges of abetment to suicide. Supporting the demand of Tirkey’s parents, Marandi said, “Her parents and the entire tribal community have been asking for a CBI probe into the incident but the state government is running away from it. Why is so?” He added that the role of state police has been suspicious from Day 1. “Pankaj Mishra, whose name was included in the complaint filed by Tirkey’s mother was conveniently excluded by the Sahibganj police from the probe. He wasn’t even questioned and the police concluded that it was a suicide. This explains how powerful Mishra is. He is Soren’s local representative. The entire police force in Sahibganj seems to have surrendered before him going by the spate of illegal activities he has been doing, right from sand theft to illegal mining,” Marandi said. The BJP leader further said even a few MLAs of the ruling JMM have been questioning Pankaj’s conduct and illegal activities. “During the budget session early this year, JMM MLA Lobin Hembrom had staged protests both inside and outside the assembly to draw government’s attention against illegal mining in Santhal accusing Pankaj Mishra as the key responsible person. Yet, the CM continues to remain silent, which is a testimony of the deep nexus aimed at ruining the natural resources in the tribal heartland,” Marandi said. He added that the party will knock on the doors of the court if a CBI probe is delayed. Responding to the charges, JMM general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharjee said, “The government has already said it is ready to get the probe done with any agency if a formal demand comes from the family. The state government is already doing its probe to unearth the truth. Rather than baseless allegations, Babulal ji and his party must focus on questioning the Modi government at the Centre for its step-motherly attitude towards the state and the mishandling of Covid management.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/govt-doesnt-want-cbi-probe-in-oc-death-case/articleshow/82866137.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The case count lowered despite nearly 54,000 new cases which confirmed less than 10% test positivity rate (TPR) of Vidarbha region for the 3rd consecutive day. Health minister Rajesh Tope said that TPR in single digit is going to be the major criteria to lift restrictions imposed in the state more than a month ago. If less than 10% TPR continues for more than 10 days, Vidarbha can get relaxations from the present lockdown-like curbs. All the 11 districts of Vidarbha together reported 8,936 recoveries on Saturday. Now, out of 10,56,492 total cases in the region, 9,78,858 have recovered. The recovery rate is 92.65% which is better than the state average of 92% and national average of 87%. The region reported 135 deaths on Saturday. Urban areas of Vidarbha are already showing good control over Covid-19, but a majority of cases and deaths continued to be reported from rural areas. On Saturday, Nagpur city reported only 7 deaths, Amravati city 4, Akola city 4 and Chandrapur city 4. This means, only 19 out of total 135 deaths came from municipal corporation regions. The remaining 106 deaths came from the rural parts of Vidarbha. The number of under-treatment patients in Vidarbha reduced further to 57,418 on Sunday. This is less than 5.5% of the total cases reported till date. Majority of the patients are recovering under home isolation. Bhandara, Gondi and Gadchiroli districts have less than 2,000 patients under treatment. Only 5 districts of Vidarbha – Nagpur, Amravati, Chandrapur, Akola and Buldhana have more than 5,000 patients under treatment. This has reduced the burden on hospitals and beds are available in most of the districts in Vidarbha now. Akola: Total 4,316 tests were conducted in Akola district on Saturday. Out of these, 525 tested positive. Now, the district has 53,347 cases. With 494 recoveries and 11 deaths reported in a day, Akola’s death toll surpassed the 1000-mark. Akola has 6,626 patients under treatment at present. Buldhana: Out of 4,432 tests conducted in the last 24 hours, Buldhana reported 592 positive cases, taking the total case load of the district to 81,782. With 824 recoveries and deaths, Buldhana’s total toll is 545, while 76,203 patients have recovered. Now, 5034 patients are under treatment. Washim: 312 new cases, 588 recoveries and 14 deaths were reported in Washim on Saturday. This took the total cases to 37,971, including 33,807 recoveries and 407 deaths till date. Total 3,756 patients are under treatment in Washim. Gadchiroli: The toll of Gadchiroli is still a worrisome factor as 13 patients died of Covid-19 on Saturday, taking the total toll of the district to 683. In all, 180 new cases were detected while 257 patients recovered in a day. The district now has 1,842 patients under treatment. Gondia: Total 105 new cases were reported in Gondia while 3 patients died during treatment. The case load has now reached 40,128, recoveries 38,512 and toll of district 662. Gondia became the first district in the second wave to have less than 1,000 under-treatment Covid patients with 954 on Saturday. More than 600 of them are under home isolation. Bhandara: A record low of 62 patients were reported in Bhandara out of 1,534 tests conducted in the last 24 hours. On the other hand, 303 patients recovered while 2 died while undergoing treatment. Now, the district has 57,862 cases, 55,667 recoveries, 1,040 deaths and 1,155 patients under treatment. Amravati: The district on Saturday reported 772 new cases but deaths were 20.

---||Chandigarh||Shiromani Akali Dal: Buy Rs 10,000 drug to treat black fungus||BATHINDA: Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Saturday said it was unfortunate that despite appeals to him, chief minister Amarinder Singh had done nothing to regulate treatment in private hospitals or impose a cap on the cost of tests by private laboratories. He asked the government to immediately announce free treatment for all Covid patients in government hospitals. Sukhbir made the statement after inaugurating a 25-bedded Covid care centre equipped with concentrators at Guru Nanak College, Budhlada in Mansa district, on Saturday. The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) has set up the facility. Badal asked the Congress government to purchase injections needed to counter the black fungus disease in bulk, on the same pattern as other state governments. “It can be tackled with injections which cost Rs 10,000 per dose every day. It is because of this that the disease is not being treated,” he said. tnnSGPC president Jagir Kaur said the centre was extending Level 1 and 2. It was announced that Covid vaccines worth Rs 53 lakh had reached SGPC’s Guru Ram Das Medical College and that a vaccination drive would be started shortly. Sukhbir said private hospitals continued to fleece patients. “I request the CM to declare the pandemic a calamity and provide free treatment to people to control the further spread of the disease,” Sukhbir said, adding that Congress MLAs needed to make a similar demand in the interest of humanity. Earlier, Sukhbir launched an oxygen sewa and langar sewa initiated by Bathinda MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal at Mansa. Sukhbir said oxygen concentrators would be provided free of cost to patients at their doorstep.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sad-buy-rs-10k-drug-to-treat-black-fungus/articleshow/82872645.cms||---
---||India||No jabs in Telangana outside Greater Hyderabad since May 15||HYDERABAD: Over the last eight days, Telangana — the state with the maximum vaccine makers in the country — has administered just over 12,300 vaccine doses, an average of about 1,540 a day. And even the little that has been done has been confined to districts that are part of the Greater Hyderabad Munipal Corporation (GHMC) region. Since May 15, Hyderabad, Rangareddy, Medchal and Sangareddy are the only districts of the 33 listed on the CoWin platform to have done any vaccination at all. And of these, Sangareddy administered doses only on Saturday and Hyderabad did none on Friday. Over these eight days, Telangana’s level of vaccination has been more or less on par with Ladakh and much lower than what Goa, a much smaller state, has been doing in just two days. Officials told TOI that with vaccine supply severely restricted, they have no choice but to stop the inoculations, even for those who need to take their second shot. In fact, Telangana has not even started inoculating those in the 18-44 category. Sources said that the state may add more districts soon as it received one lakh Covishield doses on Thursday. This would take its overall stock to 5.2 lakh doses, including Covaxin as well. “We are keen to see that the maximum number of people are vaccinated,” a senior official told TOI. “But without enough doses, there is not much that we can do.” During a video-conference with Union health minister Harsh Vardhan, Telangana minister Harish Rao had asked the Centre to allocate 13 lakh Covid-19 vaccines by the end of this month to meet the state’s requirements. He said of the 13 lakh, 10 lakh Covishield and 3 lakh Covaxin vaccines were required. In all, 1.3 crore vaccine doses were needed to vaccinate 33 lakh people with second dose and 96 lakh people with the first dose and cover all those aged above 45 years. Experts say that vaccination needs to pick up as much as possible to prevent the intensity of infection spreading in coming days. Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) former director Rakesh Misra observed that efforts should be made to complete the vaccination drive for nearly 80% of the population above 18 years by December this year. But wearing a mask is very important even after taking two shots of the vaccine, he observed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-jabs-in-telangana-outside-greater-hyderabad-since-may-15/articleshow/82872663.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Nagpur||Stealthily, tigers roar into Gadchiroli. Their survival depends on protection||In April 2016, a six-day preliminary survey by Wildlife Trust of India for tigers in Gadchiroli, which has 76% of dense forests, turned out to be a wild goose chase. However, five years later, the big cats are regaining lost ground in this tribal district of Maharashtra. “Camera trap images show the presence of at least 20 tigers — including 10 cubs with four sub-adults — mostly concentrated in Wadsa, Gadchiroli and Allapalli divisions. It’s a big challenge to protect them,” says Kishor Mankar, conservator of forest (CF), Gadchiroli. Chandrapur CCF NR Praveen, who held additional charge of Gadchiroli for seven months, adds that the number could be “around 25”. “Tigers are thriving as there is no competition in the mixed forest areas of these divisions. The rich forest is 3 times the size of Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR),” he says. Gadchiroli, before its bifurcation from north & south Chandrapur, had the presence of 115 tigers in 1989. In the last three decades, barring sporadic presence in Wadsa, they had disappeared. It was a result of a combination of two things — poaching and poor protection by forest staff wary of Naxal presence. As per the All India Tiger Estimation (AITE)-2018, there are 312 tigers in Maharashtra but an independent estimation (Phase-IV exercise) conducted last year by the forest department with Wildlife Institute of India (WII) pegs the number at 331. However, this doesn’t include the tigers of Gadchiroli. “There were no two opinions about tigers going extinct in Gadchiroli. But the sighting of a young pair of tiger on Armori-Wadsa road on July 17, 2017, was a silver lining. A young male and female (perhaps a mating pair) were sighted on the roadside by bus passengers. This family is growing now,” says ex-DFO Deepak Chondekar, who was posted in Wadsa division then. Dispersing tigers from Tadoba reach Bramhapuri from where they cross Wainganga river to reach Wadsa, which has become a source area now. The surplus population has spread and is settling down in Gadchiroli. “Our first survey in 2011 found indirect tiger evidence in Wadsa and Porla. By 2016-end, tigers had already reached there,” says wildlife conservationist Prafulla Bhamburkar. The increase in numbers after 2016 has been remarkable resulting in man-animal conflict, especially in the last three years. “In 2019, six human deaths were recorded followed by four in 2020 and three in the current year. During the same period, 110 people were injured in attacks. In 2020, a couple of tiger deaths also surprised many who believed there were no tigers in Gadchiroli,” says Mankar. To ensure the presence of tigers in Gadchiroli, the forest department will to have enhance the prey base. “We need to develop meadows and grasslands to enhance the herbivore population. Currently, tigers are dependent on cattle, nilgai and wild boar. Cattle kills increased from 390 in 2019 to 511 in 2020, and it is 56 this year,” says Mankar. “As a first small step, Rs 1 crore has been allocated for implementing the Dr Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Jan Van scheme in four Gadchiroli villages. Of this, 40% will be spent on alternative livelihood and 60% on habitat development. Our proposal was for 25 villages but the sanction was for only four,” says Mankar. Experts called for a long-term master plan for Gadchiroli if both tigers and people need to co-exist. Gadchiroli honorary warden Milind Umre says, “The biggest hurdle is lack of political will. On May 18, when a tendu collector died in a tiger attack in Dibhna, woman Shiv Sena leader Chhaya Kumbhare threatened to blacken the face of forest officials if tigers are not reined in.” There is a need to educate locals and train forest staff on animal calls, scat, pug marks etc. “Former Wadsa deputy conservator Niranjan Vivrekar had evolved a strategy to monitor tigers by displaying yellow flags where its evidence was noticed. This was to stop people from venturing in that area. Locals were also involved in monitoring the tigers. This strategy had worked well,” said Umre. Ex-honorary wildlife warden Uday Patel called for ensuring a safe passage for tigers by strengthening the corridor towards Navegaon-Nagzira Tiger Reserve (NNTR) in Bhandara-Gondia and Indravati (Chhattisgarh) through Pranhita wildlife sanctuary and Kolamarka conservation reserve (both in Gadchiroli). “Kolamarka and Pranhita have not yet been handed over to wildlife. As monitoring of tigers is difficult in Gadchiroli due to its vastness and and fragmented forest patches, collaring of tigers also needs to be taken up to curb conflict,” added Patel. Bhamburkar also wants a “conducive atmosphere created in Gadchiroli” where people are heavily dependent on the forest for a livelihood. “The priority should be to help tribals reduce dependence on the forests which have the potential to accommodate 40% of the state’s tiger population,” he says. The wildlife expert was also disappointed that the “finest mixed-miscellaneous forest patches in Central India” were being handed over to FDCM. “It only converts dense forests into open forests and plants teak. This practice should stop as even local forest-dwellers are suffering by losing mega diversified forest,” says Bhamburkar. Patel has sought an extensive survey on tigers in Gadchiroli. “No estimation has been done here for the last 20 years. Teak-dominated Chaprala sanctuary is dying a natural death and there are no tigers there since 1997, but still areas like Ghot, Lakhamenda, Kolamarka, Patanil, Kunjemarka, Ambezara, Kurmal, Balladam, Parsewada, Modewahi, Loha, enliven high hopes as tigers invariably use them,” he says. WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE * Creation of mini core rounds near perennial streams, waterholes to conserve them from encroachments * Making staff and local villagers more aware * Start jungle safaris in areas which will bring income for locals through tourism * Increasing number of herbivores like sambar and deer * Creation of mama talaos with miscellaneous and fruit trees to provide shade and food for ungulates * Development of meadows and grasslands * Setting up of protection huts in sensitive areas * Stop forest produce collection and grazing in tiger-bearing areas * Stop giving high-quality forest to FDCM||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/stealthily-tigers-roar-into-gadchiroli-their-survival-depends-on-protection/articleshow/82868329.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The corona unlock process will implemented gradually from June 1 with public participation once cases are brought down to zero in the month of May. Chouhan was addressing ministers in charge, officers in charge of Covid in the districts besides all divisional commissioners, inspector generals of police, collectors and superintendents of police through video conference on Saturday. He said that the government wants to make the state Covid-19 free by May 31, he said business cannot be kept under lockdown forever and economic activity must begin. While returning to normalcy, we cannot be complacent and must not allow Covid-19 to get back, he said. Chouhan said that at present Corona infection is on the verge of being controlled in the state. Positivity rate is 4.82% and the state’s recovery rate has gone up to 90.86%. There was a time when all the beds of hospitals were full and there was severe crisis of oxygen and Remdesivir injection. The CM said, “Today, Madhya Pradesh is better placed than before as a result of everyone’s hard work and team spirit.” Chouhan congratulated the entire team for this achievement. The chief minister said he expected several districts in the state to be free of pandemic by this month end and said we have to create an area-specific strategy. The districts with high infection wards and villages will have to be marked as hot spots. Intensive monitoring should be ensured by marking these areas as micro-containment areas. Campaign must continue for intensive testing. Corona infected must be home isolated. Such persons should not mingle with other family members. It is important to follow these guidelines. Chief minister has told the ministers and officers in-charge to ensure microplanning in their respective areas and monitor them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-cm-shivraj-singh-chouhan-hints-at-phased-unlock-from-june-1/articleshow/82872727.cms||---

Saikia was freed near the India-Myanmar border in Nagaland’s Mon district at 7am, officials said. In a statement later, the Ulfa-I chief said, “We are not against genuine talks. In fact, we had initiated one in 2006. But we cannot pave the way forward. This responsibility belongs to the newly elected CM of Assam Dr Himanta Biswa Sarma. He needs to find a way that does not distort Assam’s history and downgrade the pride of Assamese nationality.” Sarma’s first speech after becoming CM had included an appeal to Ulfa(I) for peace talks.

No Covid test was conducted on them, said health officials. The deaths came even as earlier this month, 22 children in the age group of 3-10 years had tested positive for Covid-19 at the same shelter home along with six staff members. At present 36 children are staying at the home. While 22-day-old Rani died on May 15, 20-day-old Kajal succumbed on May 17. Twomonth-old Ansh died on May 20. “We tested other kids living in the shelter home and they were found negative,” Dr Kishore Mathur, in charge of the district hospital’s special newborn care unit, said, adding that that those who died were probably not tested for the virus. Mathura DM Navneet Singh Chahal told TOI that he has marked an inquiry into the matter and action will be taken against those found guilty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/3-babies-die-in-a-week-at-shelter-in-covid-grip/articleshow/82872772.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Vadodara||App will map availability of Covid beds, oxygen and meds||Vadodara: Is locating an ambulance, hospital bed, oxygen cylinder, medicines like remdesivir, vaccination information or mental health treatment proving to be a daunting task for you? Now, a location and interest-based application developed by M S University pass-outs is providing a new Covid chat feature to connect seekers to service providers. The feature consists of a location-based live chat where providers can start a thread and seekers can connect with them personally or group chat with them within radius of 50 km. The feature has been added to the app — Gossip — so that it can solve the huge problem of communication regarding Covid. “Currently, there are many people who are trying to help those in need. But it is not reaching those who are in need. For instance, there are separate portals of individual cities like Vadodara and Mumbai. At the same time, you might post something on social media seeking help for your friend in Mumbai. But those who can help are not connected with you,” said Shubhra Saha, who along with Shyam Sunder has founded the app Gossip. The idea to develop such an app surfaced last year when during lockdown Saha, a native of West Bengal got stuck in Vadodara for nearly three months without any knowledge of what was happening in his neighbourhood. “In Gossip, we have introduced GPS in group chat, a tool through which everybody in your vicinity will get a notification. By this feature, the information that is flowing in unorganised way will reach out to people in organised way,” said Saha, who has passed out from MSU’s Maharaja Ranjitsinh Gaekwad Institute of Design (MRID). Incubated by MSU under mentorship of Dr Akash Pandey, the app is currently in beta version (testing phase). “Currently, there is no indigenously developed well-designed social media platform for the Indian market. At a time, when we are talking of ‘Make in India’, there was a need of a location-based social media app. We developed Gossip as a better version of Twitter,” Saha said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/app-will-map-availability-of-covid-beds-oxygen-and-meds/articleshow/82863254.cms||Prashant Rupera

Besides its regular procurement of mangoes for canning and pickling, Valsad Navsari Jilla Fal Ane Shakbhaji Sahakari Sangh Ltd, popularly known as Gandevi Canning Factory, has purchased 550 metric tonnes of ‘fallen’ mangoes that bore the brunt of the cyclonic winds. “Farmers would have not got anything for the damaged mangoes. This is why we decided to buy these mangoes to help them,” said Dushyant Naik, manager of the factory. While many canning traders in the region are paying a pittance for these fallen mangoes, Naik’s factory will be paying more than double that amount. “In the market, the traders are paying around Rs 150 for 20 kilograms of such mangoes. We will be paying more than the double that amount,” Naik said. In the coming days too, the federation of the cooperative societies will be buying the regular stock, Naik added. The canning factory uses these mangoes for making canned pulp, different kinds of pickles and pastes. “We have 14 cooperative societies and of these, 10 societies are involved in procurement of mangoes,” Naik told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/coops-come-to-mango-farmers-rescue/articleshow/82865147.cms||---

In the past few weeks, the highest fresh stock that the BMC has received has been 70,000 doses. In April, the BMC's daily vaccination count would be over 40,000 on most days. On Saturday, though, the number of beneficiaries stood at 25,510- with a third of them getting the vaccine from the private sector. Eleven private hospitals vaccinated 9,064 people in various age groups on Saturday, though these are vaccines procured directly by the hospitals from the manufacturers and not via the BMC. The BMC drive on Friday and Saturday was meant for people over 45 years of age who had sought prior appointment.

According to the order, private hospitals can now procure medical oxygen cylinders as per their daily requirement. However, they will have to ensure judicious and optimum utilization of the same. Yashpal Garg, nodal officer of oxygen supplies in the city, said the Union government has fixed the daily quota of 20 MT of medical oxygen for the city from M/s INOX Barotiwala. The medical oxygen is being utilised for GMCH-32, GMSH-16 and Sector 48 Covid-19 hospital. The private health care institutions are also being catered to from this quota of oxygen. Additionally, three oxygen generation plants have been commissioned recently in these hospitals. The private health care institutions in the city also require medical oxygen and they are mostly dependent on medical oxygen in cylinders. The oxygen cylinders are used by government hospitals also in ambulances and while shifting patients from one ward to another. Considering the increase in number of beds in Covid-19 wards and ICU and influx of patients, the consumption of oxygen had suddenly increased. To ensure smooth supply of oxygen to all the health care institutions in the city, the administration had out its best effort, added Garg. Garg said efforts put in by the UT administration have resulted in smooth supply of oxygen in the city and with the cooperation of private and government hospitals, the UT administration currently has sufficient oxygen cylinders to cater to the requirement. Accordingly, it has been decided that the quota of oxygen cylinders fixed for private hospitals should be relaxed. “Private hospitals may now procure oxygen cylinders as per their requirement and must ensure judicious and optimum utilization of the oxygen cylinders,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/chandigarh-administration-removes-oxygen-cylinder-quota/articleshow/82872773.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

The Andhra Pradesh government has spent Rs 2,398 crore in bills since June 2019 to provide free healthcare under Aarogyasri. This is in addition to clearing Rs 680 crore in arrears of the previous government. Under YSR Aarogyasri, patients can avail free treatment for as many as 2,434 diseases, including cancer. Around 130 super-speciality hospitals in Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Chennai have also been brought under the Aarogyasri network. Of the 38,763 Covid-19 patients currently being treated at various hospitals, 28,189 people are receiving treatment under Aarogyasri. Andhra Pradesh is the first state to bring the treatment of Covid-19 and black fungus under a health scheme. The state government has also taken up modernisation of government hospitals on a large scale under the Nadu-Nedu programme. As part of this programme, the government is working on 10,032 YSR village clinics, 560 urban health clinics, 1,147 primary health centres, 52 area hospitals and 191 community health centres across the state for infrastructure development. A total of 9,712 doctors, nurses and medical staff have been recruited in the last one year. As many as 16 new medical colleges are being constructed.

A total of 25 professionals from the central and state governments, public sector undertakings (PSUs) and private organisations are part of the programme which was inaugurated on Saturday. Ajay Sawhney, secretary, Union ministry of electronics and information technology (MeitY), was the chief guest.

---||Vijayawada||CM Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy writes to PM, seeks withdrawal of private hospitals from vaccination drive||VIJAYAWADA: Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy on Saturday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, requesting him to withdraw private hospitals from the vaccination drive. The chief minister, in his letter, said that some private hospitals are charging exorbitant fees to administer the vaccine. He further said that monitoring the vaccination drive in such circumstances has become a difficult task for the government. The present policy of the government, the chief minister said, allows private hospitals to procure the vaccine directly from manufacturers. He said the government has granted permission to manufacturers to sell 50 per cent of the production to institutions other than the government. Thus, some hospitals are procuring the vaccine directly from manufacturers, Jagan said. However, he sought to remind the Prime Minister that many states have taken the decision to give the vaccine free of cost to those above the age of 18. The manufacturers were not able to supply the required quantity of vaccine to fulfil this policy, the chief minister said. Pointing out that some states, including Andhra Pradesh, are unable to give the vaccine even to those above the age of 45, the chief minister said giving two doses to beneficiaries has become difficult for state governments due to the shortage of vaccine. Taking advantage of low supplies, the chief minister said some private hospitals were collecting Rs 2,000 to Rs 25,000 for each dose of vaccine. The high price has drawn public criticism, he said. Stating that a vaccine is a public good, the chief minister said the vaccine needed to be given free to people or at least at an affordable price. He added that giving vaccines to private hospitals would disadvantage poorer sections and requested the Prime Minister to dispense with supplying vaccines to private hospitals and instead make the entire stock available to governments. “I am confident that such a decision under your leadership will be widely appreciated and generate immense goodwill in favour of the government and arrest the black marketing of the vaccine,” chief minister Jagan wrote.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/cm-writes-to-pm-seeks-withdrawal-of-pvt-hosps-from-vaccination-drive/articleshow/82865689.cms||Gopi Dara

Addressing reporters through virtual conference, the former chief minister listed out a number of cases filed against opposition leaders. “This government has not even spared a sitting MP of the ruling party, K Raghurama Krishnam Raju, and arrested him on flimsy grounds,” Naidu alleged, taking strong objection to the custodial torture of the MP by the CID. “The government’s political vendetta has been exposed in this case, right from the local court to the Supreme Court,” he added. Naidu also targeted the government for “miserably failing to handle the Covid-19 pandemic”. Instead of targeting his political opponents, the chief minister should focus on providing vaccine, oxygen and beds to Covid patients, he said. On the AP high court cancelling the MPTC and ZPTC elections, the TDP chief said the chief minister is not following the Constitution, which is reflected in the “series of slaps” given by the courts in the last two years.  “The elections were held in the most undemocratic manner, candidates from opposition parties were prevented from filing nominations. The ruling party leaders indulged in violation of norms and model code of conduct on several occasions during the elections,” he alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/tdp-supremo-accuses-govt-of-political-witch-hunt/articleshow/82865766.cms||Gopi Dara

The men in khaki did not even spare medical, electricity staff, both exempted from lockdown curbs, and seized vehicles of food delivery executives, people heading for vaccination shots and those supplying oxygen concentrators. However, police brass claimed they are going after people “misuing lockdown exemptions”. Till last reports came in, police of the three city commissionerates had seized 8,359 vehicles for lockdown violations and registered over 9,000 cases. People delivering food to senior citizens, oxygen concentrators or heading for blood donation were slapped challans of ₹1,000 under Disaster Management Act. After the chief minister’s remarks during a video conference with senior bureaucrats and police brass on Friday about lockdown not being enforced properly, policemen stopped, caned workers of even essential services and seized hundreds of vehicles on Saturday. The CM’s snub had a profound effect that even director-general of police (DGP) M Mahendar Reddy personally supervised the lockdown enforcement at various places in the city and gave instructions to commissioners. Though Hyderabad police commissioner Anjani Kumar had warned law violators on Friday night itself about strict implementation of lockdown, no one expected police to seize vehicles of food delivery executives. At several places, executives of Swiggy and Zomato were caned when they tried to reason with policemen. In one video, which went viral on social media, a youngster wearing a Zomato Tshirt was caned right in front of Cyberabad police chief VC Sajjanar. “Police have stopped us even after we explained to them that we are going to donate blood for Thalessemia patients. They took away my bike key and broke the key chain when we showed them the blood donor card and ID card. They hurled abuses at us and said that they would have thrashed us if there were no CCTV cameras in the area....,” K Balaraju, a donor who was stopped near Langar Houz, said. Medical and health department officials complained to police about their staff being stopped for over an hour despite explaining that they were going for work at Habsiguda and another place in the Old City. However, the Hyderabad police chief said, “There is no question of stopping anyone or anything related to medical and health departments. We are alert and sensitive on this important issue.” At Mehdipatnam, scores of two-wheelers belonging to food delivery executives were seized between 10 am and 2pm. “We observed that some people have been misusing the exemption given to food delivery executives during lockdown. Using old ID cards and wearing T-shirts of food delivery companies, some people were roaming on the streets. Vehicles of such people were seized and cases were booked. We have allowed genuine employees of food delivery companies to travel after verifying their credentials,” Hyderabad police commissioner Anjani Kumar told TOI. “Traffic flow is like a normal day on SP Road. People are coming out with old medical records or lame excuses — attend a marriage, death ceremony or purchase medicines. Some people claim they are returning home from work. We are screening vehicles of potential lockdown violators at HPS, Begumpet, to prevent traffic jam on the main road. Over 500 vehicles have been seized and kept at HPS parking lot,” a Begumpet police station officer said. Earlier in the day, talking to the media, the DGP said: “Ëntry and exit points of all major towns and cities will be closed during lockdown period for normal traffic. Similarly, to control the movement of goods vehicles during lockdown period, traffic police have issued advisory permitting loading and unloading activities only between 9 pm and 8 am.” “All vehicles without permission will be seized and vehicles seized for lockdown rules violation will only be released after the end of lockdown. Shop owners should not allow customers after 9:30am and shut their businesses by 10am. Company managements should try and plan their employee work hours in accordance with lockdown timings,” the DGP added. Rachakonda CP Mahesh Bhagwat said that from Sunday onwards, employees going for work should travel between home to work and vice versa between 6am and 9am and 8pm and 10pm. “If any employee travels between 10am and 8pm except those who are exempted, their vehicles will be seized and cases will be booked,” Bhagwat added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/harsher-lockdown-kicks-in-after-telangana-cm-k-chandrasekhar-raos-snub/articleshow/82872815.cms||---

In a letter to Modi, she said the Centre has asked states to declare mucormycosis as an epidemic under the Epidemic Diseases Act, which implies that there must be adequate production of medicines and cost-free patient care. She also noted that there are reports of shortage of Liposomal Amphotericin-B, which is essential to treat this infection. Sonia said the disease is also not covered under Ayushman Bharat and other schemes. “I would request you to kindly take immediate action on this matter to bring relief to the large number of patients being afflicted by mucormycosis,” she wrote.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/let-ayushman-cover-black-fungus-sonia-gandhi/articleshow/82872835.cms||---

N Kotaiah, whose video proclaiming that he was cured and healthy after using the ‘herbal eye drop’ made by Bonigi Anandaiah went viral across social media made thousands of people flock to the seaside village of Krishnapatnam over the last two days, has been diagnosed with chemical conjunctivitis with his eyes covered in infection and pus, hospital sources said. The retired teacher from from Thinnelapudi village in Kota mandal claimed in the video that his condition kept deteriorating despite spending several days and lots of money in a private hospital, but after using Anandaiah’s ‘eye drop’, he recovered within 10 minutes. Another video surfaced on Saturday where Kotaiah, lying on a hospital bed with oxygen support, was seen being questioned by a bystander as to what happened to his claim and why is he on oxygen support. Another woman, who too used the same Krishnapatnam eye drop, has also been admitted in the hospital with the same chemical conjunctivitis. Dr C Prabhakara Reddy, a heart and lungs surgeon from Kurnool currently working with the state Covid command control room, put up a social media post sharing the latest video and lashed out at the audacious claims. “God, who is this sinner? There is severe conjunctivitis infection on both the eyes with pus coming out. On one end there is a woman who doesn’t know anything and the other happens to be a teacher and retired headmaster. His oxygen levels are critical and he is battling for life,” Reddy wrote in the post. “If we show all the tests and prove the efficiency of the vaccine, you would question it and refused to get vaccinated,” the doctor added. Several doctors have also contended with Anandaiah’s ‘miracle eye drops’, stating that the ingredients honey and tailed pepper aren’t something to be put in the eyes and cause infection. “One of the ingredients used in the eye drop was mentioned to be ‘jilledu’ (Calotropis flower). Calotropis seeds or its plant milk is harmful to the eye and could be one of the reasons behind the eye infection,” Dr N Praveen Kumar, a Vijayawada-based ophthalmologist, told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/man-cured-of-covid-after-using-miracle-eye-drop-hospitalised-with-conjunctivitis/articleshow/82865835.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

People living in the vast stretches of forest land in Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam have lost their livelihoods as weekly markets remain closed for weeks. Parts of the state’s forested areas have also seen an uptick in Covid-19 cases. The forest economy is heavily dependent on weekly markets, also known as ‘shandies’, where forest dwellers sell minor forest produce. Weekly markets see people from neighbouring areas gathering in large numbers. Apprehensive of weekly markets turning super-spreader events, the administration has them shut down. Forest shandies are without doubt the go-to place for organic millets, pulses, cashew kernel and other naturally-grown consumables. “But now, there are no customers. The shutdown of hotels and restaurants have also affected our livelihoods,” said K Kamesh, a farmer from Pedabayalu in Visakhapatnam Agency. Kamesh recalled how his produce rotted on farms during the lockdown last year. For P Lakshmi, the weekly shandies are not just a place to buy and sell. “The weekly market was the place where we met our friends and family. It became a sort of social gathering. We miss the shandies,” Lakshmi told TOI. Initially, Covid-19 was slow to spread to the Agency areas. The 11 mandals of Visakhapatnam Agency remained free of the disease till the first week of June last year. However, the second wave has spread to tribal areas quickly. A significant number of people have tested positive from these areas and some have died.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/pandemic-takes-toll-on-forest-economy/articleshow/82865936.cms||Nalla.Babu

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: V D Satheesan is opposition leader, ends Congress's Chandy-Chennithala era||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: After days of dithering following the rout in the recent assembly polls, the grand old party finally decided to heed the sentiments of its rank and file for leadership change, with the AICC on Saturday announcing the appointment of V D Satheesan as leader of the opposition. He replaces Ramesh Chennithala. Though Chennithala and veteran Oommen Chandy lobbied hard to maintain the status quo, Rahul Gandhi's intervention tilted the scales in favour of Satheesan, a threetime MLA and one of the most articulate and accessible faces of the Congress party but, most importantly, someone not too closely identified with any of the 'groups' whose chronic factionalism is one of the reasons for the party's drubbing at the polls. Soon after his appointment, Satheesan vowed to rejuvenate his party and UDF and to take everybody along. Got support from both ‘I’ & ‘A’ groupsNotably, he also said for the record that he would support the LDF government in the Covid fight and also oppose communalism of, both, the majority and minority kind. Satheesan’s appointment has evoked considerable enthusiasm within his party, while major UDF constituents like the Muslim League have wholeheartedly welcomed his elevation. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan too commended Satheesan. “He has a good track record as an able parliamentarian. Given his performance in the Assembly all these years, Satheesan is likely to emerge as an excellent leader of opposition,” the CM said. The AICC committee headed by Mallikarjuna Kharge who had personally met MLAs, MPs and other leaders of the party had submitted a report to the party high command which said the leaders in the state have demanded a leadership change. In the Congress parliamentary party, Satheesan managed to upset group equations and garner support from both ‘I’ and ‘A’ groups, which made his choice easier for the party high command. Satheesan also got the support of most senior leaders from the party. Both Chennithala and Chandy lobbied intensively with the national leadership to prevent Satheesan from becoming opposition leader. They were even ready to find a third alternative if the AICC was firm on changing the opposition leader. Chandy had sought Chennithala’s continuation as opposition leader, since he wanted to replace Mullappally Ramachandran with his trusted lieutenant K C Joseph as KPCC president. Chennithala is reportedly unhappy over his unceremonious exit. He has communicated to leaders close to him that had the high command alerted him in advance, he would have quit on his own.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/kerala-satheesan-is-opposition-leader-ends-congresss-chandy-chennithala-era/articleshow/82872868.cms||Rajiv G

---||Delhi||Ex-powerlifting champ feeds thousands in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Gaurav Sharma has many avatars. Former international champion in powerlifting, national-level shooter and, away from sports, mahant at a temple in Chandni Chowk. His latest turn, and perhaps the most welcome one in circumstances created by the pandemic, is that of a social worker. For the past 12 days, Sharma (in pic) has been preparing and distributing food to over a thousand people every day, sparing no efforts to reach out to the hapless citizens, including the inmates in a blind school in south Delhi’s Mehrauli and an old age home in Sangam Vihar. ‘This time, almost nobody was giving food’Explaining why he decided to take up the task of feeding the hungry, Sharma said, “Last year, during the lockdown, many NGOs and social organisations stepped forward to help the daily wagers, rickshaw pullers, etc. This year, I noticed barely anyone providing food to them. It might be probably due to the risk of infection because Covid has been far more virulent this year.” Sharma was pained to see a huge crowd of hungry people gathering outside the Hanuman temple at Chandni Chowk and waiting for hours for some food or prasad to be distributed. “No devotees were coming to the temple because of the lockdown, but these desperate people still hoped to get something to eat,” said Sharma, whose family has been associated with the Cycle Market temple for 11 generations. “When this continued for some time, it persuaded me to start preparing meals with whatever resources I had.” The sportsman-cum-temple figure is thankful that others extended a helping hand after a few days, contributing funds and food items. His team was able to cook enough food to distribute to the unfed people first in central Delhi, and later in east and south Delhi. Sharma was also able to distribute ration kits to several families. “Over a thousand people come to the mandir now and we have barely left after that to distribute in other parts of Delhi,” said the do-gooder. “For their safety’s sake, we are now also giving the people masks and hand sanitisers. Friends Yogesh (who uses only a first name) and Rajiv Gupta, both residents of Mehrauli, have assisted Sharma from the outset. “After their suggestion and the help offered by NGO Rasoi on Wheels Foundation, we started distributing thalis three times a day at the Progress Trust for the Blind in Mehrauli and Shanti Sahyog Old Age Home in Sangam Vihar. We plan to continue with this even after the lockdown,” the powerlifter said. He urged sportsmen and other celebrities to contribute for the cause and help the jobless poor who are stuck in the city for lack of money to return to their villages and are barely surviving. Sharma won two gold medals at the 2016 World Powerlifting Championships in England. His family has looked after the Hanuman Mandir for 11 generations, but he took up the challenge of becoming a weightlifter. He turned to powerlifting under the guidance of Dronacharya Award-winning coach Bhupendra Dhawan and won laurels for the country. He has now turned to shooting and participates in the double trap event.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ex-powerlifting-champ-feeds-thousands-in-delhi/articleshow/82872897.cms||Vibha Sharma

The MHA move came days after the Centre provided X-category security to 61 of 75 BJP MLAs (Nisith Pramanik and Jagannath Sarkar resigned as MLAs) in Bengal. The new arrangement came in view of the on-going post-poll confrontation and violence across many districts. The security cover to the TMC MPs may hasten Trinamool’s bid to report to the Lok Sabha Speaker against three MPs — Sisir, Dibyendu and Sanat Mandal — calling his attention to the defectors. The East Midnapore TMC unit has written to the party brass against Sisir’s “anti-party role” in the polls and urged for appropriate action. It has also complained against Dibyendu’s “inaction” during elections. The tension between Trinamool and the Adhikari family escalated further after Suvendu was chosen opposition leader in the assembly.  BJP brass announced security for all BJP MLAs from Bengal fearing attacks on th-em. “They were asked to apply for security. Around 12-14 MLAs, namely Shankar Gh-osh from Siliguri, Sikha Chatterjee from Dabgram-Fulbari and Anandamoy Burman from Matigara-Naxalbari didn’t apply for security. But MLAs from trouble-torn Cooch Behar, West Burdwan and Midnapore had all applied for security,” said BJP state general secretary Sayantan Basu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mha-provides-y-security-to-suvendus-kin/articleshow/82868159.cms||---

Experts are of the opinion that stricter lockdown, herd immunity, awareness, appropriate Covid-19 behaviour and early medication are the key reasons behind the better results. As per state health department records, Jharkhand’s positivity rate reduced to 4.08% from 13.11% in the last one month. As per data, the positivity rate during April 19-April 25 was 13.11% which increased to 15.85% during April 26-May 2 and then dived to 12.09% during May 3-May9 and 7.09% between May 10 and May 16. The mortality came down as the number of deaths reported between May 12 and May 16 stood at 394 which came down to 281 in the last five days, including 46 deaths on May 21. Talking to TOI, professor of critical care and head, Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences’ (Rims) trauma centre Dr Pradip Bhattacharya said, “The mortality rate is always proportional to the number of admission of critically-ill patients and we have reported a 20% dip in admissions in our ICU. If we talk about deaths at Rims alone, we used to witness 20 deaths on a daily basis till last week which came down to four or five by Thursday.” On being asked what are the possible reasons which reduced the figures, Bhattacharya said, “During the second wave, people became more aware about the virus and got themselves tested which helped them in managing the infection in the initial stage itself and that is a major reason which has contributed in the reduction of critical patients.” Meanwhile, public health expert and professor of preventive and social medicine at Rims, Dr Dewesh Kumar said, “Stricter lockdown and development of herd immunity has played a very important role in the reduction of positivity rate as well as mortality. Currently, there are more than 19,000 people who are asymptomatic and we only have around 5,000 people who are symptomatic which validates it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/mortality-positivity-rates-drop-in-state-experts-say-lockdown-helped/articleshow/82866570.cms||Gaurav Pandey
---||Surat||Surat: Disabled doctor continues to serve people amid pandemic||SURAT: Over the years, Dr Bhacca Dispensary has become a sort of landmark in Shahpore, the historic Parsi community residential area in Surat. Generations of Bhaccas, for whom serving the society always came ahead of making money, have been curing and caring for people from this very clinic. At present the dispensary is manned by a 55-year-old disabled neurosurgeon Dr Sarosh Bhacca, who represents the fourth generation of the family that has dedicated itself to serving the needy. Despite his disability he is doing his duty as a doctor even during the global pandemic. He charges just Rs 20 as consultation a fee, which is waived off for many of those who can’t afford to pay it. Dr Bhacca suffered a major accident while he was studying neurosurgery at Bombay Hospital Institute of Medical Science (BHIMS) in 1997. The accident caused permanent disability and Dr Bhacca was forced to live with the ‘old folks’ posture’. His body remains bent at waist at almost 80 degrees whether he is standing or walking. “As a doctor it is my duty to serve the people. I took over this clinic after my parents passed away. I want to carry forward my family’s legacy of the last four generations, that of curing people,” Bhacca told TOI. He practices as a general practitioner and most of his patients come from families whose many generations have been trusting Bhaccas for medical emergencies. Bhacca’s great grandfather Phirojshaw was a licensed medical practitioner while his grandfather Sarosh was a doctor at KEM Hospital, Mumbai. Bhacca’s father Sam and mother Mehroo too were doctors and devoted their lives towards serving the society. They carried on with their practice till their last breath. Both of them passed away in 2003-04. Bhacca did MBBS and post-graduation in surgery from Government Medical College (GMC), Surat. He went on to study neurosurgery from BHIMS and joined Medical College, Vadodara as a faculty member. “After my parents passed away, I did not want to close my clinic which has been operational for decades. I wanted to carry on the good work of my parents,” he said. Describing his family’s dedication for treating people Bhacca said, “My grandfather once went to treat a patient who was kept in an isolation camp outside the city during plague outbreak. In those days isolation camps were set up far away from the city and suspected patients were simply abandoned there. “Later, my grandfather was arrested for visiting the isolation camp. When he was released by the court, locals took out a procession in his honour and people pulled the buggy in which he was sitting,” Bhacca said going down the memory lane. “My father once said that ‘treating people was earlier a service, now it is a profession and it will become industry in future.’ His words have come true today. But I will continue to treat it as service and carry forward my family’s legacy,” Dr Bhacca said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/disabled-doctor-continues-to-serve-people-amid-pandemic/articleshow/82865139.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

Talking to TOI, deputy commissioner Ramesh Gholap said, “In the initial phase, 50 oxygen-supported beds at the sadar hospital will be converted into a children’s ward. A meeting with doctors and officials in this regard has been done. A special paediatric task force has been formed and order has been given to procure medicines and other necessary equipment in sufficient numbers for the paediatric centre.” He said that reputed paediatricians of the district have been consulted for their advice and support. Gholap said, “The facility will also include Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) and paramedical staff will be identified and trained for the purpose. The paediatric centre will be child-friendly in all terms with paintings and decorations. We have also planned to keep arrangements of games in the ward on the model of Building as Learning Aid (BaLA).” Civil surgeon Dr A B Prasad said doctors and medical staff are prepared to tackle the situation. He said, “Three types of paediatric wards will be made as per the age group of children. One for 0- 28 days, 1 year -10 years and 10 years to 18 years. Two private nursing homes in the district have also been asked to arrange beds.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/koderma-gears-up-to-tackle-3rd-wave-to-have-special-o2-beds-for-kids/articleshow/82866456.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Horror stories pour out of small clinics with poor infrastructure||KOLKATA: Horror stories are tumbling out of small-time nursing homes in the city that had low-key operations prior to the pandemic but have seized upon the bed crisis at major hospitals in the second wave to make a killing. Not only are they admitting patients by the droves in hallways and rooms packed with beds and little else in terms of medical infrastructure, there are reports of gross negligence in patient care. When a doctor recommended hospital admission for Santosh Devi Pansari, 58, due to her high viral load, her son Anup Kumar admitted her to a nursing home in Behala on April18. Little did he know it had gained notoriety for poor patient care and high billing. Coronavirus live updates“I was told the general bed would cost Rs 20,000 a day and ICU Rs 30,000. At the time, I was grateful to get my mother admitted,” he said. But the relief was short-lived as his mother’s condition did not improve and there was no briefing from doctors. The hospital staff did not take Covid precautions, PPEs were rarely used, bedsheets were stained and toilets dirty. “My mother complained about lack of care. Then one day she said something that made me cringe in horror. She said at night she would wake up to screams of patients and gasps from others as the staff switched off oxygen supply. I shuddered because I would see 8-10 dead bodies lined up for disposal almost every day,” recounted Kumar. He paid Rs 2.2 lakh that day and discharged his mother after signing a bond. On May 10, he lodged a complaint against the nursing home with the West Bengal Medical Council. Read AlsoIndia records 2.40 lakh fresh Covid-19 cases, 3,741 fatalitiesIndia on Sunday reported 240,842 new coronavirus infections over the last 24 hours and deaths rose by 3,741. The daily rise in coronavirus cases in the country remained below the 3 lakh-mark for the seventh consecutive day, the Union health ministry said.Sashanka Dey, 55, suffering from shortness of breath, was admitted to a nursing home in Chinar Park, Rajarhat on April 29. On May 2, son Saptarshi received a phone call from the hospital, informing that his father was weak but doing fine and would be discharged the next day. The family paid Rs 80,000 for the bed and Rs 11,000 for medicines. Barely a week later, Sashanka again experienced breathing trouble and was rushed to a hospital in Topsia, which asked for a deposit of Rs1 lakh in cash. He passed away a day later. Doctors said the chest X-ray report at the previous nursing home showed clear signs of lung infection that wasn’t treated. ‘No treatment even after paying exorbitant bills’Manik Lal Mukherjee, 66, developed Covid symptoms days after three others in the family tested positive. He needed hospitalisation but his test report was yet to arrive. When his son Abhishek took him to a nursing home in Behala, they were shocked to find eight Covid bodies dumped outside the hospital. The family then went to the facility in Park Circus, which was charging Rs 45,000 per day for an ICU bed. After four days, Abhishek realised his father was receiving hardly any treatment. On May 9, Manik Lal was shifted to Peerless Hospital and is still on ventilation. Behala resident Paramita Saha lost husband Suhash Guha (42) on May 8 due to lack of treatment even after she spent Rs 2.6 lakh in five days, first admitting him to a Behala nursing home and then to another facility at Park Circus. The Behala nursing home charged her Rs 50,000 a day for an ICU bed. The day after the admission, a hospital staff she knew informed her that the facility had only 30 minutes of oxygen supply and that he was quitting before patients began to die. On reaching the hospital, she found eight bodies lined for disposal. She signed a bond and took her husband home but as his condition deteriorated. He passed away two days later. The hospital charged her Rs 1.6 lakh. TOI tried to contact all the facilities but none took the calls. After receiving numerous such complaints on lack of treatment, negligence, mismanagement and overbilling from kins of patients, the West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission said it has ordered admission be stopped in against three facilities — Apex Clinic Pvt Ltd in Behala, Good Samaritan Hospital in Park Circus, and Ujjivan Hospital in New Town. “We have asked Apex Clinic Pvt Ltd, Good Samaritan Hospital and Ujjivan Hospital in New Town to send us some random bills within 14 hours. We will assess and analyse them. Till then, the three units have been asked not to admit new patients,” said health panel chairman Justice (retd) Ashim Kumar Banerjee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/horror-stories-pour-out-of-small-clinics-with-poor-infra/articleshow/82869446.cms||Sudipto Das
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: All districts hospitals asked to set up paediatric wards for 3rd wave||RANCHI: Fearing the advent of a possible third wave of coronavirus in the coming months, which, according to healthcare experts, is going to affect the children mostly, the state health department has decided to set up paediatrics wards and make other necessary arrangements across all district hospitals on a priority basis. An order in this regard was issued by additional chief secretary (health) Arun Kumar Singh, directing all the 24 DCs and civil surgeons to start making arrangements and install the necessary equipment in order to treat kids at the district and block levels. As per the order, the districts need to make sure that the paediatric wards are located at a safe distance from the Covid ward in the hospital. The wards need be equipped with all the facilities that are required in paediatric care. In order to maintain hygiene among the patients at all times, the wards need to have washrooms in the 5:1 ratio and the authorities concerned have been asked to ensure that they are clean 24/7. As Jharkhand has an acute shortage of healthcare workers, Singh has directed the DCs to start identifying paediatric doctors and others, like para-medical staff, who are well-versed in child care. The DCs have also directed to organize training sessions for such healthcare workers. Besides infrastructural development, the letter also laid stress on building play areas in the hospitals to help the impatient kids remain calm and make them feel at home. The authorities concerned have been asked to use various colours for painting motivational themes along the lines of slogans and cartoon characters like Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Tom and Jerry, Motu Patlu, Chhota Bheem, Doremon and Little Singham, among others. The play area will also have a TV set, soft toys, comic books and story books. Moreover, colourful bedsheets, utensils, mugs, cups and plates will be used for the kids during the entire course of their treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/state-prepares-for-3rd-wave-asks-dists-to-set-up-paediatric-wards-play-areas/articleshow/82866503.cms||---

---||Ranchi||Fewer distress calls from migrants in 2nd wave of Covid pandemic: Jharkhand govt||RANCHI: Although the state government acted promptly in rescuing the 26 stranded labourers from Nepal after receiving information about them two days ago, the number of such distress calls to the state control room has been less this time compared to the time during the first wave and the subsequent national lockdown last year, officials in the state labour department said. Those manning the control room further added that a very small percentage of migrants who are contacting the control room are actually expressing their willingness to return immediately but are looking for other assistances like monetary help. Post outbreak of the second wave early this year, different states went on to announce different forms of lockdown/restrictions in different points in time. Jharkhand first began a partial lockdown (health safety week) on April 22 and gradually extended it with certain curbs. During the current phase of lockdown, which is in force in the state till May 27, government has banned inter and intra-state public buses. In the last one month, the state control room barely received 520 calls from migrant labourers from different places but figures suggested that only about 80 wanted to return. “Many of the callers rued about lack of jobs, earning, food to eat etc and sought help but there was not much demand for immediate arrangement of travelling back to the state. Based on the requirements, we coordinate with respective departments to extend help before closing the calls or escalating the matter,” said an official at the control room. Johnson Topno, head of PHIA foundation, an NGO which is entrusted with running the control room, said the biggest reason behind the trend is lack of blackout ban on movement. “Planes, trains, buses etc have been running, as a result of which, there wasn’t any major connectivity issue. Hence, distress calls for rescue could be less,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/distress-call-from-stranded-migrants-less-this-time-govt/articleshow/82866594.cms||ASRP Mukesh

The UT administration has asked hospitals to submit a written complaint in this regard. The private hospitals include Mukut Hospital at Sector 34, Healing Hospital at Sector 34, Kare Partners Hospital at Sector 19 and Apollo Hospital, Sector 8. During a meeting between the private hospitals and the UT administration on Saturday, the hospitals complained that M/s Super Agencies has over charged them. They claimed that the refilling charges for Dtype oxygen cylinders were fixed at Rs 295 plus 12% GST, but the hospitals were forced to pay between Rs 600 and Rs 800. Surprisingly, despite repeated calls by the UT administration officials, M/s Super agency representatives did not attend the meeting. Yashpal Garg, nodal officer, said, “PCS Jagjit Singh will deal with the complaints and anybody taking undue advantage will not be spared and FIR will be lodged.” APOLLO NO-PATIENT ORDER WITHDRAWN A day after the UT administration advised Apollo Hospital not to take new patients, the administration on Saturday withdrew its order after Apollo Hospital provided all the details. The administration had asked details like number of beds occupied and oxygen cylinders procured and used between April 1 and May 10 from private hospitals. All private hospitals, except Apollo Hospital, did not submit the required details despite repeated reminders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/vendor-charging-more-for-refill-allege-four-hospitals-in-chandigarh/articleshow/82872960.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

---||Kolkata||Sonali’s tweet to Didi: Made a wrong move, take me back||Kolkata: Former Bengal deputy speaker Sonali Guha, who had joined the BJP ahead of the assembly elections after being denied a ticket from Satgachhia, has urged Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee to take her back. Addressing Banerjee, Guha tweeted an unconditional apology in Bengali on Saturday. She wrote: “I became emotional and made the wrong decision to join another party. Like a fish that cannot live without water, I cannot survive without you, Take me back.” The Trinamool brass hasn’t responded to her appeal yet. The former Satgachhia MLA, who was seen seated in the front row at a BJP Mahila Morcha meeting addressed by Union minister Smriti Irani in the run-up to the assembly polls and had ruled out her return to Trinamool even after the results, changed tack only recently. Guha said she didn’t fit into BJP’s scheme of things. “They (the BJP brass) wanted me to make a personal attack on Mamata Banerjee, which I refused,” she said. Guha’s tweet has given momentum to the anticipated “reverse flow” from BJP after the Trinamool scripted a decisive victory in Bengal. Earlier this week, former Basirhat South MLA Dipendu Biswas, who too had left Trinamool after being denied a ticket, ditched the BJP. Former chairman of Cooch Behar Municipality Bhushan Singh, another turncoat, left BJP on the ground that he didn’t want to be a party to its bid to “spread riots” in the district. Singh said: “I am leaving BJP to protest the arrest of Trinamool ministers amid the pandemic. I am not able to cope with a party that wants to spread riots.” BJP’s Cooch Behar president Malati Rava Roy retorted: “Bhushan Singh joined our pa-rty just five days ahead of the elections and has now left the party without (formally) informing us. People know how many times he has switched loyalty. I have nothing to add.” All eyes are now on big names — former minister Rajib Banerjee, former Bidhannagar mayor Sabyasachi Dutta and former Uttarpara MLA Prabir Ghoshal among them. These leaders lost the assembly polls after joining the BJP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/sonalis-tweet-to-didi-made-a-wrong-move-take-me-back/articleshow/82868283.cms||---
---||India||BJP accuses Twitter of bias, wants Centre to take action||NEW DELHI: BJP’s confrontation with Twitter looks set to escalate with party leaders accusing the micro-blogging platform of bias against their party and asking the government to take action against it. Taking exception to Twitter labelling his tweets as well as those posted by his colleagues as “manipulated media”, senior BJP functionary Vinay Sahasrabuddhe said the conduct of the social media giant was biased and has exposed its “selective” approach, and asked the government to look into the issue of whether it is a social media platform or media. “The action taken by the Twitter against us raises questions about the very character of the social media since they had earlier claimed that they are just a platform on which people can freely express their views. If Twitter or, for that matter, Facebook, are just platforms they claim to be then how can they decide the nature of a content?” asked the Rajya Sabha MP, adding that Twitter’s action against BJP shows they consider themselves to be media. “If so, they should be brought under the purview of the editorial policy norms effective on the FDI in the media sector,” he said. Sahasrabuddhe’s attack on Twitter came amid indications that the government is still waiting for a formal reply from Twitter for tagging BJP’s tweets accusing Congress of engineering a campaign against the Modi government when the matter was being investigated by police. With Twitter, unfazed by the IT ministry seeking an explanation from them, going ahead to tag more BJP tweets as “manipulated media”, the saffron ranks were hoping for action against Twitter. Sahasrabuddhe said the government should look into the discrepancy between their claim to be a platform and their actual conduct as a media outlet with discretion to determine and dictate the nature of the content. “We had raised the issue even in the parliamentary panels that it was high time the government reviews the functioning of the social media platforms. I personally think the issue has become more relevant because of their persistent bias and should be looked into,” he said. On Friday, Twitter extended its “manipulated media” label to tweets by five other BJP members, hours after it flagged BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra’s post about an alleged Congress toolkit under the same category. Tweets posted by verified accounts of Sahasrabuddhe, BJP (Mahila Morcha) national social media in-charge Priti Gandhi, Andhra Pradesh co-incharge Sunil Deodhar, BJP media panelist Charu Pragya and Delhi BJP general secretary Kuljeet Singh Chahal were tagged as manipulated. Chahal said the Twitter action is a direct challenge to the law of the land as they have acted as a judge and given a judgement. “My question is who will decide what is right and what is wrong? Government of India or Twitter?” he questioned and asserted that none can supersede authority of the Indian judicial system. On Friday the IT ministry had conveyed its objections to Twitter action, saying, “Such content moderation by Twitter puts a question mark on its status as an ‘intermediary’.” Congress had lodged complaints against several BJP leaders for circulating a four-page “toolkit”. BJP had claimed that the opposition party named the coronavirus variant found in India as the “Modi variant” and attempted to defame Prime Minister Narendra Modi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bjp-accuses-twitter-of-bias-wants-centre-to-take-action/articleshow/82873041.cms||Akhilesh Singh

---||Chennai||Chennai: Irrigation canal turns sewage channel||CHENNAI: An irrigation canal branching off from the Chembarambakkam reservoir is now encroached upon and has turned into a sewage channel, complain residents of Sekkizhar Nagar in Kundrathur. S Muruguraj, one of the oldest residents in the area, said the channel had been carrying water for farming when he bought land in the 1980s, but soon disappeared as urbanisation began, with a couple of houses being built on the water body itself. With farmlands turning into real estate plots, the canal became the first victim as did a 6-ft-wide road running on either side of it, he said. The canal, which was 3km long, was blocked by residents of neighbouring Kollicherry when it became a carrier of sewage that soon began stagnating and affected the groundwater table, he said. A few years ago, the residents requested the panchayat to convert the channel into an underground sewage drain, but the proposal was not be taken up due to political reasons, he said. During the monsoon, he added, rain water mixed with sewage overflowed onto the roads and posed a major health hazard, but there has been no response neither from the civic authorities nor from the PWD, he said. A senior PWD official said encroachment of irrigation canals was not confined to those attached to the Chembarambakkam reservoir. The revenue authorities had to be blamed as they had regularised the encroachments by issuing pattas. Every reservoir had at least four such irrigation canals, which are now encroached, he said. These irrigation canals are naturally formed streams and encroaching upon them will result in flooding during the monsoon. In some areas, the corporation or local panchayat had laid roads on them, blocking the flow of water. Such illegalities had to rectified and the canals revived to help avoid flooding, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-irrigation-canal-turns-sewage-channel/articleshow/82873064.cms||P Oppili
---||India||Covid-19 clotting complication now adds gangrene risk||AHMEDABAD: Experts have noted that gangrene is another burden that Covid-19 is piling onto the load of complications being heaped on patients. So far, several families have been devastated by the deaths of their relatives, caused by heart attack not long after they were discharged from Covid hospitals. Scores of patients have been paralyzed by brain stroke due to prolonged hypercoagulation triggered by the coronavirus. Experts now report that a growing number of people are developing blood clots in the arteries of the hands and feet, which are leading to gangrene. In many instances, the clots were not tackled in time and the patients ended up losing their limbs. Recently, Hirji Luhar, 26, a resident of Bhabhar in Banaskantha in north Gujarat, had to get his left leg amputated after it developed gangrene. “The patient had a two-week history of the Covid infection from which he recovered at home,” said an Ahmedabad-based vascular surgeon Dr Manish Raval. “Soon after, however, he developed a severe pain in the left foot which turned into numbness as if the leg had been paralyzed.” Dr Raval added: “The limb started changing colour and by the time the family consulted us three days later, his leg had developed gangrene. We had to amputate the youth’s leg to save his life.” Dr Raval said that while hyper-coagulation is a known complication of Covid along with hyper-inflammation, a significant number of patients are coming with highly deteriorated thrombosis in the limbs in the second wave. “In a small 10-bed hospital setup, I have seen 40-50 cases of arterial thrombosis in the extremities and some 10 amputations in the past one-and-a-half months,” said Dr Raval. “This rise could be due to an unprecedented surge in Covid this time.” “This rise could be due to an unprecedented surge in Covid this time.” Nearly 80% of the cases come from rural areas, Ahmedabad-based vascular surgeon Dr Manish Raval said. “That could be because medical care in rural parts is compromised as compared to the cities,” Dr Raval said. ‘Key is to get help within 36 hours’In rural areas, tests may not be available to check blood parameters for D-Dimer and CRP indicating hyper-clotting and hyper-inflammation," Ahmedabad-based vascular surgeon Dr Manish Raval At Jivraj Mehta Hospital in Ahmedabad, general surgeon Dr Ashok Gujjar on Saturday had two amputations planned. “In one case, we had to remove the foot from below the thigh of a 50-year-old man from Godhra who had Covid for 20 days,” Dr Gujjar said. “On the seventh day, he developed a rapid progression of thrombosis starting from his foot which spread to the blood vessels of his abdomen. This was an emergency surgery.” In another case, Dr Gujjar said, half a foot of a 55-year-old woman was removed after it developed gangrene. “As she sought surgical help in time, arteries could be cleared and her limb was salvaged,” he said. A leading vascular surgeon, Dr Rajesh Hyderabadi, said more such cases are being reported in the second wave. He explained that when a clot blocks heart vessels, it triggers a heart attack. In the brain, it causes a brain stroke. Similarly, clotting and inflammation in the vessels of hands and legs cause thrombosis in the extremities. “If patients come in time, the clots can be removed surgically and even through an endovascular way,” said Dr Hyderabadi. “However, once the blood supply is cut off, patients need to seek help within 24-36 hours to prevent the onset of gangrene. The key is to spot the symptoms swiftly and seek help.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-induced-clotting-adds-to-gangrene-risk/articleshow/82873099.cms||Radha Sharma
---||Chennai||NCTE postpones start of 4-year integrated teacher education course||CHENNAI: The National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) has put off by a year the plan to start a four year Integrated Teacher Education Programme (ITEP). Tamil Nadu Teacher Education University (TNTEU) is among the institutes that applied to NCTE to start the course from the 2021-22 academic year. The ITEP course seeks to integrate BEd degree with basic BA or BSc degrees that can help students wishing to pursue BEd after their bachelor degree save one year. The NCTE planned to introduce it only in state and central institutions on a pilot basis from the coming academic year. At a recent general body meeting, the NCTE decided to postpone the start of the programme to 2022-23 due to lack of consultation among the stakeholders. The council also approved the proposal to conduct a national level common entrance test for the ITEP course, which will be offered at multi-disciplinary colleges and universities. “In order to maintain uniform standard for teacher education, the admission to pre-service teacher preparation programme shall be through suitable aptitude test. There shall be a National Common Entrance Test to be conducted for a 4-year integrated BEd course by NTA” the council said in its note prepared for the general body. The council gave in principle approval for conducting the common entrance test. “It is not clear whether the students will have an exit option after three years in the proposed integrated programme. The curriculum should be designed in such a way that they would get basic degree even if they want to exit the course in three years and should be allowed to continue the final year at later stage in a different place if they want to,” said professor N Ramakrishnan, head, department of educational technology at TNTEU. He was also chairman of the board of studies for the fouryear integrated BSc BEd programme at the university. “Unlike professional courses like MBBS or BE, BTech, students will not travel to study for a BEd degree. Most prefer to study BEd closer to their native place. So, a national level entrance test is not advisable,” he added. The TNTEU gave permission to start four-year integrated BSc BEd and BA BEd degree programmes to private colleges in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/ncte-postpones-start-of-4-year-integrated-teacher-education-course/articleshow/82873096.cms||A Ragu Raman

The civic body authority has categorically asked the nodal officer that it will be the responsibility of the organisations to make fire safety arrangement at mini Covid-19 care centres. Currently, there are nine such centres in the city. The letter to the nodal officer reads, “Nine mini Covid-19 care centres have been set-up in different parts of the city to provide necessary care, medication and admission to Covid-19 patients. Many centres have arranged oxygen for patients through oxygen cylinders or concentrators and other electrical medical equipment. Therefore, it may also pose a risk of fire due to oxygen rich environment. In order to prevent any untoward incident, an undertaking regarding fire safety shall be obtained from the organisations.” The move comes after the director general (DG) of fire services of ministry of home affairs (MHA) of Government of India issued an order to the municipal corporation, Chandigarh, to carry out an intensive checking of all hospitals and Covid-19 centres across the city. Following the order, the MC has issued directions to the station fire officers to co-ordinate with officers of the Covid-19 centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/fire-safety-is-job-of-covid-centres-municipal-corporation-chandigarh/articleshow/82873095.cms||Deepak Yadav

Frontline workers and priority groups in the the age bracket, however, would be notified soon. As vaccination for the18-44 age bracket was kickstarted again on Saturday — after the drive was suspended on May 14 after three days due to shortage of vaccine — 22,788 people were administered shots. However, the National Health Mission-Karnataka, which oversees immunisation, issued a statement to “provide clarity” on the vaccination plan, citing prevailing confusion among citizens. 1 lakh got jab on SatU nder for 18 the -44 head years “vaccination age group”, the statement signed by mission director Arundhati Chandrasekhar said, “currently not available”. It went on to add that frontline workers/vulnerable group and priority groups, however, “will be informed of date and time of vaccination by the designated nodal officers”. This is the third time in recent weeks that the government has changed its stand on vaccinating those under 44 years of age. On Thursday, health minister K Sudhakar said vaccination for the age group will begin on May 22 and frontline workers along with priority groups will be vaccinated first. The government admitted that Covaxin was not available to be administered as first dose for those above 45. “We are currently not in a position to give it to senior citizens who prefer it,” a health department official said. For those above 45 years and seeking the second dose of Covaxin, the department said an SMS will be sent to the beneficiary and the latter should visit the designated vaccination centre mentioned in it. But the move lacks clarity as several people had registered themselves from others’ mobiles. As for Covishield shots to those aged 45 and above, the first dose is available through online appointments in urban areas and onsite registration in rural areas.

Travellers from the UK will have to spend two weeks in quarantine upon arrival in Germany even if they test negative for the virus, according to the foreign ministry. In addition, transport companies will only be allowed to bring German citizens back into the country. Germany now classifies Britain as a “virus variant area,” the country’s highest risk category, following a recommendation from the Robert Koch Institute, according to the foreign ministry. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she is concerned about the spread of the B1.617.2 variant. “This variant seems to be more aggressive than the British mutation,” she said. “That means we will have to be careful."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/germany-puts-travel-curbs-on-uk-over-its-rising-b1-617-2-cases/articleshow/82873171.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Many house helps may not get aid in Karnataka||BENGALURU: The cash assistance announced by chief minister BS Yediyurappa as part of the Rs 1,112-crore Covid relief package may not cover the entire labour force of the unorganised sector. This is because only 3 lakh out of 2 crore workers have registered with the Karnataka State Unorganised Workers’ Social Security Board so far. Though the government is yet to issue new guidelines for eligibility and identification of beneficiaries for this category, labour commissioner Akram Pasha told STOI that those not registered with the board won’t be considered for the assistance. He added that people would be allowed to register now and claim the benefits. The state will provide a onetime dole of Rs 3,000 each to autorickshaw and taxi drivers, folk artists and construction workers, and Rs 2,000 each to house helps, washermen, ragpickers, porters, low-wage labourers, tailors, barbers and roadside vegetable vendors. House helps, or domestic workers, have been among the hardest-hit members of the unorganised sector. The lockdown, remote work arrangements and fears of contracting the virus have prompted many people to do household chores on their own. Several families have returned to their hometowns, leaving domestic workers with less work and lower wages. According to an estimate, there are 10 lakh domestic workers in the state. Of these, 6 lakh are in Bengaluru alone. According to a government official, only 20,000 housemaids have registered with the social security board so far. “Even then, the government says assistance will be given to 20,000, which is a joke,” said Rajashekhar, a senior member of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU). The chief minister has earmarked Rs 61 crore in the relief package for workers of the unorganised sector. “Going by these numbers, less than 10 per cent of the workers will benefit from the government relief package,” Rajashekar added. SB Ravikumar, joint secretary of the board, claimed that around 80,000 domestic workers had registered. “There is no exact data about housemaids, and different people are making different claims. Whatever is the number, the sum of Rs 2,000 announced by the government is nothing but a mockery. It is like inflicting insult on them,” said Geeta Menon of the Domestic Workers Rights Union. NGOs and organisations working for the welfare of housemaids say the board’s rules are cumbersome and registrations have happened only because of their relentless efforts over the past year. “Disbursal of cash assistance will start in eight to 10 days after getting the orders from the finance department. Around 22 lakh construction workers and over 3 lakh unorganised workers have registered with their respective boards and they will get the relief,” said labour commissioner Akram Pasha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/many-house-helps-may-not-get-aid-in-karnataka/articleshow/82873174.cms||---

---||World||Nepal’s President dissolves House, election in November||KATHMANDU: Nepal’s President dissolved the House of Representatives on Saturday for the second time in five months and announced snap elections in November, rejecting both embattled caretaker Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli and the opposition alliance’s claims to form a government, a move that will be legally challenged yet again. The surprise announcement comes after a presidential statement said neither Oli, nor opposition leader Sher Bahadur Deuba were able to demonstrate a majority to form a new government by the Friday deadline set by President Bidya Devi Bhandari. As per Article 76(7) of the constitution, a date to conduct another election within six months must also be fixed. “The president has ordered the first phase of polls on November 12 and the second phase on November 19,” a presidential statement said. It said the decision was made on the recommendation of the cabinet headed by Oli to dissolve the 275-member House. “It’s been noted that Oli counted those lawmakers as his supporters who extended support to the opposition alliance,” Bhandari said on Friday. The president’s announcement plunged Nepal into further political crisis, a reminder of her December 2020 decision when she first dissolved the House at Oli’s recommendation. The Supreme Court had annulled the move in February. The opposition says Oli, who had lost a vote of confidence this month, has no legal authority to recommend the dissolution of the parliament. Five opposition leaders said in a joint statement the PM had pushed the country into a serious problem at a time when people were suffering and dying due to the pandemic. The president did not follow her constitutional responsibility of appointing a new PM on the basis of the constitutional claim as per Article 76 (5) of the constitution with signatures of majority lawmakers, the joint statement said. “Instead she sided with Oli with malafide intentions and dissolved parliament in an attack on the constitution and democracy,” it said. The opposition condemned the move as “unconstitutional, undemocratic and arbitrary”. The statement was signed by Nepali Congress president Sher Bahadur Deuba, CPN-Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal Prachanda, CPN-UML leader Madhav Kumar Nepal, Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal’s Upendra Yadav and Rastriya Janamorcha’s Durga Paudel. Prakash Sharan Mahat of the opposition Nepali Congress said they’ll launch a political and legal fight against the move. The opposition alliance is devising a strategy to approach the Supreme Court on Sunday demanding to scrap the president’s decision. Nepal’s political crisis took a dramatic turn on Friday as Oli and the opposition parties staked separate claims for the formation of a new government by submitting letters of support from lawmakers to the president. Oli claimed the support of 121 lawmakers from his own party CPN-UML and 32 lawmakers of Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal (JSP-N) for his reappointment as PM. According to the statement from the president’s office, 26 lawmakers of the CPN-UML and12 MPs of the Janata Samajbadi Party had backed both Oli and Deuba. Oli, 69, says fresh polls could end the political confusion of recent months. Election could be held despite the pandemic, he said on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/nepals-president-dissolves-house-election-in-november/articleshow/82873199.cms||---

Seema (name changed) was due to deliver when her husband was hospitalised and her in-laws and five-year-old son had Covid symptoms. Due on April 26, Seema developed labour pain on April 20, the same day her husband had to be hospitalised. While one neighbour took him to hospital, other neighbours rushed her to another hospital where she delivered a baby girl through C-section the same day. While she also tested positive, the newborn was negative. On April 22, she returned home and her Covid-positive in-laws were in hospital and her son was also positive. Her software professional husband said: “We got excellent support from our neighbours when I was hospitalised. When she returned home, a neighbour suggested she stay in his house as they had gone out of station. Our house had five positive patients then.” We are grateful to many for helping us, says familyThe husband said trouble restarted when his wife had to go for a CT scan on April 24. “She left the newborn in a room and her brother was looking after the baby. The entire apartment was concerned and people watched over for the kids,” a family friend said. Neighbours and family friends helped her and her two kids get admitted to Rainbow Children’s Hospital, with the help of paediatrician Dr Manu Chaudhary. “We’re grateful to so many people. Though I was in ICU, I was trying to coordinate and kept in touch with my wife,” he told STOI. Seema’s husband and her in-laws ended up in the same hospital on Kanakapura Road for Covid care. Her in-laws who had taken the first vaccine shot, were spared severe symptoms but required medical care. “My father, who is 84, was feeling very low. It was a tough time, but help poured in from so many quarters,” her husband said. A physiotherapist and family friend, who helped all the patients find beds, said doctors and BBMP officials were very helpful when they heard of the family’s plight. Seema and the two children finally came back home on May 1. Her husband and in-laws recovered and came back on May 3. Neighbours continued to provide food and other essential items, ensuring Seema’s family made it safely through the dark times.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-neighbours-pitch-in-for-covid-positive-family-with-newborn/articleshow/82873201.cms||Sunitha Rao R

The clips, which showed the 56-year-old doctor calling the policy “foolish”, went viral. In his complaint filed at Mangaluru East police station, Kakkilaya said the supermarket owner had illegally and unlawfully circulated CCTV footage of the said incident on Tuesday to social media, which resulted in issuance of several defamatory statements and articles in his name, all over the country and beyond. The “selective” and “illegal leak”, with audio recordings, appears to be a “deliberate attempt to malign me and cause me immense harm”, he said. Over the past three days, two more audio clips have gone viral, which seem to be of recorded telephone calls made by a person identified as Pai to the owner of the supermarket and another of a purported neighbour of the doctor. “Pai is heard illegally instigating the person on the other side of the call to file a false complaint against me and put me behind bars. He has also defamed me and my family and my late father BV Kakkilaya, a freedom fighter...,” Kakkilaya said in the complaint. “He is also heard illegally instigating the supposed shop owner to physically attack me. It is evident from another audio clip that he (store owner) is handin-glove with the person who is said to be a neighbour and both...have been following me and my family, thereby hatching a conspiracy to commit an act of threat, intimidation to my life and my reputation,” Kakkilaya’s complaint read.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/doctor-files-complaint-in-mangaluru-over-clips-of-tiff-in-store/articleshow/82873234.cms||---
---||Lucknow||New milestone: UP conducts 3.06 lakh Covid-19 tests in 24 hours||LUCKNOW: Labs in Uttar Pradesh carried out the highest number of tests — 3,06,548 — in 24 hours on Saturday. The labs in state, on an average, tested 212 samples per minute as the cumulative number of tests conducted in state since the pandemic outbreak last year rose to record 4.64 crore. “In yet another milestone, over 3.06 lakh Covid tests were done yesterday, out of which over 1.30 lakh were by RTPCR method. No other state has done as many tests so far,” said Alok Kumar III, secretary to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. “Acting on CM’s directions, the state health and medical education departments have been working to increase the capacity for testing and the record is an outcome of these efforts. Three new RTPCR testing labs started functioning in Jaunpur, Ballia and Pratapgarh last week and 12 more will be functional soon,” he added. The policy of aggressive testing in the state has brought the positivity rate down to about 1.9% even though the number of tests over the past week has been over 2.85 lakh per day, Kumar said. “In spite of the positivity rate dip, our emphasis is still on augmenting our testing capacity further,” he said. Meanwhile, additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad informed that 6,046 new cases were reported in UP in the past 24 hours. “Compared to the peak of over 38,000 cases on April 24, new cases have gone down by over 84%, even as recoveries continue to rise and the state’s recovery rate has climbed up to 93.2%” he said. “As a result of a drop in new cases and rise in recoveries, the number of active cases has been falling every day in the past three weeks. With 94,482 active cases, which is 69.6% less than the peak of 3.10 lakh on April 30, the pandemic appears to be under control now,” Prasad said. Covid casualties, however, continue to be a cause of worry, since 226 deaths were recorded in the past 24 hours, pushing the toll in the state to 18,978, said officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/new-milestone-up-conducts-3-06-lakh-covid-19-tests-in-24-hours/articleshow/82873225.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||World||Egyptian mediators hold talks to firm up Israel-Hamas truce||GAZA CITY: Egyptian mediators sought to reinforce a day-old ceasefire between Israel and Palestinian militants on Saturday, and aid officials appealed for a period of calm to start tackling a humanitarian crisis in Gaza after 11 days of fighting. The ceasefire, which began before dawn on Friday, was still holding on Saturday evening, enabling officials to start assessing the scale of the damage. Despite confrontations between Israeli police and Palestinian protesters at a Jerusalem holy site on Friday, there were no reports of Hamas rocket launches from Gaza or Israeli air strikes on the Palestinian enclave overnight or on Saturday. Rockets fired by Hamas and other militant groups paralysed towns in Israel during the hostilities, and caused widespread panic, but did much less damage than the bombardment of the Gaza Strip. Palestinian officials put reconstruction costs at tens of millions of dollars in Gaza, where officials said 248 people were killed in the fighting. A senior UN official who toured Gaza City Saturday warned of increased health risks and widespread despair after homes, roads and other vital infrastructure including hospitals were damaged or destroyed. “Everybody just needs to stand down and not to engage in any provocative moves,” Lynn Hastings, UN Humanitarian Coordinator for the Palestinian territories, said. Medics said rocket attacks had killed 13 people in Israel before the ceasefire. After mediating the ceasefire with US support, Egypt sent a delegation to Israel on Friday to discuss ways of firming up the truce, including with aid for Palestinians in Gaza, Hamas officials said. The delegates have since been shuttling between Israel and Gaza, and on Saturday met Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, an aide to the Palestinian leader said. A source familiar with planning said US secretary of state Antony Blinken would visit Israel and the West Bank on Wednesday and Thursday, hoping to build on the ceasefire. Mahmoud, however, has little influence in Gaza, which is ruled by Hamas. President Joe Biden said on Thursday that the US would work with the UN on bringing humanitarian and reconstruction aid to Gaza, with safeguards against funds being used to arm Hamas, which the West deems a terrorist group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/egyptian-mediators-hold-talks-to-firm-up-israel-hamas-truce/articleshow/82873230.cms||---
