Here is how many are coping up with power outrage||Cyclone Tauktae has impacted Goa very badly - with more than three days of no power supply families have opted to stop complaining and make the best of it. IT professional Emily from Curtorim has decided to spend some time with her nephew instead of getting irritated that the power supply hasn't been restored. She says, "I have informed my bosses about my situation here in Goa and it only makes sense that i stay away from the computer for a while. Its been almost 50 hours that the power supply hasn't been restored. Though we are in the pandemic and the phone is so important, it really feels enriching that for once you are not worried about who will message and who will not. I'm glad that I get to play with my nephew." Maria, a college student from Saligao says, "There has been no power supply for a few days now, and its difficult and tough not to be on your phone. The situation is such that I cannot even go out as the cases of COVID is increasing drastically. So I have started playing card games with my family. that is the only way that I could remain sane." Anisha Hassan from Saligao has not been having electricity for a few days now, it gets difficult to contact her staff and COVID positive patients she has been helping with food. "I drive to Panaji and back, so that i can charge my phone."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-power-supply-here-is-how-many-are-coping-up-with-power-outrage/articleshow/82750199.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Cyclone Tauktae: 17 dead and a trail of destruction in Gujarat||RAJKOT/AHMEDABAD: At least 17 people died as cyclone Tauktae ravaged coastal districts of Saurashtra after crashing into the coast near Diu and Una late on Monday night at a speed of nearly 165 kmph. Five deaths were reported in Bhavnagar district alone, while eight other districts including Amreli, Gir-Somnath, Panchamahal accounted for the rest of the casualties. PM Narendra Modi is expected to conduct an aerial survey of worst-hit districts on Wednesday, sources in the state government told TOI. After passing the night holed up inside their houses and shelters, people woke up to the scenes of wreckage all around them as Tauktae left a devastating trail in coastal districts of Gir-Somnath, Junagadh, Amreli and Bhavnagar. There were flattened houses, tin sheds scattered all around, roofs blown away, inundated fields, broken roads, thousands of fallen trees and collapsed electricity poles all along the 200-km coast from Bhavnagar to Junagadh. Hundreds of villages will remain in dark due to heavy damage to transmission infrastructure and electricity poles. CM Vijay Rupani said the situation was expected to return to normal by Wednesday. The Indian Coast Guard also rescued eight fishermen onboard a boat which had drifted into the sea off Veraval harbour, officials said. Tauktae was particularly unsparing on the UT of Diu. Sources said hotels in Diu suffered heavy damages as many glass doors and windows were shattered due to strong winds. Una taluka, just a few kilometres from Diu, has been virtually cut off from the rest of the districts. Gir-Somnath collector Ajay Prakash said the formal communication system has collapsed in Una. In Amreli district, 18 Covid hospitals were on the edge as the cyclone resulted in a massive power outage in over 600 villages. By late afternoon, Tauktae reached Ahmedabad, bringing in heavy rain and gusty winds. Several roads and underpasses were waterlogged as the city was pounded by four inches rain in just three hours. Rain pounded Vadodara city too, along with strong winds. Tauktae caused major damage to agriculture with initial estimates suggesting about 90% of standing crop in Saurashtra being levelled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cyclone-tauktae-17-dead-and-a-trail-of-destruction-in-gujarat/articleshow/82750590.cms||---
---||India||Document forged to tar those questioning govt: Congress||NEW DELHI: Accusing BJP of forging a supposed “toolkit” in the name of Congress, the opposition party Tuesday moved to file an FIR against the BJP leadership and said the saffron outfit is using fabrication to distract the people from the government's failure on the pandemic front. AICC research department chief Rajeev Gowda and social department chairman Rohan Gupta filed the complaint with the Delhi police commissioner, naming BJP leaders J P Nadda, B L Santhosh, women and child welfare minister Smriti Irani and spokesman Sambit Patra among others for the alleged “forgery”. They have accused BJP leaders of “forging and fabricating documents with the intent to create communal disharmony and civil unrest in the country”. Congress warned it would move court if the police did not file an FIR based on its complaint, demanding the provenance of the alleged “toolkit” that was circulated on what the party said is a forged letterhead of the Congress research department be investigated. It demanded BJP leaders be arrested and computers and devices seized. Nadda and others tweeted the alleged toolkit. While lashing out, Congress termed the said “toolkit” is a attempt to “try to demolish the credibility of those who question the Modi government”, referring to BJP’s “desire” to deflect and divert questions from PM Modi over the corona chaos. “It is all to make a leader out of a nobody (Modi). You are making the country suffer by trying to save the image of Modi and make a leader of out him,” AICC spokesman Pawan Khera said. “How much effort the BJP spends to cover up the truth and spread lies! If it had spent half of this time in fighting corona, the situation would have been much better and would have saved people so much of suffering,” he said. Khera warned that Congress and citizens have seen through these BJP tricks and will not keep quiet. “They will all be responded to appropriately,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/document-forged-to-tar-those-questioning-govt-congress/articleshow/82750882.cms||---

---||India||638 ONGC men stranded off Maharashtra, Gujarat coasts rescued, search still on for 93||MUMBAI/NEW DELHI: Five Indian Navy ships, along with naval helicopters and the Coast Guard, were racing against time to locate and rescue 91 crew members of Barge Papaa (P-305) who were still missing till late Tuesday night, more than 20 hours after their barge sank 35 nautical miles off the Mumbai coast in the intervening hours of Monday and Tuesday. A total of 180 survivors from the barge, however, have been rescued. In the massive search operation that began after four vessels in all — two barges off the city’s coast and a barge and drill vessel off Pipavav port in Gujarat — went adrift as cyclone Tauktae stormed past India’s western coast, a total of 638 people who were aboard had either been rescued or their vessels taken to safety till Tuesday evening. The security of all the personnel on board the three vessels apart from P-305 had been secured, officials said. Apart from the 180 on P-305, there were 137 personnel on board the barge GAL Constructor which ran aground off Mumbai’s Colaba coast. They were all rescued on Tuesday, said Navy and ONGC sources. The third barge, Support Station-3 with 220 on board, which drifted north-west off Pipavav port, was hooked to a tugboat and all on board were safe, sources said. All three barges belong to Shapoorji Pallonji group company Afcons and had on board people hired by the company. The drill vessel, Drillship Sagar Bhushan, owned by ONGC, which too went adrift off Pipavav, had also been secured and was being taken back to Pipavav port at the time of going to press. It had 101 persons on board, including 38 ONGC employees. On Tuesday, three naval ships — INS Beas, Betwa and Teg — joined INS Kochi and Kolkata for the search and rescue (SAR) ops for P-305, and P8I and naval helicopters were deployed to undertake an aerial search. Sources from DG Shipping said they believed all of P-305’s crew members were wearing life jackets, and those missing could still be floating in the waters. Many of those rescued were reported to have been pulled out of the water after floating for many hours in their life jackets. People in the know said evacuation measures had been initiated as soon as the barge showed signs of tilting. Indian Navy’s chief PRO, Commander Mehul Karnik, said all the vessels seemed to have been hit hard by the high sea swell and gusty winds. P–305 saw its anchors give way, causing it to start drifting, and it later sunk. TOI learned from some crew members who had disembarked from P-305 on May 8 that the barge had been unable to reach the shores ahead of the cyclone “due to some issue,” though some other barges and vessels had succeeded. “The crew members are from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Punjab, Kerala and Karnataka,” sources said. Sources said rescuers were battling ferocious winds and very high waves. People aware of the situation said the choppy sea has made transfer of people from barges to rescue ships a challenging task. The barges and the drillship were deployed for drilling and exploration in Heera field off Bombay High and western offshore, which make up ONGC’s main production base. The vessels had gone adrift on Monday after their moorings snapped due to the ferocity of Tuktae, which pushed up wind speed to 195 km and created waves as high as 6-8 metres. Karnik said the anchors of ‘Support Station-3’ had also given way, causing it to drift, while Gal Constructor had drifted off Colaba Point with water ingress in the engine room. ONGC’s Sagar Bhushan, deployed for exploration in the western offshore, had started drifting north. Several personnel from P-305, rescued by Sea King helicopter, were taken to INS Shikra and given medical attention. “INS Talwar has sailed to render assistance to another oil rig Sagar Bhushan with 101 personnel onboard and an accommodation barge SS-3,” said the official. Coast Guard PRO, Commandant R K Singh stated, “In an effective coordinated rescue operation, all 137 crew of distressed vessel Gal Constructor successfully rescued and are safely ashore. Rescue mission accomplished.” Gal Constructor was rescued off Satpati coast, and three Chetak helicopters were pressed into service. ONGC and Afcon are updating families of those on board the vessels, officials said. ONGC on Tuesday evening tweeted, “All drifted vessels, except ‘P-305’ are taken in control and their crew are safe. @IndianNavy and #ONGC are actively engaged in rescuing crew of vessel ‘P-305’.” Vice-admiral M S Pawar told mediapersons, “This is one of the most challenging search and rescue operations I have seen in the last four decades.” Talking about the Covid situation, Pawar said all of them (defence personnel) had taken two vaccine shots and those on the barges had been working for a long time and in all probability were Covid-free. Navy officials said SAR operations continued throughout Monday night and the entire day on Tuesday while operating in challenging conditions. Offshore barges are like floating townships or colonies and rise as high as 3-4-storeyed buildings. They cannot be moved at short notice and require 8-10 days, assuming the ongoing work can be switched off quickly. There are eight anchors of 3-4 km length in each barge, which have to be carried by other vessels for dropping into the sea. Lifting anchor again involves other vessels and takes more than a week.

---||Bengaluru||Covid-19: Karnataka overtakes Delhi, has second highest toll||BENGALURU: A massive surge in fatalities this month — 6,790 in only 17 days — has pushed Karnataka’s overall Covid-19 toll past that of even Delhi’s, making it the state with the second-highest number of deaths in the country. Karnataka’s overall case fatality rate (CFR) — deaths among those infected, which is an indicator of the severity of the disease — remains under 1%, against the national average of 1.1%. As of May 17, Karnataka reported 22,313 deaths from the disease, compared to 21,846 in Delhi. May has been the deadliest month for Karnataka since the outbreak, with a daily average of 400 deaths so far. In the 14 months prior to this, eight did not even report a monthly toll of 400.     Only Maharashtra has reported more deaths (over 82,000) than Karnataka. These two states, along with Delhi, account for nearly 46% of the 2.8 lakh fatalities in India so far. The overall CFR of Delhi and Maharashtra are higher than Karnataka’s. While Kerala stands third in terms of number of cases, its fatalities are still under 7,000; Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh occupy fourth and fifth place, respectively, in the list of states with the most Covid deaths. While most states and Union territories have reported more than 1,000 deaths each, only three other than the top five states have more than 10,000 deaths. In contrast, five states/UTs — Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Andaman & Nicobar, Lakshadweep and Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu — have still reported less than 100 deaths. During the second wave, Karnataka reported 2,956 deaths in April, which was more in line with the peak during the first wave, but things began spiralling out of control from May. As reported by TOI, the state reported 5,189 deaths in the first 13 days of the month. Between May 7 and 13, there were more Covid deaths than in any month since last year. In the next four days (May 14 to 17), the state has added 1,601 deaths at the rate of 400 cases per day, in line with the daily average seen through May. During the first wave, the maximum deaths were reported in August 2020, but the 3,388 deaths reported in that month pale in comparison to the May toll which is double that figure already. If the daily average toll holds, the state is expected to add at least 4,800 more fatalities in the remaining days of May. That would leave the month with a heavy toll of 11,600 deaths — three times the peak of the first wave. Among the districts, Bengaluru, which accounts for 43.6% of all deaths, has reported 9,722 fatalities as of May 17, followed by Mysuru (1,410), Ballari (1,090), Dakshina Kannada (819) and Dharwad (803). These five districts reported more than 62% of all deaths in the state. While all districts have now reported a toll of more than 100, four — Gadag, Yadgir, Kodagu and Chitradurga — have fewer than 200 deaths.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-overtakes-delhi-has-2nd-highest-covid-toll/articleshow/82751747.cms||Chethan Kumar

In an exclusive interview to Times Evoke, Pollard said the longer the interval between the vaccine’s two doses, the stronger the body’s immune response will be. "A three-month interval produces very good protection – this gets even better with a longer interval from three to four months. A longer time gap gets a stronger immune response after the second dose. To get the maximum immune response, it’s worth waiting longer." The statement assumes significance given the controvery that erupted over the recent change in the prescribed time interval between two Covishield doses from 4-8 weeks to 12-16 weeks, with many speculating that the decision may have arisen due to vaccine shortages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/3-month-gap-between-doses-improves-immune-response-az-vax-co-developer/articleshow/82751968.cms||Srijana Mitra Das

Preliminary assessment revealed partial damage to over 11,000 structures and over 13,500 people were evacuated from low lying areas. Officials said the toll is bound to increase as there are some who are severely injured and people were still missing. Raigad district has reported the highest damage — with four deaths, seven people injured and over 6,027 structures partially collapsing. Two deaths each were reported from Jalgaon, Ratnagiri and Palghar district. While Thane and Sindhudurg district reported three deaths each and Mumbai reported one casualty. Preliminary estimates show that over 10,000 hectares of farmlands have reported damage across the three coastal districts. “As many as 661 villages with 1.6 lakh population remain without power. Around 150 fishing boats and 5,000 hectares of farmland were damaged,” said collector Nidhi Choudhari. Officials said restoration of electricity supply and water supply in many villages was still underway and it was expected to take another 48 hours. “Three persons died, while two are missing in Sindhudurg and over 4,000 structures have been damaged. The estimated loss in the district is about Rs 8 crore. Malvan and Devgad talukas are the worst affected,” said Sindhudurg district information officer Hemant Chavhan. Initial unofficial estimation points to about 2000 hectares of farmland mostly fruit orchards destroyed in Ratnagiri. In Palghar district, 337 houses were partly damaged. Meanwhile, One fisherman drowned while two were rescued in the early hours of Tuesday at Mahim. The fishermen had come to their fishing boats to clear them of the sea water. The state government will be taking up the issue of compensation in the next cabinet meeting. Meanwhile, home minister Amit Shah spoke to the CM Uddhav Thackeray and took stock of the situation. Relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar also said the state will write to the Centre seeking compensation for the cyclone affected villages and a detailed memorandum listing the damages and the compensation amount will be sent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cyclone-leaves-17-dead-in-maharashtra-too-28-badly-hurt/articleshow/82752447.cms||---

The chief judicial magistrate of Imphal West had granted the duo bail on Monday, only for the district magistrate to issue a warrant under the NSA on the basis of police reports sent to him. Both were arrested on May 13, hours after their posts appeared on Facebook. In the NSA order, the DM quoted a report filed by the SP as saying that Leichombam and Kishorchandra acted in a manner “prejudicial to the maintenance of public order.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/fb-post-against-dead-bjp-neta-duo-get-bail-but-held-under-nsa/articleshow/82752933.cms||K Sarojkumar Sharma
---||India||Children mostly asymptomatic but capable of spreading Covid-19: Govt||NEW DELHI: Amid rising concerns that children could be particularly vulnerable to future waves of Covid-19, the government on Tuesday said existing evidence suggested that kids were generally asymptomatic but were capable of spreading the disease. “Response remains the same of what we do, we have to protect ourselves with Covid-appropriate behaviour and children have to be encouraged to wear masks and maintain social distancing. There is a clear-cut science-driven protocol already available. If Covid-19 symptoms are seen in children, then that should be followed,” Niti Aayog member-health Dr V K Paul said. Severe disease in children was uncommon but a clinical management protocol for that was in place as well, Dr Paul said. Referring to the previous sero-survey conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research, he said the infection had comparable rates among children above 10 years and adults in December-January. However, whether children could be more vulnerable to Covid-19 in the coming times would also depend on mutations, he added. Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin has been granted permission for phase 2/3 clinical trials on children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/children-mostly-asymptomatic-but-capable-of-spreading-covid-19-govt/articleshow/82753318.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||India||Covid-19: 2.7 lakh new cases across India, nearly 4k deaths||After a marginal rise on Tuesday, fresh cases remained within the 3-lakh mark for the third consecutive day as 2,67,122 cases and 3,915 deaths were recorded across the country in 24 hours. Fresh cases continued to remain within three lakh for the third consecutive day as 2,67,122 cases and 3,915 deaths were recorded across the country in the past 24 hours. The declining trend of cases which is largely consistent after May 6 when cases touched 4,14,554 has reduced fresh cases by 1.47 lakh. Even after this massive reduction in the past 12 days, India’s daily tally of fresh cases is by far the world’s highest by a huge margin. Comparable global data compiled by WHO states that against India’s above 2.6 lakh case count, Brazil — which at present is the world’s second-worst in daily cases — reported 40,941 fresh infections. The numbers were 17,984 for the USA, 16,350 for Argentina and 15,093 for Colombia. No other country reported over 15,000 daily cases. The relatively slower decline in deaths probably indicates that despite the reduction of 1.5 lakh in about two weeks, India’s case count is still high enough to overwhelm its healthcare system. With 33,059 cases reported in the past 24 hours, Tamil Nadu is leading the state list. It is followed by Kerala and Karnataka as both reported over 30,000 cases on Tuesday. Maharashtra which was leading the list for months reported the country’s fourth highest case count with 28,438 new infections. Andhra Pradesh reported 21,320 cases and was the fifth state to report over 20,000 cases. The case count was 19,428 for West Bengal and 10,321 for Odisha and no other state reported over 10,000 cases today. Nine states reported between 5,000 and 10,000 cases and the list includes Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Bihar, Assam and Madhya Pradesh. Both Delhi and Uttarakhand reported less than 5,000 cases on Tuesday. Deaths have not declined at the same pace which could be linked to the time lag between cases and deaths as well the fact that even after this huge reduction daily cases are still at a very high level. On Tuesday, 11 states reported over a hundred deaths. For many months, Maharashtra is leading the states in daily deaths and even on Tuesday despite a steep fall in cases, the state’s death toll of 679 was the country’s highest. It was followed by Karnataka that reported 525 deaths while Tamil Nadu was the third in deaths. The state with its today’s death toll of 364 was followed by Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab which reported 265, 255 and 231 deaths in that order. Other states that reported between 100 to 200 deaths were Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, West Bengal, Haryana and Bihar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-2-7-lakh-new-cases-across-india-nearly-4k-deaths/articleshow/82753934.cms||---
---||India||BJP targets Congress over bid to ‘destroy image’ of PM, India||A Congress “toolkit” that called for an internet campaign to attack the Centre by referring to the Covid variant detected in India as the “Modi variant” and to use purportedly rightwing handles to criticise the Prime Minister is part of a bid to whip up disaffection even at the cost of tarnishing India’s image, BJP said on Tuesday. BJP circulated a four-page brief allegedly spelling out a strategy to attack the government and the PM in particular and which was attributed to ‘Congress Research Department’ with the headline that said “Cornering Narendra Modi and BJP on Corona management”. “It is important to keep using this term “super spreader Kumbh” to keep reminding people that it is the Hindu politics of the BJP that is causing so much distress, the document states. BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said, “Disgusting to say the least Rahul Gandhi wants to use this opportunity of pandemic to destroy the image of PM Modi. Congress workers instructed to call the mutant strain the Modi strain.” Patra said the World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that the new strain of the coronavirus would not be named after India, but the Congress wants to one step better. “The opposition party is ready to tarnish the country's image for its politics,” he alleged. “The toolkit has exposed yet another Congress conspiracy to divide society...It is clear that even at this time of global calamity, Congress is not prepared to abandon its propaganda and hateful mindset of dirty politics. Least interested in public welfare, the Congress’s sole agenda is to bake the loaves of its selfish politics,” BJP chief spokesperson Anil Baluni said. Several BJP leaders shared the letter on social media, alleging Congress’s move to help Covid patients was more a public relations exercise than a sincere endeavour. “I can understand the opposition would want to attack the government. But to singularly commercialise it as a political opportunity and deal in death; I never imagined Congress was capable of such a low,” union minister Smriti Irani said. Sharing a recent tweet of Rahul Gandhi saying, “Indian Coronavirus variant reaches Switzerland”, BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya said, “Congress leader Rahul Gandhi used “Indian Variant”, true to the Congress toolkit.” He also referred to Congress leader Shashi Tharoor using the term “Indian variant” and said, “If the tool kit is fake then how come so much stress on the “Indian variant” of the virus on the lines of the tool kit!” BJP mahila morcha IT cell head Priti Gandhi shared excerpts of the letter and wrote on twitter, “Assist foreign journalists with sightings of funerals and dead bodies. Facilitate journalists who use 'dramatic' pictures, make sure their reporting is magnified. - Use words ‘Indian strain’ and 'Modi strain'. Block hospital beds. This is pure evil!!”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bjp-targets-congress-over-bid-to-destroy-image-of-pm-india/articleshow/82754755.cms||---
---||India||Covid-19 cases in less than 2% of population, says govt||NEW DELHI: India's Covid-19 cases account for less than 2% of the population, indicating containment measures have worked to keep the spread under control as compared to many other countries where the share of the affected population is much higher, the government said. At the same time, the government said this meant 98% of the population was still vulnerable and susceptible to infection, emphasising on the need to continue stringent containment measures and Covid-appropriate behaviour. Coronavirus in India: Live updatesThe health ministry's formulation at a media briefing on Tuesday raised eyebrows as the claim that 98% of the population is vulnerable seemed to assume the incidence of Covid-19 infections was strictly limited to the 2.5 crore cases reported so far. The claim ignored the finding of the national sero-survey that one-fifth of the population was exposed to the disease. Read AlsoMay not be new wave yet, vaccination plus Covid protocol key to quell surge in cases: ScientistsWith India recording the highest number of daily novel coronavirus cases in 83 days on Saturday, the country could be heading towards a new wave that scientists say can be quelled by vaccinating the maximum number of people and following Covid-appropriate behaviour.If the intention was to show that a low percentage of the population was reported for Covid-19, the juxtaposition of the 98% population as vulnerable claim was puzzling, and flew in the face of official statistics on antibody prevalence. While the government’s estimates are based on the number of Covid-19 positive cases reported, findings of the last serological survey conducted by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) showed almost one-fifth or 21.4% of the country's adult population (18 years and above) had been exposed to Covid-19 by mid-December. The sero-prevalence among children aged 10-18 years was found to be 25.3%. In fact, the prevalence in urban slums was found to be even higher at 31.7%, followed by 26.2% in other urban areas and 19% in rural areas. Read AlsoYouth getting slightly more affected in Covid second wave as they might have begun going out: ICMRNEW DELHI: The second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic is impacting slightly more number of younger people as they might have begun going out and also because of some variants of SARs-COV-2 prevalent in the country, the ICMR chief said on Tuesday. In response to a question on whether younger populationA sero-prevalence survey is based on detection of antibodies developed after the infection to assess how many people have been exposed and the findings are statistically extrapolated to estimate the spread of an infection keeping in view the possibility of cases of asymptomatic and even mild infection going unrecorded. Drawing a comparison with other countries, health ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal said 1.8% of the total population in India had been affected by Covid-19 so far, whereas 10.1% of the population in the US had been infected, 7.3% in Brazil, 9% in France and 7.4% in Italy. "Despite the high number of cases reported so far, we have been able to contain the spread to under 2% of the population due to continued efforts by the medical fraternity, states and districts,” Agarwal said.

Around 199 districts in the country are showing continued decline in cases and positivity since the last three weeks. Officials said the curve of the pandemic was stabilising in many states, with only eight states now accounting for over 1 lakh active cases, along with a declining positivity rate. However, there were states like Tamil Nadu and north-eastern ones where cases as well as positivity rate were rising, causing concern. India's reproduction value (R) for Covid-19, which shows how fast the infection is spreading, is below one now, which means that the pandemic is shrinking, the government said. “Comprehensive efforts at containment and testing are resulting in stabilisation. We still have a few states which continue to be cause of concern... there is a mixed picture but overall there is stabilisation,” Dr V K Paul, member-health, Niti Aayog, said. "We are keeping the case fatality rate reasonably under control. We have to be very mindful that when we are achieving declining positivity rate, it is because of the results of what we are doing and that doing cannot be slackened. We cannot again let this go out of hand," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-cases-in-less-than-2-of-population-says-govt/articleshow/82755152.cms||---

This even as overall total tests across India has gone up by almost 6% during the last fortnight — up from 2.21 crore, between April 21-May 4, to 2.34 crore during May 4-17. Karnataka saw testing go down by 4.8 lakh samples during May 4-17 as compared to previous fortnight despite a rising positivity rate (total confirmed cases per 100 tests). During the same period, total tests came down by 3.7 lakh in Gujarat, 2.6 lakh in Maharashtra and by more than 1.8 lakh in Telangana. Uttarakhand and Rajasthan scaled down by about 1 lakh each despite both states recording a high positivity rate of 22-23%. In Delhi, where at least 18 cases are found positive for every 100 tests, testing has come down by more than 52,000 in the last 14 days. Barring Telangana and Gujarat, all other states have positivity rates in double digits. In the previous fortnight (April 21-May 4) there were only two states, Delhi and Telangana, that had scaled down testing by up to three lakh samples each. The number has increased to six states and Chandigarh. Except for the six states as mentioned above and Chandigarh, all others have augmented their testing week-afterweek. In absolute numbers, Maharashtra with 32.3 lakh tests, UP with 31.5 lakh and Tamil Nadu with 20.4 lakh are the top states having done highest tests during the last 14 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/delhi-5-states-reduced-testing-in-last-2-weeks/articleshow/82755187.cms||Pradeep Thakur

He died on Monday night. Aggarwal, a recipient of Padma Shri and Dr B C Roy National Award and head of Heart Care Foundation of India, was admitted at AIIMS for the past 10 days and was put on a ventilator. His friends recalled him not just as a doctor but also as a medical educator. “He was born on Teacher’s Day in 1958 and never stopped imparting lessons on health issues. Even when he was down with Covid, he continued educating people through his videos,” said Dr. Vinay Aggarwal, former president of Indian Medical Association (IMA). The annual Perfect Health Mela held in Delhi was Dr Aggarwal’s brainchild. It was not just the medical fraternity which mourned his death. Tributes poured in from politicians, bureaucrats, artists and actors. Even while he was affected with pneumonia, a complication of Covid, and was on oxygen, he proposed to doctors what he called a “Jugaadu OPD” to handle the sheer number of Covid patients overwhelming the medical system. He said doctors could bring 100 patients with similar symptoms on a common online platform and treat all of them. Each video of Dr Aggarwal had a new message backed by thorough research. A former president of IMA, Dr Aggarwal always appeared in his videos with a stethoscope around his neck. Speaking fondly about his association with him, Dr. Vinay Aggarwal recalled how everyone was sceptical about his idea of a health mela but when it was first held in 1993, it turned out to be quite popular. “It was attended by a lot of people, and in just one or two years it became so popular that students from various schools used to wait for it. KK made it interesting by adding many new elements like food, dances etc.” Dr Aggarwal breathed his last on Monday at 11:30pm at AIIMS. He is survived by his wife, Dr Veena Aggarwal, son Nilesh and daughter Naina Aggarwal Ahuja. In a statement, his family said “He was unwavering in his mission of making quality healthcare available to the masses, especially the economically weaker sections. Even with the pandemic raging, he worked relentlessly to reach out to over 100 million people through his digital initiatives. His informational videos and educational programmes proved instrumental in saving a large number of lives from the viral infection.” They added: “He is gone, but his spirit of spreading positivity, irrespective of the situation, is something we all need to imbibe.” Dr Aggarwal was one of the first who took up the issue of violence against doctors in 2015. He organised a ‘Dilli Chalo’ programme and over 25,000 participated in it. His friends said he was a meticulous planner and micro-managed every event. He was mourned not just by the medical fraternity but by several other people whose lives he had touched. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted: “Passing away of Dr. KK Aggarwal is a setback for the whole nation. He acted all his life for the health rights of common people, especially poor, deprived and marginalized. A great human being. RIP!”. Former chief election commissioner Dr. SY Quraishi also tweeted about his association with Dr Aggarwal: “I feel devastated to lose my friend, philosopher and guide to Covid. He served humanity throughout his life. His Perfect Health Melas served millions. A health communicator par excellence, he was educating people about low-cost treatment till his last breath. RIP.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/doctor-educator-k-k-aggarwal-dies-of-covid/articleshow/82755245.cms||Sakshi Chand
---||India||India keeping eye on PLA drill near eastern Ladakh||NEW DELHI: India is keeping close tabs on the summer exercises launched by the People’s Liberation Army in its `depth areas’ facing eastern Ladakh, even as it maintains operational readiness of `reserve forces’ to ensure China does not try anything at a time when the country is battling the Covid-19 pandemic. There is as yet no decision to conduct the 12th round of corps commander-level talks between the two armies after the last one on April 9 failed to achieve any breakthrough due to PLA’s recalcitrance to even fully disengage, let alone de-induct troops and de-escalate the year-long troop confrontation. “The PLA has now finished rotating its troops, including two motorized divisions, which are in areas across eastern Ladakh. It has also kicked off its annual summer exercises in depth areas, including Kanxiwar and Kashgar, located 100 to 250-km from the Line of Actual Control (LAC),” said a senior officer on Tuesday. Closer to the LAC, at locations 25 to 120-km away, the PLA has unremittingly converted its troop shelters, ammunition depots, helipads and surface-to-air missile positions established last year into permanent positions now, as was earlier reported by TOI. With the onset of summer, the Indian Army and IAF have also strengthened their “military posture” during the “campaigning season” in eastern Ladakh, as also other stretches along the 3,488-km LAC right till Arunachal Pradesh. “This is to ensure a `military surge’ is possible if the balloon goes up,” he added. It was in April-May last year that India was caught utterly unprepared when the PLA, under directions from the top politico-military hierarchy in Beijing, suddenly diverted its troops from their annual exercises to undertake multiple incursions into eastern Ladakh in a well-planned manner. India is clearly taking no chances this time. The pandemic, however, has led to some realignment of forces along the LAC. “After a risk-assessment and analysis, some troops have been pulled back to support the nation in fighting the Covid crisis. Areas have been identified where the guard cannot be lowered at any cost, while some thinning out has taken place in other stretches” said another officer. Though the rival local commanders are keeping in constant touch over hotlines, the overall stalemate persists. The PLA has flatly refused to pull back troops from the friction sites at patrolling points (PPs) 15, 17 and 17A in the Hot Springs-Gogra-Kongka La area in eastern Ladakh, and continues to maintain considerable strength in the rear areas there. The PLA’s persistent blocking of Indian patrols from even going to their traditional PPs-10, 11, 11A, 12, and 13 in the strategically-located Depsang Bulge area, which are well short of India’s perception of the LAC in the region, also continues to be a major problem area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-keeping-eye-on-pla-drill-near-eastern-ladakh/articleshow/82755320.cms||Rajat Pandit

It may hit the coast by around May 27. Our models show the formation, but it would be clearer in a day or two,” said Madhavan Rajeevan, secretary, ministry of earth sciences. He told TOI that the cyclone, if formed, would, however, not be as strong as ‘Tauktae.’ If the cyclone is formed, it would be called ‘Yaas’ - name given by Oman. It’s still in the ‘low pressure area formation’. IMD to wait for the development before making a formal announcement. Yaas means despair or disappointment. After making a landfall near the UT of Diu and causing massive destruction in coastal districts of Saurashtra in Gujarat, ‘Tauktae’ moved towards south Rajasthan. The remnant of the system is likely to move towards western Uttar Pradesh and interact with ‘western disturbance’, causing fairly widespread to heavy rainfall over north-west India on Wednesday and Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cyclone-forming-in-bay-of-bengal-may-hit-east-coast-by-may-end/articleshow/82755516.cms||Vishwa Mohan
---||India||Efforts on to up vax supply, provide states 15 days’ advance schedule: PM||NEW DELHI: Highlighting the critical role of vaccination against Covid-19, PM Narendra Modi on Tuesday said continuous efforts are being made to ramp up vaccine supply and attempts are on to provide states 15 days’ advance schedule of the inoculation programme to enable scheduling of the shots. The PM’s remarks during an interaction with district magistrates — also attended by several chief ministers — point to the Centre's efforts to make vaccine supplies more predictable as currently states are often dealing with 3-6 days of stocks, leading to uncertainty over how many people can be inoculated. "This way states will know in each district how much vaccine will be available for how many people and enable the administration to plan for the same,” he added. Government experts and officials have said vaccine supplies will improve in June and will flow much more freely in July. The PM also asserted that district authorities have a key role in preventing vaccine wastage and efforts in this regard will enable “optimum utilisation” of the vaccine. The PM’s remarks came during a virtual interaction with field officials from states and districts on their experience in handling the Covid-19 pandemic. Modi said getting vaccinated is instrumental to lowering severity of the disease and reducing hospitalisations and mortalities. Modi said all efforts should be made to collectively quell myths and misconceptions people may have to counter vaccine hesitancy. “Constant efforts are being made to increase the supply of the vaccine on a big scale,” the PM said. The health ministry is working on streamlining arrangements and processes linked to vaccination. Describing district officials as “field commanders” in the fight against Covid-19, Modi emphasised that “localised containment zones, aggressive testing and sharing correct and complete information with people are weapons to defeat it”. People's convenience increases when information like bed availability for the sick or the vaccine stocks are easily available, Modi said and also asked officials to curb black-marketing and take strict action against those who do so. Noting coronavirus infections are decreasing in some states and increasing in others, he emphasised the need to be more vigilant and underlined that the fight is about saving every single life. The PM asserted that the focus should be in rural and inaccessible areas. He requested the officials to make relief material easily accessible to the rural population. “You understand the challenges of your district much better. So when your district wins, the country wins. When your district beats Corona, the country defeats Corona,” the PM said. Work is being done rapidly to install oxygen plants in hospitals in every district of the country through “PM-Cares Fund” and these plants have already started functioning in many hospitals, he said. Modi asked them to compile the best practices and innovative steps so that these may be used in other districts of the country. The meeting was also attended by the home minister, defence minister, health minister, chief ministers of various states, member (Health) NITI Aayog, health secretary, pharmaceutical secretary and other officers from PMO, ministries and departments of central government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/efforts-on-to-up-vax-supply-provide-states-15-days-advance-schedule-pm/articleshow/82755701.cms||---

According to auto analyst JATO, passenger vehicle sales for Q1 could take a hit to the tune of 3,50,000-3,75,000 units from the expected average sales. Passenger vehicle sales in April-June 2020 was just 1,53,734 units due to the nationwide lockdown, from 7,12,684 units in 2019-20.Vehicle makers dispatched 2,88,000 units in April to cater to local new year and other auspicious period sales before the second wave struck, said Ravi Bhatia, president, JATO Dynamics India. With the infection spreading to villages even tractors, which saw a 27% increase in sales in FY21, will scrape through with just 3-5% sales increase, said Crisil Ratings. With two wheelers, where the dealers are already carrying too much stock, the hit would be sharp. India Ratings & Research has forecast a 52 %to 56% decline in two wheeler sales in the current year.“The second wave has impacted tier -2 and 3 cities this time,” said JATO’s Bhatia. With 85-90% trade shut, finance companies holding back releasing funds against confirmed approvals, customer sentiment down and companies suspending production, passenger vehicle sales will be hit, he added.The rural hit explains why even tractor sales are expected to be muted despite forecasts of a normal monsoon. Said Gautam Shahi, director, Crisil Ratings: “The already high base of last fiscal and severity of the second wave will hit tractor volume growth. Several states have imposed lockdowns and crucially rural India has been less insulated this time around.” Maharashtra, UP, Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, which account for over 50% of tractor volumes, have seen a surge in infections, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/auto-makers-brace-for-sales-dip-on-falling-rural-demand/articleshow/82749934.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta

The previous deadline was May 31, she said. Earlier in the day, the CM reviewed the status of wheat procurement and asked the cooperative department to extend the deadline till June 15 so that a maximum number of farmers could take the benefit of the minimum support price (MSP). The Centre has fixed Rs1,975 per quintal MSP for wheat this season. Preyashi said the state has so far procured around 98,000 metric tonnes of wheat from different districts. “Wheat production is very good in the state. The officials of cooperative and agriculture departments should motivate the maximum number of farmers to sell their wheat to the primary agriculture cooperative society (PACS) or the Vyapar Mandal,” Nitish said and asked the officials to make arrangements to store the procured wheat in the godowns of the state food corporation. Nitish said the state government is providing free ration to all the ration card holders in Bihar in May. “Please ensure that all ration card holders get the benefit of this facility,” Nitish told the officials. Earlier, Preyashi informed the CM that a survey of the farmers willing to sell their wheat was conducted with the help of ‘Kisan Salahkar’ in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/govt-extends-deadline-for-wheat-procurement-till-june-15/articleshow/82747585.cms||Madan Kumar

The full-year net profit for FY21 stood at Rs 2,557 crore as against a net loss of Rs 5,838 crore in FY20. The results for the quarter and year ended March 31, 2021 include operations of erstwhile Syndicate Bank. Hence, the quarterly and yearly results for FY21 are not comparable with the corresponding periods of previous financial year. Domestic deposits of the bank stood at Rs 9,63,306 crore as of March 2021 — an increase of 10.7% over the previous year. Advances for the same period rose 5.5% to Rs 6,52,558 crore. Despite the slower growth in advances, the bank reported an 18.5% jump in net interest income as the net interest margin improved by 24 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point). The credit growth was driven by a 12% increase in retail and 17% growth in agri loans. The bank’s corporate loan book shrunk by 4.6% during the year. Retail loan growth was driven by home loans, which grew 15% to Rs 61,607 crore. The board also approved a proposal to set off the accumulated losses of Rs 18,495 crore as on March 31 this year by utilising the balance standing to the credit of share premium account of the bank. The bank said that it has extended restructuring to 15,395 loan accounts where it has a loan exposure of Rs 1,206 crore. Of this, 5,228 were personal loans amounting to Rs 636 crore. The bank’s gross non-performing assets reduced marginally to Rs 60,288 crore (8.9%), while net NPAs stood at Rs 24,442 crore (3.8%).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/canara-bank-sees-q4-profit-of-rs-1010-crore/articleshow/82750281.cms||---

However, overcast and rainy conditions are likely to persist at a few places in the state over the next two days under the influence of a couple of weather systems. “A trough line is passing from Bihar to north Chhattisgarh via Jharkhand. Also, a cyclonic circulation is situated over southwest Uttar Pradesh. Under the influence of the two weather systems, few places in the state are likely to witness light to moderate rainfall along with lightning and hail,” said Md Zeeshan Ansari, an official at Patna Meteorological Centre. Meanwhile, skies remained cloudy along with light rain in intermittent manner at a few places in the state on Tuesday. An official at Patna Meteorological Centre said light to moderate rainfall occurred at one or two places in south Bihar in the last 24 hours. The places which received light showers included Gaya (50mm), Sherghati (20mm), Rafiganj (20mm) and Deo (10mm). Other places which received isolated light rainfall on Tuesday included Patna (0.4mm), Bhagalpur (0.3mm) and Muzaffarpur (0.2mm). Though significant rainfall was not witnessed in Bihar, the cloud cover owing to the outer band of the cyclone Tauktae provided slight respite from the scorching heat at most places in the state. For instance, the maximum temperature in Patna came down from 40 degrees C on Monday to 35.2 degrees C on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/light-rain-in-state-for-2-days-met/articleshow/82747872.cms||Piyush Tripathi
---||Business||Leaders should not reward just loyalty or long service||By Prabir JhaAs the season of appraisals and the concomitant bonus & increment decisions set in, it is an opportune time for raising some basic questions for organisations. There is both a strategic logic and a bread-and-butter compulsion to look at financial rewards. But my experience, both as a CXO and now as a strategic adviser, suggests that companies have chosen to become more rewards-rich in their thinking, ignoring the set-off that recognition-rich thinking could offer. In times of business duress, or even in normal situations, there’s the pressure of managing expectations and disappointments. Can this be better handled if the entire pressure was not on rewards distribution? And possibly it is a more cost-efficient use of money. Maybe there is an opportunity to explore here. Here are some simple hooks that could help companies as well as leaders review their current rewards mix, with recognition being part of ‘total rewards’: * Philosophical appreciation of recognition as a rewards lever: While nuances may vary with the industry and the demographics of the workforce, the desire to be acknowledged and appreciated is a very human expectation. Unfortunately, many leaders are low on this sensitivity or believe any recognition will build complacency. Or someone else will feel demotivated. In the process, they do not applaud in real time. They do not appreciate enough. They rarely even thank enough. And hence, even when rewards come at the year end, these seem little, and too late. Worse, it feels extractive. And money alone does not build a sense of high self-worth. Finally, someone will always pay a dollar more and people leave. But if employees feel recognised for their efforts through the year, they better appreciate the constraints of restricted financial rewards. And continue to pull together. * Need to align recognition mix with chosen strategy: Firms that indeed do have a mix of recognition types often do not think through well enough about the strategic alignment of these programmes. What really do you want to recognise? How is your recognition effort helping you to execute your strategic intent? Are your actions sending conflicting messages on what you want to improve in your organisation? In my advisory experience, several clients have not passed the litmus test. Recognition is a strategy deployment too. Both the type and focus of your recognition efforts should depend on what you want to reward, as opposed to what you may have done historically. There is no point recognising pure long service when you realise you need to become a high-performance company. There need not be a conflict, but if there is, you need to choose the strategic imperative. Otherwise recognising ‘loyalty’ is the wrong card to play. * Balance of individual-group recognition: Another critical call that leadership must make is in the relative weight of individual performance to group performance, including inter-functional. In far more companies than ideal, I have noticed individuals being recognised. There is nothing wrong in it. In fact, celebrating individual breakthroughs raises the bar for others, inspires them to deliver likewise and creates role models to emulate. Unfortunately, just this alone falls short often. It may create a worse problem. Sometimes individuals are only the face of what truly is a group, even a cross-disciplinary effort. This may send very misleading messages to the team and promote individualistic behaviour rather than collaboration and boundarylessness. Such recognition programmes, the glitz and jazz notwithstanding, corrode the culture you otherwise may have been strategically architecting. * Design the cadence of your recognition offers: My critique of many contemporary recognition efforts in companies has been that they are often too muddled. In the effort to recognise in good faith individuals, functions and regions, companies get overloaded with various recognitions and awards. This is disastrous. In my CXO life, I aggressively eliminated much of the hotchpotch. I believe there must be a strong cadence from enterprise-wide recognition to that by the individual manager. Create strong brand recalls for a smaller set of rewards. It does mean to take on some difficult conversations, but the clutter is completely dysfunctional. Once an enterprise has streamlined the names and types of awards, criteria and frequency, the ownership of its deployment can be distributed as needed down the line. Even a small pin by an individual manager now has a commonly recognised and practised behaviour across the company. And that recognition is a better understood narrative than the medley that one often sees. * Dissemination of recognition: More than just the recognition, the how of recognition is a strategic issue. People don’t want to only feel good personally from the award. They feel more charged when peers, friends and family get to know. Whether virtual or physical, there are so many ways of recognition today. Even a small note or a gift for a parent or a spouse complimenting the employee’s good deed can be powerful. In the current ‘Work From Anywhere’ reality, virtual opportunities are multiple. However, there is nothing like a personal touch. A recognition loses its entire appeal either when it comes too late or feels sterile. Recognition must always have a soul. Technology can help in accuracy and spread but recognition must never feel robotised. This is a huge danger that I sense in many recognition trends. Recognition, I have always maintained, must not become a surrogate for some financial reward. I never advise recognition to have a financial accompaniment. And it should not be a cheap and rampant giveaway. It must be more sublime. It must be more powerful. It must be more differentiating. It must be a powerful signalling. It must be a smarter strategic lever. Finally, it must celebrate people as it recognises the behaviour and impact you seek from them. It must count for far more than what money can buy.

Several other civic bodies are also considering to do so in view of the increasing number of bodies being brought in daily for cremation. Ten to eleven bodies are brought daily over the past few weeks in the crematoriums where the working hours have been extended. Sources said the crematorium authorities have been receiving calls from people and from local leaders even at late night to get the bodies cremated. “We have been cremating 10-11 bodies daily over the past three weeks. There was some relief on Saturday and Sunday, as only six bodies were cremated in the past two days,” said Murali, who works at a crematorium in Tripunithura, which has been allowed to operate at night as well. Ernakulam has witnessed hundreds of Covid deaths over the past few weeks, while the figures released by the government are low. Sources in the health department said according to the reports received from the different hospitals in Ernakulam, as many as 282 people died due to Covid in the first 10 days of May, but according to the data from the dashboard of the state government only 40 deaths have been declared as Covid fatalities during the same period. Similarly, though according to the hospital records, as many 252 people died of Covid in the month of April, the government dashboard has reported only 46 Covid-related deaths during the same period. As per the data provided by Suchitwa Mission, there are 37 crematoriums in panchayats and 20 in urban limits in Ernakulam. “We used to cremate one or two bodies daily following Covid protocols. Now, it has risen to six to seven a day,” said A V Ramdas, caretaker of Pachalam crematorium owned by Kochi Corporation. “As the body of a Covid patient is brought wrapped in a PPE kit, we pour diesel around it after placing it on the woods and burn it. We open the chamber only after three to four hours. The corporation should allow us to extend the working hours as we receive even late night calls,” Ramdas added. Experts in the health sector opine suppressing actual death tolls will have negative ramifications in the days to come. “Such hiding of facts will give an impression among the public that the situation is not serious. More significantly, covering up information about the death of people suffering from comorbidities will not help us in anyway. If there is no correct data, we cannot say whether vaccination is helping to prevent mortality or not. It is the duty of the doctor who treated the patient to say whether the person died of Covid or not, said Dr Arun N M, internal medicine expert in Palakkad. “If the duty doctor indicates in the death report that the underlying cause of death is Covid, such cases should be declared as Covid fatality. Though the doctors report Covid as the cause of death, the state Covid death audit committee has been discarding the reports,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/as-deaths-rise-working-time-of-crematoriums-extended/articleshow/82688699.cms||---

A division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Kumar, while hearing a batch of three PILs on the grim pandemic situation in the state, orally observed that it would get the issue of oxygen demand and consumption at PMCH inspected by an independent committee. Senior counsel P K Shahi, who appeared for the PMCH, admitted that there were some shortcomings in the use of oxygen which have been rectified. He also apprised the court that a pressure swing absorption oxygen manufacturing plant would be installed at PMCH with the help of Linde, a private gas manufacturing firm, by May 30. The plant, he said, would become functional by the first week of June and would be able to refill 2,000 cylinders per day. After pulling up the PMCH on the issue, the bench ordered that it must file an affidavit to apprise the court what steps it has taken taken to resolve the issue. It was amicus curiae Mrigank Mauli who had submitted a detailed report on several wards based on mathematical calculation that logbooks were showing excess consumption of oxygen cylinders than what should have been consumed looking at the number of patients in the wards who were kept on oxygen support. In the report, which was submitted after inspection of PMCH by Mauli on May 2, it was also mentioned that consumption of four jumbo-size oxygen cylinders were shown in logbooks of gynaecology ward even as no patient was kept on oxygen support. Meanwhile, the high court has asked the Patna Municipal Corporation commissioner to file a reply on collection and disposal of the biomedical wastes like Covid-19 kits, PPE kits and other related items. The court has also asked the medical superintendent of ESIC Hospital at Bihta to file a personal affidavit on the functioning of the hospital and availability of infrastructure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hc-seeks-pmch-reply-on-consumption-of-o2/articleshow/82748040.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Incidentally, the officials of district administration and drug controller office besides the police personnel of the Economic Offences Unit (EOU) of state police are involved in such raids after receiving complaints from the family members of the patients. Otherwise, people are arrested immediately if found selling drugs on black market or charging exorbitantly for providing ambulance services in similar situations. The only hospitals in which arresting was made are Unique hospital at Shastri Nagar and Rainbow hospital on SP Verma Road, Patna. On May 13, the EOU had arrested Unique hospital staff Dhupendra Kumar and Raju Kumar for allegedly selling oxygen cylinders for Rs50,000 each. Hospital director Abul Wafa is evading arrest. Rainbow hospital director Ashfaq Ahmed was arrested on May 6 for selling Remdesivir injection on black market. An FIR was registered against Shyam hospital at Hanuman Nagar under Kankarbagh police station on Monday for exponentially overcharging Covid patients for beds and medicines. The drug controller team raided Sai hospital at 900feet Road also under Kankarbagh police station and got an FIR registered against it also on Monday for similar irregularities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/exorbitant-drug-prices-few-arrested-after-raids/articleshow/82748156.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Patna||Patna: Doctors sound note of caution amid rise in corona cases among children||PATNA: The second wave of Covid-19 has not only affected the youth, but several children as well. The deadly virus claimed the lives of many kids being treated at city hospitals in April and May. According to health experts, most kids were asymptomatic last year, but now Covid positive children have symptoms like vomiting, diarrhoea, breathlessness, chest congestion, rashes, cough and high fever. Some of them even require hospitalisation and emergency care. Dr Sanjeev Kumar, the nodal officer for Covid-19 at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna (AIIMS-P), told this newspaper that during the first wave, senior citizens and people with comorbidities were generally admitted to hospitals. “The second wave, on the contrary, is not just infecting young people, but children as well. Two kids, including a four-year-old girl and a 20-day-old baby, died of Covid recently,” he added. Of the 1,284 patients admitted to the Covid ward of the AIIMS-P since March 22, 37 were children. Five of them died due to Covid-19 in the last one month. “At present, two kids — a four-month-old and a three-year-old — are undergoing treatment at the hospital. They are stable and will recover soon,” Dr Sanjeev said, adding that medicines like Remdesivir and blood thinners were not given to kids as they responded well to conservative treatment. At the Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH), four kids have died of Covid-19 while three are being treated by doctors of the paediatrics department. The hospital’s nodal officer for Covid, Dr Mukul Kumar Singh, said, “During the first wave, a few newborns had tested Covid positive because their mothers were infected. This year, however, everybody is being affected. The increasing casualties among youngsters have also become a matter of concern.” An associate professor at the NMCH, Dr B P Jaiswal, claimed that a third wave was likely to occur in October or November, but “it may not be very severe because most people will get vaccinated by then”. The Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences has also geared up to tackle the rise in Covid cases among children. The hospital’s medical superintendent Dr Manish Mandal said, “We have a 40-bed ward for kids with six ventilators. The paediatrics intensive care unit (ICU) has eight beds with two ventilators and the newborn ICU has four beds.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/docs-sound-note-of-caution-amid-rise-in-corona-cases-among-kids/articleshow/82748254.cms||Faryal Rumi

The 30-share index closed 613 points higher at 50,193. On the NSE, the Nifty closed 185 points higher at 15,108 — also a month-high level. Mid and smallcap stocks saw some hectic buying, brokers said. “The frontline indices closed the day’s trading with over 1.2% gains, while the midcap index (up 1.9%) and the smallcap index (1.3%) clocked much higher gains. The fall in the total number of new Covid cases across the country below the 3-lakh-per-day mark and the likely enhanced availability of vaccines in the coming weeks helped repair sentiment to a certain extent,” Emkay Wealth Management head (research) Joseph Thomas wrote in a post-market note. In the coming days, the “market may focus on the sustainability of the gains in the fight against the pandemic”, and the inflation numbers in light of rising fuel prices to get more comfort on the growth front”, Thomas added. Among the sensex stocks, HDFC Bank contributed the most to the sensex’s rise, followed by RIL and Bajaj Finance. Of the 30 index constituents, five closed in the red with Bharti Airtel, down 2.4%, contributing the most to the loss. The day’s rally also added nearly Rs 3 lakh crore to investors’ wealth with BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 218.7 lakh crore. In the last one month, BSE’s m-cap grew almost Rs 15 lakh crore. Technically, the Nifty crossing 15k is a major milestone for the index. According to Kotak Securities’s executive VP (equity technical research) Shrikant Chouhan, the Nifty closing above 15,100 (on Tuesday) is definitely a positive for the market. We may see consolidation between the levels of 15,000 and 15,200. However, in the near term, markets have set targets of 15,450 and 15,600.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sensex-regains-50k-on-drop-in-new-covid-cases/articleshow/82750367.cms||---
---||Patna||Mines secretary asks DGP to stop illegal sand mining||PATNA: Mines and geology department principal secretary Harjot Kaur Bamhrah has written to DGP S K Singhal on Sunday for strict action against the police personnel who were helping the mafia in illegal sand mining and its transportation. Videos had gone viral a few days back showing police vehicles escorting trucks overloaded with illegally mined sand.The secretary has pointed out in the letter that illegal mining, storage and transportation of the sand is not possible from the bordering areas of districts like Patna, Bhojpur, Saran, Aurangabad and Rohtas without the connivance of the police personnel concerned.The alleged rampant illegal sand mining in the five districts started after private firms having tenders for mining sand from hundreds of ghats in the five districts stopped their work due to frequent attack by criminals and lack of security from the administration.In fact, the lockdown paved the way for the organised gangs to carry out illegal sand mining.At least two separate videos had surfaced in the last three days in which police vehicles could be seen moving with trucks overloaded with illegally mined sand. Sources said both the videos are from Bhojpur district.Bamhrah has also written to the DGP that serious complaints of illegal sand mining were being received from the bordering areas of the five districts besides media reports of police vehicles ‘escorting’ trucks loaded with illegal sand. She has asked the DGP to direct the senior police officers in districts to stop illegal sand mining and maintain vigilance by deploying the required police personnel.This is the second time in the last ten days that the secretary has written a letter regarding illegal mining.Earlier, on May 7, she had first written to the DMs and SPs of the districts concerned to stop illegal sand mining.Attempts was made to contact ADG (headquarters) Jitendra Kumar, but his official cellphone was found switched off.DGP Singhal also could not be contacted on his official cellphone number as a police personnel responded that the number was with the control room. It is the same contact number, which was released by the IPRD in mid-January this year after a complaint to CM Nitish Kumar during an event that the DGP doesn’t pick up the phone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/mines-secretary-asks-dgp-to-stop-illegal-sand-mining/articleshow/82747640.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: After experts’ nod, final vax panel OK awaited on jabs for pregnant women||Mumbai: There is a growing demand for vaccination of pregnant and lactating women who face a high risk of Covid infection. Following a recommendation by a national expert panel in their favour last week, the Centre said it was weighing the pros and cons. “Let the official decision come,” Dr Vinod K Paul, Niti Aayog’s member-health, told TOI. Countries like the US, UK, Belgium and Israel have started vaccinating pregnant women. Last week, the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) recommended that pregnant and lactating women may be offered either of the two available Covid vaccines — Covishield or Covaxin. The recommendation has been sent to the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC) for its nod. Stating that pregnant women should be informed about the risks and benefits associated with the vaccines, NTAGI recommended creating an educational tool that would inform them about the risk of Covid during pregnancy, benefits of vaccination and rare complications associated with vaccines, such as thrombosis and thrombocytopenia (with Covishield). The experts said lactating women can receive the vaccines any time after delivery. Earlier, the Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India (Fogsi) had stated the protection of vaccination should be extended to pregnant women and lactating mothers. “The very real benefits of vaccinating pregnant and lactating women seem to far outweigh any theoretical and remote risks associated with vaccination,” the largest body of gynaecologists in India had said. “A substantial increase in the incidence and severity of Covid has been seen in pregnant women in the second wave. The risk of severity and death is at least 4-5 times more in a pregnant woman with Covid compared to one who doesn’t have it,” said Dr Alpesh Gandhi, president, Fogsi. The body has been maintaining a registry of cases and deaths among pregnant women. “The numbers have been so overwhelming that many of our members are still updating the database. But there is no doubt that the second wave has seen far higher mortalities, and hence they need the protection from vaccines,” he added. Members of the state Covid task force said they haven’t made any recommendations and will wait for the central guidelines. Dr Sanjay Oak, task force chairman, said: “There is scant evidence about vaccination during pregnancy and we should follow national guidelines.” Another member, Dr Shashank Joshi, too said there is need for more data. A study in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology has shown pregnant women make Covid antibodies after vaccination and transfer them to their foetuses. “It was an added benefit,” said Gandhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-after-experts-nod-final-vax-panel-ok-awaited-on-jabs-for-pregnant-women/articleshow/82751210.cms||---
---||Patna||Rudy denies role in Pappu’s arrest||PATNA/CHHAPRA: The BJP’s Saran MP, Rajiv Pratap Rudy, on Tuesday denied any role in the arrest of former MP and Jan Adhikar Party (Loktantrik) chief Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav in a 32-year-old kidnapping case lodged in Madhepura district. An arrest warrant was issued by the court against him in March this year. “I have not sent him to jail. I do not have this capacity,” Rudy said. Pappu was arrested around a week after he ‘raided’ the community centre located at Amnour in Saran district that Rudy manages. Pappu pointed to the 50 parked ambulances there in spite of the coronavirus pandemic. While Rudy did not take the name of Pappu even once in his virtual interaction with the media, he also said, “The arrest, for some reason, might have been delayed.” Rudy said he himself had no “profile of a whistleblower, nor of conscience-keeper, nor even of a Robindhood” like Pappu had. In his vigilantism, he has combined the role of even police “DGP and what not”, when he even visited the Covid wards of the hospitals without taking care that he could have himself developed infection and also infected others, even at his own home. “As his election affidavit says, he (read Pappu) was involved in 32 cases and there is no crime in the CrPC that he has not committed. Besides, during the 2014 parliamentary election that he lost, he had hidden 14 other cases from the Election Commission,” Rudy alleged. He insisted that Pappu had indulged in mudslinging against his political profile at a press conference held at Patna, besides “raiding” the premises of the Amnour community centre near which is located his own ancestral house. From the centre, the ambulance services for public use at the level of panchayats are being coordinated and managed under his overall care and supervision for the last 10 years in the full knowledge of the Saran district administration, Rudy said, adding: “There could have been some mistakes, some errors. Still, it is the best-run ambulance service in the country.” Pappu had claimed that the ambulances had been withdrawn from public use on the plea that drivers were not available. Showing the letter he had written to the Saran DM, Rudy said he had sought the services of drivers from the district administration days before Pappu had appeared at the community centre. “My only plea to you (read Pappu) is that don’t speak lies and do not level charges without any rhyme or reason. You have spoken against PM, CM, Union home minister and several others and made baseless charges against doctors, frontline health workers, drug dealers, traders and the police,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rudy-denies-role-in-pappus-arrest/articleshow/82747959.cms||Abhay Singh

A delegation of NVCC led by its president Ashwin Mehadia met additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi and submitted a memorandum urging relaxation in restrictions and allowing traders of non-essential items to restart their businesses. Traders also met municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B. Shops of non-essentials are facing restrictions since March 2021. Last year, traders faced the lockdown which crippled their finances for eight months. Though the Maharashtra government ordered restrictions from April 2021 and extended it till May 30, the city is under lockdown from March itself. Traders also pointed out that the government has not announced any relief package for them and instead, it has made taxation rules stringent by imposing a penalty for not filing or paying taxes. NVCC vice-president Sanjay Agrawal pointed out that traders are the backbone of the economy and if the present situation continues, the country’s economy will collapse. Lakhs of people employed by non-essential shops are facing hardships due to no salaries for the past several months, the delegation pointed out. The civic chief said if traders assure strict compliance of Covid-19 protocols, the state disaster management committee can take a decision to start business activities from June 1.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/allow-non-essential-shops-to-reopen-nvcc/articleshow/82751120.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

As many as six flights were cancelled due to inclement weather conditions and 13 others due to operational reasons. IndiGo and SpiceJet cancelled one flight each to and from Ahmedabad. SpiceJet cancelled its flights to Pune and Hyderabad while IndiGo cancelled one flight to Delhi and GoAir its Mumbai flight. Patna-Mumbai flight (6E-9112) departed late while G8-352 arrived late by more than 45 minutes, which delayed its departure as well. Altogether 23 flights landed at Patna airport on Tuesday while 22 departed. The number of flights at city airport has already gone down from 48 to 42 since April last week and it was further reduced to 27-28 by May-mid due to the lockdown amid the Covid pandemic. The airport’s deputy general manager (air traffic management), Santosh Kumar, said only few fights got cancelled because of bad weather conditions while several others were cancelled due operational reasons. “The number of flights at Patna airport has reduced to 26-32 due to low occupancy in aeroplanes. The airlines cancelled the flights on their own,” he said, adding that he was not aware of any diversion of Patna-bound flights due to the cyclone affect. Flyers rued flights cancellation. One Dhiraj Kumar from Chappra said he got the message about the rescheduling of Patna-Hyderabad flight for the next day. “The airlines did not mention the reason. However, I have to travel today at any cost,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/six-flights-cancelled/articleshow/82747917.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Cyclone Tauktae kills 17, leaves coastal villages wrecked||RAJKOT/AHMEDABAD: At least 17 people died as cyclone Tauktae ravaged coastal districts of Saurashtra after crashing into the coast near Diu and Una late on Monday night at a speed of nearly 165 kmph. Five deaths were reported in Bhavnagar district alone, while eight other districts including Amreli, Gir-Somnath, Panchamahal accounted for rest of the casualties. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to conduct an aerial survey of worst-hit districts on Wednesday, top sources in the state government told TOI. After passing the night holed up inside their houses and shelters, people woke up to the scenes of wreckage all around them as Tauktae left a devastating trail in coastal districts Gir-Somnath, Junagadh, Amreli and Bhavnagar districts Flattened houses, tin sheds scattered all around, blown away roofs, inundated fields, broken roads, thousands of fallen trees and collapsed electricity poles all along the 200 km coast from Bhavnagar to Junagadh spoke volumes about cyclone effect that left people speechless with its sheer ferocity. Hundreds of villages will remain in dark due to heavy damage to transmission infrastructure and electricity poles. CM Vijay Rupani said the situation was expected to return to normal by Wednesday. “We have been able to contain the damage to life and property to the minimum,” he said. The Indian Coast Guard also rescued eight fishermen onboard a fishing boat which had drifted into the sea off Veraval harbour, officials said. Tauktae was particularly unsparing on the union territory of Diu which is now a far cry from the ever-bustling picturesque island it used to be barely four days ago. Sources said hotels in Diu suffered heavy damages as many glass doors and windows were shattered due to strong winds. The cyclone was predicted to weaken into a deep depression by late night. Una taluka, just a few km away from Diu, has been virtually cut off from the rest of the districts. Gir-Somnath collector Ajay Prakash told TOI that the formal communication system has collapsed in Una. "Around 2,000 trees got uprooted in Una, Gir-Gadhda and Kodinar and there is no electricity since last Monday night." In Amreli districts, 18 Covid hospitals were on the edge as the cyclone resulted in a massive power outage in over 600 villages. PGVCL teams were working on war-footing to restore power supply to hospitals on priority. Thousands of coconut trees, which have been cooling the eyes of travellers on the coastal highway, were either half-broken or fallen by the roadside or orchards. By late afternoon, Tauktae charged into Ahmedabad, bringing in heavy rain and gusty winds that left many commuters scampering to save themselves from huge hoardings that flew off from tall buildings.

The allocation of doses for people above 45 years, or for the 18-44-year category is decided by the Centre,” said Dr G Srinivasa Rao, director of public health, Telangana. “They have indicated that some more doses will be issued in the next 15 days. After receiving it, people due for second dose of Covaxin will be administered,” added Dr Rao. With the increase of interval for the first and second dose of Covidshield from 12 to 16 weeks, currently no one is due for the second dose, said the official. Separately, a committee has also been formed to approve requests for anti-fungal injections (for mucormycosis commonly known as black fungus infections). There are roughly 90 cases of the infection currently in the state, according to authorities. “A treatment protocol has been developed by experts which will be followed in government hospitals. Responding to the shortage of injections for treating mucormycosis, these have been made available at government designated hospitals now,” said the official. “While these are not the main line of treatment, these are required after surgically removing the affected part. These have been made available at the government ENT hospital and the Gandhi Hospital,” added the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/wait-for-second-dose-gets-longer/articleshow/82751131.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Ahmedabad||Cyclone Tauktae: Heavy damage to mangoes, large salt crop washed away in Gujarat||AHMEDABAD/SURAT: Heavy and gusty winds joined by intense spell of rains have wreaked havoc on mango and salt crops. While the cyclone has ravaged 50-70% mangoes in Saurashtra and South Gujarat, a massive 10-15 lakh tonnes of salt lying in mounds across different areas has been washed away. Mango farmers from Gir-Somnath, Junagadh, Amreli and Bhavnagar, where tons of mouth-watering Kesar mangoes used to grow, are staring at huge losses as mango trees were devastated due to the heavy rains accompanied by strong wind currents. “The bigger trees have faced the maximum damage as 70% of fruits from these trees have fallen,” said D K Varu, head of Department of Fruit Science at Junagadh Agriculture University. “The cyclone struck at the correct harvesting time. Had it been 10 to 20 days later, farmers would have sold their crops and made money,” he added. In south Gujarat too, a loss of 50% of fruits is estimated in the bigger trees. “We have never seen such damage to our crops as well as to our trees. Farmers are going to face a severe economic burden as this was the season of making money,” said Bharat Desai, a farmer from Killa-Pardi in Valsad district. The annual turnover of mangoes in south Gujarat is estimated to be around Rs 400 to Rs 500 crore. Estimates by Indian Salt Manufacturers’ Association (ISMA) suggest that at least 10-15 lakh tonne crop lying on salt mounds in various parts of Gujarat couldn’t be moved out ahead of the cyclone was destroyed and with heavy rainfall, as per estimates by Indian Salt Manufacturers’ Association (ISMA). “More than 5-inch rainfall in various parts of Saurashtra and the entire stock of harvested salt could not be moved from the salt mounds. This is a clear loss of production. A lot of salt was also being crystalised in salt pans which would also be washed out,” said Bharat Raval, president, ISMA. According to estimates, salt manufacturing is gravely impacted in the coastal belts of Amreli, Junagadh, Bhavnagar and Bharuch districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/heavy-damage-to-mangoes-large-salt-crop-washed-away/articleshow/82750202.cms||Niyati Parikh

Farmers on 1.75 lakh acres in Kurnool, Kadapa, Nellore and Chittoor districts are expected to benefit after completion of lining works for the canals and upgradation of capacity of local tanks. Delay in taking up of modernisation of Telugu Ganga canal has deprived farmers of nearly 30 to 35 per cent of the ayucut with irrigation water. Successive governments have failed to complete the lining of the main canal as well as strengthening of local reservoirs. This has resulted in poor flow in the canals even during the peak flood season. The government set its focus on the modernisation of the Telugu Ganga project soon after Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy took over the reins of the state. “We have already spent close to Rs 152 crore on modernisation of Telugu Ganga project to bring the designed ayucut into cultivation. A long-pending grievance in the Rayalaseema region would be resolved shortly,” said irrigation engineer-in-chief Chinnaganta Narayana Reddy. Sources said the irrigation department has lined up several works at a cost of Rs 300 crore. According to official sources, modernisation of canals would help divert about 59 tmc of water from the Krishna and the Penna during the flood season to local reservoirs. Lining of nearly 8-km-long link canal constructed from Banakacherla cross to Veligodu reservoir and development of 18-km-long main canal between Veligodu reservoir to Bramham Sagar are expected to take water in full capacity during the season. “This project alone can save around 18 tmc water if upgraded to store full capacity,” said a senior irrigation official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/govt-fast-tracks-modernisation-of-telugu-ganga-project-canals/articleshow/82749206.cms||Samdani MN

The CM asked the officials to ensure that no outsiders, other than people coming to take meals, get entry inside the centres and unnecessary crowd such places. The six kitchen centres inspected on Tuesday are located at the Bankipore Girls’ High School, Patna High School, Saidpur canal Rain Basera, NMCH, Rajkiya High School, Mangal Talab, and the College of Commerce. The CM also spoke to some of the beneficiaries about the facilities and quality of foods being provided to them. All the beneficiaries to whom the CM spoke to through videoconferencing lauded the food quality and other arrangements made at the centres. Nitish also asked the beneficiaries about the timing of taking meal and how many times in a day and also asked about the food items and did they face any difficulty in getting meal from the government-run kitchens? Kedar Saw at Bankipore Girls’ High School told the CM, “We are taking both meals every day. The quality of food is very good. The taste is better than what we eat at home. We do not face any difficulty here. All the arrangements are good.” Phool Kumari, another beneficiary of the same centre, said, “My husband pulls a cycle-rickshaw for livelihood. We both come here for daily meals. The quality of meal is very good.” Raj Amrit at the NMCH centre also praised the food quality and other arrangements made for the poor people. Earlier, the officers present at the centres, informed the CM about the various facilities available at their respective centres.After the virtual tour to the centres, Nitish said it is a matter of happiness that the beneficiaries taking meals at the community kitchens are satisfied with the quality of food and other arrangements||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cm-reviews-facilities-at-six-community-kitchens/articleshow/82747523.cms||Madan Kumar

Tejashwi, in his letter addressed to CM Nitish Kumar and released on social media, said some leaders were doing social service at community kitchens for the sake of photo opportunity. The leader of the opposition in the state assembly said he would like to personally supervise the activities of the legislators and appealed to the CM to see that the “government ensures that patients and their attendants are not inconvenienced and the administration and doctors do not stop their work”. Tejashwi alleged that the health department had failed in providing beds, life-saving drugs and oxygen cylinders to the needy patients. He said the need for writing the letter and seeking prior permission had arisen because he himself had been “slapped with police cases on numerous occasions as and when he came out on the roads to raise the matters of public concern as his constitutional duty and right.” Meanwhile, Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) spokesman Danish Rizwan countered Tejashwi, saying that he was “doing politics during the coronavirus pandemic” and should stop writing “ulool-julool” (nonsensical) letters to the CM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/allow-us-to-serve-covid-patients-tejashwi-to-cm/articleshow/82747821.cms||Abhay Singh

The government has promised not only to fast-track such investment proposals through a special committee but also ensure that these investors get required infrastructure and skilled manpower in a rapid manner. The state government cleared the much awaited Electronics Policy by offering several sops to industrialists. The policy, which will be in force till 2024, is designed to expand its footprint in the electronics sector. “The state government will offer infrastructure coupled with other resources critical to the growth of the electronics manufacturing industry. Additionally, the government would also develop sub-sector specific parks and MSME parks for electronics manufacturing wherever feasible,” said industries minister Mekapati Gautham Reddy. The minister pointed out that land allotment to electronics industry would be done by a designated agency only on the recommendations of Consultative Committee on Information Technology and Electronic Industry (CCITEI), comprising experts from the government. The government has also decided to allow investors for mixed land usage, up to 25 per cent of the developed land. For industries that will invest Rs 500 crore or provide employment to at least 4,000 people in the electronics manufacturing unit, the government has decided to offer customised packages. “Creating large-scale employment in the thrust areas of mobile phones, consumer electronics, industrial electronics, electronics components and strategic electronics is the main objective of the policy,” said IT principal secretary G Jayalakshmi, adding the government has set its focus on creating a robust infrastructure for the electronics manufacturing industry in the form of electronics manufacturing clusters (EMCs) along with plug-and-play manufacturing sheds, capitalising on growth in domestic consumption, creating an industry-ready talent pool and fulfilling demands for skilled human resource. Jayalakshmi said the government would give priority to fast growing sub-sectors such as mobile phones, consumer electronics, strategic electronics across traditional assembly and electronic component manufacturing including batteries, screens, camera modules and printed circuit boards (PCBs).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/govt-woos-large-investors-in-electronics-sector-with-sops/articleshow/82762134.cms||Samdani MN

Nearly 7,439 healthcare workers (HCWs), frontline workers (FLWs) as well as the 45-plus class took the first and second dose in the district on Tuesday. In all, 4,021 took the jab in the city and 3,418 in rural parts of the district despite availability of Covishield and Covaxin doses. Vaccination was badly affected in the city in nine out of the of 12 days until May 12 due to lack of doses. Inoculation resumed on May 13 after doses were supplied. In all, 22,591 took the jab in the district on May 13 followed by 12,180 on May 14 and 24,379 on May 15. The number of beneficiaries dropped to 7,046 on May 16 and increased to 9,539 on May 17. Again, vaccination declined to 7,439 on May 17. TOI on May 13 had reported how 1,25,310 people were due for the second dose in the district as they completed the 42-day cycle after the first dose. “The government revised the interval between two doses of Covishield from 6-8 weeks to 12-16 weeks on May 13 and the orde was implemented here on May 14. Therefore, the number of second dose beneficiaries went down. A large number in the 45-plus group is yet to take the first dose. We are finding reasons behind eligible people not coming for inoculation. We also started two centres for drive-in vaccination where the 45-plus were also permitted from Tuesday,” NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi told TOI. NMC officials said less than 4,000 doses are available at the centres. “Vaccination will be affected on Wednesday if more than 4,000 turn up. We were likely to get the fresh stock on Tuesday which got changed to Wednesday,” they said. The NMC is permitting only the second dose of Covaxin since the last six days. A few 45-plus people are waiting for the first dose to resume. “I’m waiting for the first dose of Covaxin for my relative for the last 15 days but not able to get it either at GMCH or Mahal Diagnostic Centre,” said K Pandey, a resident of Jaffar Nagar. City police, in collaboration with the NMC, have decided to vaccinate 5,785 senior citizens, including 212 staying alone, who are enrolled with their special cell. City police chief Amitesh Kumar said cops would also pick up and drop the senior citizens at their places. City police’s ‘senior citizen’ cell members would get shots of Covidshield at the police hospital at Takli soon. Vehicles of the all-women ‘Damini squad’ would be used to ferry them during the drive. “The vaccine drive is the extension of our commitment to the security, safety and well-being of senior citizens. Th police department felt the vaccination drive for senior citizens too is a part of our responsibility as we are going through a turbulent phase,” said Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vax-drops-in-district-likely-to-hit-city-today-due-to-shortage/articleshow/82751088.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Coimbatore||Test positivity rate remains at 30% in district||Coimbatore: The district recorded 3,071 fresh cases of Covid-19 on Tuesday, taking the tally to 1,21,884, of which 95,028 have recovered so far. The test positivity rate remained at an alarming 30% on the day. With only 1,305 patients getting discharged, the number of active cases rose to 25,951. The recovery rate has come down to 77.9%. The district also recorded 19 Covid deaths, taking the toll to 905. Four of the 19 victims were aged between 30 and 40. Only one of them had comorbidities - tuberculosis - and that patient died after 18 days of hospitalization. The remaining three, who were aged 32, 33 and 35, didn’t have any comorbidities. Another three victims were in the age group of 40-50 years. There continue to be deaths within 24 to 48 hours of hospitalization. “None of the deaths were due to shortage of oxygen. It was because the patients were referred to CMCH or a bigger private hospital in the last minute,” an official said. On Tuesday, the number of ambulances lined up inside and outside CMCH with people desperate for an oxygen bed or even a few hours of oxygen grew. Even the oxygen bus and the zero delay centre with oxygen beds were fully occupied throughout the day. There were just six oxygen beds—two oxygen and four ventilator beds available. Many private hospitals reported a severe shortage of oxygen supply over the past two days. “We are not admitting any new oxygen requiring patients because even for the existing patients, oxygen supply is a touch and go,” said officials at both Ganga Hospital and VGM Hospital. “Oxygen supply for the past two days from suppliers has been extremely low. Coimbatore is yet to get its allotment forcing us into refusing patients,” said another official from Sri Ramakrishna Hospital. Besides the fact that the district continues to record the second-highest number of fresh cases, after Chennai, the number of daily fresh cases recorded by the district has doubled in the last two weeks. The district which crossed the 1,500-mark on May 4, saw it touch 3,000 cases on May 13. It has been recording more than 3,200 cases on and off, registering a 112% increase. However, the growth rate seems slower than Trichy and Erode where the number of cases has almost quadrupled. While Salem has ensured that there has been no spike in cases, Madurai has seen a rate of increase of hardly 28.4%. “Madurai had seen a massive spike in the first wave itself and numbers Coimbatore and Trichy never saw. Besides the assumption that Madurai probably has more herd immunity, we think Coimbatore being an industrial town with its industries continuing to be open is probably a reason for the rate of increase,” said a health department official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/test-positivity-rate-remains-at-30-in-district/articleshow/82751097.cms||---

At least 18 lions were reported missing from the coastal districts of Amreli, Gir Somnath and Bhavnagar which bore maximum brunt of the cyclone. Senior forest officials said that 18 lions were reported missing from Rajula and Jafrabad taluka of Amreli, Una and Kodinar talukas in Gir Somnath and Mahuva taluka of Bhavagar. The three districts are reportedly home to 40 lions. "We have our fingers crossed over the well being of the lions in these coastal districts. Even as there is apprehension that the lions may have got swept away due to ferocious rains, we hope the Big Cats took refuge in high altitude areas," said a senior official in Saurashtra. Beginning Wednesday, the state forest department will undertake a comprehensive survey of all 674 lions across Gir and neighbouring revenue areas to ascertain Cyclone Tauktae's impact. Of these, some 340 lions are reported to live in revenue areas outside the Gir sanctuary. Meanwhile, bird lovers were aghast with images of bird chicks scattered around dead under trees as the little one's could not survive the deadly blow of cyclone. Images emerging from Greater Gir, which is part of the Asiatic lions’ landscape today, led to shock and concern. Visuals of juvenile cattle egrets, herons and other birds, being crushed to death after falling from treetops offered insight into the trail of destruction that the cyclone had left for wildlife at Greater Gir. "Herons, egrets and cormorants' nest in colonies of hundreds in trees and hence the loss of bird lives could be large,” said Uday Vora, a retired forest officer and an avid birder. He said that insectivorous birds including drongos and golden orioles would also have built nests at this time in Gir. In Babara, about 650 small birds resembling chicks of babblers and sparrows have succumbed to the cyclone, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/18-lions-go-missing-hundreds-of-chicks-dead-in-greater-gir/articleshow/82750157.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

The elephant named ‘Mitthu’ is likely to become part of a team of jumbos used for patrolling in Dudhwa National Park in a month or two. Except for a daily ride of two-three kilometre, Mitthu remains tied with iron chains at KWLD compound in Ramnagar. Varanasi divisional forest officer Dinesh Singh said, “We have completed all formalities, and taken permission of CJM court and forest department for shifting this 400-year-old jumbo to Dudhwa National Park. A team from Dudhwa will come with a special truck to take Mitthu.” The elephant was passing through Paranpurkala village under Baburi police station in Chandauli on October 26, 2019 while going to a Ramleela event when one Ramashankar Seth came close to it and it lost its cool. Before Mahaut Tulsiram Sonkar could control Mitthu, the latter killed Seth. He was taken into custody by KWLD officials. Mahaut Tulsiram Sonkar revealed that one PK Tiwari of Jaunpur was Mitthu’s owner and had procured it from Mohd Ahmed of Hamirpur district on a donation letter. DFO said Ahmed also could not produce genuine documents of ownership following which a case under sections of Wildlife Act was lodged and Sonkar sent to jail while Tiwari got a bail. After detailed investigation, a chargesheet was filed in the court. “So, we took all due permissions to shift Mitthu to Dudhwa for leading a normal life with other elephants. It will be trained for patrolling there,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/jailed-jumbo-mitthu-to-head-for-dudhwa-join-patrol-team/articleshow/82751103.cms||Rajeev Dikshit
---||Patna||Bihar: Assessment of death figures in ten days, says health department||PATNA: Amid the rumours over discrepancies in the number of Covid-19 deaths, the state health department has formed committees at medical college and district levels to accurately assess the number of deaths due to the Coronavirus in the state so far. Additional chief secretary (health) Pratyaya Amrit said on Tuesday that the committees would have to furnish consolidated reports of deaths under their jurisdiction in 10 days. "The idea behind this exercise is to ensure that all Covid deaths are accounted for, and no affected family is deprived of the schemes announced by the government for the pandemic," Pratyaya said in a briefing. The additional chief secretary said there are five sources of information of Covid deaths-- home isolation, Covid care centres, Dedicated Covid Health Center (DCHC), Dedicated Covid Hospital (DCH) and private hospitals. "A three-member committee at the government medical college level, comprising principal, superintendent and head of department (HoD) will do the primary verification of Covid deaths from all five identified sources," Pratyaya said. "Similarly, the district level committee comprising the civil surgeon, additional chief medical officer and any other doctor authorised by the civil surgeon will verify the Covid deaths data at the district level. The data on Covid deaths, provided by the two committees, will be analysed at the headquarters level," he added. He further said that any unreported Covid death can be brought to the notice of the officials concerned to be included in the corresponding data of the health department. Meanwhile, Pratyaya said Bihar would get 17.34 lakh doses of Covaxin and Covishield by June 1. He said 10.45 lakh doses of the vaccines for people above 45 years will arrive between May 21 and June 1. "Similarly, 6.89 lakh doses of Covishield vaccine for beneficiaries in the age group of 18 to 44 years will arrive by June 1. As on Monday, we had vaccinated 92, 58, 939 people across the state," Pratyaya said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/assessment-of-covid-death-figures-in-10-days-health-dept/articleshow/82748101.cms||Piyush Tripathi

Two members of my family have already been infected by the virus. I won’t take any risk,” said schoolteacher Ravi Kant Prasad of Kadamkuan. Sushma Devi, a housewife residing at Kankarbagh Colony, has also not cooked fish during the past five days after the Buxar event. “Now we will resume eating fish only when the disease disappears completely and the situation normalizes,” she said. There are many others who have stopped consuming fish for the time being. Malti Devi, who sells fish at Boring Road crossing, asserted that the imposition of lockdown and the reports of bodies floating in the Ganga, have adversely affected the fish sales. “Normally I used to sell 40 to 50kg of fish per day. This Sunday, I could sell only about 10kg. Fear of getting infected after consuming ‘infected’ fish’ and drastic reduction in shopping hours (8 to 10am) have resulted in the decline of sales,” she added. Niranjan of the Fish Market at Hanuman Nagar said the lockdown has affected the sales. Fear of infection has nothing to do with his sales as he deals only in pond fish brought from local water bodies. “However, the overall sales have reduced at least by 50% during the last fortnight,” he added. State fisheries department’s deputy director Dilip Kumar Singh said the disposal of bodies in the river hardly infects fish. “No study has yet been carried out by the experts on this issue so far. Bodies were found floating in the river earlier also, without casting any adverse effect on fish,” he said. Singh also said the disposal of bodies has not created any noticeable impact on the fish sales in the local market till date. “The sales of Gangetic fish have already declined due to large consumption of fish from Andhra Pradesh and also from local ponds and smaller rivers. Since catching fish from the Ganga is a group activity, it has been reduced owing to the lockdown,” he added. Experts have already ruled out Covid transmission through water bodies of suspected Covid patients. Dumping of bodies primarily leads to pollution of rivers, they claim. Patna University’s retired professor of geology N C Ghose, who has done extensive work on the qualitative aspects of the Ganga, said the river water is unique in the sense as it kills most of the bacteria coming in its contact. “This is probably due to the fact that its upper reaches pass through granitic rocks containing radioactive minerals. Hence, the radon content of Ganga water is much higher than those of other rivers,” he said, adding disposal of bodies of suspected Covid patients would hardly affect the quality of river water or its aquatic life. Meanwhile, the Union Jalshakti Ministry has reportedly asked various states, including Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, to take immediate steps to stop dumping of bodies in the river and ensuring their safe disposal with a view to protecting the quality of the river water.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/covid-impact-decline-in-fish-consumption-sales/articleshow/82748301.cms||B K Mishra

The flagship of Tata Group booked an exceptional charge of Rs 14,994 crore for restructuring its UK subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) to face the market dynamics in the automotive industry. JLR is pivoting to fully electric models by the end of this decade to get ahead of looming bans on new fossil-fuel vehicles in many countries (in the UK the ban is expected to take effect in 2030). Of the Rs 14,994-crore exceptional charge, Rs 9,606 crore was attributed to write-downs of cancelled JLR models, and the rest to other restructuring costs. Before the exceptional charge, profit was Rs 5,703 crore, Tata Motors said. Revenue from operations was up 42% to Rs 87,772 crore. The management said, while demand is improving on the back of increased Covid vaccination rates, government-imposed business restrictions to control the pandemic are likely to impact operations, including on raw material (steel) costs, supply chain situations (shortage of semiconductors worldwide) and auto loan recoveries. The company lost 47 employees to Covid in India. “We expect Q1FY22 to be relatively weak due to supply chain disruptions and rising commodity inflation and expect to improve gradually from the second quarter,” said Tata Motors. JLR reported an operating profit of Rs 5,595 crore on a revenue of Rs 66,075 crore. Earning was supported by a strong recovery in China, where sales grew 127% over Q4 of FY20. JLR’s earning is crucial for the over $100-billion Tata Group as it is being buffeted by the public health crisis. Tata Motors’ India business reported a profit of Rs 1,646 crore on a revenue of Rs 19,827 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tata-motors-hit-by-rs-7-6k-cr-q4-loss-on-rs-15k-cr-charge/articleshow/82750401.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh CM Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy pays Rs 10,000 each to over 1 lakh fishermen families||VIJAYAWADA: Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy on Wednesday disbursed Rs 119.88 crore into the accounts of 1,19,875 fishermen families, crediting Rs 10,000 each for the third consecutive year under the YSR Matsyakara Bharosa compensating the off-season ban on marine fishing. Speaking on the occasion, the chief minister said that the programme, benefiting as many as 1,19,875 families, was taken up for the uplift of fishermen who were struggling for livelihood during the lean period from April to June every year. The scheme was initiated in 2019 increasing the financial assistance from Rs 4,000 to Rs 10,000, and the state government had spent around Rs 332 crore alone on this scheme. With the welfare of fishermen being the priority, the chief minister said the government had increased the fuel subsidy from Rs 6 to Rs 9 per liter which can be redeemed instantly at 100 recognised petrol bunks. The government has also provided power at a subsidised cost of Rs 1.50 per unit to the aqua farmers despite being burdened with Rs 780 crore annually. In case of an accidental death, the state government has enhanced the ex gratia from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 10 lakh to support the family of the deceased and so far, 67 fishermen families have been provided with an assistance of Rs 6.7 crore. The chief minister said the previous government had completely neglected the welfare of fishermen and aquaculture in the state. In order to create more opportunities for the fishermen in the state and to prevent them from going to other states in search of livelihood and risking their lives, the chief minister said that eight new fishing harbours will be established. Works on four harbours are in phase one at Juvvaladinne in Nellore district, Uppada in East Godavari, Nizampatnam in Guntur and Machilipatnam in Krishna district, and underway at a cost of Rs 1,510 crore. Soon, four more harbours will be set up in Srikakulam, Visakhapatnam, West Godavari and Prakasam districts with an expenditure of Rs 1,365 crore, aiming to create employment for 80,000 fishermen. The chief minister further said that the state has set up 35 aqua labs to check the quality of aqua products, with an expenditure of Rs 50.30 crore. He said that the government has also proposed an AP Fisheries University in West Godavari district to impart expert training in aquaculture. In order to support aqua farmers, the state government is setting up 100 aqua hubs at a cost of Rs 332.9 crores, where each hub will have 120 retail shops to sell their produce directly. Currently in phase one, 25 aqua hubs are being set up across the state and works on these are in progress.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/cm-pays-rs-10k-each-to-over-1l-fishermen-families/articleshow/82749001.cms||Gopi Dara

While the cyclone has ravaged 50-70% mangoes in Saurashtra and South Gujarat, a massive 10-15 lakh tonnes of salt lying in mounds across different areas has been washed away. Mango farmers from Gir-Somnath, Junagadh, Amreli and Bhavnagar, where tons of mouth-watering Kesar mangoes used to grow, are staring at huge losses as mango trees were devastated due to the heavy rains accompanied by strong wind currents. “The bigger trees have faced the maximum damage as 70% of fruits from these trees have fallen,” said D K Varu, head of Department of Fruit Science at Junagadh Agriculture University. “The cyclone struck at the correct harvesting time. Had it been 10 to 20 days later, farmers would have sold their crops and made money,” he added. In south Gujarat too, a loss of 50% of fruits is estimated in the bigger trees. “We have never seen such damage to our crops as well as to our trees. Farmers are going to face a severe economic burden as this was the season of making money,” said Bharat Desai, a farmer from Killa-Pardi in Valsad district. The annual turnover of mangoes in south Gujarat is estimated to be around Rs 400 to Rs 500 crore. Estimates by Indian Salt Manufacturers’ Association (ISMA) suggest that at least 10-15 lakh tonne crop lying on salt mounds in various parts of Gujarat couldn’t be moved out ahead of the cyclone was destroyed and with heavy rainfall, as per estimates by Indian Salt Manufacturers’ Association (ISMA). “More than 5-inch rainfall in various parts of Saurashtra and the entire stock of harvested salt could not be moved from the salt mounds. This is a clear loss of production. A lot of salt was also being crystalised in salt pans which would also be washed out,” said Bharat Raval, president, ISMA. According to estimates, salt manufacturing is gravely impacted in the coastal belts of Amreli, Junagadh, Bhavnagar and Bharuch districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/heavy-damage-to-mangoes-large-salt-crop-washed-away/articleshow/82756803.cms||Niyati Parikh

But this government is going ahead with the session when Covid-19 is severe only to meet the constitutional obligation,” alleged K Atchannaidu, deputy floor leader and TDP’s AP state president. The decision to boycott the budget session was taken at the TDP legislature party meeting on Tuesday, which was presided by party chief and former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu. Atchannaidu and Yanamala Ramakrishnudu, opposition leader in the legislative council, said the TDP will run a parallel ‘mock assembly’ to expose the failures and misdeeds of the YSRC regime. “The chief minister failed to conduct the budget session when Covid-19 cases were only 900.

The court also said that a professional body like ICAI should not silence or stifle the speech of a student or its member like it did to this student. In the 20-page order, judge Dinesh Mehta also ordered ICAI to declare the result which would show the student, Risha Lodha, as having passed the exam. It also imposed a Rs 20,000 cost on ICAI but did not impose any exemplary penalty on the CA governing body. The decision by the governing body for CAs was based on an email that Lodha had written ahead of the intermediate exams that was scheduled in November 2020. Due to fears of catching Covid infections during the physical exam, the female student had requested ICAI to develop an online system for such exams. Following this, ICAI had asked Lodha to apologise to the CA governing body, sent her a show-cause notice and to present herself in front of its disciplinary committee in Jaipur. Even though the student had apologised to ICAI and presented herself in front of its disciplinary committee, the governing body had withheld the results. When on March 26 this year Lodha checked her results on the ICAI website, she found that her results were cancelled and marked ‘Adopted unfair means’. After that, Lodha moved the Jodhpur bench of the Rajasthan HC. In its order, the judge remarked that “although the chronological facts are a handful, their culmination has been dreadful and conclusion thereof could have been doomful”. Among various shortcomings on the part of ICAI, the judge pointed out that Lodha’s email — which the CA governing body had termed as “derogatory” — was more “emotional” in nature. He also pointed out that the show-cause notice to Lodha did not mention that a possible punishment could be the cancellation of her results. Citing an SC order of 2014, the judge said “a show-cause notice should necessarily state the action which is proposed to be taken against the noticee”. It also said that as ICAI is a statutory body, “its decisions, actions and adjudication are supposed to conform to the standards expected of state or instrumentality of a state”. “A state that suppresses freedom of speech and inflicts or imposes extreme punishment treating an act or attempt of criticism and/or if it treats any suggestion for improvement as a challenge to its authority or supremacy is a state that disregards, rather violates, fundamental rights of citizens guaranteed by…our constitution.” The court also hoped that in future ICAI “will not take any such action and take any criticism in a positive stride”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rajasthan-high-court-slams-icai-for-withholding-students-results/articleshow/82750322.cms||Partha Sinha

The government has promised not only to fast-track such investment proposals through a special committee but also ensure that these investors get required infrastructure and skilled manpower in a rapid manner. The state government cleared the much awaited Electronics Policy by offering several sops to industrialists. The policy, which will be in force till 2024, is designed to expand its footprint in the electronics sector. “The state government will offer infrastructure coupled with other resources critical to the growth of the electronics manufacturing industry. Additionally, the government would also develop sub-sector specific parks and MSME parks for electronics manufacturing wherever feasible,” said industries minister Mekapati Gautham Reddy. The minister pointed out that land allotment to electronics industry would be done by a designated agency only on the recommendations of Consultative Committee on Information Technology and Electronic Industry (CCITEI), comprising experts from the government. The government has also decided to allow investors for mixed land usage, up to 25 per cent of the developed land. For industries that will invest Rs 500 crore or provide employment to at least 4,000 people in the electronics manufacturing unit, the government has decided to offer customised packages. “Creating large-scale employment in the thrust areas of mobile phones, consumer electronics, industrial electronics, electronics components and strategic electronics is the main objective of the policy,” said IT principal secretary G Jayalakshmi, adding the government has set its focus on creating a robust infrastructure for the electronics manufacturing industry in the form of electronics manufacturing clusters (EMCs) along with plug-and-play manufacturing sheds, capitalising on growth in domestic consumption, creating an industry-ready talent pool and fulfilling demands for skilled human resource. Jayalakshmi said the government would give priority to fast growing sub-sectors such as mobile phones, consumer electronics, strategic electronics across traditional assembly and electronic component manufacturing including batteries, screens, camera modules and printed circuit boards (PCBs).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/govt-woos-large-investors-in-electronics-sector-with-sops/articleshow/82749081.cms||Samdani MN

The policy has been designed to ramp up oxygen manufacturing capacity in the state from the existing 360 metric tonnes (MT) to 700 MT. It targets to set up at least 50 Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) oxygen plants in both captive model (in hospitals) and the non-captive model. The chief minister has decided to strengthen infrastructure in view of the exponential surge in demand for medical oxygen, which has touched 600-700 MT during the second wave. The state is presently producing just around 364 MT and the rest is being met through supplies from Odisha, West Bengal and Karnataka. “Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy is keen to ensure that the state doesn’t land in a precarious situation due to lack of production. The need of the hour is to rapidly augment oxygen production capacity in the state, so that reliability and self-sufficiency are achieved,” said industries minister Mekapati Gautham Reddy. Interestingly, the oxygen policy has been prepared by the department of industries in consultation with the department of health and family welfare, taking into account the need for medical oxygen. The government has also taken measures to draft the best in class policy compared to other states, such that the private sector is incentivised to participate. Mekapati said the government has already received intents from companies such as Nova Air (Sri City), Air Liqid (Kadapa), Praxair (Chittoor) and Inox Air Products (Vijayawada/Guntur) to augment oxygen production capabilities in the state. He said six sick PSA units have already been identified and refurbished for producing oxygen. Entrepreneurs have also shown interest in setting up small and medium scale oxygen (PSA) plants that can be installed in a span of three to six months and the policy has been designed to support entrepreneurs of all scales. The government is also in touch with suppliers across the globe for importing zeolite molecular sieve, a key component in PSA oxygen plants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/self-reliance-boosting-capacities-central-to-aps-new-oxygen-policy/articleshow/82762356.cms||Samdani MN

Municipal commissioner Anshul Aggrawal terminated ward jamadar and four sweepers and suspended the ward councillor soon after the fact finding team found their involvement. The action was prompted against the accused following a two-member fact finding team comprising deputy municipal commissioner Jayesh Kumar Sinha and city manager Rajeev Kumar found the claim true that the ward councillor of ward No 8 Sushil Kumar Mithu had extorted Rs 16,500 from a Jalalpur woman for the cremation of the body of her Covid suspect son Manoj Kumar alias Guddu on May 13. Sinha said the inquiry revealed that the accused had demanded Rs 22,000. The ward councillor in connivance with jamadar Sanjay Kumar, sweepers-Ajay Dom,Shankar Dom, Ganesh Dom, Sonu Dom and supervisor Parmanand Singh had carried the body on municipal corporation’s hand driven cart meant for carrying garbage to Sohsarai-based creamation ground on May 13. Nalanda DM Yogendra Kumar Singh had ordered an inquiry into the matter on Sunday after a video carrying the body on a garbage cart went viral on social media and the Jalalpur residents lodged a complaint to the DM on his mail. Confirming FIR against the accused, Sohsarai police station house officer Shyam Kishore Prasad Singh said an investigation is underway in this regard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/fir-against-nalanda-ward-councillor-six-others-for-extorting-money/articleshow/82747769.cms||Farrukh Nadim

The DM said 20 of the required 25 doctors have been recruited, which will help fight the infection more effectively. Various measures taken to tackle Covid cases in the district include increasing testing and reducing the time lag for reports, identifying containment zones and increasing vaccinations. Expressing satisfaction with the work being done by the district administration, the minister sought suggestions from Nalanda MP Kaushlendra Kumar and Nalanda MLAs on how to make health services more accessible to the rural population of the district. Nalanda MP Kaushlendra Kumar announced the setting up of three oxygen gas plants from MPLAD funds soon while presenting his views on the difficulties faced in treating oxygen-deficient Covid patients in the district. To provide immediate medical help to Covid patients, the district administration has approved Biharsharif-based Nalanda Emergency Hospital and Critical Care Centre for the treatment of Covid patients, though the facility was recently caught extorting more than the agreed sum from a Covid patient. While the daily Covid count was 211 on Tuesday, which is two less than what was reported on Sunday. Eight persons, including district child welfare officer Brajesh Kumar, died due to the infection in the past 36 hours. With this, the number of casualties crossed the 165-mark.

He also ordered tracking of high-risk contacts of Covid patients so that risk of further transmission of the virus to others could be avoided. Covid positivity rate in the district has come down to 3% from 14% in first week of this month. The district’s Covid mortality rate, on the other hand, is 0.5%, which is less than the state average of 0.58%. District magistrate Abhishek Singh has asked the ANMMCH authorities to install CCTV cameras on the ground floor of the mother-child hospital (MCH) block and the flu corner building of the hospital. “The attendants can watch the CCTV footages to know the condition of their patients,” the DM said. Amresh Kumar, an officer looking after institutional isolation, had earlier told the DM that relatives of patients are at the risk of getting infected if they are not barred from visiting the Covid ward of the hospital. The DM, however, said the attendants should be allowed to meet patients in special cases only if they wear PPE kit. The DM said a waiting hall should be made outside the isolation centre by erecting pandal where relatives can enquire about health condition of the patients from the doctors. The DM was informed at the meeting that community kitchen is functional at 27 places in the district. District programme manager (health) Nilesh Kumar said 2,034 people were in home isolation in the district till Monday. “So far, 14,15,247 samples have been tested in the district since the outbreak of the virus in March last year and results of 28,328 came positive,” Kumar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/track-high-risk-contacts-of-covid-patients-gaya-dm/articleshow/82747718.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Amul driver’s son rides in dairy honcho’s trail||AHMEDABAD: The son of an Amul company chauffeur has not only driven himself to earn an IIM-A degree but has also chosen the field he thinks is the cream of the crop — the dairy sector. At the recent placements at IIM-A, 24-year-old Hitesh Singh was selected as associate manager (new products) at Country Delight. For Singh, it was a dream come true. He always wanted to get a job in the dairy sector and follow his role model R S Sodhi, the managing director of Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF) Ltd, which markets the brand Amul. Singh’s father works as a chauffeur with GCMMF and this is how Singh got to meet Sodhi for the first time, many years ago. From then on, he was inspired by the man at the helm of India’s largest dairy cooperative. Singh sought guidance from Sodhi from time to time. “Milk is already the largest crop in terms of value for India. Currently, the organized sector contributes to only 25% of the total industry pie,” said Singh. “There is a huge potential for growth. That’s why in the past 4-5 years more and more large organized players are coming into the field.” Besides, Singh said, milk tech startups are disrupting the industry with product innovations, technological developments, and improvements in customer access. Singh, who studied in a Gujarati-medium school, was in the 97 percentile club in physics, chemistry and maths stream in Class XII exams. He has studied on scholarship from his school days and has never attended tuition classes. His mother Saritaben taught him at home. He topped in BTech in dairy technology from SMC College of Dairy Science, Anand Agricultural University. He was placed in the 96.12 percentile in the Common Admission Test (CAT). Pankaj Singh, the IIM graduate’s father, migrated with his family from a village in Bihar to Anand. He worked as a security guard initially, earning as little as Rs 600 per month. Later, he learnt driving and joined GCMMF in 2007. “I have taken a loan for education and personal expenses,” said the junior Singh. “I had some savings from the previous job. Also, the institute had provided a special need-based scholarship.” On his experience at IIM-A where he completed the Postgraduate Programme in Food and Agri-Business Management, Singh said the course gave him the best two years of his life. “Studying alongside the brightest minds in India, I grew as a person. Now, I am more aware of my strengths. That has helped in boosting my self-confidence,” he said. “Compared to the BTech education, the management course helped me gain a deeper understanding of business as a whole.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amul-drivers-son-charts-a-dairy-trailamul-drivers-son-rides-in-dairy-honchos-trail/articleshow/82750098.cms||Bharat Yagnik
---||Nagpur||Finally, Ignou gets land for new office building||Nagpur: Over two years after paying the full amount to the state government, the Indira Gandhi National Open University (Ignou) finally got possession of the allotted land through the district collectorate. The land parcel in Omkar Nagar was purchased by Ignou for Rs 2.25 crore in January 2019 directly, but since a third party claimed that the property was under dispute, the handover got entangled in the bureaucratic process. Last month, the property’s site measurement was done in the presence of officials from Ignou, district collectorate and cops and handed over the open university. The land was under the collector’s posession and had been acquired under the Urban Land Ceiling (ULC) Act. In December, TOI was the only media house to report about how Ignou was still waiting to take physical possession of the property. The issue kept on getting delayed because of a change in the state government in 2019 and then in 2020, because of Covid-19 and the subsequent national lockdown. The final push to resolve the issue started in December when Union minister Nitin Gadkari got involved. Gadkari held a meeting with the district collector Ravindra Thakre, who said that the matter would soon be resolved as the legal ownership of the land was with his department only. “The issue has been resolved by following the due process of law. It’s been clearly established now that the land’s ownership was solely with the Nagpur district collectorate, following which it was purchased by Ignou. Once the pandemic’s second wave ends, we will begin construction plans,” said P Sivawaroop, regional director of Ignou. The institution has been operating from its rented premises since 2008 and with its base expanding aggressively in Vidarbha, it made sense to have a regional centre of its own. By the end of 2022, Ignou may start operations from its new regional study centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/finally-ignou-gets-land-for-new-office-building/articleshow/82751147.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

A police officer said 26-year-old S Prabhakaran, of Malligai Nagar near Thondamuthur, was arrested on April 14 for attempting to murder his estranged 22-year-old lover. In her police complaint, the woman said she had married Gunasekaran, of Mettupalayam, five years ago after breaking up with Prabhakaran, as he used to get imprisoned in assault cases often. “Prabhakaran met Gunasekaran recently and claimed fatherhood to the boy that the latter’s wife gave birth 10 months ago. Gunasekaran fought with his wife and sent her to her mother’s house at Malligai Nagar,” the officer said. Around 8pm on April 12, the officer said, Prabhakaran met the woman at her mother’s house and fought with her. “He attempted to murder her using a sickle. However, when neighbours came to her rescue, he escaped.” Based on the woman’s complaint, the Thondamuthur police registered an attempt to murder case against Prabhakaran, arrested and lodged him in the Coimbatore Central Prison. The officer said Prabhakaran was already facing a murder case that was reported in 2014 and several other assault and theft cases. Police officials prepared a detailed report against Prabhakaran and sent that to the district collector with a request to detain him under the Goondas Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/26-year-old-detained-under-goondas-act/articleshow/82751141.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The ferocity of winds that gusted upto 170 km per hour from 9m on Monday continued for six hours till nearly 3amBut villagers woke up to the sight of horror. Ramesh Barad, a farmer in a village of Veraval said, “All the kutcha houses in Una town and surrounding villages have collapsed.”Both roads to enter Una were blocked. Due to heavy rain, clay and mud from an under construction bridge near Dolasa, 12 km from Una, got scattered everywhere on the road, making it impossible to travel. The roads that lead from Somnath to Una were also blocked by huge trees that collapsed due to wind. Ajay Prakash, collector, Gir-Somnath, told TOI that “There are around 2,000 trees uprooted and the entire machinery is engaged to open the roads. Una is cut off and the formal communication system has also collapsed. We are using our wireless system to contact our officers there.” Mobile towers are also damaged or collapsed which has disrupted the communication and internet in the entire area. According to locals, people did not even get milk in the morning as vehicles could not enter inside. Nearly 400 electricity poles collapsed and it may take four to five days for the administration to restore electricity and clear the roads. Saiyad Rajpara, Navagam, Gir-Gadhda and Kodinar have also been badly hit with nearly 700 electricity poles falling, leaving 300 villages without electricity since Monday night.

However, the BMC has extended the EoI by a week to let companies finish the required paperwork. Civic body officials said all three proposals received are for supplying Russia’s Sputnik V. While two proposals are from Indian firms, one is from a company registered abroad. Officials said they will go through the proposals, and as per the EoI, it will be the responsibility of the firms to get all approvals from the Centre. So far, the cost of the vaccines hasn’t been revealed. The BMC had last week floated a global EoI to buy 50 lakh vaccines (1 crore doses) in a bid to speed up its vaccination drive. The BMC is expecting to spend around Rs 300 crore to Rs 700 crore on the purchase of vaccines. “We have received three proposals but all the bids require more paperwork. So the EoI has been extended by a week. All three are for Sputnik. We will establish the link of these companies with the original vaccine manufacturer and scrutinise the proposals,” said P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner (Projects). BMC officials said it will also consider vaccines developed by Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-receives-proposals-from-3-cos-to-procure-vax/articleshow/82751214.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The states have not yet granted them the status of frontline warriors. Saket Badola, secretary general of the association, representing over 3,000 IFS officers and 25,000 field staff across the country, wants the matter to be taken up on a priority basis. “This action will ensure that the forest officers and the staff who are working in extremely challenging areas, often with poor healthcare facilities, and are working with forest-based communities, will get vaccinated on a priority basis, just like their colleagues in the police and revenue departments,” said Badola. “This will ensure extension of preferred healthcare support if they get infected by coronavirus during their work. Such a step will boost the confidence of the staff while carrying out their duties and dealing with the public,” said Badola. The IFS official added that, “Additionally, such an action will also reduce the risk of the virus spread from an infected staff member to the endangered animals as well as to any tribal particularly the vulnerable tribal group (PVTG), with whom they work closely.” As per the official figures, in Madhya Pradesh alone, 122 employees, including two IFS officers and five ACFs, 75 foresters and forest guards have succumbed to Covid-19 this year. “While responding to the call of duty and protecting the nation's ecological wealth, several employees ranging from IFS officials to daily wagers have succumbed to the coronavirus. The forest department remained active even during the national lockdown last year and shouldered the responsibility of helping forest-based communities,” said Badola.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-19-ifs-demands-frontline-worker-status-for-forest-staff/articleshow/82751180.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Employees who stay in different parts of the city or in the districts are unable to report to work as public transport including buses, metro and local trains have been suspended due to the ongoing restrictions. Several elderly traders and those with co-morbidities are being stopped by their families from opening their shops and stores for the fear of contracting the virus. Community markets which can remain open only between 7 am and 10 am are witnessing crowds of customers leaving very little room for social distancing. Tarak Saraf, who sells cooking oil in Tiretta Market in central Kolkata. has three employees who help him in the shop. “Only one of them is coming now as the other two stay near the airport. There is a huge rush in the shop every morning and we cannot tackle the rush. I sit at the cash counter and the employees pack, pour and package the different types of oil before handing over to customers. I kept the shop shut on Tuesday as it is very difficult to deal with customers,” said Saraf. In Nutan Bazar on Harrison Road, Mohit Singh, a retailer of pulses, has hired two local youths to help him out. The youths were working for a transport company but are out of job since restrictions came into effect last Sunday. “They don’t have much experience but they at least stand at the counter and engage with the customers. It takes up a lot of time but there is little I can do now,” said Singh. Many shop owners are contemplating shutting the business for the next few days owing to their age and health. Mohammad Ghulam Anasari, 68, has store in Tiretta Market where he sells bread, eggs, milk and edibles. “I am diabetic and old. My daughter has been helping me out for the past one week since the lone employee stopped coming. But seeing the crowd every morning she has suggested I keep the shop shut for the next few days till situation gets under control,” said Ansari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/lack-of-help-in-shops-puts-traders-in-trouble/articleshow/82749593.cms||Zeeshan Javed

They got a chance to register themselves with the MC for legal vending sites by paying monthly fee. “We are just waiting for the situation to improve as we are ready with our records and other related details. Once the situation improves, the process will be started in accordance with laid down norms to allot these new sites to newly-registered street vendors of the city,” an official said. In the first phase, only those vendors who had Adhaar cards of Chandigarh and had been working in the city for many years, were registered. “It needs to be cleared that the MC has not conducted any fresh survey of vendors and the vendors who are being registered now were already covered in the previous survey. They were not given sites earlier as they did not have a Chandigarh-based Adhaar card but they are being registered in the second phase,” sources said. Box: Zones across the city As per MC records, there are 46 earmarked vending zones in the city. Having a capacity of over 800 vendors, Sector 15-based vending zone is the biggest in Chandigarh. Out of approximately 6,500 registered street vendors, around 4,100 belong to non-essential service providers while the rest fall in the category of essential service providers and mobile vendors. The monthly vending fee is different for vendors across the city as per their work, it varies from Rs 300 to Rs 2,000 per month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/1500-covered-in-phase-2-of-vendor-registration/articleshow/82749556.cms||Deepak Yadav

The Variety Hall Road police said they had nabbed B Amiys Biswas, a native of Ghurni Post at Nadia in West Bengal, based on a compliant that was lodged by 27-year-old R Sreekanth Ramesh, manager (incharge) of Town Hall branch of the State Bank of India, recently. In his compliant, Ramesh said when he reported for duty on May 11 along with deputy manager Kanjana Rajan, cashier Srividhya and staffer Selvaraj the window of the bank on Karuppanna Gounder Street was found broken open with the files on the tables scattered around. He said there was an attempt to break open the locker in which valid documents were kept. “The burglar was not able to steal anything and damaged the locker.” Based on his complaint, the Variety Hall Road police registered a case under Section 380 and 457 of the Indian Penal Code on May 11 itself. A special team of police led by sub-inspector Marimuthu subsequently collected CCTV footage from nearby buildings and zeroed in on the suspect. They arrested Biswas, a construction worker, on Tuesday. A police officer said Biswas has confessed to the crime. “He told us that he decided to burgle the bank as he was rendered jobless because of the pandemic and was planning to leave for his hometown with the money he could steal. However, his two attempts went in vain.” Police produced him before a judicial magistrate, who remanded Biswas in judicial custody. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/guest-worker-breaks-into-bank-nabbed/articleshow/82751178.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

During the second wave, the NGO began a “free oxygen seva” by offering cylinders, which they say have so far helped over 40 families affected by Covid-19. “When Sai Raj came to us with his brother Satish Raj, who had contracted Covid-19, Satish’s Saturation of Peripheral Oxygen (SpO2) level was around 60%, which is considered low and requires oxygen supplementation. Our team immediately provided oxygen to the patient and necessary assistance to the family,” said Amandeep Singh, founding trustee of the NGO. Singh, who established the NGO alongside Sparsh Maheshwari, said their goal was to help the underprivileged and downtrodden. To procure oxygen, teams were asked to stand outside gas agencies and ensure quick cylinder refilling. They have also been maintaining a record of each beneficiary to ensure transparency. “We have been regularly providing food and ration packages to slum dwellers and others,” said Singh. Each ration package for a family of five contains wheat flour, rice, cooking oil and two types of pulses that can last a week. The NGO said 1,500 fresh meals were being cooked daily for people allocated by the deputy chief minister’s office in locations such as Sarai Kale Khan. Since March 2020, they have distributed over six lakh cooked meals among the poor, along with about 20,000 dry snack packets. Over 5,000 families have been helped through dry ration kits. For assistance, people can reach them on the helpline number 1800 103 4683. “Currently, we are relying on our own investments as well as donations. Efforts are on to help as many people as possible,” said a member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/food-ration-o2-ngo-reaches-out-to-poor/articleshow/82753371.cms||---
---||Business||Now, Mitsui arm challenges 2,400 crore retro tax order||NEW DELHI: The government is facing a fresh international challenge to the policy of retrospective tax amendments adopted by it. Now, Earlyguard, a British subsidiary of Japanese conglomerate Mitsui & Co, has commenced arbitration under the India-UK Bilateral Investment Treaty after income tax authorities raised a Rs 2,400-crore demand related to a transaction that took place in 2007. While Earlyguard commenced arbitration proceeding in February, the Mitsui & Co disclosed the details, while releasing its financial results earlier this month. The Japanese giant said the tax department has demanded capital gains on the sale of shares of Finsider International Co — a UK company that owned a 51% stake in iron ore miner Sesa Goa — by Earlyguard. “Although Earlyguard treated the capital gain properly according to the tax laws at that time, the payment notice has been issued,” Mitsui & Co said. In earlier filings too, it had disclosed that a tax notice had been received in January 2020. Neither the tax department, nor Mitsui responded to requests for a comment. Like several other entities, proceedings against the Mitsui subsidiary started years after the government decided to retrospectively amend the Income Tax Act to levy capital gains tax on transactions that took place outside India but involved assets located in the country. The amendment was introduced by the then FM Pranab Mukherjee in 2012 after the government discovered that it could not realise any tax on the sale of Hutch Whampoa’s 67% stake in an Indian telecom firm to Vodafone in what was then the largest deal in the country. Since there was no way to catch Hutch, tax officials came up with a demand on Vodafone, accusing it of not deducting tax while making the final payment. Vodafone challenged the notice but lost the case in the High Court, while its stand was accepted by the Supreme Court. Mukherjee and his team then came up with the retrospective amendment, which was cited as part of the tax terrorism that even BJP complained about. While the Narendra Modi government promised not to use retrospective tax tools, it has done nothing to either stop the earlier proceedings, leave alone reversing it. In fact, officials in the finance ministry have been justifying the move and have challenged two adverse international awards against the amendment. First Vodafone and then Cairn Energy Plc have won arbitration cases in international tribunals, for violation of bilateral investment treaties. Both the cases have been challenged by the government, which has argued that taxation is the sovereign right of Parliament and is not dictated by commitments under investment agreements. In several cases, officials have sought to justify the stand on the grounds that tax was not paid in any jurisdiction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/now-mitsui-arm-challenges-2400-crore-retro-tax-order/articleshow/82755730.cms||Sidhartha

In compliance with the government order, the committee was constituted to check immersion of unclaimed dead bodies in Ganga in the urban areas. The committee comprises of ten corporators--Kailash Pandey, deputy chairman, working committee, Yashpal Singh, Amod Tripathi, Vikas Jaiswal, Ajit, Sharad Prakash Mishra, Manoj Kumar Pandey, Madan Babu, Kirti Agnihotri, Saurabh Dev and Dr Ajay Sankhwar, health officer, S K Singh, chief engineer (civil) and RK Pal, in-charge of road light. The committee suggested to make residents aware about the outcome of immersion of dead bodies in the river. Sign boards be displayed at all ghats of the river and contact numbers of the vigilance committee be displayed so that people could contact them, the committee suggested. The municipal commissioner said the courts and the state government had clearly directed to keep the Ganga free from pollution. “The main object of the vigilance committee is to ask people not to immerse the unclaimed or claimed dead bodies in the river. KMC has made arrangement for free cremation of unclaimed dead bodies in the electric crematorium”, he said. Similarly, Covid-19 bodies and the bodies of the poor and destitute families would be cremated free of cost, he added. Mayor Pramila Pandey while lauding the efforts of KMCs sanitary workers, municipal commissioner, chief engineer and corporators, said that they had played their role beautifully. The proposals presented by the members were good and in view of the present pandemic, funds would be allocated to meet it in the original budget of the financial year 2021-22. Meanwhile, the KMC teams sanitized as many as 8295 places of the city by using anti-smog gun, jetting /fog machines and spray machines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/tell-people-not-to-immerse-dead-bodies-in-ganga-vigilance-panel/articleshow/82751228.cms||Anant Shekher Misra

The region reported 5,799 new cases, 10,293 recoveries and 163 deaths in the last 24 hours. The number of daily Covid-19 tests which had reached below 40,000 on Sunday recovered to the average daily count of 55,000 tests in the next 24 hours. Despite increased testing, the number of new Covid-19 cases continued to be low, which is a strong indicator that the curve is now moving towards the baseline. The major concern for Vidarbha in the last two weeks has been the rural spread of Covid.

---||Goa||Seriton tests positive for Covid-19, misses out on India debut yet again||Panaji: For any neutral, Seriton Fernandes is the best right-back in India at the moment. The FC Goa defender believes he can do the job better than anyone else. He proved it in good measure in the Indian Super League (ISL) and then the AFC Champions League (ACL), rubbing shoulders with some of the best teams from the continent. National coach Igor Stimac too has been left in no doubt that Seriton can add to India’s strength. When he last met him more than a year ago at a plush hotel in south Goa, the Croatian coach explained what he wanted from the sturdy defender. Since then, Seriton has upped his game, but the wait for his international debut continues. When Stimac first summoned Seriton for national duty in March last year, the coronavirus pandemic brought the world to a standstill and forced postponement of the World Cup qualifiers. When international sporting action resumed and the Indian football team was scheduled to play two friendlies in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in March this year, Seriton was injured and could not make the trip to Dubai. After an impressive showing in the AFC Champions League where he captained Goa for two matches, Seriton was gearing for his first big international test. He travelled to Delhi, was among the certainties for a starting place in the squad, until he was stopped by Covid-19. “Seriton travelled to Delhi with a negative RT-PCR test for Covid-19 but when we conducted another test here prior to the trip to Doha, he tested positive. His absence is a big setback to the team,” a senior official told TOI on Wednesday. The Goa defender has been fighting Covid-19 for a while now. When Stimac asked players to make their availability known, he was among the players who reported a positive result for Covid-19. It was an Antigen test, but when he did the more reliable RT-PCR test, it marked him as negative. Excited at the prospect of finally making his India debut, Seriton did another test; again, a negative result 48 hours prior to his departure to Delhi where he was scheduled to join the other probables. But with 24 hours left for departure to Doha, there was bad news in store for him. Jamshedpur FC defender Narender Gehlot was later named as Seriton’s replacement. With Ashutosh Mehta, Prabir Das and Ashish Rai also missing the trip to Doha, Stimac will have fewer options on the right of defence when they face Asian champions Qatar in the World Cup qualifier on June 3. “It’s not an ideal situation as we move ahead to the qualifiers in June,” said Stimac. “Due to the pandemic, our national camp which was slated to begin in Kolkata at the beginning of May had to be cancelled. The pandemic also robbed us of a friendly match in Dubai.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/seriton-tests-positive-for-covid-19-misses-out-on-india-debut-yet-again/articleshow/82780202.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

The yellow coloured bins have been placed at the smart street in front of New Town mela ground, at Sapoorji crossing and at Eco Park. “We are urging all to dump the bio- medical waste only in yellow bins. The NKDA workers will collect it and dispose if off accordingly,” said a NKDA official. Officials said that it was being seen that bio-medical waste, specially masks and gloves were being dumped along-side the general home collected waste, which is dangerous and could spread Covid. Plans are on to place more such bins across the township. In nearby Salt Lake and Rajarhat area, the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation is urging Covid affected families to dump all the bio medical waste including masks in a separate packet for the conservancy workers to collect and dispose it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-town-gets-yellow-bins-to-dump-bio-medical-waste/articleshow/82749629.cms||Suman Chakraborti

Its signature cynosure, the Nagoa, Ghogha and Jalandhar beaches, display the nature’s wrath it bore throughout the night. On Tuesday morning, uprooted trees, signboards of the beach hotels that were washed away by the sea lay littered on the sand. There are 35 registered hotels and resorts in Diu and several hotels suffered damages on roofs and glass panes. The whole UT was cut off completely from the rest of the world as telecom infrastructure was severely damaged and also power supply was snapped in major part of the district since Monday night. Talking to TOI, district collector of Diu, Saloni Rai said, “There are no reports of loss of life. Cyclone has caused damage to trees and partial damage to properties. The post cyclone route clearance and cleaning work is going on.” Diu had become India’s first solar power plant island, but Tauktae ravaged the plates of the 9MW plant. More than 1,000 coconut trees got uprooted causing major economic loss to the UT’s farmers. The Diu airport wall also collapsed and repairing work has started on war footing. Rai further said that 4,000 trees in all got uprooted in Diu while the administration is still assessing damage to electricity poles and private properties. Meanwhile, six rescue and relief teams from the Army braved the fury of nature and travelled for 12 hours along with cyclonic winds and heavy rains to reach Diu where fallen trees, debris and damaged electrical wires had blocked the road between Gir and Diu. The personnel worked overnight to clear these along with electrical poles that were uprooted at many spots. They also helped district administration in helping the locals restore their cyclone-ravaged homes. The teams managed to restore movement of vehicles carrying essential supplies, medical support besides normal traffic, Army said in a statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/diu-bore-tauktaes-fury-full-on-battered-but-standing/articleshow/82747435.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Pvt hosps make quick buck as cases spike||Coimbatore: In the early hours of May 13, 52-year-old Subramani, who was admitted to a private hospital at Sundarapuram on Pollachi Main Road with Covid-19, breathed his last into a ventilator. The hospital gave the family a bill for Rs 4 lakh to be paid before his body could be released. He was hospitalized for eight days, of which two and half days were spent in the intensive care unit (ICU). The family had no option but to use the Rs 3 lakh that Subramani had saved for his daughter’s marriage to settle the bill. The family now hopes to get an insurance reimbursement. Subramani, who was charged Rs 50,000 a day, is one among the thousands of victims who were charged more than the tariff that was fixed by the state for Covid-19 treatment. As per the state fixed tariff, private hospitals could charge only Rs 7,500 a day for general ward and Rs 15,000 a day for the ICU care. Private hospitals are, however, making a killing. TOI has copies of bills for Rs 50,000 to Rs 1 lakh that hospitals have charged patients for a day. And many families belonging to lower economic sections are running around borrowing from relatives and friends to settle the bills. Chief minister M K Stalin had on May 8 announced that the government would bear the expenses of the patients who are forced to undergo treatment in private hospitals because of unavailability of beds in government hospitals. He said the expenses would be covered under the Chief Minister's Comprehensive Health Insurance Scheme and directed the hospitals to collect additional expenses, if any, from the insurance companies directly. However, his instructions are yet to be followed. It’s mainly the smaller hospitals with less than 150 beds that overcharge the Covid-19 patients. A Sungam-based hospital had last week billed a 76-year-old patient Rs 3.6 lakh (Rs 60,000 a day) for six days of treatment in a twin sharing non-air-conditioned room. The elderly woman didn’t require oxygen and remdesivir was bought from outside. Her husband, who was hospitalized eight days ago and on high-flow oxygen support, has already been billed Rs 6.3 lakh. Members of another family based at Sundarapuram said they had lost their mother and brother to the virus. They had paid Rs 7.2 lakh for their brother Albert Junior, an ex-army officer, who was admitted to a private hospital at Ondipudur hospital for 11 days and another Rs 2.3 lakh for their mother Philomena V, who was admitted to another private hospital at Sundarapuram for seven days. “My brother was in the ICU for eight days, including a day on a ventilator, and my mother was in the ICU for four days. They died on subsequent days last week,” said V Sebastian, a retired Indian Air Force officer. According to the private hospitals, the tariff fixed by the state doesn’t cover many hidden costs involved in the Covid-19 treatment. “We have hidden costs like infected staffer’s treatment, giving them 21 days of paid leave every time they test positive, giving them a week off with pay for every one-week duty,” said a private hospital administrator, who didn’t want to be identified. He said the charges for consumables like personal protection equipment kit, and incentive, special accommodation and food for those on Covid duty were not covered by insurance. “Insurance companies pay only 60% to 70% of our bills,” he added. Another hospital representative said they needed to charge a patient on ventilator a minimum of Rs 50,000, one on oxygen support Rs 35,000 and those with mild symptoms Rs 10,000-Rs 12,000 for it to be financially viable. “While we have good turnover, Covid-19 treatment is not profitable as we do not get road traffic accidents and elective surgeries anymore.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/pvt-hosps-make-quick-buck-as-cases-spike/articleshow/82751239.cms||---

This is no doubt a good news for the region. Better news is Covid curve is in exponential decay and is falling more rapidly than it rose. Keeping Covid appropriate behaviour going can end the wave in the region by this month-end, said experts. The exponential growth phase of the second wave began in the first week of March in Vidarbha, which was earliest in India. Ascent from less than 5,000 cases to a peak of 17,019 cases took 41 days from March 11 to April 24. On the other hand, descent from the peak to less than 5,000 cases has taken only 23 days from April 24 to May 17. The has dissipated in about half the time it took to rise. It’s still plummeting rapidly. “At this pace, the second wave will be over by May-last or June first week. But, many factors are still affecting it,” said epidemiologist Dr Anand Thatte. According to him, rural spread, number of tests, pace of vaccination, and how the government will unlock the restrictions will decide how effectively the second wave peters out. “Rural spread is visible now in Vidarbha and administration needs to cut the chain off at village level only. Test numbers must not go down. Vaccination must gain pace. Finally, how we behave after the proposed unlock in June will be the key,” said Dr Thatte. Infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde said that some rise in cases is unavoidable after the government relaxes the restrictions. “There will be a small spike in number of cases after relaxation. It is time is to remain vigilant even after the wave subsides,” he said. Sharp drop! Ascent: From 4,924 to 17,019 | March 14 to April 24 | 41 days Descent: From 17,019 peak to 4,795 | April 24 to May 17 | 23 Days Endpoint: A sharp decline in new cases and then a long duration of a low number of cases every day will be the endpoint of this wave Expected: Between May 30 and June 07 Conditions: Careful unlock policy keeping transmission chains off; check on rural spread; accelerating vaccination, and Covid appropriate behaviour by people||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/2nd-covid-wave-receding-faster-than-it-rose/articleshow/82751256.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Should Covid-recovered wait 6-9 months for jab? Decision soon, says Top govt panelist||Tweaking India’s vaccination strategy by delaying jabs of those who have recovered from Covid by a few months will free up lakhs of doses for those without infection-induced antibodies, a senior member of a top government panel on Covid said on Tuesday, adding that the country can expect a decision on the matter soon.The panel member, requesting anonymity, said, “It is yet to be decided if the deferment interval (between recovery and vaccination) should be six or nine months. A decision on this period is likely in the next couple of days. It will be based on how long antibodies last after infection. Scientific evidence, in the Indian context, is being studied to assess how long antibodies survive during a six- to nine-month period after Covid infection.”The official said a decision to delay vaccinations for those who have had Covid is based on the premise that they already have substantial antibody levels. “During the Covid peak, nearly 3 lakh infections were being recorded daily, which meant nearly 1 crore cases per month. If vaccination is deferred for this group, it will help save an equal number of doses for the period it has been deferred for this chunk of population,” the official said.Dr Gagandeep Kang, one of the country’s leading experts on vaccines, said there is evidence that supports delayed vaccination in the recovered.“Data from the SIREN (Sarscov2 Immunity & REinfection EvaluatioN) study in the UK shows people who were previously infected with Covid had at least seven months of good protection from severe disease. The WHO recommends that in a time of vaccine scarcity, previously infected people can wait six months after infection to be vaccinated,” she said.Dr Naveen Thacker, president-elect of the International Paediatric Association (IPA), said, “Those who have recovered can get the shot 14 days after recovery as they will not infect others any more. But a longer interval is advised for a better immune response — four to eight weeks or even after six months. This is because immunity in such cases has been triggered after infection.” Dr Thacker added, “If people who have recovered do take a shot too early, there are chances of mild reactogenicity or minor side effects, but they may not be serious. We also believe that someone who has had Covid recently doesn’t need more than one dose due to immunity induced by natural infection.”The Covid panel member said though the possibility is remote, vaccination close to Covid recovery could even neutralise a vaccine dose.He added that the government is also setting up a tracking platform to determine vaccine performance, frequency of breakthrough events (infection despite vaccination) and their severity. The official confirmed that the platform should be ready in a couple of weeks, with weekly briefings based on data to be released into the public domain.“Some decisions on vaccination could be revisited after studying this data. The information can help us decide if one dose is enough or if interval between doses should be reduced,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-should-covid-recovered-wait-6-9-months-for-jab-decision-soon-says-top-govt-panelist/articleshow/82751268.cms||Neha Madaan

Of them, 68 have recovered and 37 are in isolation at these homes themselves, the state government informed the Gujarat high court. In response to a petition filed by Child Rights Collective, Gujarat seeking protection of the rights of children during the Covid-19 pandemic, the director of Social Defence said 105 children at such homes suffered from the disease. Thirty seven such children who are still ill are under observation at these child care institutions. Proper protocol is being followed for their recovery and they are being provided proper nutritious food. “If the need arises for further treatment, arrangements will be made for their admission to hospitals. No child has needed hospitalization for treatment till date,” the officer stated. On May 7, following instructions from the Centre, the social defence department has designated 99 juvenile homes and child care institutions across the state for care and protection of children whose parents suffer from Covid-19. Contact numbers and addresses of these designated institutions have been ordered to put up displays near the receptions of all Covid-19 facilities, so people can know about these provisions and the patients can avail of these facilities by placing their children at these special homes temporarily. The director also informed the HC that on May 7, the department of social justice and empowerment was requested to declare child protection services an essential service. A demand was also made for vaccination of staff serving at these protection homes. On a demand by the petitioner to drop the rule of mandatory six-month stays for a child before sending them to foster care during this pandemic, the social defence director said the department has received the same suggestion from the Juvenile Justice Committee. The authority also informed the HC that after the Supreme Court’s directions last year during the lockdown, a sum of Rs 2,000 per child per month between April and August 2020 was credited to the bank accounts of as many as 1,217 children who were living in child care institutions, but had to be sent back to their families due to the lockdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/105-kids-at-juvenile-homes-caught-covid/articleshow/82751261.cms||---

While the bench of Justice Bela Trivedi and Justice Bhargav Karia has asked the state government to place details about the vaccination programme, it also asked the Centre to elaborate on its vaccination policy. In its order in the suo motu PIL on Covid-19, the court said, “According to the opinions of medical experts, an intensive drive for vaccination could save the lives of people or at least stop them from becoming seriously ill as a result of Covid-19 infections. The court therefore is of the opinion that it would be appropriate for the court to direct the central government to place on record for the information of the general public at large, about the vaccination policy adopted by the central government.” The court asked the state government, “What is the estimated requirement of vaccines for vaccinating all categories of people fully and what is the roadmap for achieving the said estimate?” It has also sought to know how many people have been vaccinated till date in various categories and age groups. The court has wanted to know how far PHCs and CHCs are equipped to treat Covid-19 patients. It asked, “What is the mechanism for providing RT-PCR test kits, necessary medicines, remdesivir injections, oxygen supply etc., to such PHCs and CHCs and other healthcare centres in the districts and talukas?” These were among the various queries the high court placed before the governments. They included the policy of distribution of remdesivir and its availability.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-orders-centre-to-spell-out-its-vaccination-policy/articleshow/82751362.cms||---

But are the people getting out for genuine reasons bearing the brunt of their lockdown enforcement strategies and measures? The answer seems to be yes! Podanur-based environmentalist N I Jalaluddin was one such victim. He had in the early hours of last Friday rushed his wife to the St Mary’s Hospital in his residential area with severe chest pain. The hospital took an ECG and offered her first aid for high blood pressure and sent her away, as she couldn’t be admitted because of Covid-19. The same morning, Jalaluddin took her to the PSG hospital for treatment. “On my way to Peelamedu from Podanur, police stopped me at Kurichi Pirivu and Aathupalam, but on seeing my wife’s condition, hurried me on. At Ukkadam, a police officer took a picture of my two-wheeler. Later, I got an SMS with the picture, asking me to pay a fine of Rs600 at Bazaar police station.” Pointing out that he was out on an emergency, the environmentalist said police hadn’t even bothered to ask him where he was going and why he was out. “I am planning to complain to the city police commissioner regarding this.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/out-to-hospital-activist-fined-for-violating-lockdown-rule/articleshow/82751322.cms||---

This was revealed by the founder director of Caring Minds and Psychotherapist Minu Budhia. Established in 2013, Caring Minds is an institute of mental health. “Most of the suicide cases being reported are now due to depression. Earlier awareness about mental health was less but now it is going up. The number of calls we are getting regarding mental help in Caring Minds has also doubled in the last few months,” she added. Budhia pointed out that Caring Minds launched a mental health free helpline (18008913021) as the country continues to fight against Covid-19. According to her, anyone can call 7 days a week, 9am- 9pm, and speak with a mental health expert. It is also introducing a hotline for those who have a suicidal tendency. According to her, currently people are emotionally distraught, disturbed, distressed and depressed. “With the ‘new normal’ constantly evolving and bringing with it death, devastation, and grief wherever one looks, it has become a toxic situation that is bound to take a toll on our mental health too,” she added. Budhia pointed out that living in a constant state of worry for over a year under circumstances that are less than ideal affects one and all - all age groups, all genders, all classes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/depression-calls-keep-counsellors-busy/articleshow/82749696.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi court denies pre-arrest bail to wrestler Sushil Kumar||NEW DELHI: A sessions court on Tuesday dismissed the anticipatory bail plea of Olympic medallist wrestler Sushil Kumar in the case of 23-year-old grappler Sagar Dhankad’s death after a brawl at Chhatrasal Stadium. Kumar called the allegations against him “unfounded, baseless, scurrilous and preposterous” with the only motive to “humiliate and injure” his reputation. Additional sessions judge Jagdish Kumar, however, observed that the allegations against Kumar were serious. “From the perusal of the record of investigation done so far, it reveals that prima facie the applicant/accused is the main conspirator and the FIR is not an encyclopedia. The investigation is still going on and some of the accused have not been arrested,” the order stated. The court further noted that Kumar also faced a non-bailable warrant and clarified that it was not observing anything on the facts of the case at the stage of anticipatory bail as it might prejudice the parties. “The statements of eyewitnesses are also there. So at this stage, the court is not inclined to grant anticipatory bail. The application is dismissed,” it held. During arguments, senior advocate Sidharth Luthra, along with advocates RS Jakhar and Kumar Vaibhaw, contested the account of a witness saying he had antecedents but police hadn’t brought this fact on record. “Why is there complete silence about the conduct and antecedents of Sonu? The police’s reply (to Kumar’s plea) is incomplete,” Luthra said. Referring to the FIR, which stated that bullets were fired in the air, Luthra contested the application of IPC Section 302 (murder) calling the case “malicious”, adding that Kumar’s wife was called to the police station and cops hadn’t disclosed seizing his passport. Denying the authenticity of charges against Kumar, the counsel underscored the delay of about six hours between registration of the FIR and the incident. He accused the investigating agency of not attributing any motive behind the alleged crime. Police had made recoveries, thereby negating any need of Kumar’s custodial interrogation, argued Luthra. Public prosecutor Atul Shrivastava opposed the plea submitting that Kumar and his associates had forcibly driven the victim to Chhatrasal Stadium, where he was beaten up mercilessly. The motive behind the crime was stated to be the victim vacating the flat owned by Kumar’s wife without paying the rent for two months. The prosecution further informed the court that Kumar’s passport wasn’t seized, but taken by police to record particulars and inform the authorities concerned in case he tried to flee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-denies-pre-arrest-bail-to-sushil-kumar/articleshow/82753508.cms||Aamir Khan

It was the lowest daily Covid tally for the state in 36 days and lowest daily deaths in 35 days. The state registered a 40% drop in daily cases in a matter of five days. However, the mortality rate has remained the same in May. When cases were 10,742 on May 13, deaths were 109, and there were 131 deaths against 13,050 cases on May 4. The average mortality rate for April was 0.9% due to fewer number of cases and deaths in the beginning of the month. In April, the state recorded its highest daily cases at 14,605 on April 30, and highest daily deaths at 180 on April 29. “This wave has seen rapid deterioration of many patients. The mortality profile has also changed with younger patients’ share in overall mortality increasing. However, if one compares the mortality rate of the last surge, the rate has surely fallen with better understanding of the infection and possible ways to prevent the patient from going critical by intervention right at the start,” said a senior city-based critical care specialist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cases-dip-by-40-mortality-rate-static/articleshow/82751385.cms||---

It urged the CM that the partial lockdown like restrictions which include night curfew and shutdown of non-essential shops in 36 cities should be extended till May 31 to avoid fuelling the Covid spread again. The state government has extended partial lockdown in 36 cities till Friday and is expected to take a decision whether to allow other non-essential businesses to open once the cyclone situation is under control. IMA, Gujarat, office-bearers Dr Kamlesh Sainani and Dr Mahendra Patel in a letter submitted that Covid cases are steadily declining in the past few days after a severe second wave gripped Gujarat in the past weeks. “This was possible due to the timely decision of the government to impose partial lockdown. Shutting down all non-essential services and curtailing the number of people stepping out of their homes and resulting in fall in corona cases,” said the letter. The office-bearers cautioned that as experienced in the past, it would be premature to relax or lift the partial lockdown in the next couple of days. “The entire benefit of containing the corona spread will be lost making it further difficult to get rid of it without further loss of precious human lives,” said the letter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ima-advocates-partial-lockdown-till-may-31/articleshow/82751371.cms||---

Anarock added that 72% of those homes were already sold, with homebuyers largely opting for ready-to-move homes .Despite the real market moving over the past year to the premium and mid-range, and to some extent the luxury segment, the majority (around 40%) of the homes up for completion are in the affordable segment, Anarock’s data shows.In Pune, 59% of the scheduled completions are in the affordable category, while in Kolkata, affordable homes form up to 65%. Hyderabad, Bengaluru, and Chennai bucked the trend, with more completions scheduled in the premium and luxury segments/“The tally of 4.22 lakh homes scheduled for delivery across the top seven cities by 2021-end must be viewed in the context of the severe second wave of Covid-19. All the top cities have been affected, and it is likely that a part of these deliveries will be pushed to 2022. Amid the localized lockdowns and restrictions in most states, construction activity is permitted — albeit mandating Covid-19-specific protocols,” said Anuj Puri, chairman of Anarock.A city-based realtor told TOI that despite construction continuing largely unabated with the help of vaccinated or tested in-situ labourers, supply chains of crucial materials, such as cement and metals, are affecting construction, and raising input costs, all while passing the costs onto the buyer is “not an option”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/4-2-lakh-homes-to-complete-in-2021-delays-possible-anarock/articleshow/82749742.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

---||Nagpur||Unijules will also manufacture Amphotericin at Hingna plant||Nagpur: Food and drugs administration (FDA), Nagpur, on Tuesday issued product permission to Unijules Life Sciences Limited, a WHO-approved pharmaceutical company based in Hingna, to manufacture anti-fungal Liposomal Amphotericin B injections used in the treatment of black fungus induced mucormycosis. The injection is in short supply in the region after demand soared following a spike in the fungal disease. The company, which is 40 years old, is contemplating producing the first batch within a month, depending upon availability of raw materials. TOI has already reported about the shortage of the Amphotericin B family of drugs, which has been aggravated by unavailability of raw materials, which come from abroad. Unijules would be the third company in Maharashtra to produce Amphotericin B after Ambernath-based Bharat Serum and Vaccines Limited, and Genetek Life Sciences Private Limited in Wardha. Genetek is set to produce Lipid Amphotericin B emulsion. Genetek and Unijules were granted product permission within one week by FDA Nagpur to manage the acute shortage of Amphotericin B family drugs in the backdrop of sudden rise in mucormycosis cases among active and recovered Covid patients. Both Genetek and Unijules would have to wait until raw material arrives to start production.

Analysis of pandemics that preceded the Covid-19 such Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) has shown sleep disorders in 100% of the survivors. Memory impairment was seen in about a fifth of the patients while 10% had depression.During a recent internal discussion among JSA members, it was decided that telesupport service would be a way to help people hit by the Covid wave. The response was immediate as 75 members from Mumbai willingly volunteered to counsel callers or train volunteers.“It was a spontaneous response. We looked at the problem and realised that most people are not doing okay. What we were in April 2020 versus where we are in in May 2021 is a very different space. There is a fear of understanding who Covid will affect, people feel trapped in a way, anxiety is getting worse and, in some cases, violence is increasing. People want reprieve,” said Nivedita Chalil, a JSA member and trained psychologist.Juvva said the tele-psychological helpline is expecting calls from all over the country. “We launched the service on Monday. We envisage that group support services would be possible for people admitted in Covid jumbo hospitals or children of parents hospitalised due to Covid,” said Juvva.There are other support efforts as well. A doctor has set up a support group after losing a family member to Covid, while Powai yoga instructor Vijaya Reddy has set up free Zoom classes to teach breathing techniques to Covid recovered patients. Her daughter Pooja said 20 people have signed up for the classes in the last month. “My mother also has a Whatsapp group and keeps up a dialogue going every day to help people out,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-helpline-launched-to-heal-emotional-scars-of-covid/articleshow/82751464.cms||---

---||Surat||Storm damages 50-70% of mangoes in Gujarat||SURAT: Blame Tauktae if your craving for mangoes this season remains unfulfilled. The cyclone ravaged thousands of hectares of mango orchards in Saurashtra and south Gujarat, the hub of state’s mango production. Mango farmers from Gir-Somnath, Junagadh, Amreli and Bhavnagar, home to mouth-watering Kesar mangoes, are staring at humongous losses after the devastating wind accompanied by heavy rains tore through the mango-laden trees. “The cyclone struck at the ripe harvesting time. Had it been 10 to 20 days later, farmers would have sold their crops and earned money. Much of the damage is witnessed in the old and bigger trees owing to their height,” said DK Varu, head of the Department of Fruit Science at Junagadh Agriculture University. In south Gujarat too, a loss of 50% of fruits is estimated in the bigger trees. “Farmers are going to face a severe economic burden as this was the season of making money,” said Bharat Desai, a farmer from Killa-Pardi in Valsad district. “We have never seen such damage to our crops as well as to our trees. The winds were so strong that branches broke, and even trees got bent,” he added. Farmers may also not be able to pluck the remaining fruits as their farms got inundated from rainwater. However, on Tuesday many made a beeline outside the market yard in Valsad to sell mangoes that fell off during the cyclonic storm. “These (fallen) mangoes have to be disposed off or sold. Otherwise, fruit flies will start damaging the mangoes which are still there on the trees,” Desai said. Kesar mangoes which are usually sold at Rs 1,500 for 20kg were sold for Rs 250 to Rs 300 for 20kg in the market on Tuesday. The annual turnover of mangoes in south Gujarat is estimated to be around Rs 400 to Rs 500 crore, but due to the cyclone this year it is likely to be less than 50%. “The end consumer is also not going to pay a good price for the mangoes which are still on the trees because of the rain, and many may not even buy now. The government should think of compensating the farmers,” said Dr CK Timbadiya, senior scientist and head of Krushi Vigyan Kendra at Navsari Agriculture University.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/storm-damages-50-70-of-mangoes/articleshow/82747668.cms||Jay Pachchigar

The man had fled with the car. Bhargav Shukla, a resident of Shivranjani Society in Satellite, said the accused introduced himself as Nirav Chabhadia and approached him on January 3 seeking his car on rent. After negotiations with Shukla, he came to meet him on January 3, submitted his identity documents such as his election card and Aadhaar card and the Rs 500 deposit that Shukla had asked for. Though Chabhadia told Shukla he would take the car for one day only, he did not return for two days. When Shukla contacted him, he first promised to return the car soon but then went incommunicado.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/astrologers-car-stolen/articleshow/82751472.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Artists threaten legal action as North Zone Cultural Centre's Kalagram fails to clear payments||CHANDIGARH: Eight months on, several city-based artists who were enrolled by North Zone Cultural Centre’s (NZCC) Kalagram to spearhead a seven-day online workshop, are still waiting for the department to release their payments. Irked by the negligent attitude of the authorities concerned, the artists have now threatened to take legal action if their payments are not processed soon. Speaking to TOI, Shashi, a student of Government College of Art in Sector 10, Chandigarh and a sculpture artist (wood), said, “In October last year, a total of 20 artists were asked to make videos for a seven-day online workshop. Directions in this regard were given by a senior artist, Gurmeet Glodie, who was coordinating the workshop. Following the directions, we procured raw material and started work. This was my first assignment with Kalagram and I did not want to lose the opportunity. Due to financial crunch, I had to borrow Rs 3,000 from a friend to purchase wood.” Tarvinder Singh, a student artist, said later their work was showcased in an online workshop -- Nayi Umeed, Nayi Pehel -- which was organised by Kalagram in collaboration with Sanskar Bharti from January 11 to January 16. “Under the event, sculpture artists were to get Rs 1,100 per day for a seven-day workshop, plus the cost of wood procured. Painters were to get Rs1,100 for a four-day workshop, plus the cost of canvas used by them. When we requested for our payments, including clearance of raw material procured, authorities rejected all requests,” Singh said. He added that Kalagram’s role was to foster artists and promote art and culture, which was hardly being done now. “Due to the pandemic, most of us are struggling to make ends meet. The authorities should understand that this is not the right time to hold or reject payments,” he said. A few days ago (May 16), all artists enrolled in the workshop wrote to NZCC and requested release of payments. In their letter, they said, “We are in a workshop group, which is organised by North Zone Cultural Centre (NZCC). We were invited to take part in a seven days workshop for sculpture and four days for painting. We are writing to inform you that the payments have not been credited to our bank accounts. We have been trying to resolve the issue orally, but nothing is being done. In days of the pandemic, we arranged raw material and later acquired nothing. We request the authorities to immediately process our payments and compensate us for our losses.” Another sculpture artist, Prince Sharma, said, “This is not the first time that Kalagram has delayed payments of artists. Delaying payments for two to three months is normal here. This eight-month delay in payments is a new low even for them. They fail to understand that we are already struggling because of the pandemic, and the authorities are only making it harder for us to follow our passion by denying what is rightfully ours.” Jagjeet Singh Bhatia, office secretary, NZCC, said that the honorarium for all artists was scheduled to be released in the next four to five days. “However, we won’t be able to reimburse the cost of raw material procured by the artists as they had procured the raw material before the issuance of the letter by the authorities,” Bhatia said. “The directions to start work were given by then director of Kalagram, Saubhagya Vardhan. We have fallen victims to red tape. We only followed the orders of the official who was at the helm. Now, the costs borne by us are being denied, citing mismatch of date and release of the official order,” the artists said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/artists-threaten-legal-action-as-nzccs-kalagram-fails-to-clear-payments/articleshow/82749895.cms||Shishir Parasher

---||Goa||KTC bus schedule now available on Google maps||Panaji: To enable commuters to exhaustively use public transport, buses of the Kadamba Transport Corporation limited (KTC) have been marked on Google maps with the help of Google geo-fencing. The schedule of around 2,500 timings of 386 buses have been marked on the maps with the help of students from the Goa Engineering College. Users can therefore see at what time they can board which bus at which stop. For instance, someone who wants to travel from Mandrem to Palolem can tap on that route and check the bus service available on that route, the KTC bus timings will then show. “This way, the commuters can schedule their travel plans accordingly. Even working professionals can use the service to decide what time they can leave their home at,” KTC general manager, Sanjay Ghate said. “Having the geo-fencing feature at their disposal from the comfort of their home, people will use public travel more often,” he added. Regular travelers have welcomed this moved by the KTC. “People that live in remote villages, will be able to make best use of this feature. Since I live in Nuvem and need to take multiple buses to reach Panaji or Porvorim, this feature will be useful,” said Hercules Rodrigues, a regular commuter. He, however, pointed out that senior citizens unfamiliar with the use of smartphones or its features may not be able to navigate through this system. Currently, the bus schedules and routes are available on the geo-fencing feature, but users may have to wait a while to track the movement of the bus they intend to board. KTC is also planning to install GPS on all its buses, following which users will also be able to see the live location of its buses on the marked routes. “This will further help the public to plan their trip. We expect about 10-15% of private vehicle owners to shift to public transport due to this advantage,” Ghate said. In addition to this, plans are afoot to include private buses on this platform for the benefit of public transport passengers. “There are about 10,000 timings followed by private buses with an average of eight trips per bus. Once we add the private bus schedules in the system, it will become easier for commuters,” Ghate said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ktc-bus-schedule-now-available-on-google-maps/articleshow/82753632.cms||Nida Sayed

Parth Raval, a resident of Vishwamitra Society in Vejalpur, said he had on September 4 got a call from an unknown number where the caller asked him if he needed a job. As Raval said he did, the person told him to talk to his supervisor. The other person, who introduced himself as Ketan Patel, told Raval that he would provide him a job with a private firm at Mansi Circle for which he would have to pay registration fees and other fees to ‘process his job’. Raval agreed to this and ended up paying Rs 57,000 into a bank account specified by the man. Even after that, he did not get a job. For a long time, a woman kept calling Raval and assured him that he would get the job. As nothing happened after nine months, he approached police and filed a complaint of cheating.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/24-year-old-cheated-of-rs-57k-with-job-promise/articleshow/82751491.cms||---

District health officer Dr Mitesh Bhanderi said primary health centres at Sanathali, Vichiya, Jasdan, Dhoraji, Gondal and Upleta welcomed one baby each, while two were born in Jetpur PHC. The district administration had ensured that all expecting women in all the affected areas get all medical facilities for safe delivery. Altogether 17 women were shifted to the hospital through 108 ambulances from remote villages of Bhavnagar on the night of the cyclone including the most affected talukas like Mahuva, Gariyadhar and Ghogha. Project manager of 108 ambulance service, Sachin Gadhe said, “It was difficult to go out while the storm was pounding, but our team took the challenge to reach the villages at the critical juncture when the women were having labour pains. We had to negotiate our way through shrubs and fallen trees.” The Junagadh district administration had shifted six women in labour pain to the hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/12-newborns-first-cries-muted-the-cyclones-furious-howls-in-rajkot/articleshow/82747703.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||After 2.5 years wait, Telangana signs up for Ayushman Bharat rollout||HYDERABAD: The Telangana government on Tuesday decided to implement Ayushman Bharat in the state with immediate effect, almost two-and-half-years after the Centre launched the health scheme nationally. Telangana health officials signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the national health authority on Tuesday to implement the scheme in the state. The state health authorities have directed the chief executive officer of Telangana Aarogyasri Health Care Trust to see that patients get treatment in the empanelled hospitals as per the newly converged health scheme. Ayushman Bharat was launched by the Centre in September 2018. Telangana was among the states that had opposed the scheme and even claimed that its own Aarogyasri scheme was much better. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had rejected the national scheme on the floor of the assembly. Officials claimed that Aarogyasri provided coverage for 949 different treatment modalities. The scheme provides insurance coverage to each family from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 13 lakh and in some specialised therapies, there is no cap on the cost of treatment. The cap is Rs 5 lakh under Ayushman Bharat. TRS working president and K T Rama Rao has even termed Ayushman Bharat as a ‘bakwas scheme’. But the Telangana government changed its stand on the scheme in December 2020 and conveyed to the Prime Minister Narendra Modi through chief secretary Somesh Kumar during a video conference that the state would join the Centre’s scheme. KCR has cut back on the rhetoric against the Centre after he met Modi some months ago. The TRS even helped the Modi government by abstaining from voting in Rajya Sabha on key issues like the Triple Talaq bill.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/after-2-5-yrs-wait-t-signs-up-for-ayushman-bharat-rollout/articleshow/82753623.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Chandigarh||Punjab: Congress MLAs rally behind Charanjit Singh Channi||Chandigarh: A group of Congress legislators on Tuesday met Cabinet minister Charanjit Singh Channi to express their support, a day after the state women’s commission president moved to revive an over two-year-old matter of alleged harassment against Channi. “Five ministers and seven MLAs met Channi, but I cannot disclose their names,” said Congress Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa, after the meeting with Channi. However, the numbers could not be independently confirmed. Sources said a few of the MLAs did not want to be identified and preferred not to come out while the media was present outside Channi’s house. Commenting on the reason for the get-together, Cabinet minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa said, “The women’s commission president’s decision to raise questions at Channi was discussed. It is a constitutional, and not a political body. Why is the matter (against Channi) being revived after three years even though there is no complainant? The commission has not reacted to gang-rapes or other cases of atrocities on women in the state. It is unfortunate.” “Our fight is to seek justice in the cases of sacrilege and fulfilling the poll promise of wiping out the drug trade. The issue of sacrilege is being side-tracked as part of a conspiracy to divert attention. The day I went with cabinet minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa to Bargari to make the protestors lift their dharna, chief minister Amarinder Singh had told us to make a promise that accused of sacrilege cases will be put behind bars. But when a protest was held outside my house by Sant Samaj, any person with conscience is bound to get upset. Whatever happened in the Cabinet (meeting) and what the chief minister said hurt me,” added Randhawa. To a question if he too could be under vigilance scanner, he said, “I am not scared of any inquiry or going to jail. Jails are meant for humans. We came to power to open vigilance cases against the opposition leaders. But if it comes to our own party, I will present myself before the vigilance,” he said, adding, “It is not about how many of us are together on the sacrilege issue, even one is enough.” Bajwa added, “The situation will become explosive if vigilance is misused. There were scams during the tenure of Badals and it is those matters that should have been probed… I condemn the threat made to Pargat Singh and the chief minister should come forward to clarify things. It is a serious matter. He should either say whatever was said by his adviser was not with his consent.” Jalandhar Cantonment MLA Pargat Singh, who revealed on Monday that he allegedly had been threatened by one of the CM’s advisers, said, “We had come to meet Channi. The matter is three-year-old. The head of the women's commission is on a constitutional post and should not be talking of the party high command… If they have to make a person say such things against someone, at least that person should have knowledge.” Cabinet minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa along with Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa, besides a group of MLAs met Channi at his residence. Cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu said in an interview to a channel said, “Channi has not made any statement against the chief minister. He has been raising a particular issue and that is fair.” But it is not clear whether he is among the ministers said to be supporting Channi. BOX: Rawat gets in touch with Punjab leaders Congress in charge of Punjab affairs Harish Rawat got in touch with Punjab leaders, including Channi, Partap Bajwa and Pargat Singh, to defuse tension. “Rawat said that they are worried, and the matter is being discussed and we will be intimated in a couple of days. I told him that he should come to Punjab to do a reality check by doing one-on-one meetings with the party MLAs. Channi decided to postpone his press meet due to Rawat’s intervention,” said Bajwa. On the possible damage to the party, he added, “The central leadership of the party and the chief minister should reflect upon this. People want action against the Badals, and you have started knocking at the doors of its own party leaders. If you try to blame some people, they will definitely try to defend themselves and it will lead to voices of rebellion.” Pargat too confirmed to TOI that Rawat had telephoned him on Monday. BOX: Issuing threats not our culture: Randhawa Reacting to the alleged call to threaten Pargat Singh, Randhawa said it was not the culture of the Congress party. “It is a party that has the history of fighting against the British and then militancy,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/congress-mlas-rally-behind-channi/articleshow/82751478.cms||Vibhor Mohan

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Covid-19 positive teen goes into tree top isolation||HYDERABAD: With nowhere to go and isolate himself after he tested positive for Covid-19, an 18-year-old tribal youth made a makeshift ‘isolation bed’ for himself on a tree and stayed there for 11 days. “There was no other option. Five of us — mother, father, sister, brother and I — stay in a one-room house. For their safety, I had decided to stay on a tree,” Ramavath Shiva Naik told TOI. After spending 11 days in his own ‘Covid ward’, he was shifted to an isolation centre, which is 7 km away from his residence, and was sent home a day later after he tested negative. A resident of Kothanandikonda, a tribal hamlet in Nalgonda district, Shiva tested positive for Covid-19 on May 4. Shiva stayed on a tree for 11 days to avoid infecting his familyOn Day 1, he stayed in an open area in front of his house. “While staying there, I got an idea to shift my bed onto the tree. I secured my bed by tying it to branches using a rope,” he said, adding that he spent most of his time reading books and listening to music. He said that he started feeling better by Day 9. He was not scared as he was staying right in front of his house. Kothanandikonda, which is 166 km from Hyderabad, is a small tribal hamlet which has about 500 houses in Adavidevulapally mandal. The nearest primary healthcare centre is 5 km away. Shiva said that about 50 people from the village have already been infected with Covid-19 and many had struggled to stay in isolation because of lack of facilities. “It would be better if there is an isolation centre in each village. That would ensure that no one has to suffer like me,” he said. To make sure that his siblings and parents do not contract Covid-19 from him, the tribal youth chose to stay on the tree. Shiva said that nobody came to his rescue despite knowing that he was staying on the tree during his isolation period. He said that his mother used to leave food on a chair placed under the tree. “My mother used to call me before leaving the food. I used to go down and eat,” said Shiva, who is studying BA in a college in Patancheru, Hyderabad. Shiva said that as the house has only one washroom, located inside the house, he used to go out to the fields after sunset. To support his family, Shiva started working as a daily wage labourer after the first lockdown in 2020. He said that he had also registered under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act. “I was asked to take rest for two more days. Soon after, I will start working,” he said. Shiva, who is the only one from his family to go to college, said he gets paid about Rs 120 to Rs 200 per day under NREGA based on the work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-19-ve-teen-goes-into-tree-top-isolation/articleshow/82753673.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

---||Chandigarh||Oz Sikhs fume against kirpan ban in New South Wales schools||AMRITSAR: A stabbing incident in an educational institution prompted Australia’s New South Wales (NSW) state to ban Sikh students from wearing kirpan in all schools from Wednesday, triggering anger among the community. The kirpan is one of Sikhs’ five kakars (articles of Sikh faith). New South Wales education minister Sarah Mitchell issued the order after a 14-year-old baptized Sikh boy allegedly stabbed a 16-year-old male student with a kirpan twice in his stomach at Glenwood High School in Sydney on May 6, according to media reports. Calling the ban unacceptable, Pritam Singh, secretary, Australian Sikh Association said Sikhs of Australia would oppose the order tooth and nail. “It is a knee-jerk reaction from the government in response to the media's reporting,” he said. Danny Singh, an Australian Sikh businessman, said an isolated incident does not give anyone the right to oppress the entire Sikh community. “Nobody has the right to interfere with our tradition of carrying a kirpan. It’s been compulsory for us to carry kirpans since March 30, 1699,” said Danny, referring to the date Guru Gobind Singh announced the birth of the Khalsa. Danny is the maker of ‘Khalsa 1699’ watches. Mejindarpal Kaur, international legal director, United Sikhs, an NGO, said the NSW government should have consulted the Sikh community before taking the decision. “It is believed the education minister held an online meeting with two members of the Sikh community and informed them about the ban. There had been no prior discussion with the Sikh community," she said. Here, Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) vowed to take up the matter with the Centre, the Australian government, and the Indian high commissioner in Australia.

A vacation bench of Justices Vineet Saran and B R Gavai issued notice to the West Bengal government after senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani alleged that the TMC goons had the license from the police to attack workers of BJP leading to the death of 22 persons and vandalisation of their properties. The bench posted the matter for further hearing on May 25 while allowing the petitioners' counsel to serve the notice on the government through email. First petitioner Biswajit Sarkar is the younger brother Abhijit Sarkar, who on May 2 was killed by a mob of 20 TMC supporters. He alleged that the mob entered Abhijit's house, dragged him out, and brutally killed him in front of his mother, who was allegedly molested, and other family members. Second petitioner Swarnalata is the widow of another booth-level BJP worker Haran Adhikari. He was attacked with bricks, sticks, spades and shovels at his home and brutally killed in the presence of his 80-year-old father, who was also kicked, and minor son. The petitioners sought the two murder cases relating to their family members be investigated by CBI and also provided the SC with a list of 16 other murders of BJP workers that were part of an allegedly well-orchestrated post-poll violence that gripped several parts of West Bengal after TMC romped home to form the government for the third consecutive time. The petition, filed through advocates Sarad Kumar Singhania and Ravi Sharma, vividly depicted each of the gruesome incidents, inferring that the post-poll violence had the sanction of the newly elected government as the police stood mute spectators as the TMC mob went on a rampage with impunity. They sought "a fair probe by an SC-appointed Special Investigation Team into the murders and large scale incidents of violence unleashed at the behest of a particular political party, and further to examine the failure of the State administration which while identifying itself with this vengeful cause of the ruling political party in the State has chosen to turn a blind eye leaving victims of these crimes remediless as the entire genocidal attacks are part of a well thought of politically designed of the party in power to take political revenge after the declaration of results of assembly elections on May 2. There are a series of such well-planned attacks with the active connivance, knowledge, support and at times participation of the local police under the instructions of the State Government." "In total, there have been 22 reported murders till date, where the deceased were workers/supporters of the opposition political parties in West Bengal. In many of the incidents, FIRs are refused to be registered. Even where FIRs have been registered the version of the victim has not been even recorded by the police," the petitioners alleged. The petitioners alleged that there is an atmosphere of fear hanging in the air around the BJP workers and their families. "Apart from murders, there are hundreds of incidents of destruction of properties, vandalism, and assault where the local law enforcement authorities have turned a blind eye. Many victims are being coerced not to file written complaints and threatened with dire consequences. Entire neighbourhoods are now lying uninhabited as the residents have deserted the area and gone to safer places. Their livelihoods have been reduced to nought. Their children are living in constant fear of further attacks if they return home. Their Aadhaar Cards are being taken away forcefully to deny them basic government services and ration," they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/supreme-court-seeks-west-bengal-response-on-sit-probe-into-post-poll-violence/articleshow/82755939.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Recently, some residents of these villages had opposed installation of smart meters. Apprehending threat to the lives of their staff, the electricity department through the administration has asked for police protection. Sources said the department is likely to carry out the exercise next week. Recently, the Joint Electricity Regulatory Commission (JERC) had directed the administration to ensure faulty meters are replaced in a timely manner. The JERC order reads, “The commission has taken a serious view of the fact that the petitioner (UT electricity department) is yet to ensure full compliance. The petitioner is directed to ensure that faulty meters are replaced in a timely manner in accordance with the Supply Code Regulations, 2018”. Earlier, the department in its reply had submitted, “The replacement of defective or non-functional meters is a continuous process. However, every effort is being made to ensure that faulty meters are replaced on priority. At present, very few electromechanical meters are existing and same shall be replaced shortly. The department submits quarterly report on the status of meters to the commission regularly”. A senior official said the department has already started work on smart grid project. In the first phase, the department has allotted a work to a firm for replacing 30,000 existing power meters into smart meters in sectors 29, 31, 47 and 48 and Industrial Area, phases 1 and 2, and Faida, Ram Darbar, Hallomajra, Raipur Kalan, Makhan Majra and Daria villages. The work is likely to be completed soon. For the project, the department will also set up a control room in Sector 18, from where they will keep a tab on all consumers, the official added.

---||Allahabad||Prayagraj municipal corporation extends financial aid of Rs 4,000 per Covid cremation||PRAYAGRAJ: At a time when the many residents of the city are struggling to cremate their loved ones who are dying due to Covid-19, Prayagraj Municipal Corporation (PMC) is extending financial aid of up to Rs 4,000 per body to facilitate their cremation. The PMC is extending this help only at Phaphamau Ghat and has stationed its team to oversee the cremations of those dying of Covid. The aid is being given in accordance with an order issued by the state government in this regard, informed PMC officials. However, in order to avail this aid, the relatives of the deceased persons are required to produce documents from a pathology lab or a hospital to support their claim that the deceased individual was Covid positive, said PMC zonal officer of Phaphamau area, Neeraj Singh. All relevant details of the bodies cremated with the help of PMC’s financial aid are being duly entered in the records and maintained, he added. Singh said that from May 13 to May 18 (till 4 pm), a total of 85 bodies of people dying of Covid have been cremated with the help of PMC’s aid. “This includes 22 bodies cremated on May 13, another 22 on May 14, 13 on May 15, nine on May 16, 12 on May 17 and seven on May 18 (till 4pm),” he added. Officials made it clear that while the financial aid is being provided by PMC and its team is present at the site to oversee the cremations, it is the family members who are performing all the rituals. During the first wave of Covid-19, the administration was not only bearing the cost of the cremation, but also performing it. The family members were not allowed to be present at the site. However, in PMC-supervised cremations this time, the family members are being allowed to remain present, albeit with all precautions, added the officials. In the missive issued by principal secretary, urban development, Manoj Kumar Singh, it is mentioned that the financial aid would also be provided for burials to the relatives of the individuals belonging to minority community who are dying of Covid. It is to be noted that following the announcement of the state government, the order issued in this regard mentioned an aid of up to Rs 5,000 for the cremation of an individual dying of Covid. However, the financial aid being extended by PMC since May 13 is only Rs 4,000 per cremation. As per officials, in a meeting held by mayor Abhilasha Gupta ‘Nandi’, municipal commissioner Ravi Ranjan and other officials, following the state government order, it was decided to extend a financial aid of up to Rs 4,000 only in Prayagraj since the cost of each cremation in the district has been capped at Rs 4, 000 by the district administration. “In Prayagraj, the cost of cremation is adding up to only Rs 4,000 per body, and this cost has also been fixed by the administration. Likewise, cost of burial in graveyards has been fixed at Rs 3,500 per body,” said mayor Abhilasha Gupta ‘Nandi’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/pmc-extends-financial-aid-of-rs-4k-per-covid-cremation/articleshow/82751599.cms||---

Kolvenkar joined five Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP)-backed councillors and two Goa Forward Party (GFP)-backed councillors to win the post with eight votes against seven votes of Ritesh. Ritesh, son of Ponda Congress legislator Ravi Naik, had recently joined BJP. He was favoured for the post of PMC chairperson by BJP, but Kolvenkar had also expressed interest in becoming the PMC chairperson. The post had been lying vacant after outgoing chairperson Vishwanath Dalvi had tendered his resignation on April 29. Dalvi was elected to the post on August 31, 2020. Later on Tuesday, BJP’s state president Sadanand Shet Tanavade announced that he has expelled Kolvenkar from the post of Ponda Mandal president of BJP with immediate effect. Kolvenkar will be the fourth chairperson of PMC in this term of council. The first chairperson was MGP's Pradeep Naik, who was elected on May 21, 2018. BJP's first chairperson was Venkatesh Naik who served between August 29, 2019 and August 17, 2020. Dalvi served between August 31, 2020 and 29 April, 2021. PMC has 15 members elected through three different panels backed by three major political parties in Goa—BJP, Congress, MGP—in the recent election to the council held in 2018. MGP-backed ‘Rising Ponda’ panel emerged victorious by winning seven seats of the 15-member Ponda civic body, which was followed by Bharatiya Janata Party-backed ‘Ponda Nagrik Samiti’ with five seats, while Congress-backed Ponda Citizens Progressive Front had got only three seats. With the recent joining of Congress-backed councillors, BJP had raised the strength of the ruling party to eight in the council.

Director of Medical Education and Research (DMER) Tatyarao Lahane confirmed to TOI that in the wake of a series of complaints on the quality of the ventilators, a high level audit was conducted to check the performance of the ventilators. “It was a massive exercise, since it involved examination of 1,433 ventilators. We found that 351 ventilators are non-functional and beyond repairs. We will take it up with the ministry of health and ensure that the defective ventilators are replaced in a time-bound period. In view of the current pandemic situation, we urgently need ventilators,” Lahane said. As per official records, Maharashtra received 762 ventilators before March 2021, and 590 ventilators before April 30, of which 862 are in working condition, 243 are non-functional, 85 have been given to private hospitals, while 156 are in the process of installation. Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant was the first to take up the issue of defective ventilators, saying it was biggest-ever scam and the NDA government led by PM Narendra Modi is playing with the lives of the people. “Before dispatching the ventilators to Maharashtra, it was the responsibility of the ministry of health to ensure that they are in working condition, but it appears that there was lack of supervision and dereliction of duty at all levels. Modi must fix responsibility,” Sawant said. The Aurangabad medical college dean was the first to raise an alarm overdefective ventilators. After a thorough probe, it was found that 58 ventilators supplied to the college were sub-standard and useless and the company, which supplied the ventilators, declined to open the remaining 37 ventilators. “The dean submitted a comprehensive status report on the ventilators to the district collector on April 12. The report clearly stated that the ventilators are useless and beyond repairs. In fact, the nominees of the firm which supplied ventilators, too visited the medical college but expressed inability to repair the ventilators. Three ventilators were repaired, but did not work on the second day. Since then, no technician has turned up at the college,” a college official told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-got-243-faulty-ventilators-under-pm-cares-fund/articleshow/82753788.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Uttar Pradesh: Railway hospitals across NCR upgraded for Covid contingency||PRAYAGRAJ: In anticipation of the third wave of Covid-19 pandemic, general manager North Central Railway (NCR), V K Tripathi, has said that strengthening of healthcare infrastructure of Railway hospitals should be done on a mission mode. In the review meeting on progress of vaccination and upgradation of infrastructure in Railway hospitals, Tripathi stressed upon strengthening of medical infrastructure, both in terms of men and material. He also emphasised on close monitoring of oxygen express trains as they pass through NCR and instructed that no detention to them should occur. Dr Anand Tandon, principal chief medical director informed TOI that NCR’s fight against Covid-19 has got a new momentum with further availability of oxygen concentrators. With the help of NGOs, Jhansi Railway Hospital received 49 more oxygen concentrators on Monday. Also, 47 concentrators of 5 litre capacity have been given by NGO ACP grants while NGO Shilpi has provided two oxygen concentrators of 10 litres capacity each. DRM Jhansi, Sandeep Mathur said more such efforts are being done to associate NGOs in this battle against Covid. In addition to it, as a result of the help sought by the general manager, 25 oxygen concentrators have been provided by the UP government for Central Hospital, Prayagraj. Besides, five oxygen concentrators have been provided by the Railway Board to be used for Railway Hospital Agra. In its bid to further strengthen the infrastructure, one advanced RT-PCR machine has been delivered and installed at Central Hospital, Prayagraj. This is expected to be functional soon and will significantly reduce the time lag between sampling and availability of results as now the hospital will conduct in house single stage RT-PCR testing. The general manager directed the officials to get its functioning started at the earliest. This is also worth mentioning that one TrueNat RT-PCR machine has been provided to the Railway Hospital, Agra by the district administration. Necessary permission to start it has been sought by the state government which is expected to be received soon. Apart from procurement and installation of infrastructure, another breakthrough achieved by NCR is the recruitment of 15 doctors on contractual basis for Prayagraj and three for Jhansi. Eight at Prayagraj and all the three at Jhansi have joined. Remaining are likely to join today (Tuesday). This development will redress the issue of shortage of doctors in Railway Hospital. Tripathi assured the health officials that all necessary support from the Railway Board and from state government will be received as and when required. He further stressed upon 100% vaccination of staff and put a word of caution to observe adequate social distancing and to prevent crowding at vaccination sites.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/railway-hospitals-across-ncr-upgraded-for-covid-contingency/articleshow/82751641.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||This steely AP village halts virus in its tracks||Vijayawada: Fighting Covid-19 in the countryside may have been a herculean task for medical experts, but people living in this tiny village, hardly 40 kilometres away from Vijayawada, have successfully kept the coronavirus at bay. The village of 1,030 people has not recorded a single Covid-19 case ever since the start of the pandemic 14 months ago. Duggiralapadu village, under G Konduru mandal in Krishna district, managed to stay Covid-free even during the first wave of the pandemic. And they have held on to that ‘record’ in the ongoing second wave too, which has wreaked havoc across the country including Andhra Pradesh, by keeping the virus away from the village boundaries through sheer determination, awareness and daily sanitation of all streets. In March 2020, when the first wave of the pandemic was just setting in, the villagers held a meeting and decided to take steps to ward off the novel coronavirus. Everyone took a pledge to follow ‘Covid-19 appropriate behaviour and protocols’. Besides ensuring precaution for themselves by dutifully wearing masks, they also took up sanitation drive all over the village on a daily basis, which they have continued. The village panchayat procured a power sprayer along with a tank to spray sodium hypochlorite in the streets twice a day. Local youths formed teams to help in the sanitation drive. Village sarpanch Jada Rambabu told TOI that everyone in the village felt that preventing the spread of Covid-19 was important. “We collectively took a decision to implement strict rules. Celebrations and public gatherings are completely prohibited in our village. Salesmen and street vendors are known to spread the disease from one village to the other. We have prohibited the street vendors from entering our village,” Rambabu said. The villagers also prohibited relatives from visiting them. Fun gatherings were also banned. They kept guard even when the first wave subsided and people in other areas threw caution to the wind. “A special quarantine facility has been set up in the village where patients with fever are kept. Health workers and volunteers conduct door-to-door surveys every fortnight to assess the health condition of the elderly and high-risk people,” Rambabu added. IT and industries minister Mekapati Gowtham Reddy recently tweeted and appreciated the efforts of the villagers in keeping Covid-19 at bay. He also asked people in other villages to derive inspiration from Duggiralapadu and contain the pandemic. “Stay home, stay safe is the only slogan we are implementing. We avoid going to other villages and towns as we may get infected. We will implement the guidelines till this pandemic is wiped out. Nothing is more important than our lives,” said Majji Satyanarayana, one of the villagers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/this-steely-ap-village-halts-virus-in-its-tracks/articleshow/82753745.cms||Venu Lanka

---||Kolkata||Covid nightmare: Went through hell but came back||By: Rupsa Basu When I suddenly developed a racking cough last month, a local doctor prescribed an RT-PCR test and advised hospital admission. What followed was a nightmare that thousands of families are experiencing everyday. Every hospital that my husband dragged me to refused admission on the ground that I didn’t yet have a Covid +ve report. But my cough was getting worse and breathing was getting difficult and a CT scan of my lungs showed Covid pneumonia. Desperate calls to ‘contacts’ — doctors, health workers, hospital staffers — by family and friends yielded result after 48 hours and a private hospital agreed to take me in. My treatment started on a stretcher trolley beside the hospital admission desk. Even as I lay there dazed, I could hear a stream of desperate patients being turned away. I realised I was lucky to have beaten them at the race by reaching the hospital minutes before. Quite late at night, I was wheeled into the emergency, which was functioning as a full-fledged Covid ward. My bed was manoeuvred into a sliver of a space beside the doctors’ desk. Over the next 72 hours I was witness to the workings of a hospital emergency in the time of pandemic and the tireless efforts of doctors and health workers to save lives. The emergency itself was a biggish room but already overcrowded. The next morning, the beds were adjusted further to squeeze in a few more patients. Now, the beds were touching each other separated only by flimsy curtains and if one patient coughed, the beds next to it shook. There was even a bed at the foot of my bed. There were two washrooms attached to the emergency and the handful of us who could still walk, were assisted there by nurses but finding the way was like walking through a maze. Almost all the patients were on oxygen support and some on bipap. Breathing was laboured and persistent coughs rang through the room. Sleep was elusive and I could hear the doctors discuss if a patient needed to be on ventilator and debate if a bipap would do till an ICU bed was available. Once, a junior doctor had to make the thankless call to a deceased patient’s neighbours to come and collect the death certificate since all his family members were down with Covid. Clearly, the number of patients was overwhelmingly high for the caregivers to pay personal attention but we were so grateful to find a hospital bed and receive proper medical treatment that complaining was far from everyone’s mind. On the third day, I was shifted from the emergency to the hospital’s Covid ward when a bed became available. Another three days later, I was released as the doctors felt the crisis was over and the rest of the treatment could be continued at home. Any other time, they would probably have kept me back for a few more days. But it was time for me to make way for a more critical patient and time for them to save another life.

---||Thane||Thane sessions court acquits son in Sandhya Singh murder case||MUMBAI: The state seems to be gearing up to file an appeal after the Thane sessions court acquitted Raghuveer Singh, arrested seven years ago for the murder of his mother Sandhya Singh, sister of music composer duo Jatin-Lalit and actors Sulakshana and Vijeta Pandit. Commenting on the May 13 decision, special public prosecutor Vaibhav Bagade on Tuesday said “it is a fit case for appeal”. A Mumbai crime branch officer said it is likely to appeal after studying the grounds for acquittal once the reasoned judgment is made available. Advocate Jagdish Nagar, part of Raghuveer’s defence team who was in court at the time of the ruling, said the judge had found “no conclusive evidence” against his client, and hence acquitted him. Raghuveer, 22 when arrested on December 16, 2013, had pleaded “not guilty”. His defence counsel R K Poswal from New Delhi had argued that there was a total lack of evidence in the case to show Raghuveer’s complicity. Sandhya Singh, married to Jayprakash Singh, then a central excise commissioner, went missing in December 2012 after she stepped out of her Navi Mumbai home to visit a bank with her friend. On December 15, 2012, Raghuveer lodged a missing person’s report with the police. At that time, she was in her mid-fifties. A murder case was registered against unknown persons after the partial remains of a woman, including a skull and seven bones, and clothes, were found on January 28, 2013, in a marshy area 200m from the Singh residence by bird watchers. A DNA test identified the remains as Singh’s. Additional sessions judge P P Jadhav acquitted Raghuveer under section 302 (murder), section 201 (causing disappearance of evidence) and section 397 (robbery or dacoity with attempt to cause death or serious hurt) of the IPC. He directed that a gold chain be returned to him and a recovered “Rado wristwatch be sold in auction and the sale proceeds be credited to the state”. The prosecution had said he had mortgaged the watch, which Singh used to wear when she stepped out, for Rs 16,000 via a friend on January 17, 2013. Assistant commissioner of police (ACP), anti-terrorism, Sripad Kale, who had been the investigating officer, said the entire case was based on circumstantial evidence. In 2015, after the chargesheet had been filed, the Bombay high court had granted Raghuveer bail, saying the case rested entirely on circumstantial evidence, which at the time was “neither clinching nor sufficient, prima facie” to show his complicity. “There is no last seen evidence nor evidence of recovery of any weapon or clothes,” the HC had said, adding that neither could the prosecution give the time of killing nor how she had been murdered. Opposing bail, the prosecution had pointed out that Singh had not conducted any transaction at the bank on the day she went missing and cited Raghuveer’s “strained relations with his mother’’ fortified by statements of three domestic help who claimed he would “frequently quarrel with his mother, abuse her and demand money from her”. It had argued that he had on December 14, a day after she went missing, “thrown a party for his friends’’ and had mortgaged her watch on January 17, 2013.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-sessions-court-acquits-son-in-sandhya-singh-murder-case/articleshow/82751785.cms||---

Accompanied by strong winds, the heavy showers left some areas including the Sayajigunj underpass waterlogged. Weather officials said that the city received 37 mm of rains from 6 am to 6 pm and more showers are expected late in the evening. The strong winds uprooted about 50 trees in Sayajigunj, Alkapuri, Chhani, old city, Vadi Wadi and many other areas apart from five hoardings that came crashing down. A father-son duo was injured when a signboard fell on them on Tarsali-Jambua bypass on Tuesday morning. Hitesh Parmar and Ganesh Parmar were riding on their motorbike when hoarding fell on them. The duo was rushed to the hospital for treatment. District administration officials said that three electric poles fell in Makarpura-GIDC but no one was injured. An old house too came crashing down near Pathhargate in the old city. Fire officials said that they received dozens of calls throughout the day. Two motorbikes got crushed under a tree in the old city apart from an auto-rickshaw in Ellora Park area. Though the administration had warned people to stay indoors, many were seen out driving on the roads to enjoy the weather. Youngsters flocked the Sindhrot bridge and Akota-Dandia Bazaar road to get drenched in the rains.  Many Barbadians also drove all the way to Pavagadh and spent some time there with their families. Apart from the city areas, Karjan and Padra received two inches of rains on Tuesday. Several trees fell in the district areas but the police department as well as firemen swung into action and cleared the roads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/hoarding-comes-crashing-down-2-hurt-in-vadodara/articleshow/82747847.cms||---

On May 12 the judge deferred the judgment as the court was understaffed in line with the new standard operating processes (SOP) for courts with the rise in Covid cases. Special public prosecutor Francisco Tavora told TOI that the judgment would likely be pronounced today. The final arguments in the 8-year-old trial against Tejpal in Goa concluded in March this year. The case has seen many twists and turns. On November 7 and 8, 2013 Tejpal allegedly sexually assaulted a woman at an event organised by Tehelka at a starred hotel in north Goa. On November 22, Goa Police lodged a suo motu FIR against Tejpal. He turned up in Goa on November 28, 2013 and was arrested on November 30 after his anticipatory bail plea was rejected. He was granted interim bail on May 19, 2014 to attend the cremation of his mother and since then has been out of jail. In July 2014, Tejpal was granted bail. In September 2017 a Mapusa court framed charges against Tejpal for allegedly raping a junior colleague in the November 2013 case. Tejpal had pleaded not guilty paving the way for a trial. The cross-examination of the survivor began on October 21, 2019. Earlier through a criminal revision application Tejpal challenged the framing of charges by the additional district and sessions court. On December 20, 2017 the high court of Bombay at Goa had dismissed Tejpal’s application. Tejpal has been charged for offences under Sections 354, (assaulting or using criminal force on a woman with an intent to outrage her modesty), 354-A (outraging modesty), 341 (wrongful restraint), 342 (wrong confinement), 376 (rape), 376(2) (f) (person in position of trust or authority over women, committing rape of such women) and 376(2)(k) (rape of a woman by a person being in position of control or dominance over the woman).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/judgment-in-tejpal-case-likely-to-be-delivered-today/articleshow/82753776.cms||---

He was cremated by his team at the Rishi Nagar crematorium here on Tuesday according to the Covid-19 guidelines and in the presence of Hisar mayor Gautam Sardana and municipal corporation commissioner Ashok Kumar Garg and other senior officials. Kumar is survived by his wife and two sons, one of whom is an MC employee and the other a student. Hailing from a joint family, Kumar lived with his brothers and their families in the same house and two of his four brothers work for the municipal corporation. Paying tribute to Kumar, who was also the president of the Hisar Municipal Corporation Employees Union, Hisar MC spokesperson Sunil Bainiwal said: “He had cremated over 300 bodies of Covid-positive patients since last year. He tested positive two days ago and was admitted to a private hospital, where his oxygen level kept dipping due to which he died.” Mayor Gautam Sardana said Praveen was his childhood friend and added that he had lost a close friend. Haryana Sarv Karamchari Sangh district leader Surender Mann said besides being the leader of the employees, Kumar was a true corona warrior. Jitendra Sheoran, head of the Hisar Sangharsh Samiti, claimed that it took Kumar’s family three hours on Sunday to manage a hospital bed for him, due to which his oxygen level had even dropped to 40. Sheoran added that the Hisar administration could not even arrange a bed for Kumar whose condition deteriorated instantly. There was no response to these allegations by the Hisar MC or the district administration officials. His family too could not be contacted for their version. There is also a growing demand that Kumar must be honoured by the district administration by naming one of the municipal wings after him. His supporters also demanded that Kumar must be given the status of a martyr and one of his family should be given a government job and other necessary help.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/hisar-man-who-gave-dignified-funeral-to-300-covid-19-victims-dies-of-virus/articleshow/82751696.cms||Kumar Mukesh

A delegation of NVCC led by its president Ashwin Mehadia met additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi and submitted a memorandum urging relaxation in restrictions and allowing traders of non-essential items to restart their businesses. Traders also met municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B. Shops of non-essentials are facing restrictions since March 2021. Last year, traders faced the lockdown which crippled their finances for almost eight months. Though the Maharashtra government ordered restrictions from April 2021 and extended it till May 30, the city is under lockdown from March itself. Traders also pointed out that the government has not announced any relief package for them and instead, it has made taxation rules stringent by imposing a penalty for not filing or paying taxes. NVCC vice-president Sanjay Agrawal pointed out that traders are the backbone of the economy and if the present situation continues, the country’s economy will collapse. Lakhs of people employed by non-essential shops are facing hardships due to no salaries for the past several months, the delegation pointed out. The civic chief said if traders assure strict compliance of Covid-19 protocols, the state disaster management committee can take a decision to start business activities from June 1.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/reopen-non-essential-shops-nvcc/articleshow/82747888.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Chennai||Fish prices in Chennai to go up further||Chennai: Fish prices in Chennai are set to go up further as aqua-culturists in Andhra are unable to despatch their produce to the city. Since the fishing ban kicked in, city residents were dependent on the Rohu, Katla and Mrigal varieties — all raised on private farms in Nellore in Andhra Pradesh and brought to Chennai by road. Now, with Covid-19 cases in the city rising, lorry drivers from AP are refusing to operate vehicles to Chennai, resulting in prices of fish going up at the markets at Vaanagaram, Pattalam, Chintadripet and Kaavankarai near Red Hills. The city’s requirements are mainly met by the catch coming to the harbour. But, since the beginning of the lockdown that has kept fishermen indoors, fresh water fish raised on farms in the neighbouring state have sustained the city. That too has dried up now. Shankar, a vendor at the Pattalam market, said arrivals from Andhra Pradesh had reduced since the lockdown was declared. A trader at Vaanagaram, the largest market where both wholesale and retail trade occur, said the average of 50 lorry-loads of fish arriving daily had dropped to just 10 since last week. Kannan Pasupathiraj, proprietor of Chennai-based Fresh Fish, said that when marine fish were available in the market, those sourced from farms in the neighbouring market used to retail at between Rs 100 a kg and Rs 150 a kg. Now they are being sold at Rs 250 a kg, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/fish-prices-in-chennai-to-go-up-further/articleshow/82750127.cms||P Oppili

Four of her neighbours were also administered the fake shots in similar ways. It was only when the woman and her neighbours were unable to get the online vaccination certificate weeks after receiving the jab that they smelt something foul and contacted the lab in question. The lab denied to have vaccinated anyone at home. The woman then approached Phoolbagan police station and lodged a case. The Enforcement Branch has subsequently taken over the probe. According to police sources, the incident took place on May 3. “The cheat claimed he represented a lab located at the Eden Hospital Road. He then claimed that private facilities were vaccinating people at home for as little as Rs 300. The victim, Pragati Bandhopadhyay, and four others agreed to get the jab,” said an investigating officer. The accused has been booked under IPC sections pertaining to criminal conspiracy, cheating, malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life and disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/woman-files-plaint-over-fake-jab/articleshow/82750119.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Chennai||Over 500 beds with oxygen support added at hosps in neighbouring dists||Chennai: The health department has added around 550 l oxygen-supported beds in the districts of Thiruvallur and Chengalpet to check the inflow of patients to neighbouring Chennai. Infections in these districts are rising faster than in Chennai. As a result, patients from the suburbs are turning to hospitals in Chennai hospitals. And though cases aren’t rising as fast in Kancheepuram, the district doesn’t have Oxygen beds free either.In fact, the government dashboard (https://tncovidbeds.tnega.org/), which is a real-time portal, showed six beds free in Kancheepuram and 56 in Chengalpet and Thiruvallur. Even when authorities claim that bed status is updated frequently, calls to hospitals suggest that there was a time lag of at least 2-3 hours and beds were already occupied in the meanwhile. Arasi Srivatsan, dean of Thiruvallur Medical College Hospital, said, "We are getting some breathing space only after taking over Indira Medical College Hospital, where 54 additional oxygen beds are ready now. Some of our patients are shifted there. Another 100 beds are likely to be added on the same premises soon". Besides this, the government is planning to create an oxygen parlour in the district. But the location is yet to be finalised, she said. At Chengalpet Medical College Hospital, around 200 additional beds are to be set up with the help of a private organisation named Gsquare. "Infrastructure is getting ready and it is likely to come into use soon," said J Muthukumaran, dean of the college. Kancheepuram health authorities said that 100 out of the 250 beds in the new CEmONC (comprehensive emergency obstetric and newborn care) building at the local district headquarters hospital were converted into oxygen beds on Tuesday.In all these hospitals in the city's suburbs, doctors have started to triage patients before admitting them in covid wards.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Pandemic forces artists to give up Phad painting||JAIPUR: Even before the Corona outbreak, Phad painting had lost many of its 150 practitioners. For some of the remaining 50-odd artists in 15-20 families living in Bhilwara, Shahpura and Chittorgarh region, depending solely on the art for livelihood is no more the option. The pandemic has put an end to tourism and there is no idea when it will restart. Fairs, festivals, and exhibitions have stopped. During weddings in villages, people used to have Phad painting on the front walls of their houses. That window is also closed. A few families supply to agents for online sale, but that’s not option many could explore due to the small size of their business. “There is almost no income since the pandemic broke out last year. Some have opened kirana shops. Others have picked up odd jobs. My younger son, who used to paint with me, has chosen the job of an electrician. Phad painting has been a family occupation since generations. So, I cannot give it up,” said Satya Narayan Joshi from Chittorgarh. In fact, it is the extended Joshi family who are practicing the art, which unique to Rajasthan. Satya Narayan said the work is not highly remunerative as it takes 3-4 days to complete a painting that fetches about Rs 1,000. That’s why younger generation looks for other career options. Well-known Phad artist from Bhilwara Kalyan Joshi, whose ancestors dating back to 750 years practiced the art, said the risk is that some of the artists who are picking up other jobs may not return to the family occupation if they find better livelihood opportunities. “My father, Shree Lal Joshi, revived the art form for which he was awarded Padma Shree in 2005. We have brought in innovations to themes and refinement to the art. To popularise and create awareness about the art, I had made two paintings depicting difficulties the country faced during last year and the labour migration. One of the paintings was bought by the British Museum. But the pandemic has created problems for those who depended on tourism, fairs and festivals,” said Kalyan. Phad is a scroll painting done on a starched cloth. Initially, the paintings narrated stories of deities Pabuji and Devnarayanji (God Vishnu) and folk heroes. The stories on the paintings would be narrated by priest-singers for entertaining the village crowds. But Kalyan said with time, new themes were experimented as the vibrant paintings could put them into good effect. “My father, who is no more, experimented with stories of erstwhile kings. It increased the commercial value of the paintings. Today, themes like Kalidasa’s Abhigyana Shakuntalam and Hanuman Chalisa are in great demand,” added Kalyan. For some, he said, the pandemic has been very devastating and the government needs to find ways like providing pension to artists to keep them interested in the art.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/pandemic-forces-artists-to-give-up-phad-painting/articleshow/82751776.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

The new museum, which is dedicated to the struggle for freedom from Portuguese colonial rule, was scheduled to be inaugurated this month, but the opening has now been postponed because of the second wave of the Covid pandemic, Lobo told TOI. The museum, financed under the central government’s Swadesh Darshan scheme, was to depict the lives of freedom fighters, many of whom were jailed there during the Portuguese colonial rule, and incidents from the freedom struggle through installations and light and sound shows. It was originally scheduled to be opened in October last year, but was delayed because of the pandemic. The jail at the fort was being used till 2015, after which, it was decategorised as a jail.

---||Chennai||Chennai: Staff smuggle rice from Madipakkam ration shop||CHENNAI: A ration shop in Madipakkam allegedly tried to smuggle rice to a private farm in Porur in broad daylight on Tuesday. Videos shot by TOI lensman show workers discreetly loading rice bags from the back door of the ration shop into a private mini-truck. Staff at the Madipakkam ration shop claimed that there were no takers for these bags and were being sold to farms in the city's suburbs for Rs 120 per bag. "In other areas, excess rice bags and ration were distributed to nearby migrant workers. But in Madipakkam, there are not many such workers. We can't return them either. To avoid paying out for the losses from our pocket, we are selling them to farms, which use the rice to feed the birds," the staff said, refusing to reveal his name. Though he continued to deny that it was sold in the black market, the staff said that the money was collected to pay the workers involved in loading/unloading and transportation of the bags in mini-trucks. When asked for a clarification about this, Tamil Selvi, joint commissioner of Tamil Nadu civil supplies and consumer protection department said that there was no such provision to sell excess rice bags and assured to look into the issue. Smugglers of ration rice can be booked under Tamil Nadu Essential Commodities Act, 2011, where the penalty to be paid was set based on the market value of the vehicle used for smuggling.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/staff-smuggle-rice-from-madipakkam-ration-shop/articleshow/82750151.cms||---
---||Mumbai||After Doppler flop, 5 more radars for Mumbai in 3-4 months||MUMBAI: The fact that the city’s only Doppler radar did not work on Monday when an extremely severe cyclone came within 120 km has upset experts. Madhavan Rajeevan, secretary, ministry of earth sciences, agreed and called it “very unfortunate” in a tweet, but went on to add that it did not affect monitoring for Cyclone Tauktae. IMD’s Doppler or S band radar, installed at the Regional Meteorological Centre in Colaba, has a powerful antenna that can track around a 500km radius and has good transmission capability too. Radars are special as their signals do not weaken and one gets perfect data even if it’s very cloudy or raining heavily. TimesViewJust when it was most needed to provide information about the cyclone on Monday, the Doppler radar remained non-functional. This is not the first time the sophisticated radar developed a glitch. In 2016 too, it remained non-functional for a fortnight. The IMD should ensure that the equipment is well maintained round the clock.Asked about the non-functional Doppler radar, Rajeevan said it was an important tool but the IMD had other platforms which could help it make a “perfect forecast” of Tauktae, its track, landfall location, time and intensity. “There is one Doppler in Mumbai and another in Bhuj (Gujarat). However the one at Bhuj is away from the coast, and therefore had the one in Mumbai been functional, it would have played a crucial role in tracking the path (of the cyclone),” said Akshay Deoras, an independent meteorologist who is a PhD student at the University of Reading in UK. Rajeevan tweeted on Tuesday: “I agree, very unfortunate. But it did not affect monitoring as IMD had access to 3 high resolution satellites.

The panel had come off due to heavy winds triggered by the cyclone. The incident took place when the nurse was passing on the road below a building of the hospital. The glass panels of the building had started coming loose due to heavy winds. Some of these fell inside a ward while the remaining came crashing down on the ground below, on the nurse. She was rushed to the casualty department of the hospital and given first aid. Detailed investigations were conducted on the nurse to ensure that she did not have any serious injuries as she was pregnant too. The ward that had a glass panel on one side instead of a wall, was being used to keep Covid-19 patients. Officer on special duty for Covid-19 Vinod Rao said that the ward had 43 patients who were shifted to other wards in the hospital. Movement was also restricted in the areas where there were glass panels on the building. The patients were shifted just in time by staffers treating them. The glass panels fell not only on the outside, but even inside the ward near the beds where the patients were sleeping. Rao said that engineers of the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) were asked to inspect the building as well as the dome structure tfor safety purposes. The hospial had 484 patients on Wednesday afternoon including 162 on ventilators or BIPAP machines as well as 143 on non-rebreather masks requiring high quantity of oxygen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/nurse-injured-by-glass-shards-falling-off-hosps-exterior-panel/articleshow/82748003.cms||---

While more than 28 people were injured across the state, two fishermen from Sindhudurg district are still missing. Jalgaon, Ratnagiri, Mumbai and Palghar districts reported two deaths each, while Thane and Sindhudurg districts reported three deaths each. Raigad reported four deaths. Officials said the toll is likely to increase. Early on Tuesday, the port zone of Mumbai Police, along with the CISF, rescued 11 fishermen stranded in the sea in two boats. In another incident, seven fishermen were rescued after their boat broke anchor at Angre jetty in south Mumbai and drifted into the sea. In Mahim, one fisherman drowned, while two others were rescued as they were trying to retrieve their boats. According to preliminary on-ground assessment, over 11,000 structures were partially damaged, 13,500-plus people evacuated from low- lying areas, and over 10,000 hectares of farmland were damaged, which largely included fruit-bearing trees in the coastal districts. Raigad, Sindhudurg and Ratnagiri have relaxed the lockdown-like restrictions rules and allowed shops selling electrical, hardware, cement, steel items to remain open. “As many as 661 villages having a population of 1.6 lakh remain without power supply. Around 150 fishing boats and 5,000 hectares of farmland were damaged,” said Raigad collector Nidhi Choudhari. “Three people died, while two are missing in Sindhudurg and over 4,000 structures have been damaged. The estimated loss in the district is about Rs 8 crore. Malvan and Devgad talukas are the worst affected,” said Sindhudurg district information officer Hemant Chavhan. In Palghar district, 337 houses were partly damaged. The state government said it will take up the issue of providing compensation to those affected by the cyclone in the cabinet meeting on Wednesday. Maharashtra will also seek compensation from the Centre. Meanwhile, Union home minister Amit Shah on Tuesday spoke to the chief ministers of the cyclone-affected states, including Maharashtra, and took stock of the situation and extended help. Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray spoke with his Gujarat counterpart Vijay Rupani. Fisheries minister Aslam Shaikh visited a few fishing villages in Mumbai to review the damage and promised adequate compensation to the locals. Thirteen fishing boats have sunk and 218 damaged, while one is still stranded in the sea at Uttan. Fishermen have written to Thackeray demanding that the state declare a “wet famine” and immediately release Rs 35 crore as compensation for their community.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-cyclone-toll-rises-to-18-2-fishermen-still-missing/articleshow/82751856.cms||---

---||Chennai||MK Stalin asks officials to make Tamil Nadu self-reliant in oxygen, vaccine, drugs||CHENNAI: Hampered by the shortage of life-saving oxygen, drugs and vaccines in the fight against the pandemic, chief minister M K Stalin on Tuesday pushed for self-reliance by asking state-owned Tidco to explore the possibility of joining hands with private players to produce oxygen, medical equipment, oxygen concentrators, vaccines and other drugs used in treating Covid-19 infection. Tidco will enter into joint ventures with both Indian and overseas industrial companies willing to invest at least Rs 50 crore in setting up such new units. “Tidco has floated Express Of Interest (EOI) seeking proposals from investors for setting up units to produce oxygen, oxygen concentrators, medical equipment, vaccine and other drugs used for containing the Covid spread,” a senior government official told TOI. While no target has been set in terms of number of new ventures to be floated, Tidco will study the offers that it receives by May 31, 2021 and finalize prospective ventures,” a senior government official told TOI. The official pointed out to the incentives announced last week by the state government for new units to be established and become operational by November 30, 2021. The incentives include 30% capital subsidy for both large and small units, interest subvention for units requiring smaller investments and cost-free single window clearance of the proposal by Guidance Tamil Nadu. Even though any fresh oxygen produced would have to be offered to the central pool for the Union government to distribute it among states, sources said the pandemic has brought betetr coordination among states in tackling emergencies that arise from time to time. They cited the instance of SicgilSol oxygen plant in Thanjavur, which had to abruptly stop its production last Sunday. “The SicgilSol unit was producing 50MT per day. While the sudden stoppage of production increased the pressure on officials to redistribute available supply to the central and south Tamil Nadu, timely help from Andhra Pradesh and Kerala helped the state overcome the situation without much trouble,” the sources said. According to them, chief secretary (V Irai Anbu) quickly reached out to his counterparts in Andhra Pradesh and Kerala. “Consequently Andhra Pradesh, which has been allotted 35MT from Inox unit at Sriperumbudur, came forward and let go 15MT in favour of us. On its part, Kerala increased its supply to our state by 15MT. Such understanding at the officials level saved the day,” the sources added. Even the Centre has not been found wanting. Besides increasing the oxygen allotment to Tamil Nadu upon the request of chief minister Stalin, the Centre also offered four ‘ISO’ containers to Tamil Nadu, as the state was struggling to ferry its allotted oxygen from Odisha, the sources added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/stalin-asks-officials-to-make-tn-self-reliant-in-o2-vaccine-drugs/articleshow/82750201.cms||D Govardan
---||Delhi||Black fungus: We can’t be caught unawares this time, says Delhi HC||NEW DELHI: This time Delhi can’t be “caught unawares”, Delhi High Court warned the state government on Wednesday while pointing to the shortage of a key drug to treat cases of black fungus, a post-Covid affliction. “What are the bottlenecks? You have to point them out. It can’t be a case of shortage if the drug is locally made. How can the drug be suddenly in short supply? We can’t be caught unawares,” said a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh, while asking Delhi government to inform it by Thursday about the stock and supply status of amphotericin B used in the treatment of mucormycosis, commonly called black fungus. Senior advocate Rahul Mehra said a single patient needed 90 vials of the drug for treatment but the state government didn’t have the required stocks because supply was controlled by the central government. On the sudden shortage, Mehra pointed out that the demand for amphotericin B had suddenly shot up 100 times when it was earlier not regularly prescribed in such high numbers by doctors. “We have no stocks. Purely and squarely, the supply of this drug lies with the Centre, like Remdesivir. We are getting it in a rationed manner since the Centre has to make it available,” Mehra told the court, adding that other states too were facing this shortage. The bench responded, “What are the stocks held by you, what are your supplies and how are you distributing it, please tell us.” The court also sought to know the rationale behind the drug being cleared first by a technical committee before being approved for use on a needy patient. The government had submitted that it had set up a four-member panel to meet twice a day to clear applications. The high court asked both the Centre and Delhi government to take instructions on the issue and apprise it on Thursday. The bench noted, “Nobody had anticipated that we would be so badly hit by the second Covid wave which was why there were shortages of medicines.” The bench is monitoring the treatment of Covid patients and availability of hospital beds, testing laboratories, etc. Watch We can’t be caught unawares: Delhi HC on rising mucormycosis cases||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/we-cant-be-caught-unawares-this-time-hc/articleshow/82782694.cms||Abhinav Garg

He would offer them the test in ‘private’ and then charge Rs 1,500 for it,” cops said. The misdeeds of the accused were found out after a patient came to visit a doctor at the same institute for consultation. “The doctor, seeing symptoms in the patient, asked her to start taking Covid-related medication. But the fake report she got stated that she was Covid negative. On noticing it, the doctor immediately informed the superintendent,” said an investigating officer.

---||Mumbai||Amitabh Bachchan plays key role in starting 25-bed Covid care facility in Juhu||MUMBAI: The western suburb of Juhu got a 25-oxygen bed Covid care centre with a donation from its most famous resident, actor Amitabh Bachchan. The facility was started in a building on Ritambhara College premises on Tuesday. Local corporator Renu Hansraj said amid concerns about a third wave likely to affect children, the next step is to set up a paediatric facility with 25 oxygen beds at the same place. The senior Bachchan has made the donation for infrastructure at the facility. Mentioning the initiative in his blog post of May 15-16, the actor had said, “The 25-bedded care centre that I had donated for is happily all ready...the facilities are all in place... and just today the relevant OCs have been obtained from the BMC and the fire brigade... just one more permission is due to come tomorrow and with that the facility shall be ready to operate by Tuesday or Wednesday... this is for the really needy and those that cannot afford the expenses required for treatment.” Producer Anand Pandit has facilitated arrangements at the centre. Hansraj said initially the plan was to start a 50-bed facility. “But when we put up the first 25 beds and got the oxygen lines in place, we wanted to get moving. The civic authorities then suggested another 25 beds be converted into a paediatric facility instead. We plan to work on the same in the coming days,” said Hansraj. Local MLA Ameet Satam said payment to the vendors for infrastructure at the centre was done by the actor. “As public representatives, we only helped ensure that the centre became operational as soon as possible. The reason behind setting up oxygen beds is that patients who are unable to find hospital beds and are in need of oxygen can be brought here and their condition can be stabilised,” said Satam, adding that besides the paediatric ward, efforts are also on to start an ICU facility. Umesh Sanghvi, trustee of Ritambhara Vishva Vidyapeeth, said the facility was started within a fortnight. “There were challenges in getting the oxygen lines within the college, but everyone came together to make it happen.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-big-b-plays-key-role-in-starting-25-bed-covid-care-facility-in-juhu/articleshow/82751919.cms||Richa Pinto

Officials of the task force set up to coordinate and facilitate the transportation of oxygen said that trucks carrying tankers had to wait for a few hours at the Hazira plant for the water to recede but the roads were cleared by 3pm. The speed of the trucks also reduced due to the wind, but there was no disruption. In fact, an official said that on Monday, the state lifted 66MT from the Hazira plant against an allocation of 60MT and 112MT from the 120MT allocation. From Bhiwadi, 100MT was lifted. “We were able to lift the capacity allotted to us. We had made arrangements keeping in view the possible disruptions due to the cyclone. We had 11 teams including personnel from SDRF and police stationed at various locations to clear the path in the event of fallen trees blocking the road or roads getting damaged,” said a senior official of the task force. Some trucks reached a few hours late because of rains, water logging and the wind speed but there has been no discontinuity in getting the allotted capacity, he said. Looking at the possibility that things could go wrong due to the ferocity of the cyclone, the task force had prepared in advance. “We had collected enough oxygen to last for two days so that there is no shortage of it even if supply gets disrupted for a day,” he added. He said officials of the Gujarat government were also on alert mode to ensure quick restoration of traffic on roads .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cyclone-delays-o2-tankers-from-guj-by-a-few-hours/articleshow/82751838.cms||---

As of Tuesday, the reduced level of the dam due to the summer is 31.8m. The dam storage as of now is 526.5 hectare metre, which means the resevoir is over 50% full. Allaying fears, the department source said that people of Canacona need not worry as there is enough water to last till the monsoon. For domestic consumption, about 8 MLD per day is used by the water supply department for the people of Canacona. Moreover, the source said that irrigation water requirement is considerably reduced by this time as paddy for the rabi season has already been harvested. “No doubt we distribute water for garden crops but that too is in short supply. We give them water twice to thrice a week. We also provide water for sugarcane and coconut plantations in areas like Gulem and petrol pump area, which has been reduced so that more water is available for consumption,” the source said. Meanwhile the concerned department has informed the public not to venture into the dam waters either for swimming, washing or fishing. It has also been notified that if anyone is found violating these instructions, then the concerned department will be liable to initiate action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/irrigation-supply-reduced-to-meet-domestic-needs-in-canacona-officials/articleshow/82753865.cms||---
---||Chennai||Chennai divided into 348 grids; e-registration must for travel||CHENNAI: In a novel initiative to contain lockdown violations by motorists, the Greater Chennai Police have divided the city into 348 grids and allowed inter-grid movement only if road-users had valid e-registration. A press release from commissioner of police Shankar Jiwal’s office clarified that an e-pass or e-register is mandatory for anyone stepping out of their houses after 10am or before 6am. Those who don’t possess these valid registrations will not be allowed to enter from one grid to another. The move, however, caught commuters by surprise, resulting in chaos and traffic pile-ups at key junctions and thoroughfares on Tuesday morning. Commissioner Jiwal came out with the detailed traffic curbs shortly after chief minister M K Stalin’s review meeting for top police officers. As per the new plan, the 138 police stations in city limits have been divided into 348 grids called sectors. Cops barricaded roads and allowed movement only on a handful of routes so as to enable police to verify and allow only those who had e-registrations or and frontline workers out on essential purposes. Commuters without valid documents to justify their movement outside their respective sectors were disallowed from proceeding any further. Due to the strict enforcement, places like Spencer’s signal witnessed a big pile-up of vehicles disallowed from using the stretch. After making lockdown violators spend about an hour in the hot sun, police let them go with a warning. Similar scenes were witnessed in traffic junctions at Nandanam, Teynampet, Thiruvanmiyur, Adyar, near Gandhi statue on Kamarajar Salai, Saidapet, Guindy, Ashok Nagar and few more places. City traffic police inspector V Praveen said, “we stopped the bikes and cars at key intersections and allowed them to drive one after another, making a beeline, so that we can verify their credentials.” Another traffic police officer at Teynampet said, “we formed two lanes – one for cars and the other for bikes -- at Teynampet junction. It was a little chaotic initially, but later it became smooth.” However, arguments broke out when a few doctors and journalists out on duty too were caught up in the melee. Many took to the social media slamming city police for enforcing the curbs without adequate prior intimation or publicity. Traffic pile up on main roads led motorists to take a detour and crowd narrow streets to reach their destinations. On Monday, meanwhile, Chennai police slapped 2,855 cases on people for flouting lockdown norms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/city-divided-into-348-grids-e-registration-must-for-travel/articleshow/82750203.cms||---
---||Chennai||Chennai: Ill-effects of alcohol a reason for vaccine hesitancy in people||CHENNAI: The city corporation is ramping up drives and camps for vaccination, but many residents remain hesitant due to the alleged ill effects of alcohol. This hesitancy has remained from the time Greater Chennai Corporation began a drive for frontline workers in February. This is not only among low income groups, but also among middle and high income groups, conversations with residents show. Corporation officials have on multiple occasions clarified that there is no study to show consumption of alcohol will adversely affect vaccination, but in Chennai doctors advise residents to abstain for a day before the jab and 3-7 days after. R Krishnan*, a resident of central Chennai, said his senior citizen father who had a habit of consuming small amount of alcohol every day was unwilling to take the vaccine. “He is worried about adverse reactions,” said the 33-year-old. K Magesh*, who lives in the suburbs, said men in the family of his house help and his driver did not take the vaccine for the same reason. “Though I tried to clarify many times, they are unconvinced,” said the 30-year-old. Officials in the country’s tele counselling centre say they continue to get a number of calls regarding vaccine efficacy. “Some ask if vaccines are safe if they consume alcohol. Some have also raised questions about its safety after actor Vivekh’s death,” an official said. News breaks about vaccines is when they get maximum calls regarding the subject. Dr E Theranirajan, dean of Madras Medical College and Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, in a chat with actor Karthi hosted by the corporation on its social media channel last week, said that alcohol consumption would reduce the effectiveness of any medicine and the vaccine was no different. “Don’t consume alcohol one day before and three days after the jab,” he said.

The single bench of Justice SP Sharma issued the order on a petition by Urmila, wife of Dr Kamal.The petitioner, wife of a private homeopathic practitioner who had died of Covid, sought a direction to the state government to extend the benefit of order April 11, 2020 (Pension 05/2020) to the family and dependent of ‘private doctors’ practicing in all fields, whether belonging to allopathic, homoeopathic or ayurvedic system of medicine who died of Covid, for ex-gratia payment /compensation of Rs 50 lakh. The government was asked to reply within four weeks.“When ‘ration dealers’ and ‘accredited journalists’ have been included in the ambit of order entitling their family members or dependents to receive an ex-gratia payment/compensation of Rs 50 lakh in the event of their death due to Covid, why private doctors who are more susceptible to catching an infection left out,” said Sunil Samdaria, counsel for the petitioner.The central and state governments had ordered that hospitals, dispensaries, clinics, nursing homes, both in the public and private sector, were kept out of the ambit of lockdown and it was specifically stated that they would remain functional.In compliance with the above government direction , husband of the petitioner, Dr Kamal, kept his homoeopathic dispensary/clinic functional throughout lockdown and during periods of extended lock down and served his patients.Dr Kamal contracted Covid while running his clinic and died on August 6, 2020 at Mahatma Gandhi Medical College and Hospital, Sitapura, Jaipur. Extending the scope of order of April 11, 2020 (Pension 02/2020), the state government issued an order on March 25, 2021 including even ‘ration dealers’ and ‘accredited journalists’ among the beneficiaries. The petitioner asked why private practitioners were kept out of the ambit of this benefit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/hc-notice-over-covid-warrior-tag-for-pvt-docs/articleshow/82751880.cms||Joychen Joseph

---||Mumbai||All four vessels hit hard by sea swell, gusty winds, says Navy||MUMBAI/NEW DELHI: As search ops for missing crew members of the barge P-305 continued on Tuesday, people in the know said evacuation measures had been initiated as soon as the barge had shown signs of tilting. Indian Navy’s chief PRO, Commander Mehul Karnik, said all the vessels seemed to have been hit hard by the high sea swell and gusty winds. P–305 saw its anchors give way, causing it to start drifting, and it later sunk. TOI learned from some crew members who had disembarked from P-305 on May 8 that the barge had been unable to reach the shores ahead of the cyclone “due to some issue,” though some other barges and vessels had succeeded. “The crew members are from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Punjab, Kerala and Karnataka,” sources said. Sources said rescuers were battling ferocious winds and very high waves. People aware of the situation said the choppy sea has made transfer of people from barges to rescue ships a challenging task. The barges and the drillship were deployed for drilling and exploration in Heera field off Bombay High and western offshore, which make up ONGC’s main production base. The vessels had gone adrift on Monday after their moorings snapped due to the ferocity of Tuktae, which pushed up wind speed to 195 km and created waves as high as 6-8 metres. Karnik said the anchors of ‘Support Station-3’ had also given way, causing it to drift, while Gal Constructor had drifted off Colaba Point with water ingress in the engine room. ONGC’s Sagar Bhushan, deployed for exploration in the western offshore, had started drifting north. Several personnel from P-305, rescued by Sea King helicopter, were taken to INS Shikra and given medical attention. “INS Talwar has sailed to render assistance to another oil rig Sagar Bhushan with 101 personnel onboard and an accommodation barge SS-3,” said the official. Coast Guard PRO, Commandant R K Singh stated, “In an effective coordinated rescue operation, all 137 crew of distressed vessel Gal Constructor successfully rescued and are safely ashore. Rescue mission accomplished.” Gal Constructor was rescued off Satpati coast, and three Chetak helicopters were pressed into service. ONGC and Afcon are updating families of those on board the vessels, officials said. ONGC on Tuesday evening tweeted, “All drifted vessels, except ‘P-305’ are taken in control and their crew are safe. @IndianNavy and #ONGC are actively engaged in rescuing crew of vessel ‘P-305’.” Vice-admiral M S Pawar said while speaking to mediapersons, “This is one of the most challenging search and rescue operations I have seen in the last four decades.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-all-four-vessels-hit-hard-by-sea-swell-gusty-winds-says-navy/articleshow/82751970.cms||Mateen Hafeez

CPM leaders said the decision was based on the “common agreement” that none of the incumbent ministers should be included in the Pinarayi government 2.0. However, many in the party and outside view the push for new faces from Vijayan as a ploy to knock out his potential competitors and solidify more power in his hands. Read AlsoKerala: K K Shailaja first casualty in Pinarayi Vijayan second waveThe CPM, in a bid to induct fresh faces in the second Pinarayi Vijayan govt, dropped the immensely popular KK Shailaja from the new cabinet, sending shockwaves across the state and among its own cadres, and spawning doubts on the continued efficacy of Kerala’s hitherto sterling fight againstVijayan and Kodiyeri Balakrishnan had proposed the idea of inducting fresh faces in the cabinet in the party politburo meeting last week and party general secretary Yechury had in fact asked the state leadership to give an exemption to Shailaja in view of the popularity she earned as the health minister. “Teacher was aware of the move to drop her from the cabinet and had spoken to Yechury about it. She was hopeful that the party general secretary’s intervention would prompt the state leadership to change its stand,” sources close to Shailaja said. Read AlsoKerala: CPM rank &amp; file upset over omitting K K ShailajaThe demise of veteran communist leader K R Gouri Amma a few days ago had been an occasion for the Left sympathizers in the state to “mourn the historical blunder of the party” which failed to make her the chief minister. Now, the decision of the CPM state committee to drop K K Shailaja from the next“I accept the party decision. I would do what the party demands,” Shailaja said during her brief interaction with media. “The government’s success was a collective one. I too played a part. That’s it,” said Shailaja. Though CPM had made it clear that it would not consider sitting ministers to the new cabinet, there was a feeling that the party would consider Shailaja as a special case, considering the fact that her experience would be unmatchable in the fight against Covid-19. It was Kodiyeri Balakrishnan who conveyed to the CPM state committee about the party politburo’s and state secretariat’s decision that all the party ministers in the next cabinet should be new faces. A few members in the state committee stood for Shailaja, but their requests were turned down. The leadership role that Shailaja played in the fight against Covid-19 outbreak in Kerala had earned her a name even outside the country. “Under the garb of giving a chance to new faces, Vijayan has eliminated all potential threats and dissent in his new cabinet. He also wants to wash his hands of the bad reputation several of his cabinet colleagues had earned,” said CPM former state committee member Appukkuttan Vallikkunnam. The CPM, that too upon the insistence of Vijayan, had denied seats to 38 sitting MLAs in the assembly elections. Senior leaders like G Sudhakaran and T M Thomas Isaac too were denied seats. But the move to give more opportunities to youngsters paid off as the party and LDF were able to retain power by putting an end to the practice of Congress and CPM-led fronts winning the elections alternately. This has given Pinarayi more authority to dictate terms single-handedly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/teacher-absent-class-must-continue/articleshow/82756939.cms||B S Anilkumar

Read AlsoKerala: K K Shailaja first casualty in Pinarayi Vijayan second waveThe CPM, in a bid to induct fresh faces in the second Pinarayi Vijayan govt, dropped the immensely popular KK Shailaja from the new cabinet, sending shockwaves across the state and among its own cadres, and spawning doubts on the continued efficacy of Kerala’s hitherto sterling fight againstVijayan and Kodiyeri Balakrishnan had proposed the idea of inducting fresh faces in the cabinet in the party politburo meeting last week and party general secretary Yechury had in fact asked the state leadership to give an exemption to Shailaja in view of the popularity she earned as the health minister. “Teacher was aware of the move to drop her from the cabinet and had spoken to Yechury about it. She was hopeful that the party general secretary’s intervention would prompt the state leadership to change its stand,” sources close to Shailaja said. Read AlsoKerala: CPM rank &amp; file upset over omitting K K ShailajaThe demise of veteran communist leader K R Gouri Amma a few days ago had been an occasion for the Left sympathizers in the state to “mourn the historical blunder of the party” which failed to make her the chief minister. Now, the decision of the CPM state committee to drop K K Shailaja from the next“I accept the party decision. I would do what the party demands,” Shailaja said during her brief interaction with media. “The government’s success was a collective one. I too played a part. That’s it,” said Shailaja. Though CPM had made it clear that it would not consider sitting ministers to the new cabinet, there was a feeling that the party would consider Shailaja as a special case, considering the fact that her experience would be unmatchable in the fight against Covid-19. It was Kodiyeri Balakrishnan who conveyed to the CPM state committee about the party politburo’s and state secretariat’s decision that all the party ministers in the next cabinet should be new faces. A few members in the state committee stood for Shailaja, but their requests were turned down. The leadership role that Shailaja played in the fight against Covid-19 outbreak in Kerala had earned her a name even outside the country. “Under the garb of giving a chance to new faces, Vijayan has eliminated all potential threats and dissent in his new cabinet. He also wants to wash his hands of the bad reputation several of his cabinet colleagues had earned,” said CPM former state committee member Appukkuttan Vallikkunnam. The CPM, that too upon the insistence of Vijayan, had denied seats to 38 sitting MLAs in the assembly elections. Senior leaders like G Sudhakaran and T M Thomas Isaac too were denied seats. But the move to give more opportunities to youngsters paid off as the party and LDF were able to retain power by putting an end to the practice of Congress and CPM-led fronts winning the elections alternately. This has given Pinarayi more authority to dictate terms single-handedly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/teacher-absent-class-must-continue/articleshow/82750258.cms||B S Anilkumar

Tuesday registered 1,359 fresh infections, taking the case positivity rate to 35%. Mortalities, however, rose to 2,198 with 45 Covid-19 deaths reported over the past 24 hours. Of the total casualties, 23 people died while undergoing treatment at the Goa Medical College and hospital, Bambolim, and 11 deaths were reported from the South Goa district hospital. These are the two government hospitals that are presently dealing with the maximum load of Covid-19 patients. Elsewhere, three people were brought dead to hospital. A 39-year-old man from Siolim was declared brought dead at the North Goa district hospital. He had no comorbidities and had tested positive for the dreaded virus the same day. Two men — a 52-year-old from Salcete and an 80-year-old from Ponda — who were in home isolation, were also declared brought dead. Four patients who died at hospital after being in home isolation were in their 70s. Six patients, including a 39-year-old from Bastora, died within 24 hours of being admitted to hospital. A 55-year-old man from St Inez who had been suffering from cancer, died at the GMC barely two days after he tested positive for Covid-19. Taking a firm stand on timely medical care for those who need it, state health minister Vishwajit Rane said that if any hospital refuses admission, a patient must email the health secretary or the directorate of health services to ensure that action is taken against the errant healthcare facility. On Monday, the state government took over admission rights of all 21 private hospitals following complaints that some had denied admission to Covid-19 patients on the ground that their beds were fully occupied. Rane said that such private hospitals must admit not just mild and moderate cases of the coronavirus but critical Covid-19 patients, too. Additionally, the state saw 3,120 Covid-19 patients declared cured on Tuesday, pulling the recovery rate up to 81%. Goa has nearly 24,000 active Covid-19 cases. The daily average of tests done over the past three days was 4,000 while the count was 7,000 during the preceding 10 days. On Monday, state health secretary Ravi Dhawan had pointed out that the state may be reporting fewer cases of Covid-19 as fewer people may have stepped out to get tested due to unfavorable weather conditions. The state government would have to wait for few days more before ascertaining whether Goa has in fact witnessed its Covid-19 peak, he had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fresh-infections-remain-under-2000-for-third-day-over-3000-declared-recovered/articleshow/82751946.cms||---

---||Aurangabad||Checks sought on illegal water lifting from Jayakwadi||Aurangabad: As construction of headwork for the upcoming water supply scheme in Aurangabad falls within the limits of the eco-sensitive zone of Jayakwadi bird sanctuary, a necessary clearance is being awaited from the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF & CC). In its proposal sent to the Centre in April 2018, the forest department had categorically said Jayakwadi bird sanctuary is situated in drought-prone area and water is essential for “both human beings and birds”. “It is an important site for local and migratory birds. To provide ample food and water to birds, at least dead water storage will be left in the sanctuary so that even if less rainfall occurs in the next monsoon, the remaining stock of water can take care of the visiting birds in the winter,” the proposal reads. Senior bird researcher Dilip Bhagat said MoEF & CC should pay attention to unauthorised lifting of water from Jayakwadi dam before giving clearance to the new water supply scheme for Aurangabad. “Both seasonal farming and fishing are rampant in an illegal manner within Jayakwadi bird sanctuary and its eco-sensitive zone. Such farming witnesses highly uncontrolled extraction of water. Even many locals have dug wells right inside the catchment area of the dam within the limits of the bird sanctuary to lift water,” he said. Highlighting that Jayakwadi dam was already supplying water to Jalna and Aurangabad (existing pipeline) besides catering to need of industries, Bhagat said the revenue, irrigation and forest department must act together to put a check on unauthorised lifting of water from the dam. While the MoEF clearance in question is still awaited, former Aurangabad MP Chandrakant Khaire has written a letter to union minister Prakash Javadekar to expedite the formalities. “The current water supply scheme is very old and (water) situation in the city is very challenging. Residents of Aurangabad get water once in 6-7 days and that too for a duration of just 45-minutes in spite of one of the largest dam Jayakwadi is near the city,” Khaire has told the union minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/checks-sought-on-illegal-water-lifting-from-jayakwadi/articleshow/82750267.cms||Prasad Joshi

Ward 42 councilor Dashrath Singh and ward 46 councillor Jyoti Chauhan had written to Gurjar that they received complaints from residents that Sharma took money from people on charges of not wearing masks. Gurjar said, “We received a complaint that Sharma used to extort street vendors in the name of huge amounts of fine for not wearing masks. His used to click a photograph and then charge someone. We have written to the commissioner to send him on APO and take action.” Sources in the department, however, said councillors were holding grudges against an honest officer. “The officer is really honest and did not follow unnecessary demands of councilors and politicians. That is why they are exterting pressure on the commissioner to send him on APO, but hope the commissioner will act diligently,” said a source in the department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/heritage-mayors-ire-on-revenue-inspector/articleshow/82751953.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||Fears of man-animal conflict surface again in Tillari as elephant herd spotted||Keri: A herd of four elephants, including two calves has been found roaming in the forest area near the Tillari Reservoir since last week. Villagers have expressed apprehension as the male tusker was noticed with injuries. In 2002 a herd of 20 elephants entered Sindhudurg district from the forests of Karnataka-Goa through Maan and Mangeli villages situated on the Maharashtra-Karnataka border. Man-elephant conflict in the vicinity of Tillari region reached to such an extent that it resulted in the death of around 10 elephants and deaths of more than a dozen people. Damage of over Rs12 crore to agricultural and horticultural crops had been reported by the Sawantwadi forest division. From 2004 to 2008 repeated campaigns were organised by Maharashtra forest department to send elephants back to their natural habitat but it did not prove successful in completely eliminating the man-elephant conflict. Seven elephants remained in Sindhudurg, of which three took refuge in Kendre in the backwater of Tillari reservoir and remaining four moved to the Kudal area of which all four elephants were dead. Currently a herd of four, with an injured male tusker and a female elephant and the two calves, entered Babarwadi in Hewale from Ker-Morle forest of Dodamarg taluka. Sanket Naik from Maneri, said, “Among the herd of four elephants the tusker is injured and is seen roaming in the forest along with the female elephant and two calves. There is an urgent need of monitoring the movement of these elephants as they may enter into areas of human settlement of the Goa-Maharashtra border. A decade ago elephants from Tillari forest entered into Goa and created havoc in villages of Bicholim, Bardez and Pernem talukas.” Deputy conservator of Sawantwadi forest division, Shahaji Naranvar said, “Recently I had visited Tillari region and I am planning a strategy to monitor the movement of the elephants. I will inform our staff to patrol the area.” Sanjay Sawant from Dodamarg said, “Increasing activities of forest clearances near to the Tillari reservoir is posing serious threat to the habitat of the wildlife. There is need to accord protection to these four elephants.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fears-of-man-animal-conflict-surface-again-in-tillari-as-elephant-herd-spotted/articleshow/82753940.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar

---||Jaipur||Second wave puts brakes on Jaipur Development Authority’s big ticket infra projects||JAIPUR: The curfew imposed during the second wave of Covid has resulted in slowing down the Jaipur Development Authority’s big budget infrastructure projects in the state capital. The state government allowed construction activities during the curfew but the spread of the infection among supervisory staff and labourers stalled all works. The JDA will be forced to extend project deadlines of almost seven projects by a period of six months to one year. An official said, “After the digging of Ramniwas Bagh underground project started, the chief designer of the awarded firm succumbed to Covid. The JDA engineer also got infected and in such a situation, the work was affected.” The JDA is also facing a shortage of manpower at all construction sites due to migration of workers, which stimulated uncertainty over completion of projects on time. A senior official said, “To construct the flyover at Civil Lines the JDA has awarded the work, however, it cannot be initiated. Similarly, Jhotwara elevated road work is also delayed due to shortage of skilled labour and material.” The work on Sodala elevated road project again encountered a serious setback due to shortage of oxygen. Source said that trained gas cutters and welders are migrating from the city in absence of oxygen. “Many labourers who were involved in welding-related work are migrating in absence of work. It would take long to gather the momentum and restore the resources,” he said. It was informed at the sites that specialised labour is required as the steel comes in the shape of squares. Cutting them and bridging them together is a very important activity in construction. The civic body had planned to complete the long-pending project by October-end. However, after the second wave hit the city, sources said the project would not be operational before June 2022. The work of long pending Rs48-crore Bassi flyover project will also not be completed soon as JDA is waiting for the railway’s nod to start construction over the lines. The project is expected to be delayed by 8 months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/second-wave-puts-brakes-on-jdas-big-ticket-infra-projects/articleshow/82751913.cms||---

At a time when Vadodara, like other regions of the state, was reeling under the impact of cyclone Tauktae, at least two dozen Covid-19 patients were shifted from referral hospitals and community health centres from rural areas like Dabhoi and Savli because of the flash strike. From Dabhoi referral hospital and community health centre alone nearly 19 Covid-19 patients were shifted to Vadodara’s GMERS Medical College and Hospital, Gotri and isolation centres at Thuvavi and Darul Uloom as all the 11 nurses had joined the strike leaving nobody to attend the patients. The flash strike crippled the services at Covid wards and ICUs at state-run SSG Hospital where nearly 526 patients were undergoing treatment. “In view of the strike, we have deputed doctors, nurses and nursing students from GMERS hospital to manage the situation at SSG Hospital,” said Dr Vinod Rao, officer on special duty for Covid-19 in Vadodara. But this move did not ease problems faced by resident doctors and medical students who are already burdened with the flow of patients. “Even inside ICU, we are finding it difficult to attend to all the patients. We were already short of manpower and now the entire burden has fallen on us. Who is to be blamed,” questioned a resident doctor. The Gujarat In-Service Doctors Association which has nearly 200 members in Vadodara district admitted that patients are facing inconvenience because of their strike. “We had begun ‘pen-down strike’ to press for our demands and seeking government’s intervention to resolve our problems. But we had not stopped our work as we never wanted to create trouble for patients,” said Vadodara chapter president Dr Uday Tilawat. “By transferring four of our office-bearers instead of holding talks with us, the state government has forced us to go on flash strike,” said Tilawat, adding that the association will stick to its demands. Earlier, the doctors had threatened to go on mass casual leave on May 24 and indefinite strike from May 31. The United Nurses Forum (UNF) and other nurses who staged a demonstration at SSG Hospital too blamed the state government. UNF said that while it had gone on token strike on Tuesday, it will go on indefinite strike from Wednesday onwards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/flash-strike-by-nurses-doctors-adds-to-woes-of-covid-patients/articleshow/82748184.cms||---

---||Goa||Curfew slows down work on double-tracking project||Margao: The pace of the South Western Railway’s (SWR) double-tracking project in Goa has slowed down on account of the reverse migration of labourers engaged in the work following the curfew imposed in the state. Sources in the Indian Railways said that as most of the labourers involved in the construction work are migrants, their return to their native places has adversely impacted the progress of the double tracking project. Nevertheless, sources said that the Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd (RVNL) has almost completed laying the second track between Margao and Sanvordem, and that a trial run on the second track on this stretch will be conducted soon. Work on certain stretches between Margao and Vasco has been grounded owing to the stiff opposition from the locals. The report of the Central Empowered Committee (CEC) recommending to the Supreme Court cancellation of the double tracking project, has added ammunition to the opponents of the project though the opposition brigade has been lying low, probably on account of the pandemic surge and the curfew. The CEC, in its report submitted to the court on April 23, has termed the project as “inefficient”, “unjustified” and “potentially destructive” even as it has raised concerns about the threat to the biodiversity hotspot of Mollem, and pointed to the failure of the Railways in utilising most of the existing capacity of the single railway track. The RVNL has completed construction of the six underpasses along the Goa stretch of the double tracking project – one each in Curchorem, Chandor, Kamral, Sao Jose de Areal and two in Dhadem near Sanvordem. Most of the underpasses have been constructed in a bid to enable smooth passage of traffic once the level crossings along this route are eliminated. The RVNL has now undertaken the task of installing rubberised pad surface at level crossings with a view to providing a smooth surface at the rail-road intersection at level crossings. While the work of installing the rubberized pad surface at Sao Jose de Areal level crossing was been completed, the work at Chandor is underway. The technique involves joining the rail and road interfaces by rubber pads making a flexible smooth vehicular road surface on the rail track. The rubber panels, which replace bitumen or concrete roads, are placed atop the concrete sleepers on the railway tracks. As bitumen and concrete roads entail high maintenance costs, concrete blocks were being used as an alternative. However, they were found to get disintegrated by continuous traffic load, thus leading to accidents at the crossings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/curfew-slows-down-work-on-double-tracking-project/articleshow/82751981.cms||---

Over the past one-and-a-half months, bed occupancy at RUHS remained 100% and patients were finding it difficult to get admission for treatment. But with the graph of active cases in the city dipping, the number of admissions has dropped.The bed capacity of the hospital is 1,275 but it accommodated up to 1,362 patients by setting up extra beds in the holding area (corridor). “We have adjusted 35 beds in the holding area to accommodate more patients for their treatment.

A total of 180 survivors from the barge, however, have been rescued. In the massive search operation that began after four vessels in all—two barges off the city’s coast and a barge and drill vessel off Pipavav port in Gujarat—went adrift as cyclone Tauktae stormed past India’s western coast, a total of 638 people who were aboard had either been rescued or their vessels taken to safety till Tuesday evening. The security of all the personnel on the three vessels apart from P-305 had been secured, officials said. Apart from the 180 on P-305, there were 137 personnel on board the barge GAL Constructor that ran aground off Colaba coast. They were all rescued on Tuesday, said Navy and ONGC sources. The third barge, Support Station-3 with 220 on board, which drifted north-west off Pipavav port, was hooked to a tug boat and all on board were safe, sources said. All three barges belong to Shapoorji Pallonji group company Afcons and had on board people hired by the company. The drill vessel, Drillship Sagar Bhushan, owned by ONGC, which too went adrift off Pipavav, had also been secured and was being taken back to Pipavav port at the time of going to press. It had 101 persons on board, including 38 ONGC employees. On Tuesday, three naval ships—INS Beas, Betwa and Teg—joined INS Kochi and Kolkata for the search and rescue (SAR) ops for P-305, and P8I and naval helicopters were deployed to undertake an aerial search. Sources from DG Shipping said they believed all of P-305’s crew members were wearing life jackets, and those missing could still be floating in the waters. Many of those rescued were reported to have been pulled out of the water after floating for many hours in their life jackets. People in the know said evacuation measures had been initiated as soon as the barge showed signs of tilting. Indian Navy’s chief PRO, Commander Mehul Karnik, said all the vessels seemed to have been hit hard by the high sea swell and gusty winds. P–305 saw its anchors give way, causing it to start drifting, and it later sunk. TOI learned from some crew members who had disembarked from P-305 on May 8 that the barge had been unable to reach the shores ahead of the cyclone “due to some issue,” though some other barges and vessels had succeeded. “The crew members are from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Punjab, Kerala and Karnataka,” sources said. Sources said rescuers were battling ferocious winds and very high waves. People aware of the situation said the choppy sea has made transfer of people from barges to rescue ships a challenging task. The barges and the drillship were deployed for drilling and exploration in Heera field off Bombay High and western offshore, which make up ONGC’s main production base. The vessels had gone adrift on Monday after their moorings snapped due to the ferocity of Tuktae, which pushed up wind speed to 195 km and created waves as high as 6-8 metres. Karnik said the anchors of ‘Support Station-3’ had also given way, causing it to drift, while Gal Constructor had drifted off Colaba Point with water ingress in the engine room. ONGC’s Sagar Bhushan, deployed for exploration in the western offshore, had started drifting north. Several personnel from P-305, rescued by Sea King helicopter, were taken to INS Shikra and given medical attention. “INS Talwar has sailed to render assistance to another oil rig Sagar Bhushan with 101 personnel onboard and an accommodation barge SS-3,” said the official. Coast Guard PRO, Commandant R K Singh stated, “In an effective coordinated rescue operation, all 137 crew of distressed vessel Gal Constructor successfully rescued and are safely ashore. Rescue mission accomplished.” Gal Constructor was rescued off Satpati coast, and three Chetak helicopters were pressed into service. ONGC and Afcon are updating families of those on board the vessels, officials said. ONGC on Tuesday evening tweeted, “All drifted vessels, except ‘P-305’ are taken in control and their crew are safe. @IndianNavy and #ONGC are actively engaged in rescuing crew of vessel ‘P-305’.” Vice-admiral M S Pawar told mediapersons, “This is one of the most challenging search and rescue operations I have seen in the last four decades.” Talking about the Covid situation, Pawar said all of them (defence personnel) had taken two vaccine shots and those on the barges had been working for a long time and in all probability were Covid-free. Navy officials said SAR operations continued throughout Monday night and the entire day on Tuesday while operating in challenging conditions. Offshore barges are like floating townships or colonies and rise as high as 3-4-storeyed buildings. They cannot be moved at short notice and require 8-10 days, assuming the ongoing work can be switched off quickly. There are eight anchors of 3-4 km length in each barge, which have to be carried by other vessels for dropping into the sea. Lifting anchor again involves other vessels and takes more than a week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/638-ongc-men-rescued-93-still-at-sea-off-mumbai-coast/articleshow/82754034.cms||Mateen Hafeez
---||Kochi||Kerala: CPM rank & file upset over omitting K K Shailaja||KOCHI: The demise of veteran communist leader K R Gouri Amma a few days ago had been an occasion for the Left sympathizers in the state to “mourn the historical blunder of the party” which failed to make her the chief minister. Now, the decision of the CPM state committee to drop K K Shailaja from the next cabinet seems to have caused similar grievances among the rank and file of the party. According to many CPM workers and sympathizers, the decision of the party to not include Shailaja in the cabinet has taken the sheen off the thumping victory of the LDF. “We all had expected that K K Shailaja teacher would be there in the cabinet that too with the health portfolio. But the decision of the party has disappointed us,” said Suresh Kumar, a CPM sympathizer. “Her performance as the health minister was excellent. She helped the state in tackling crises like Nipah virus outbreak and Covid-19 pandemic. The party should have given her one more chance at least for ensuring continuity in the fight against the pandemic,” he said. All the members in the last cabinet put up better performances. The success in the fight against Covid is not the achievement of just the health department, but all the departments contributed to it, she said. Her words resonate the voice of a silenced section in the party who are destined to defend the party even while it does injustice to them. According to political observers, the message given by the omission of Shailaja is that of an authoritarian rule which Kerala may witness soon. “The decision gives a clear message that Pinarayi Vijayan reigns supreme in the party as well as the government. At this time of pandemic, an experienced health minister would have been a big asset for the fight against the disease. It is learnt that only a couple of leaders who attended the CPM state committee even spoke about the need for Shailaja being given one more term. This is certainly an unwarranted trend,” said political observer N M Pearson. There are speculations that chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan was intolerant towards the public acceptance Shailaja got and she becoming a towering personality after she successfully handled the pandemic. It is a fact that the Kannur district committee of the CPM was not in favour of giving ministership to Shailaja.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cpm-rank-file-upset-over-omitting-shailaja/articleshow/82750273.cms||M K Sunil Kumar
---||Delhi||Delhi government orders 1 lakh units of key medicine||NEW DELHI: Delhi government has ordered one lakh units of the medicine used for the treatment of mucormycosis or black fungus, which is being seen among some patients infected with or recovered from Covid-19. The medicine, however, will not be available over the counter for treatment at home, but only at hospitals. A technical expert committee has also been constituted to approve requests for this injection by hospitals. Cases of black fungus, which could lead to complications like loss of vision and even death, are being reported across hospitals in the country and Delhi has also witnessed an increase in the number of cases in some hospitals. This has led to a spike in the demand for amphortericin B, a key drug used in the treatment of this rare infection. Health minister Satyendar Jain on Wednesday said black fungus could be treated only in hospitals under the supervision of doctors and through the standard protocol. “The medicines need to be available in the hospitals as black fungus cannot be treated at home... All measures are being taken to maintain the supply of medicines in the hospitals,” Jain said. “The supply was less and we have demanded one lakh units of the medicine for the treatment,” he added. In an order issued on Tuesday, Delhi government’s health department formed a three-member technical expert committee headed by pulmonologist Dr M K Daga, which will approve the applications for injection amphotericin B by all Covid hospitals. According to the order, the committee has been constituted to streamline and systematise the distribution of the injection, prevent its indiscriminate use and establish a transparent, efficient and time-bound system of distribution to the needy and hospitalised patients. The guiding norms for the committee will be based on clinically approved, evidence-based grounds and ethical principles of distributive justice, states the order. Both private and government hospitals will have to mail or send a physical application with a complete proforma to the committee to get the approval for the required numbers. The committee will meet virtually at least twice every day to scrutinise the applications and facilitate rapid decision-making. Directorate General of Health Services will coordinate with the committee and monitor the overall management from the approval till the delivery to the hospital. The decision of daily meetings will be sent through email to the hospitals and the overall allocation will be displayed on the health department’s website.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-govt-orders-1l-units-of-key-medicine/articleshow/82782752.cms||Sidharatha Roy

With sewerage and telecom lines present on both sides of the road, the department dug the middle of a road and now citizens worry that these might not be repaired anytime soon. In Tilak Nagar, the area from overhead water tank and passing through LBS College, the entire lane has been dug and temporarily covered with mud. PHED additional chief engineer Manish Beniwal said, “The pipeline is being laid down under the Gurunanakpura Water scheme worth around Rs 4.5 crore. As on both sides of the road there are sewerage and telecom lines, we decided to dig the middle of the road.” He said it was an important pipeline for transferring water and no connection would be given from it. Ravi Khatri, a resident of Raja Park, said laying pipelines was a good idea as the lines of PHED are really old and needed change, but digging the middle of the road wasn’t a great idea. “This is a serious issue and we need some answers for that. In small lanes, four-inch pipeline are laid, but now roads have been filled temporarily with mud,” said Khatri. Ward 148 councillor Mahesh Saini said he had received many complaints about the inconvenience people were facing. “Currently, people are at home so the number of complaints was not high. But slowly, as lockdown restrictions would be lifted, people would get out of their homes and complaints would increase. I asked PHED officials about the repair of roads, but officials said they had deposited road repair money in JMC-Greater. I still have to get the documents for it,” said Saini.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/phed-digs-middle-of-road-to-lay-water-pipeline-people-livid/articleshow/82751965.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Recently the state cabinet had taken a decision to prorogue the assembly session. After the opposition decided not to attend the business advisory committee meeting to decide on the budget session, chief minister Pramod Sawant cancelled the meeting and spoke to the members over the phone. In March, the state legislative assembly session was cut short by over two weeks and adjourned till July 19 after the state election commission declared the schedule for the second phase of the municipal elections, bringing into force the model code of conduct. All pending business of the house which was listed for the coming days, including the discussion on the budgetary demands and the private member’s bills submitted by the opposition, was earlier decided to be taken up for discussion and consideration in July, after the session resumes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/governor-prorogues-budget-session/articleshow/82753971.cms||---

ICMR is one of them. So, we have decided to take overall opinion on plasma therapy. Meanwhile, we will continue using it as part of Covid treatment,” said Dr Sudhir Bhandari, principal and controller, SMS Medical College and head of doctors’ panel formed by the state government for Covid treatment. Across the state, there are nine government-run medical colleges and three private medical institutes, which have the permission of collecting plasma for Covid treatment. The state has developed a proper infrastructure for convalescent plasma therapy over the last one year. The SMS Medical College had set up a separate bank of plasma of recovered patients with sufficient antibodies to transfuse in Covid patients. “We have found convalescent plasma therapy beneficial to Covid patients, who have not developed antibodies in first week of Covid infection,” said Dr Virendra Singh, member of state’s advisory committee on Covid. According to health department officials, plasma collected from Covid recovered patients was 3,940 and it was transfused into 3,664 patients, while 276 units was in the bank as on April 16. A lot of social organisations, which have been working in blood donation drives, had started encouraging Covid recovered patients to donate plasma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/icmr-junks-plasma-therapy-but-raj-to-continue-treatment/articleshow/82751947.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Covid-19 in Rajasthan: 40% of cases reported from rural areas, new SOPs issued||JAIPUR: Out of the total Covid patients in the state, around 40 per cent are from the rural areas, attracting the attention of the state government to strengthen healthcare facilities in villages and far-flung areas. The government has come up with a separate SOP for containment and management of cases in rural areas. Currently, a large number of patients have to rush to urban areas when their condition deteriorate. The new SOP will help early detection of cases and timely treatment in health centres of rural areas. “The situation in rural areas has changed a lot. Earlier, 30% cases of the state were reported from rural areas, but now it has increased to 40%. A separate SOP has been issued to deal with the increasing number of cases in rural areas and for their treatment,” said a senior health department official. A multi-pronged approach led by the gram panchayats (GP) and engaging the health sector, ICDS, schoolteachers, women self-help groups (SHGs) and other community-based organisations will be utilised for mobilising rural people in the fight against the pandemic, says the SOP. Major tasks include preventive measures for the control of the pandemic, helping surveillance activities, support quarantine and isolation facilities and ensuring early treatment. Focus of the government is now more on active surveillance for influenza-like illness/ severe acute respiratory infections (ILI/SARI), which should be done by ASHA with help of Village Health and Sanitation Committee (VHSC). Symptomatic cases can be treated at the village level and cases with comorbidity/low oxygen saturation should be sent to higher centres. As many as 350 community health centres will be converted into Covid care centres. Identified suspected cases will be linked for testing with the health facilities either through Covid rapid antigen testing or by referral of samples to nearest Covid testing laboratory. The state government is introducing rapid antigen test in rural areas. For the purpose, training will be imparted to medical officers, lab technicians, lab assistant, data entry operator and other healthcare workers. Recently, chief minister Ashok Gehlot had directed officials for posting 1,000 doctors and 25,000 nursing staff in rural areas. They will be posted at primary health centres and community health centres. A system will be developed for monitoring of oxygen saturation of Covid patients under home isolation in rural areas. The SOP says it is desirable for each village to have adequate number of pulse oximeters and thermometers. A system of providing the pulse oximeters and thermometers on loan to families with a confirmed case of Covid should be developed through ASHA/ Anganwadi workers and village-level volunteers. The pulse oximeters and thermometers shoul dbe sanitized after each use with cotton/cloth soaked in alcohol-based sanitizer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/40-of-cases-reported-from-rural-areas-new-sops-issued/articleshow/82751982.cms||Syed Intishab Ali
---||Jaipur||Lower income schools to start joint forum for online classes in Rajasthan||JAIPUR: With the pandemic situation at its peak, schools are unlikely to open for another six months. To address the situation, small and medium-sized schools have decided to come forward and start a joint forum for online classes for students all across Rajasthan. School Shiksha Pariwar, an organisation of more than 20,000 small and medium-income class schools, has said they would contribute money and set up studios and cameras where teachers will give lectures that will be recorded and sent to students. Anil Sharma, president of School Shiksha Pariwar said, “Unlike bigger schools with fees going up to lakhs of rupees, our schools cannot afford to set up studios for classes or give mobile phones to each teacher for online classes. So, we have decided to set up everything in Jaipur from where lectures will be recorded or livestreamed.” One problem that small schools face is that many students do not have android phones. For solving this problem, association has decided to send audios as well so that students will be able to listen to it even if they cannot see them. Moreover, a helpline will be set where students can call up for clearing doubts. Some schools have appreciated this step as with online classes, it becomes easier for the schools to ask parents for fees. Seema Bhardhwaj, director of Blooming Buds School, Behror, Alwar, said as not every institute has the capacity to set up online classes, it will be beneficial for schools and students if one forum was established. There are many schools which still believe that this won’t change anything. Mohmmad Ashar, director of Royal Oxford School where minimum to maximum fees is between Rs 5,000 and Rs 15,000, said many parents have become so weak financially that they are unable to pay fees. “Two years of pandemic has broken the back of parents who do not have money to pay. I spent around Rs 1 lakh for online class set up but parents still didn’t pay fee because they are simply unable to,” said Ashar. Similarly, at Bhanwar Singh Kasana, director of Jai Bharti Vidya Mandir, Shahpura, where minimum and maximum fees is between Rs 6,000 and Rs 16,000, said in rural areas, farmers could not sell vegetables which ultimately had a ripple effect on their capacity to deposit fees. Some schools have also complained that parents have a mentality that where they don’t want to pay for online classes and would rather get school materials and send kids for tuitions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/lower-income-schools-to-start-joint-forum-for-online-classes/articleshow/82751999.cms||---

The party’s state convener Rahul Mhambre said BJP itself is the biggest disaster facing Goans, with multiple consecutive failures on various fronts such as the Covid-19 pandemic, the weak response to cyclone Tauktae, and the economy. “Sawant must announce who is responsible for restoring power supply today. Goans have been silently suffering for the past 72 hours, and helpline numbers are not reachable. Who is taking decisions and who is directing and supervising the electricity department to ensure it has everything it needs to fix the problems?” Mhambre asked. The state AAP convener said the CM must ensure that electricity department staff is not diverted to give priority to fix the power outages of VIPs over the common man. Party functionary Valmiki Naik, while commending frontline workers, expressed anguish that even Goa Police personnel were seen clearing trees with nothing but a chopper and their bare hands, even as he criticised MLAs for not arranging chainsaws and even basic safety gear such as hard hats and raincoats. Naik demanded to know what was discussed at the various disaster management meetings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bjp-has-failed-on-covid-19-cyclone-econ-mgmt-aap/articleshow/82752018.cms||---
---||Kolhapur||Kolhapur dams’ live stock to be emptied by July 15||Kolhapur: The live stock from dams located in the upstream of Panchaganga river in Kolhapur district will be emptied by July 15 to make space for rain water that will come in from heavy rainfall to occur between July 15 and August 15. The live stock refers to the amount of water that can be discharged by opening of the gates, while the water below the gates is called dead stock. Authorities are giving major importance to dam water level management to avoid flooding if Panchganga river. The water resources department (WRD) has made a plan according to which enough space will be created in dams to accommodate the excess rain water. It has been observed that from mid-July to mid-August, the district witnesses maximum rainfall during monsoon. The unprecedented flooding in 2019 occurred because of heavy rainfall and no space left in dams to accommodate the downpour. This led to rise in water level of Panchganga river. Mahesh Surve, additional superintendent engineer of WRD, said, “We have studied the rainfall pattern for the last two-and-a-half decades. Based on the observations we have decided to reduce the stock of the water from the dams by carrying out frequent discharge till July 15. In 2019, continous rainfall for four to five days led to the flooding. That time the catchment areas received more than 100mm rainfall. Now, we will monitor the rainfall closely during this period and accordingly start or stop the discharge. We will also have to ensure there is adequate stock of water in the dam at the end of monsoon.” Meanwhile, the storage level of the dams have gone up due to the recent bouts of heavy rainfall. Most dams currently are 34% filled. Panchganga river falls under Krishna river basin. And the strategy to avoid flooding in Krishna river will be same. The discharge from the dams such as Koyna and Warna will be carried out regularly to make space for rain water. The irrigation authorities are also in touch with officials managing the Almatti dam located along Krishna river in neighbouring Karanataka state. Hotlines between chief secretaries of both states will be activated soon. The chief secretaries of both states are going to meet online on Wednesday. “We will keep the Almatti authorities updated about the discharge carried out from dams in our regions along with the water level of the rivers. Accordingly they can control the discharge of Almatti dam. Last year, to avoid flood, the maximum discharge from Almatti dam was around 1.5 lakh cusec,” Surve said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-dams-live-stock-to-be-emptied-by-july-15/articleshow/82750277.cms||---

The SHO was later suspended on Tuesday evening. Singh came into the ACB net after his head constable was caught red-handed taking a monthly bribe from a businessman. The ACB has handed over the case to Jaipur commissionerate after they recovered one kg of opium and two illegal firearms from his residence. ADG ACB Dinesh MN said that they have enough evidence to prove Singh’s involvement in the case. “Since he is absconding, we have not been able to question him. The evidence suggests that he was heading the monthly bribery racket while involving his policemen,” said MN. Singh fled minutes before ACB reached the police station from the back door. The ACB then raided his residence in the police complex to recover drugs and a country-made pistol. “The case has been registered and he is being searched for at all potential areas,” said the police, who are investigating the case. Singh was SHO of Bagru and Sadar. “We are also collecting clues from his earlier postings and evidence of his involvement in similar crimes in those areas,” said the police, who are also questioning the cops from the police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sho-booked-for-keeping-illegal-firearms-drugs/articleshow/82752029.cms||---

The victim, Sangita Kharat, was injured after a Banyan tree fell on her near Worli’s BDD chawl on Monday. The woman was rushed to the civic-run KEM Hospital but died during treatment. TimesViewThe biggest casualty of Monday’s cyclone was the city’s green cover. With so many trees uprooted, it was a major loss for a city whose green cover is depleting due to construction work and infra projects. The BMC must carry out tree trimming in a scientific way. Unfortunately, there have been complaints that trees are hacked under the guise of trimming by the BMC staff. This must stop.The cyclone also claimed the highest single day toll on the city’s trees. In all, 2,364 trees were either completely uprooted or had branches broken. Hundreds of vehicles were also damaged due to tree fall incidents. The BMC had an uphill task on Tuesday as uprooted trees blocked roads across the city. As many of the trees were decades old, activists believe this would severely impact the city’s green cover. On Monday, the BMC reported 333 tree fall incidents in the island city, 595 in the eastern suburbs and 1,103 in the western suburbs. Major tree fall incidents were reported in the western suburbs and central Mumbai. Residential areas with heavy green cover like Bandra and Khar reported several incidents of trees being uprooted. Tree experts say the BMC’s trimming exercise was unscientific and tree collapses were a result of poor trimming before the monsoon. Arborist Vaibhav Raje who runs Treecotech, an arboriculture firm, said, “We need more proactive mechanisms to save trees. We could have saved many trees. The BMC needs to put in place a proper risk assessment plan for trees. If this goes on, the city’s green cover will deplete in the next few years. If we give value to the trees, we have lost green cover worth crores of rupees,” Raje said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cyclone-blows-a-hole-into-green-cover-tree-fall-kills-1/articleshow/82752026.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

On Tuesday, Jaipuria Hospital performed its first surgery on a 36-year-old woman, who had come with complaints of blurry vision. The doctors examined her and diagnosed that she had mucormycosis. “Our team of doctors cleaned the area which was affected by the fungus near the eye and applied anti-fungal drugs,” said Dr SS Ranawat, superintendent, Jaipuria Hospital. Dr Ranawat said few cases of mucormycosis have been registered at Jaipuria Hospital. “For saving life of such patients, we have started conducting surgeries,” he said. ENT surgeons Dr Raghav Mehta and Dr Mukesh Dagur conducted the debridement surgery, a procedure which involves thoroughly cleaning of the infected part. The patient, who was operated upon, had recovered from Covid. But, even after recovery, she got mucormycosis, which is a fatal disease. When the doctors examined her clinically, she informed them that she had taken steroids as part of Covid treatment.

Five more are yet to arrive in Goa,” said Panaji-based Shruti Chaturvedi, who initiated the crowdfunding campaign to purchase the oxygen concentrators for Goa to help during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. TOI had earlier reported that Covid-19 volunteer group — Covid Care Goa — has raised money through crowdfunding to order oxygen concentrators for the state. With some costing between Rs 90,000 and Rs 1.2 lakh per unit, the group had set a target of Rs 15 lakh to purchase 10 units, seven of which were ordered from Israel. The two that have arrived in Goa are among the seven oxygen concentrators ordered from Israel. These arrived in Goa on Monday night, making them one of the first consignments of oxygen concentrators that were purchased by raising money through a citizen-led initiative. Chaturvedi also procured ten units of 5-7 litre flow concentrators with the help of the Swasth platform under ACT grants, the amount for which was approved. “Anyone who requires an oxygen concentrator can pick up any one from these from the nearest volunteer of Covid Care Goa, use it till the patient is stabilised, sanitise it and then return it to the volunteer. This will then be provided to the next patient in need,” she said. Chaturvedi further said that she has applied for another grant to purchase supplies, which is pending approval. “Once approved, we will purchase ventilators that will be provided to hospitals in Goa,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/2-of-10-oxygen-concentrators-arrive-in-state/articleshow/82752058.cms||Nida Sayed

It was frustrating for thousands working from home or those in Covid isolation. In Maharashtra, more than 46 lakh consumers faced power tripping due to the cyclone. In MMR, 130 Covid hospitals faced power outage, which was restored at 93 at the earliest while others operated on generators. Across the state, 516 Covid hospitals faced power cuts. Officials said over 600 telecom towers were hit in MMR, leading to disruption in mobile and WiFi communication at several places. Residents of Evershine City in Vasai East told TOI they had never experienced an outage of around 32 hours, during which many of them exhausted their power inverters, drained their power banks and later mobile phones and were confined to darkness with no lights, fans and no power for drinking water pumps. In Dombivli, a consumer said she faced power cut of up to 33 hours in Davdi village area as a pole was damaged. In a majority of cases, it was gusty winds, waterlogging or tree fall that disrupted the power system. At a few places, the transformers of Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission company were affected too, leading to an outage on Tuesday. The devastation included damage to at least 188 substations, 1,095 feeders and damage to 2,600 poles. More than 9.2 lakh consumers in Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg were the worst hit. “A special team of 2,000 officials were deployed on Tuesday to restore supply on war footing,” said energy minister Nitin Raut. In Mumbai, consumers complained of power cuts in Jogeshwari, Andheri, Chembur, Ghatkopar, Kurla, Kandivli, Dadar, Sion and Agripada. Over one lakh residents of Kalwa and Kharegaon faced cuts following a snag in the system and threatened to protest.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Police keep a close eye on violators, motorists complain about e-pass hurdle||KOLKATA: The police have seized 465 vehicles in the city till Tuesday noon for breaking the enhanced restrictions and being out on roads despite the occupants not being part of any essential service or in need of any medical emergency. While Lalazar claimed the prosecutions were due to intense naka checks across the city, some residents alleged they were out for legitimate reasons but were prosecuted as they could not get the e-pass issued. Kolkata Police had sized 85 vehicles on Sunday. The figure shot up to 269 on Monday, when the police made most of the prosecutions in the evening and during the special night restrictions as they were busy tackling Trinamool protests during the day. On Tuesday, 111 vehicles were seized till noon. Citizens pointed at several procedural and technical problems cropping up while applying for an e-pass, a document that police are issuing in several cities across the country for emergency travel during Covid restrictions. One of the primary complaints from citizens was that the documents that had to uploaded had to be within 100KB, a virtually impossible task for those having no access to Photoshop. Also, once the papers were submitted, they received no acknowledgement from police or any application number. There was no text message or email to confirm the application was properly submitted, residents claimed. “I have no inkling what happened to the application I made,” said Sourav Majumdar, a bank employee from Tollygunge. Several others pointed out that the generic details sought in the form were impossible to fill. “How can I enter a fixed yellow taxi number?” said Sajal Gupta, a pharmacist from MG Road. Lalbazar sources said they were trying to fix the glitches. “We have received 26,000 applications so far. It will take time. We cannot allow all vehicles as that would defeat the purpose of imposing restrictions. Doctors and medical staff with IDs don’t need an e-pass. The system of e-passes was introduced to offer relief in emergency situations on a case-to-case basis. Many applicants view the pass as a licence to roam freely,” said an officer. Volunteers, most of them students, who have been reaching oxygen cylinders, medicines and food to Covid-affected families, said without the e-passes, they were being asked to show their ID cards and documents at nakas. The volunteers have urged the police to treat patients’ prescriptions as valid “passes” so that movement with essential medicines and food was not hampered. They even cited how Chandannagar City Police had arranged for separate passes for them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/police-keep-a-close-eye-on-violators-motorists-complain-about-e-pass-hurdle/articleshow/82750469.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Kochi||Kerala: Three faces from Thrissur in cabinet||THRISSUR: The LDF leadership in Thrissur is elated as the district has been allocated three ministers this time also, as was the case with the outgoing Pinarayi ministry. The LDF has won 12 out of the 13 seats in the district in this election. Interestingly, all the three proposed ministers from the district are associated with the Sree Kerala Varma College. Two of them CPI’s K Rajan and CPM’s K Radhakrishnan were students while R Bindu was the acting principal of the college. The district had three representatives V S Sunilkumar (CPI), C Raveendranath (CPM) and A C Moideen (CPM). Hailing the decision of the LDF to allocate the posts of three ministers to Thrissur, the CPM district secretary M M Varghese said this was a recognition for the growing mass support of the LDF in the district. In the last elections also the LDF could win in 12 seats in the district. “But this time the vote share of the LDF has gone up by nearly 2% from 45% in 2016 to about 47% in 2021. Also, the margins of the winning candidates have also gone up,” he said. Another remarkable facet of the LDF win in Thrissur was that the vote share of the BJP has shrunk from 19% in 2016 to about 17% in 2021. “It is a welcome sign that communal politics is not able to take roots in the district. A major reason for the victory this time was that the LDF could win the support of all the communities and sections. The LDF state leadership has recognised this rise in mass support here,” Varghese said. “Even though Thrissur was earlier a Congress stronghold, it is now emerging as an LDF citadel. Apart from the state-level positive factors for the LDF, the care taken by the elected representatives to address the needs in the constituencies has greatly contributed to the sustained victory of the LDF in the district, and the present decision of the LDF is in appreciation of these changes,” CPI district secretary K K Valsaraj said. Even though the UDF has marginally improved its vote share by about 0.33% in Thrissur this time, the front is facing a rudderless predicament in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/three-faces-from-thrissur-in-cabinet/articleshow/82750283.cms||T Ramavarman

Operations at Covid hospitals in NCH was affected due to the strike. “The nurses are angry because our leaders Dipkamal Vyas and Iqbal Kadowala were transferred in Saurashtra while the government was requesting us to withdraw our strike call. They took the decision to transfer the leaders even before the discussion to mount pressure on us,” said a protesting nurse. Vyas and Kadiwala are leaders of the United Nursing Forum (UNF) which has given the strike call. The nurses are demanding rise in salary and remunerations equal to other states in the country. “Nurses in all big states receive almost double the salary and perks compared to us. We have been demanding these benefits since long but government did not resolve it,” said one of the nurses. Earlier the nurses have threatened the government to go on strike if their demands related to hiking salary and perks are not addressed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/600-nurses-go-on-strike-after-their-leaders-are-transferred/articleshow/82748293.cms||---
---||India||Vijay Mallya kicks bankruptcy into the long grass again||LONDON: Indebted liquor tycoon Vijay Mallya escaped being made bankrupt in the high court in London by a whisker on Tuesday after the judge was persuaded that Mallya’s ongoing proceedings in the Indian courts could render the judgment debt against him invalid for the purpose of making a bankruptcy order. Chief Insolvency and Companies Court (ICC) judge Briggs adjourned making the bankruptcy order to allow for another day of arguments on July 26 after Mallya’s lawyer, Philip Marshall QC, pointed out that Mallya had an interest rate challenge in the Karnataka high court and a compromise settlement proposal in the Supreme Court of India, and claimed that both could discharge the debt he owes. On July 26 the parties will argue whether the application for the imposition of a compromise settlement in India renders the judgment debt invalid for the purposes of making a bankruptcy order. "Justice Deepak Verma says the compromise proceedings and interest rate challenge have a reasonable prospect of success," Marshall said, referring to the testimony of the retired SC judge acting as expert witness. "That would discharge the entire debt. There are other assets too, not only of Mallya and UBHL, but various companies owned by family members that would put assets forward to dispose of the debt," Marshall added. A consortium of Indian banks is seeking to make the Indian entrepreneur bankrupt in the ICC so that a bankruptcy trustee may be appointed to investigate his worldwide assets and claw back the Rs 11,000 crore he owes them by virtue of personal guarantees he provided for loans given to Kingfisher Airlines. "Why can’t a bankruptcy order be made today?" Briggs asked. "After four hearings what is it that still need to be decided? There is no reason for it to not be made as I have given permission for the bankruptcy petition to be amended and it has been amended." Marcia Shekerdemian QC, representing the banks, said: "We need closure on this and it’s wrong for a bankruptcy petition to stay on the court file so long. Even if the petition debt is halved by his interest rate challenge, his assets won’t be sufficient to pay us in full. UBHL is in liquidation and those assets are not within the gift of Mallya or his associates or UBHL to deal with, so his ‘compromise settlement proceedings’ are going nowhere. All he is doing is asking for more time and the end may never be sight. It is time for this court to … bring this bankruptcy to its inevitable end." On Tuesday Briggs handed down judgment which allowed the banks’ amended bankruptcy petition in which they said they are willing, in the event of a bankruptcy order being made, to give up any security they held over Mallya’s assets for the benefit of all the creditors. The banks estimate that the value of that security they hold over Mallya’s assets is around £230 million (Rs 2,386 crore). Mallya was refused permission to appeal this judgment. "There are a number of people he would like to pay legal costs to but is inhibited because of the bankruptcy proceedings, which are much more restrictive than the freezing order," Marshall said. "Mallya hasn’t had the funds to instruct his Indian lawyers. We want an order for costs to be provided to his Indian representatives, which will greatly facilitate further progress of the Indian proceedings," he added. He also pointed out the court process in India was substantially disrupted by Covid and another matter was "the question of motivation of the petitioners" given the "political background to proceedings".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/vijay-mallya-kicks-bankruptcy-into-the-long-grass-again/articleshow/82756255.cms||NAOMI CANTON

---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Gangs target patients in Covid hospitals to black-market remdesivir||JAIPUR: Covid dedicated hospitals have become safe havens for agents selling remdesivir injections, oxygen beds and oxygen cylinders. Most of the gangs exposed by police were luring clients from outside the hospitals by identifying those in need of scarce medicines and oxygen or getting inputs on those needing such articles from the hospital staff. The arrest of three persons on May 17 revealed that the nexus is going stronger and bigger. Jaipur police have so far exposed 15 such small and big rackets selling these items at exorbitant prices. Importantly, the arrested include government hospital nurses and employees which indicate the deep-rooted connections of these agents with hospital insiders. So far, a private practitioner doctor, Amit Kumar, has been arrested by police along with a nurse from Vidhyadhar Nagar police station for providing remidisivir injection. “City hospitals have to own up responsibility to ensure that they should guide patients’ attendants to not to fall into the trap and provide them government-approved route for accessing these medical resources. Also, we came across information that in several cases the hospital staff had leaked information of those in need or casually providing their numbers to them,” said Digant Anand, DCP crime, Jaipur police Commissionerate. The city has 77 dedicated hospitals which are the prime targets of these gangs. Officers have asked all the police stations to increase patrolling in hospital areas and activate their network to crack down on these rackets. Vidhyadhar Nagar SHO Virendra Kureel said they have fielded police in the civilian dress outside hospitals under the jurisdiction. “Those displaying their numbers on social media platforms with their request should be careful in dealing with the leads. We have reported cases in which patients attendants were misled or duped over the phone while taking their number from social media sites,” said Kureel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/gangs-target-patients-in-covid-hosps-to-black-market-remdesivir/articleshow/82752131.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Did migrants’ return lead to rise in cases in hills?||Dehradun: Since March this year, when Covid-19 cases started surging across the country, around 1.25 lakh migrants have returned to Uttarakhand, according to an official estimate. Official data shows most of them headed to their native villages in the hills. Around a month later, Uttarakhand’s nine hill districts, which were relatively unaffected by the coronavirus case surge before, started seeing an uptick in cases. As of May, the nine hill districts in Uttarakhand, which have limited health infrastructure, account for at least 30% of its total Covid-19 case load. Uttarakhand currently has 76,232 active coronavirus cases and 26,148 (34.3%) of those are from Almora, Bageshwar, Chamoli, Champawat, Pauri Garhwal, Pithoragarh, Rudraprayag, Tehri Garhwal and Uttarkashi. Between March 2020 and March 2021, the nine hill districts recorded a total of 218 deaths. In just two months though, between April 1 and May 17, these districts recorded 303 deaths, registering a 40% increase. Pauri and Almora have been the worst hit. Pauri, which saw 60 Covid-19 deaths between March last year and this year, has recorded 168 deaths since April. Almora recorded Covid-19 26 deaths from March last year to this year and 77 in the last two months. However, the data compiled from March last year to May 17 this year, shows that as many as 228 people in Pauri and 103 in Almora have died due to Covid-19. Gram pradhans, who had used their own resources to track and isolate returnees claimed that they were never reimbursed and therefore did not bother this year. to trace or segregate the returnees. As reported by TOI earlier, little to no testing is done in remote villages and villagers displaying Covid symptoms even die without treatment. For the Uttarakhand government, tracing each returnee, doing RT-PCR tests on them and providing medical assistance should they need it, remains a challenge. On April 21, the state government made registration mandatory for people returning to the state. Till date, over 70,000 people have registered on the Smart City portal. Most of them are from adjoining states of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Delhi. Last year after the lockdown, 3.25 lakh migrants had returned to Uttarakhand. Around 1 lakh went back by September. Agriculture minister and government spokesperson Subodh Uniyal said that gram pradhans, ASHA and Anganwadi workers have been roped in and arte being motivated to conduct door-to-door surveys and compile data on returnees. “We have also asked them to find out whether home isolation norms are being followed,” said the minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/did-migrants-return-lead-to-rise-in-cases-in-hills/articleshow/82748298.cms||Kautilya Singh

He said this was the time to serve humanity by rising above the considerations of caste, religion, class, ideology and region. He said the state government took every section together in the fight against corona and took decisions which brought relief to the needy. ‘Nobody sleeps hungry’ has been our mantra, he said, adding in the first wave, our management was praised at home and abroad. “But now the challeng is even bigger, for which everyone will have to work in unison,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cm-govt-strengthening-healthcare-at-local-level/articleshow/82752073.cms||---
---||Kochi||A recognition for VN Vasavan's successful poll experiments in Kottayam||KOTTAYAM: VN Vasavan (66) is known to be a voracious reader who equips himself with sufficient information before speaking on a topic or dealing with a crisis. This quality might have influenced the party when it made him evaluate the pros and cons of a tie-up with Kerala Congress (M). He successfully accomplished this task and the move also became beneficial for the party later. The ministerial berth for Vasavan is a recognition by the party for making this new experiment, in elections, a success for CPM in central Kerala. VNV, as he is popularly known, will be the first Kottayam native to become a minister in a CPM-led LDF government after he won from Ettumanoor constituency. TK Ramakrishnan, who had earlier won from Kottayam constituency on three occasions and had served as the minister (last time in 1996), was a native of Tripunithura. More than teachers and classrooms, his love for books shaped his career. He became active in student politics during his student days in Ettumanoor ITI. After establishing himself as a trade union leader, Vasavan climbed up the party hierarchy and became Kottayam district secretary of CPM in 2015. He was elected as MLA from Kottayam in 2006. Even when he was busy building the party in a traditionally strong UDF fort, VNV continued his affair with letters. The camaraderie he enjoyed with writer Ponkunnam Varkey led to the formation of the literary forum ‘Navalokam’ which gave a permanent place for his hometown Pampady in the cultural map of Kerala. The forum is still active and conducts annual programmes at the late writer’s home where eminent writers attend various functions. The May Day rally organized by him since 1978 in the little town of Pampady attracted the attention of everyone as he used to bring even national leaders for the rally. VNV is also actively involved in developing the government medical college hospital as one of the best institutions in the state. He is also the chairman of Abhayam charitable trust which has been extending help for the bedridden and financially backward patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/a-recognition-for-vasavans-successful-poll-experiments/articleshow/82750291.cms||Jaikrishnan Nair
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Citizens come forward with oxygen help during crisis||KOLKATA: Amidst the shortage of oxygen cylinders and instances of people, who are in distress, being charged exorbitant amounts by unscrupulous operators, an initiative led by citizens, known as Oxyzone, has stepped forward to provide free oxygen to patients with breathing trouble. Five centres — two facilities in Kidderpore and the rest at Sodepur, Salt Lake, Jadavpur — are in operation. The next one is underway in Bhowanipore. Founded with the help of donations from ordinary citizens from different walks of life, including students, professionals, doctors and nurses, this initiative is being implemented by the non-profit organization, Prameya Foundation, where oxygen is being provided free to patients 24×7 . “Oxyzone has been a life saver for my mother as it was the only avenue that we could find at a time of need in the middle of the night at 1am. The volunteer ensured that we got free oxygen at home when nothing else was available,” said Pinak Sarkar, a resident of Behala. The present restriction, though, is a challenge and the group has approached Kolkata Police to ensure that the volunteers can move freely while responding to a distress call. “It has been a herculean collective effort to get Oxyzone up and running with the help of so many well-wishers. Yet, there is so much more we can do in saving more precious lives if the support continues to pour in. Oxygen has nearly become unaffordable and scarce and it is our mission to ensure that the city continues to breathe as oxygen is and should always be free,” said Gargi Bhattacharya, one of the founding members of Oxyzone. The initiative has been entirely funded by donations from citizens and NRIs. Each centre with bed, oxygen, medical kits requires an investment of Rs 1-2 lakh and can cater to around 10 patients a day. Social media has been the primary source for Oxyzone’s funding network so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/citizens-come-forward-with-o2-help-during-crisis/articleshow/82750292.cms||---

The resignation copies were also sent on email and WhatsApp number of Joshi’s personal assistant, Choudhary said. The MLA confirmed about his resignation but maintained silence before the media about the reasons behind this move. Choudhary said that he would speak in detail after his resignation is accepted. Choudhary said, “I have sent my resignation to the assembly speaker through email and by post. I resigned earlier also but it was not accepted. The party pacified me and I agreed. I have been an MLA for 2.5 years of this term, it is enough. How does it matter if I don't remain MLA for the remaining 2.5 years? ” Congress state president and education minister Govind Singh Dotasra tweeted, “Hemaram ji is a senior and respected leader of our party. I have spoken to him after getting information about his resignation as MLA. This is a ‘family (Congress) matter’, it will be resolved soon.” The Congress MLA had been speaking against his party government for long. He was among the 19 MLAs, including Sachin Pilot, who rebelled against chief minister Ashok Gehlot in July last year. After Choudhary submitted his resignation, Pachpadra MLA Madan Prajapat expressed his pain. Prajapat, without taking the name of revenue minister Harish Choudhary, alleged that the officers of Barmer district are working on the directions of the minister. Prajapat, talking to media, said that Gudamalani MLA is a very senior leader and a very emotional man. He added that if Hemaram has submitted his resignation during pandemic then there has to be a reason. In assembly debates during the Budget session, Choudhary lashed out at the Gehlot-government a couple of times. He continued protesting against the government from time to time. He had raised questions on the policies of the Gehlot government and the Congress' manifesto. He has alleged many times that the government is not fulfilling its promises due to which people are annoyed. If it continues then it will be very difficult to come back elected in 2023. In such a situation the government should fulfil the promises it made in the manifesto. He had expressed his annoyance and said that works are not taking place in his assembly constituency and he is being discriminated against. In the resignation Choudhary submitted on Tuesday has mentioned that as per the process of Rajasthan assembly and work operation rule 173 he was sending his resignation from the membership of Gudamalani assembly constituency and requested to accept it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/gudamalani-mla-sends-resignation-to-speaker/articleshow/82752114.cms||---

The crime branch that is probing the case said this is possibly one of the biggest haul of gelatine sticks and detonators found to have been stocked together in the district. Officials said that if triggered accidentally, it was potent enough to cause visible damage to the surrounding residential area. The accused has been remanded to police custody. According to Thane crime branch officials, they were tipped off about the huge cache of gelatin sticks and detonators being illegally stocked in the office of one Gurunath Mhatre (53) who is a building material supplier and contractor at his Karivali village office in Bhiwandi taluka. “Accordingly, we raided the place on Monday and found nearly 12000 gelatin sticks packed in around 63 boxes and collectively weighing over 1500kgs. We also found around 3008 electronic detonators wrapped in boxes from the premises,” informed Lakshmikant Patil, deputy police commissioner, crime. The accused was arrested under relevant sections of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908 and the IPC and has been remanded to police custody till next week. Meanwhile, the stock was later shifted to a special warehouse in Wada in designated vehicles from where it will be disposed of later after securing adequate permissions. Meanwhile, considering the huge stock, the dog squad and the bomb disposal squad were also summoned during the raid while an ATS team also surveyed the stretch late Monday, informed officials. PI Krishna Kokani, crime branch, Thane, unit-1 added this was probably one of the biggest haul found stored together in the district in recent times. “The man had no permission to stock such a huge cache in such dangerous conditions. The sticks and detonators are ideally stocked separately. Had some explosion been triggered, it could have caused notable damage to the dense residential area,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/huge-cache-of-gelatin-sticks-detonators-seized-in-thane/articleshow/82752182.cms||Manoj Badgeri

On the one hand, the shortage is forcing citizens to travel to different places and break the lockdown rules and on the other, dairies with surplus milk are planning to produce milk powder. Jyoti Patil, a banker, said the municipal corporation has asked for milk to be delivered at home but shopkeepers are either not answering the call or simply say that milk is over. “We are forced to go to three to four shops to get milk packets. The milk shops are open from 7am to 10am and 4pm to 7pm, but not a single packet can be found in the evening,” she said. Umesh Chechar, a shopkeeper in the Timber market area, said that due to panic buying, customers who used to purchase half a litre of milk are now buying one-and-a- half or even two litres of milk. “Milk is a perishable commodity and we can’t purchase it in huge quantity as we will face losses if it doesn’t sell in time,” he said. Amit Mane, a shopkeeper from Mangalwar Peth, said, “Our shops are closed due to the lockdown, so refrigeration of milk cannot be done. Hence, we are purchasing it in quantities that can be sold within a short time. If people purchase it in regular quantity, the demand will be met. Earlier we used to sell 70 litres of milk daily, but now it has dropped to only 30 litres”. Meanwhile, operators of tea stalls, hotels, bakeries and restaurants who have a high demand for milk are closed now, leading to a drop in demand and forcing the dairies to mull production of milk powder. D.V. Ghanekar, managing director of Gokul dairy, said milk is in plenty but the demand has gone down due to the lockdown. “Currently, 98,000 litres of milk is being distributed in Kolhapur city in the last few days as against 1,13,000 litres in normal times. The excess litres will be converted into milk powder although it is not a profitable task,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/milk-shortage-in-kolhapur-city-despite-adequate-production/articleshow/82750289.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

Traders from Latur district on Tuesday took to roads and reiterated their demand for allowing the markets to reopen. To attract attention of the district administration and state, the traders stood on the roadside of the market area and held placards. Latur district Vyapari Mahasangh president Pradeep Solanki said, “Traders and businessmen are the worst affected due to frequent lockdowns and restrictions that are being extended every 15 days.” He added the traders are ready to meet all conditions for opening their respective shops. Last month, the traders also held Bheek Mango (begging) agitation while pushing for the demand. The traders cited deteriorating financial conditions, loss of direct and indirect employment to several sectors, including porters, transporters that are dependent on them. Echoing similar views, vice-president Vishal Agrawal said, “Considering the fact that number of Covid positive patients have come down drastically, those dealing in non-essential commodities should be allowed to operate on alternate days.” He added, “Paying salaries to the employees, rents as well as loan installments have turned out to be the biggest challenges before the business community. On Monday, Aurangabad Zilha Vyapari Mahasangh — district’s umbrella organization of traders — reached out to district guardian minister Subhash Desai demanding reopening of markets. Mahasangh’s president Jagannath Kale said, “Traders are facing unprecedented financial hardships. It is high time relaxation is granted to the traders, before it is too late.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/traders-in-latur-dist-demand-reopening-of-markets/articleshow/82750299.cms||---

In November 2020, Charan Teja, a salesman at a shopping mall in Kukatpally, married an armed reserve constable, 29, working with Arya Samaj. “The constable’s first husband had died and she has a seven-year-old daughter. After a three-year live-in relationship with Charan Teja, she married him in November 2020. However, after the marriage, Charan was not behaving properly. When he left her in January 2021, we had counselled him and again on May 14, he left his wife and switched off his phone. Suspecting that his parents might make him marry another woman, his wife submitted a petition on May 14,” Jubilee Hills inspector S Rajasekhar Reddy said. Police said that Charan did not come for counselling immediately and on May 18 he turned up at the Jubilee Hills PS with an advocate. “Charan released videos levelling various allegations against his wife which are not substantiated. We are counselling the couple. Based on the outcome of the counselling, we will proceed further,” the inspector said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cops-summon-constables-husband/articleshow/82752156.cms||---

---||Delhi||Covid-19 in Delhi: Two 500-bed facilities powered in a week||NEW DELHI: Recently, two Covid care centres with 500 ICU beds each were made operational from scratch by Delhi government near LNJP and GTB hospitals in just around 15 days. The centres also required a robust power infrastructure, which was set-up by discom BSES Yamuna Power Limited (BYPL) in what the company says was a record time of just seven days. This was not the only impressive feat for the company as its other branch, BSES Rajdhani Power Limited (BRPL), had set up a strong power infrastructure to support the massive centre with 10,000 beds at the Radha Soami Satsang Beas in south Delhi’s Chhatarpur. Closed early this year, the centre was restarted on April 26 to meet the demand for beds after an exponential rise in Covid-19 cases. The experience helped the discom with these two centres. The two centres were established to meet the huge demand for ICU beds. Although the public works department of Delhi government created these structures on the ground in 15 days, operating state-of-the-art medical equipment 24X7 for patients at the centre also required reliable and uninterrupted power supply. “For this, BYPL had been tasked with readying the power infrastructure on a war-footing,” a BSES official said. The combined length of underground cables laid using trenchless technology is seven kilometres. The official said that the anticipated power demand at each of the facilities can go up to 5 MW and accordingly, at both sites, four distribution transformers — each having an installed capacity of 1.6 MVA, totalling 6.4 MVA — were set-up. “Around 280 discom officials and workers worked round-the-clock in close coordination with the government and other departments to cater to the large load requirement,” he added. While the facility near LNJP hospital is getting electricity from the Kamla Market and Minto Road Grids, the facility near GTB hospital is being supplied electricity from the Nand Nagri and Dilshad Garden Grids, along with backups for uninterrupted connection. “The network at the two large centres conforms to the best international standards. Moreover, to prevent faults, distribution infrastructure set-up is also being scanned using hot-spot technology and load balancing undertaken,” he said. Quick Response Teams (QRT), with senior engineers, have been stationed 24x7 near the two facilities to take care of any contingency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/two-500-bed-facilities-powered-in-a-week/articleshow/82750373.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Agra||In ten days, 76 of 1,575 of Covid positive cases in Agra below 18 years old||AGRA: The second wave of the coronavirus pandemic has afflicted more children than the previous wave in Agra district. In the past 10 days alone, the number of children falling prey to the virus has increased from an average of 2% to 4.82%, according to district health department records. In the period between May 7 and 16, a total of 76 children below 18 years of age have tested Covid-19 positive in Agra. Out of these, 25 (32.90%) are below 10 years of age. According to the records, 76 of the 1,575 people who tested Covid-19 positive in the district in this period were 18 years or less of age. Among them, 25 children were up to nine years old, eight up to 10 years of age and 43 were in the 11-18 age group. Chief medical officer of Agra district Dr RC Pandey said, “The overall Covid-19 positivity rate is on the decline. However, there has been an increase in the number of children testing Covid-19 positive. In the last 10 days, 43% of Covid-19 cases below 18 years of age were related to children up to 10 years of age. We are going to increase Covid-19 testing among children. We will be running a special awareness campaign to control the spread of disease among children.” Since the pandemic broke out in March 2020, children up to 18 years old accounted for 2% of the total number of people testing positive for Covid-19. Till date, a total of 24,054 people have tested Covid-19 positive in Agra district. Out of these, 470 were children in the age group 0 to 10 years, 1,576 in the 11 to 20 years age group, 10,881 in the age group of 21 to 40 years, 8,168 in age group 41 to 60 years and 3,934 were people above 60 years of age. The scenario appears even more bleak today in view of the Union health ministry's alert that children below 18 years are at risk in case a third wave of Covid-19 hits the nation. In this context, the health department and district administration here have started working on a plan to set up dedicated Covid wards for children at government hospitals. A survey is also being conducted in the city to identify child specialists and pediatric centres. According to the health department officials, a fresh protocol for the treatment of children is being prepared. CMO Pandey said, “We have started making arrangements for the third wave of Covid-19. Following expert opinion that children will be at high risk in the third wave, we are going to establish dedicated wards for patients below 18 years of age and those below 10 years of age. A fresh treatment protocol will be determined for the treatment of children.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/in-10-days-76-of-1575-of-covid-ve-cases-in-agra-below-18-yrs-old/articleshow/82748370.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Agra||Agra: 'Oxygen-on-wheels' to help Covid-19 patients in Mathura villages||AGRA: To ensure prompt supply of life saving oxygen in rural areas, which are experiencing a surge in Covid-19 cases after panchayat elections, Mathura administration on Tuesday started oxygen-on-wheels service in the district. The service will ferry oxygen cylinders on mini trucks. Each truck will carry 30 cylinders, and each cylinder will have seven cubic metres of oxygen. District magistrate Navneet Singh Chahal informed that 13 such vehicles have been pressed into service. Out of these 13, 10 will be exclusively allocated to block headquarters to ensure oxygen supply for needy persons in rural areas, and three vehicles will be used in urban areas. Under the scheme -- implemented in association with some philanthropic industrialists -- the family members of the patients have to contact the Integrated Control and Command Centre in Mathura, and the required oxygen cylinder would reach them within two hours of the call. “The facility will be free of cost and initially available for four days to each patient on the recommendation of the area rapid response team. However, it may be extended for three more days based on the requirement,” said Chahal. While in rural areas, the sub-divisional magistrate of the area would act as the nodal officer for the scheme, an official from the municipal corporation will be in-charge in urban areas. “This will be very helpful for patients in home isolation,” Chahal added. On Monday, the district nodal officer of Covid-19 in Mathura, Mayur Maheshwari, flagged off the vehicles to block headquarters. Maheshwari complimented the district authorities for launching the programme as medical oxygen is important for saving lives in the ongoing second wave of Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/oxygen-on-wheels-service-started-for-covid-patients-in-rural-mathura/articleshow/82748347.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The three leaders were admitted to SSKM Hospital’s Woodburn Ward — two in the wee hours of Tuesday and another later in the morning. Family members and senior leaders who visited the hospital on Tuesday said all three leaders were put on oxygen support and were stable. Madan Mitra, who has recently recovered from Covid-19, complained of chest pain as well. After their arrest early on Monday morning, the four were brought out of Nizam Palace around 12.45am on Tuesday and within half an hour all of them were at Presidency Correctional Home. Mukherjee and Mitra were brought out first. While Mukherjee stressed he was innocent, Mitra said: “Amra kharap ar Subhendu, Mukul-ra bhalo?” TMC turncoats Subhendhu Adhikari and Mukul Roy also featured in the same sting operation in which the four of them have been booked. Still in his light pink night-suit, Sovan Chatterjee said he was in shock at the way he was arrested. “We are not terrorists or robbers. We were still sleeping when six-seven people entered our bedroom and made us come with them. I couldn’t even change. But I have faith in the judiciary and will fight this out in the court,” he said on his way to the correctional home. City civic administrator and state transport minister Firhad Hakim couldn’t hold his tears as he came out of the CBI office. “What has been my fault? Have I not cooperated with CBI officials every time? Being popular is not a crime. So many people have come for me since they love me. How can I be responsible for what they do?” he hinted at a possible reason behind the stay of bail as put forward by CBI lawyers — the Monday afternoon protest by TMC supporters outside Nizam Palace. “I was made appointee to handle the entire Covid related services in the city. They didn’t allow me to save the people of Kolkata,” Hakim broke inbto tears while getting into the car on his way to the correctional home. The four leaders walked into the correctional home around 1.20am on Tuesday, even as family members and party supporters camped outside. “All his medicines have been left behind with me. He needs two doses of insulin daily and regular medicines for COPD,” cried Baisakhi Banerjee, Chatterjee’s friend while banging the iron doors of the correctional home. Jail officials said around 3am, Mitra, Mukherjee and Chatterjee complained of breathlessness. They were first taken to jail hospital and then brought to SSKM in two cars around 3.45am. While Mitra and Chatterjee were admitted at cabins 103 and 106 of Woodburn ward, respectively, Mukherjee (76) was sent back to correctional home after check-up. Around 10.30am, he again complained of uneasiness and this time, he was admitted at the hospital. Later he was put on a nebulizer. According to Hakim’s lawyer, he had fever on Tuesday but didn’t need hospitalization after being examined by doctors at jail hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hosp-back-forth-drama-as-3-arrested-leaders-fall-ill-in-jail/articleshow/82750353.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

They said most of them were yet to be vaccinated and requested the government to facilitate the same for them. Jaipur Transport Operators Association president Anil Arora said, ‘Without worrying about our health, we have been continuing to transport goods even during the pandemic when there is no one out on the roads. Our vehicles are constantly moving due to which our workers are at the risk of getting infected with Covid. In fact, in the last one year, we have lost some of our colleagues as well. Keeping this in mind, we have written to transport minister Pratapsingh Khachariyawas to declare us as frontline workers so that we can get vaccinated at the earliest.” The transporters claimed that they have been finding it difficult to keep up their business and now with the constant exposure without being vaccinated, they are also putting their families at risk. Last week, the minister had held a meeting of the department’s employees and assured them of putting up this demand to the government. “I had put forward this request in the cabinet meeting as the transport department staff as well as the transporters cannot work from home due to their nature of job and I am trying to get them declared as front line workers,” said Khachariyawas. Previously, the transporters’ association had written to Union petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan and Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot about fuel prices in the state which were stable for a while, but increased again after the assembly elections in four states recently. The association had said they fear that many of them would have to sell off their vehicles as they were running into losses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/declare-us-as-frontline-covid-workers-demand-transporters/articleshow/82752190.cms||---

A shopkeeper said rain water came in from a gap in the roofing at the entrance of the market. “Initially the rain water was just trickling in, but as the intensity of the rains increased, water started entering shops at the entrance. A monsoon shed was to be erected, but the heavy downpour on Monday caught everyone unawares,” said the shopkeeper, requesting anonymity. TimesViewIf a brand-new municipal market building starts flooding in the first monsoon shower, the builder must be questioned and made accountable for the shoddy construction. However, the BMC, which owns the property has molly-coddled the builder over the years despite delaying the redevelopment project for more than a decade. The civic administration should now immediately carry out a structural audit of the building and find out what led to the flooding.Madhu Poplai of Pali Hill Residents’ Association said it was unfortunate that shopkeepers who had waited so long to get their shops in the redeveloped market had to go through this. “Even before monsoon can begin, this is the state of affairs. There is no slope to let the water get drained outside. Contractors must be penalised for shoddy work,” said Poplai. Deputy municipal commissioner in charge of markets Ramesh Pawar said work is still ongoing. “Work on the sale component is still in progress. Water had got collected in the ducts of the lift. We have directed the officials concerned to rectify the seepage issue immediately,” he said. Water-logging was also reported at BMC’s Shirodkar Market in Parel. “Excavation work was being carried out in the adjoining space and water from there entered the market premises. This issue is being resolved as well,” said Pawar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-shoddy-work-to-blame-for-pali-mkt-water-logging/articleshow/82752240.cms||Richa Pinto

The alleged incident took place in Aligarh’s Saha Nagar Sarola village on Tuesday. The health officials, who were in the village to collect samples for Covid-19 testing, alleged that they were beaten up by the group of men who also destroyed samples collected by the team members and tore their register containing records. An FIR against six persons, five of them unnamed, was later registered at Tappal police station. Rama Rao, the lab technician, said that the newly-wedded woman wasn’t lifting her veil as there were men in the room. So he asked other elderly persons and youths in the room to move out for a while. “This enraged them. And they started beating us. Two Asha workers were also with us, and they were attacked too,” Rao said. Village pradhan Dushyant said that he tried to resolve the issue but a large number of people gathered there and they chased the health workers out of the village. “Whatever happened to the health workers was wrong. They were doing their duty. Action should be taken against those who created the ruckus,” he said. Circle officer (CO) of Khair, SP Singh, said that it was a case of misunderstanding. “However, the locals should not have misbehaved with the health officials. The FIR has been registered on a complaint filed by Rama Rao.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/health-officials-attacked-chased-out-of-village-in-aligarh-fir-registered/articleshow/82748439.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

This will be a boon for the conservation of the local and migratory avifauna and will also boost eco-tourism in the area. Unlike other conservation reserves in the Western Ghats, the Mayani conservation reserve falls in the dry region of the Satara district. Chief conservator of forests for Kolhapur circle Dr Clement Ben said, “Under the powers conferred by section 36-A of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, the Maharashtra government has declared the Mayani lake and the Yeralwadi lake as a ‘conservation reserve’ to be known as the ‘Mayani Bird Conservation Reserve’ due to its ecological, faunal and floral significance. The total area under the Mayani Bird Conservation Reserve will be 866.75 hectare or 8.76 km. All government land in the Mayani and Yeralwadi lakes, a minor irrigation tank and the Kankatrewadi reserve forest will fall under this. No private land comes under the conservation reserve.” “The villagers had responded positively when we held a meeting with them before making this proposal to the government. Once the pandemic situation eases, we will hold a meeting again and will form a management committee that will work on boosting sustainable eco-tourism in the region in a way that will be safe for the birds, the ecology and the environment,” he added Migratory birds like the lesser flamingo, greater flamingo, black-tailed godwit, jacana, open-billed stork, bar headed geese and many more visit the Mayani region in the winters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/mayani-lake-area-in-satara-district-awarded-conservation-reserve-status/articleshow/82750369.cms||Rahul Gayakwad
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Celebs-turned-BJP members question timing of CBI move||KOLKATA: Two Tollywood actors-turned-BJP party workers Rupa Bhattacharjee and Anindya Pulak Banerjee have expressed reservations about the timing of the CBI arrest in the Narada sting case. Both agree that the proceedings of arrest of state cabinet ministers Firhad Hakim and Subrata Mukherjee, Kamarhati legislator and former state transport minister Madan Mitra and former mayor Sovan Chatterjee could have been delayed while devoting all attention to Covid crisis management. Rupa has also requested the Bengal governor to be as prompt about addressing the vaccination problems as he is about other issues pertaining to the law and order of the state. “I am tired of being told about the non-availability of adequate vaccines in the state. I would look forward to his tweets on the country’s vaccine policy and when actors like me who have been shooting without masks will get their vaccines. During this critical hour, tweets from him on the vaccine crisis will be of immense help for everyone.” Anindya Pulak pointed out that Monday was not the “right time” to start proceedings. “One doesn’t need to really read up a lot of science to understand that this is just not the apt time. The timing of arrest could have been delayed by another 15 days at least,” he said. He also pointed out that while Covid is primarily a health subject, it is being merged with “other political and social issues”. “I absolutely do not support playing politics while ignoring the pandemic. Unfortunately, political parties are preying on the insecurity and helplessness of people. Ego is becoming more important than the lives of people. This is upsetting social equilibrium,” he said. Rupa told TOI that she is tired with the news of the avalanche of death. “I can no longer see any political colour when people are dying left, right and centre. All I see is bodies wrapped in white. Addressing the Covid issue must be a priority for one and all. Under such circumstances, I see no reason to divert the attention and initiate a process that derails any effort to handle this emergency,” she added. However, she also made it clear that she is all for punishment of anyone who is corrupt. “All I am questioning is the timing of the arrest. I am surprised by this sudden rush for justice when enhanced restrictions had just been imposed in the state. The restrictions have stalled shootings. That means I am not even earning anything. Yet, I want to sacrifice because I know there is a need to break the chain. Doctors are all fatigued. The health sector is on the verge of collapsing. Is this the only time to rake up an issue that has been on the backburner for six years?” she asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/celebs-turned-bjp-members-question-timing-of-cbi-move/articleshow/82750368.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

While two of them work in Gotri GMERS Medical College, the woman works on contract in Gotri GMERS Hospital. The cops have seized a remdesivir injection labelled ‘not for sale’ from the accused who are suspected of having sold more such vials. The police said that it had received information about a man selling remdesivir following which they set a trap and sent in a decoy customer on Tuesday. When the accused identified as Sohail Darbar came with the injection, the cops nabbed him. Darbar told the cops that he worked as a plant operator in the oxygen plant at Gotri medical college. “Darbar said that he got the injection from Shailesh Prajapati who works as a servant in Gotri medical college. Prajapati had sold the injection for Rs 14,000 and Darbar decided to sell it for Rs 15,000,” the police said. Prajapati told the cops that he had got the injection from Varsha Damor who works as a servant in the Covid ward at Gotri GMERS Hospital. “Damor had one injection with her over last 25 days. She was given two injections for a patient but he died after one was administered. Damor then decided to sell off the remaining one,” crime branch officials said. The cops are also questioning the accused to find out if any other persons are involved in the crime.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/3-held-for-illegally-selling-remdesivir-in-vadodara/articleshow/82748456.cms||---

The accused, Mohammed Shaikh, confessed to the crime saying he was fed up of being blackmailed by the victim who threatened him with a false rape case, and took his salary of Rs12,000 every month. Initially, the police suspected a case of rape and murder since the victim’s body was found partly naked. Cop later learnt that Shaikh had undressed her to check if she hid his salary which he got on May 10. . Shaikh slit her throat after partying with her near MTNL Junction in BKC and dumped the body near the nullah. Shaikh said the victim had approached him around 10pm on May 10 and asked him to accompany her to a party. “Shaikh said after a couple of drinks, the victim forced herself on him but he pulled out a knife and slit her throat. She asked him to rush her to a hospital but he demanded his money back. In a fit of rage, he repeatedly slit her throat and stabbed her to death. Shaikh then crossed the nullah to reach the other side, dumped the blood-soaked shirt and knife and fled to Mumbra,” said a police officer. The police team — DCP Manjunath Singe, ACP Kailash Avhad, BKC senior inspector Sachin Rane (who is in isolation for Covid) and inspectors led by officers Pradeep More, Kanhaiyalal Shinde, assistant Sadashiv Sawant and Vinayak Panmand — worked for 96 hours without going home to catch Shaikh. They even entered the nullah without the fear of getting Covid, and finally nabbed Shaikh from his Kurla home after he returned from Mumbra. He will be in police custody till May 21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cops-96-hr-hunt-for-killer-helps-crack-bkc-murder-case/articleshow/82754267.cms||Narayan Namboodiri

This comes days after the vice-chancellor of the university, Prof Tariq Mansoor, in a meeting with the UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath underlined that the high mortality rate in the varsity was due to non-vaccination, late hospitalization and comorbidity following the death of several employees including 16 serving faculty members, 10 retired professors and non-teaching staff. The letter issued by deputy director of Medical Attendance Scheme (MAS) for wide circulation stated that it was seeking information on how many employees have been vaccinated, names of beneficiaries, their MAS book numbers, employment ID numbers, which age groups they belong to (18-45 years or 45 and above), number of dependents who have taken the vaccine and who have registered for the vaccine. “The information is required for future health-related planning in order to streamline the vaccine drive,” said Dr Salman Shah. He added, “The overarching of Covid-19 vaccines is to contribute significantly to equitable protection and promotion. The vaccine is to be used in conjunction with other control measures advised by the Government of India and state government from time to time. MAS seeks to achieve maximum uptake of the vaccine across all target groups among the beneficiaries.” On the directives of the vice-chancellor, AMU has also established a 24/7 help desk to facilitate MAS beneficiaries in the emergency and trauma centre in addition to meeting the additional oxygen requirement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/amu-asks-staff-dependents-to-furnish-vaccination-details/articleshow/82748468.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Bar Council chairman A Narasimha Reddy, in an appeal to the CM, sought his urgent intervention in the matter as Covid-19 had taken away lives of scores of advocates and their kin on one hand and crippled the lives of the surviving advocates economically on the other. As courts are not functioning to their full capacity, the advocates are not able to eke out their livelihood from this profession and are struggling to make ends meet, he said. He thanked the the chief minister for granting Rs 25 crore last year which could help the advocates to some extent. He also brought to the notice of the chief minister the gesture of Andhra Pradesh, which helped the advocates there with a grant of Rs 25 crore to enable them to meet their medical insurance needs. A part of that grant was also used to extend loans to the needy advocates. Narasimha Reddy described the conditions of junior advocates as pathetic and said that there is a need to help them urgently. “Last year, we tried to help some of them who possess less than five years of experience by giving Rs 3,500 each, but our limited resources got exhausted thereafter,” he said. “We have to give a stipend to the junior advocates and enhance the benefits being provided under the welfare fund Act, the bar council chairman said. We could not extend any help to them during the current second wave of coronavirus, he said, urging the CM to enable the council to help the advocates in crisis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bar-council-urges-cm-to-release-rs-25cr-for-advocates/articleshow/82752301.cms||---

Compared to a week ago, the vacancy of beds increased from 262 to 556 beds, according to health department data. As of Tuesday, there were 12,572 active cases of Covid-19 in Bhopal. During the same time last week, the number active cases was 15937. Dip in patient numbers was about 3300. An estimated 40% of patients are hospitalised or under quarantine outside the home. 50 people have died in the state capital due to Covid-19 in the past week. “While the number of cases in need for critical hospitalised care has dropped, the death toll continues to be high,” said Dr Rajiv Singh. One of the reasons continues to be the need for antifungal medication like Amphotericin B. Around 700 doses of the injection have been provided in Gandhi Medical College (GMC) alone in the last 48-hours according to an official. “300 injections were made available on Tuesday,” he added. Mucormycosis, often termed ‘black fungus, in patients with Covid-19 or who are recovering from Covid, has been reported in many cases. According to some experts, a patient can need up to 60 injections of the antifungal medication. A dose of four is injected in a go and the medication can be required for up to two weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/good-signs-2-fold-rise-in-no-of-vacant-covid-beds-in-a-week/articleshow/82750429.cms||---
---||Meerut||HC's ‘Ram bharose’ quip: Kin of ex-MES man find solace, await closure||Meerut: Talking about the surreptitious cremation of a Covid-positive ex-Military Engineering Services official by a top Meerut hospital that kept the man's kin in the dark for 10 days, the Allahabad high court on Monday had said UP's state of health was in "god's hand". The family of the man, whose story TOI had reported in its May 10 edition, said on Tuesday that they hope "there will be some justice now". "If this is the state of affairs of treatment at a medical college in a city like Meerut, then the entire medical system can only be said to be ‘Ram bharose’,” a division bench of Justices Siddhartha Varma and Ajit Kumar had observed. Ghaziabad’s Shifa Shivangi, the daughter of former MES official Santosh Kumar (65), may never get closure as the family couldn't even perform his last rites, but the HC order has given them hope -- that authorities of the Meerut hospital will be held accountable and the bereaved kin will finally get to know what exactly happened and where the man was cremated as "anonymous". Kumar had died in Meerut’s Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial Medical College on April 23, two days after being admitted. The hospital staff had then quietly cremated his body as “unclaimed” without informing the family; they weren't given any information for 10 days after that. Shivangi had on May 7 released a video addressed to CM Yogi Adityanath, asking him to find her father. It prompted the hospital to form a panel to probe the "disappearance" of the retired officer from its ICU ward. The panel in its report later said that Kumar was cremated by the staffers after they “failed” to contact the family. Shivangi told TOI on Tuesday, “They (the hospital) had given a mechanical reply that my father was no more and that he has been cremated according to Hindu tradition. Imagine what we went through. We could not even see him one last time." Kumar’s son-in-law Ankit Dixit said that the court has asked for strict action against those responsible, and that gives them hope. “We are happy that the honourable HC has reacted. Action should be taken against the big fishes. Some junior level hospital staffers should not be made scapegoats,” Dixit said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/hcs-ram-bharose-quip-kin-of-ex-mes-man-find-solace-await-closure/articleshow/82748544.cms||---

They also held talks on ramping up the RT-PCR testing facilities across 144 KMC wards. “It was Hakim who was instrumental in giving our Covid combat plan a definite shape and pace. He was the one who was keeping in constant touch with the Swasthya Bhawan to make a coordinated move in getting the supply of vaccines or reaching out to city’s housing complexes for RT-PCR tests,” Ghosh said. Talking to the media, Hakim broke down when talking about the uncertainty over the Covid-combat plan for the city. “I don’t know whether we can save the city from the pandemic,” Hakim said.

It took over 25 years for INL to become LDF’s constituent as veteran leader VS Achuthanandan refused to budge from his position that INL was a communal party and LDF being a progressive, non-communal political alliance could not let INL into its fold. INL was formed by former Indian Union Muslim League national president Ibrahim Sulaiman Sait in 1994 in revolt against IUML’s refusal to severe links with Congress in the aftermath of Babri Masjid demolition. It was only after VS became inactive owing to age-related illness that the section led by Vijayan could let INL into LDF. VS used to argue that the entry of INL into LDF could become a prelude for the entry of IUML into LDF. “VS had stonewalled the entry of INL when he was active. He had specific reasons for his opposition to INL. He believed INL and IUML as equally communal,” said political observer and former IT adviser to VS, Joseph C Mathew. However, Vijayan’s decision that minor allies should take turns and share cabinet berths has come as a bloody blow to Kerala Congress (B) leader KB Ganesh Kumar, who had been expecting a solid cabinet berth this time. This, in turn, became a boon to Congress (S) leader Kadannappally Ramachandran who did not expect a cabinet berth this time. According to sources, Vijayan offered the first term of the shared cabinet berths to INL MLA Ahammed Devarkovil and Janadhipathya Kerala Congress MLA Antony Raju. While the preference for Ahammed Devarkovil is aimed at positioning INL as a potential competitor of IUML and its vote bank, the selection of Antony Raju is for being more obsequious to Pinarayi Vijayan than political motives. “Antony Raju was the only person who didn’t lay claim to first preference to be given in the shared berth,” said a CPM leader when asked why Antony had a better chance to get the first preference.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/with-inl-pinarayi-to-lure-iuml-voters/articleshow/82748559.cms||B S Anilkumar

Impressed by the idea, the Uttar Pradesh government is also implementing the Osmanabad pattern at 15 ethanol plants for increasing the oxygen generation capacity ahead of third wave of Covid-19. Already orders have even placed for getting the required equipment, including compressors, that are to be imported from Taiwan, Korea and the USA for two plants. There are 195 sugar factories out of which 137 have ethanol plants in the state. In addition to this, there are over a dozen standalone ethanol plants across the state. Abhijit Patil, who is the first person in the country to generate medical grade oxygen by altering his Dharashiv Sugar Factory-based ethanol plant in Osmanabad, is now assisting other plants for going ahead with the implementation of the idea. “I am glad that our project has impressed the state as well as owners of sugar factory-based ethanol plants from across the country,” Patil said.

The deceased cousin, Jitender Balyan, had been recently elected pradhan from Sanjeev Balyan’s native village Kutbi in Muzaffarnagar. The Union minister’s other cousin, Rahul Balyan, is fighting for life at AIIMS Rishikesh. When asked if recently held panchayat polls are the reason for so many deaths in the rural belt of UP, the minister said, “I don’t think it is justified to link these Covid deaths to elections as no elections took place in other states like Maharashtra, Bihar and Uttarakhand, and yet the numbers are quite high there. Covid-19 is a disease and can take anyone in its grip.” On Tuesday, the minister brought the body of his cousin from Rishikesh and last rites were performed in their native village. According to him, “My 52-year-old cousin Jitender was initially in home isolation along with his elder brother but later both had to be admitted to AIIMS Rishikesh. My other cousin Rahul is also serious.” The massive exercise to hold panchayat polls in Uttar Pradesh, whose four phases saw at least 9 crore voters queuing up before 2 lakh booths manned by about 12 lakh government servants and security personnel, coincided with a sharp surge in Covid-19 cases in the state. According to official data, between January 30, 2020 and April 4, 2021 -- in a span of 15 months -- UP had recorded a total of 6.3 lakh Covid-91 cases. In 30 days starting April 4, over 8 lakh fresh cases took the caseload of UP to 14 lakh. The period was marked by the rural polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/union-minister-sanjeev-balyans-cousin-a-newly-elected-pradhan-dies-of-covid-another-cousin-critical/articleshow/82748560.cms||Sandeep Rai

Bharat Biotech joint managing director Suchitra Ella tweeted late on Tuesday evening that the company has dispatched Covaxin doses to private hospitals in as many as 25 cities across the country starting Monday. These include private hospitals in cities like Hyderabad, Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai, Kolkata, Mysuru, Guwahati, Calicut, Coimbatore, Ernakulam, Goa, Guntur, Gurgaon, Jaipur, Jalgaon, Kanpur, Kochi, Mohali, Nellore, Nizamabad, Raipur, Shimoga, Vijayawada and Vizag. Ella, however, did not name the hospitals to whom supplies have been made or the quantum of doses supplied so far. She also did not mention any details about the orders that the company has received so far either from state governments or private hospitals. Apart from the direct shipments to private hospitals, she also said the company has sent doses of the vaccine to 10 cities as directed by the Union ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW). These include shipments to cities like New Delhi, Pune, Guwahati, Gannavaram, Gandhinagar, Ranchi, Bhubaneswar, Chandigarh, Jaipur and Lucknow. Bharat Biotech began direct supplies to state governments from May 1 after the Centre threw open vaccinations to all citizens over the age of 18 years and has been ramping up supplies since then. The company has fixed a price of Rs 400 per dose for state governments and Rs 1,200 per dose for private hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bharat-biotech-begins-direct-covaxin-supplies-to-private-hospitals-in-25-cities/articleshow/82751790.cms||Swati Bharadwaj
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Carmichael Rd seniors let off in Rs 1cr cheating case after 20 yrs||Mumbai: Observing that merely defaulting on repaying investors was not an offence under the Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors (MPID) Act, a special court recently acquitted Charmichael Road-based senior citizens 20 years after they were accused of cheating 129 investors of Rs 1 crore. The court said the prosecution failed to establish the schemes were started as a result of a criminal conspiracy by the accused to cheat the investors. Acquitting Chandramohan Nandani (68) and Bhanu Nandani (65), the special MPID court said it was proved the accused failed to repay investors. “However, mere default does not attract Section 3 (fraudulent default by financial establishment) of the MPID Act. The default must be fraudulent... There is no material to show that there was inducement on the part of accused or there was any deception caused by them,” the court said. Two other accused, Jitendra Seth and Pramila Seth, remained untraceable. It was alleged the scheme was floated in 1999 and investors were offered interest at the rate of 21.5%. The prosecution submitted they failed to repay the amount, closed their office and duped the investors. Four witnesses, including two investors, deposed. The two said they had received their principal amounts from economic offences wing (EOW), which probed the case. The court has directed EOW to issue a notice to repay 75 investors who are untraceable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-carmichael-rd-seniors-let-off-in-rs-1cr-cheating-case-after-20-yrs/articleshow/82746540.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Delhi||Three held for providing fake RT-PCR reports||New Delhi: The Shahdara district cops have busted a racket involving fake RT-PCR test reports with the arrest of three people. The accused were generating fake bills and reports under the header of a well-known lab. One of the victims, Umang, had called a person home to collect samples for the Covid-19 tests of him and his family members after his mother tested positive. Six samples were collected for Rs 9,000 in cash. When he didn’t get the report for four days, Umang contacted the person who claimed that there were large numbers of samples and asked for two more days. Eventually, a report stating he had tested negative was sent on his WhatsApp. “While checking the report, Umang got suspicious since the date of collection was wrong. He verified the report directly from ‘Dr Lal Chandani Lab, Punjabi Bagh, Delhi’ as the accused had claimed to be its representative. On verification, the report was found to be fake,” DCP R Sathiyasundaram said. Umang approached police and an FIR was lodged. The mobile number was traced and Sunny and his associates Jitender and Sunil were arrested by a team led by SHO Shivaraj Singh Bisht. The trio were employees of the lab. Sunny, who used to collect Covid samples for the lab, got the fake reports prepared by Jitender. Sunil, who handled the lab’s billing counter, said he had generated many fake bills with Jitender’s help and used to get Rs 100-150 per sample. In another case, the Greater Kailash police has arrested a man, Sachin Yadav, who was duping people on pretext of providing remdesivir and tocilizumab injections. He used to advertise a phone number on social media to collect money and then go underground. In a similar incident, a pharmacist has been arrested for allegedly black-marketing remdesivir in southeast Delhi. Ishtiyaq Khan was charging Rs 20,000 for each vial. The arrest was made after Gaurav Dhingra filed a complaint at Kalkaji police station that he was duped of Rs 40,000 after contacting a phone number found on social media to buy remdesivir for his friend’s father, said DCP R P Meena.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/three-held-for-providing-fake-rt-pcr-reports/articleshow/82750476.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||State to begin special fever survey for pregnant women nearing delivery||Hyderabad: On similar lines of the state government’s fever survey to track people with Covid-19 symptoms, the women and child welfare and health departments will launch a special survey for pregnant women. This survey will have special focus on pregnant women are due for delivery within a week to ten days. While the women and child welfare department does maintain data of pregnant women enrolled with various centres and keeps track of it from conception to birth, the additional data collection through the new survey is aimed at preventing pregnant from contracting Covid-19 while also providing additional care. After a recent case in which a pregnant woman died after not being provided treatment on time, the government is said to have stepped up its focus on precautionary measures. While conducting the new fever survey, health staff will also note down details of women whose delivery dates are nearing. These women will get special focus and will be monitored by health staff who will keep track of symptoms and ensure the women adhere to Covid-19 protocols. Officials said the data collection is to ensure that pregnant women do not go under the health department’s radar. “In most cases it is observed that many pregnant women, when they are conceive, register themselves at a particular place, mostly at their in-laws place but just before delivery, there is a change of places as they go to their parents’ home where they are not registered,” a health official said. “With this additional data collection, such women will also be under our observation,” he added. The directives for new data collection were given late on Monday night with a changed format. The current fever survey was to be completed on Tuesday but till then only 80 lakh households had been surveyed as against the target of nearly one crore households across the state. It was also observed that many private hospitals were denying treatment to non-Covid-19 patients which can create problems for pregnant women.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/state-to-begin-special-fever-survey-for-pregnant-women-nearing-delivery/articleshow/82751435.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Meanwhile, the state board, too, could be considering a similar evaluation method. CBSE was the first board to decide how their students would be evaluated after the Class X exams were cancelled due to the Covid crisis. The board had set up an eight-member results committee that had to complete the evaluation process by June 11. The board was to declare the results on June 20. In an official statement, CBSE controller of examinations Dr Sanyam Bhardwaj said keeping in view the pandemic situation, lockdown in states and safety of teachers and other staff members, the deadline for submitting the marks has been extended to June 30. Though the board has not specified when results will be declared, they are expected in July.  A state official said a decision on marking students will be taken in a couple of days. He said with offline exams looking difficult, the state may have to drop the common entrance test idea. The state is considering the suggestion of several college principals to evaluate based on Class VIII and IX performance.

The stretch between Chandrayangutta to Santosh Nagar is seeing a huge rush for essentials during the stipulated four hours time every day. The Falaknuma flyover, which is closed for public as it is under renovation, is also contributing to major influx of vehicular traffic at Chandrayangutta crossroads. Policemen from the Hyderabad traffic wing were seen struggling to clear the oncoming traffic with the under-construction metal bridge from Phisal Banda (Santosh Nagar) to Saidabad acting like a stumbling block for the traffic. The sudden rains, too, have added to the public’s woes as the condition of roads, which are dug for the flyovers has deteriorated. Many people from the Old City flock to the Madannapet vegetable market, and fish market, ignoring social distancing and mask norms. “The time for lockdown relaxation is limited, and traffic jams at Chandrayangutta are further adding to menace,” said Mohammed Wajid, a resident of Chandrayangutta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rush-for-essentials-sees-heavy-traffic-in-old-city/articleshow/82751902.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Eyeing third wave, experts say elevated CFR in Hyderabad is a cause for concern||Hyderabad: Telangana’s overall case fatality rate may look stable at 0.56 percent but pandemic experts warned on Tuesday that the death toll might rise and the situation could worsen if effective preventive steps are not taken immediately. It took 409 days from the first Covid-19 death reported in March 2020 to reach the 3000-toll mark in the state. According to the official death figures released by the health department, the CFR slightly went up to 0. 57 per cent, before settling down again. Telangana has reported 1378 deaths from March 1 this year to Tuesday. “This increase in CFR in recent months point to the fact that the virus is more virulent and there is need for increasing the treatment facilities both at urban and rural areas and to prevent deaths,” said Dr Subodh Kandamuthan, director, Centre of Health Care Management, Administrative Staff College of India (ASCI) Experts said during a recent meeting with eight states on Covid- 19 scenario, Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan pointed out that though caseload in Telangana is certainly dipping, but slightly high CFR (1.02 percent) in Hyderabad is of concern. Experts said that increased deaths indicate rapid infection spread even in towns and rural areas “He (the Union minister) also made similar observations in Medak district. The state’s current CFR 0.56 per cent is less than the national CFR is 1.1 per cent. Hyderabad and Medak’s CFR are certainly below the national CFR, but more patients from other states are also getting treated in Hyderabad and this could be one of the reasons for slightly high CFR,” said a top health official. Director of health Dr Srinivasa Rao said mortality rate has always been under control in the state “During the first wave the CFR was low and during the second wave also we are stable as 99. 5 percent of the infected people are recovering,” he assured during the press conference on Tuesday. The state government has also changed the testing policy for the family members of deceased from Covid- 19. The family members were earlier asked to be under home isolation, now the government is conducting tests for those attending the funeral.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/eyeing-third-wave-experts-say-elevated-cfr-in-hyderabad-is-a-cause-for-concern/articleshow/82751230.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: New testing method to cut down on time, cost & errors||HYDERABAD: A new dry swab RT-PCR test for Covid-19 developed by CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) is set to become a game changer. The novel test, developed by PhD students at CCMB, will drastically cut down on testing time by making the process much simpler and is likely to cost less than Rs 200. The process is said to ease transportation problems, reduce cost of testing and solve the problem of long queues once the tests become widely available in the market. The dry swab tests are currently being sold by one company while five are set to start production soon. “With less steps involved, the risk of errors and contamination reduces, and accuracy improves. By this method we can get results in 2 to 3 hours and more importantly, it can also detect low viral load cases,” said CCMB director Dr VM Tiwari, adding that the method has been tested locally at Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS), National Geophysical Research Institute (NGRI) and Gandhi Hospital. Unlike normal RT-PCR tests, in which the naso-oesophageal sample is put in a tube containing viral transfer medium (VTM), this test does not require samples to be put in VTM. “As a result, the need of costly VTM is automatically reduced. While in the normal RT-PCR test, sealing and then unsealing tubes with VTM is a cumbersome process, it also carries a risk of contamination if the sample leaks. Sometimes unsealing 100 to 200 samples takes hours and then RNA mixture is prepared with the VTM which again takes a couple of hours. This process is not required in the dry swab test which makes it much faster,” explained advisor and former CCMB director, Dr Rakesh Mishra. Cutting down on RNA testing will mean a reduced need of RNA testing machines, the costs of each being in crores. “The higher sensitivity of the test was proven in tests run on 500 staffers at NGRI. Of these, 20 per cent had tested positive by this method but many were not detected positive through regular RT-PCR method. Given 90 per cent of the positive cases were found to be asymptomatic, this method will be effective in rural setting where these (asymptomatic cases) could be super-spreaders as this test is useful in detecting cases with low viral load and preventing further spread,” Dr Tiwari said. The ICMR-approved method has also been tested in various institutions across India, including the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute in Nagpur, which has no backlog of tests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/new-testing-method-to-cut-down-on-time-cost-errors/articleshow/82751320.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Mumbai||Cyclone Tauktae: Day after heaviest May downpour, Mumbai receives sparse rain; green alert for today||MUMBAI: A day after gusty winds and extremely heavy rain lashed the city and its suburbs due to Cyclone Tauktae —the highest ever for the month of May—the weather cleared up. Both Colaba and Santacruz observatories did not report any rain till 8.30pm on Tuesday, though skies remained overcast and strong winds persisted. Some parts of the cityand Thane received light rain later in the evening. The IMD has issued a green alert for Wednesday, indicating very light rain and thundershowers for Mumbai and Thane. “Cyclonic storm Tauktae over Saurashtra, about 60km southwest of Surendranagar and 75km northeast of Amreli. It would move north-northeastwards and weaken gradually into a deep depression,” said IMD on Tuesday afternoon. In Mumbai, by Tuesday, rain had brought down maximum and minimum temperatures considerably. The IMD’s Santacruz observatory recorded maximum temperature of 31.6 degree Celsius, which was 1.9 degree below normal. This was also the lowest maximum temperature the city had recorded for the month in the past nine years. In 2011, the city had reported its lowest maximum for the month at 31.3 degree on May 17. Minimum temperature also stayed on the lower side on Tuesday with the IMD Santacruz recording 23.6 degrees, which was 3.6 degree below normal. This was also the second lowest minimum temperature in the past 10 years. The extremely severe cyclonic storm Tauktae, meanwhile, saw the city log some massive rain figures. Though the downpour recorded between May 17-18 falls in the extremely heavy rain or red alert category, till Sunday, the IMD had given an orange alert for May 17, only signifying heavy to very heavy rain. Later, the IMD went on to upgrade its own warning to a red alert. Experts said the rapid intensification of the cyclone could have been the reason. In the 24 hours between May 17 and 18 (8.30am-8.30am), the IMD’s Colaba observatory recorded 207.6mm rain and the Santacruz observatory 230.3mm. Both these fall in the extremely heavy rain category as per IMD classification. Adjoining areas such as Dahanu also recorded 283mm rain in the same period. For Mumbai, it was clearly the wettest May day as the previous high for the month was 190.8mm on May 19, 2000. Areas such as Kandivli (320mm), Borivli West (315 mm), Dahisar (292mm), Goregaon (281mm) Chincholi and Malad (281mm) reported massive rain. At least three areas in Mumbai—Colaba, Malad and Reay Road—reported over 100kmph of winds, two of which were closer to the sea.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-day-after-heaviest-may-downpour-city-receives-sparse-rain-green-alert-for-today/articleshow/82746018.cms||Richa Pinto

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Patients made to wait, sent home sans check-up in Barkas||HYDERABAD: Patients at the Barkas community health centre have been dismayed over alleged negligence and rude behaviour of the medical staff. Many complained that patients, including pregnant women, are forced to wait for hours in long queues or make several rounds to different counters just to get a Covid-19 test. Objecting against the health centre’s administration, patients and their relatives have demanded immediate intervention from government and health department authorities. One attendant, Mohammed Anwar, claimed that patients were not being attended to by medical staff and that pregnant women were made to wait in line for hours and in some cases, even sent back without a proper check-up or consultation. “I have come here for my daughter’s (who is pregnant) medical check-up but she was kept waiting for hours. When her turn arrived, she was told to get a Covid-19 test done first. I sought a clarification as to why there was no mechanism to inform about these procedures to pregnant women. After that, we were sent back citing a shortage of testing kits. Several pregnant were kept waiting this way,” Anwar said. AIMIM ward member Talha Kaseri told TOI that the matter had been brought to the notice of higher authorities and the government through several representations but no action had been taken so far. “Apathy towards pregnant women is unacceptable. Patients are being let down by the attitude of staff. While multiple complaints have been made and the matter was brought to the notice of government. There is no check on medicine use and no one is checking staff attendance,’’ Talha Kaseri told TOI. Another patient, Farzana Begum alleged that she had been visiting the health centre for the last one month but failed to get a consultation as doctors were absent. “I have been waiting here since morning, now its 11 (am) and so far, no one is here to see the patients. On asking, we are rebuked and sent back by the medical staff,’’ Farzana Begum said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/patients-made-to-wait-sent-home-sans-check-up-in-barkas/articleshow/82751667.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Vaccine tourism takes off with no-quarantine Moscow package||MUMBAI: There is growing demand for overseas vaccine tourism in India and currently Moscow seems to be the destination of choice.  A Delhi-based travel agency has begun offering 24-day package tours, priced at Rs 1.3 lakh each, which will take vaccine hopefuls to Moscow for two shots of Sputnik-V with a spot of sightseeing thrown in to pass the 21-day interval between jabs. “The first shot is administered the very next day after arrival in Moscow,” said an official from the travel agency. “Foreigners with a minimum seven-day stay in Russia can get vaccinated. They only need to register for vaccination, which we do for them,’’ he said. Sputnik V, in a tweet posted on its official account on April 3, had a teaser on vaccination tourism. “Sputnik V vaccination in Russia! Who’s on board?... Our social media followers will be the first to be invited to get #SputnikVaccinated in Russia when the programme starts.” There have been no updates on this thereafter. TOI sent a query on whether foreign tourists can get vaccinated in Russia. A response was awaited at the time of going to press. The Delhi company official said their first batch of vaccine tourists left on May 15, a group of 30, largely doctors from Gurugram, and they have received their first shot. The second batch, for May 29, is all booked too and most are Delhi-based doctors, he said. Then there are batches in June. “The group spends three days in St Petersburg and the remaining days in Moscow. The package includes cost of air tickets on Aeroflot flights from Delhi, breakfast, dinner and a few days of local sight-seeing. The visa fee of Rs 10,000 isn’t included,” he added. Currently, Russia is one of the few countries that allow Indians to fly in for a vaccine vacation as it permits entry with just a negative PCR report and no requirement of quarantine on arrival.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-vaccine-tourism-takes-off-with-no-quarantine-moscow-package/articleshow/82746668.cms||---

If vegetables and fruits are sold during lockdown as essentials, why not chicken, fish and mutton, they ask. They further point out that non-vegetarian food is protein-rich and would have kept their immunity high when Covid-19 is on a rage. “It has been more than a month that non-vegetarian food is not available here. Eggs you can have at milk parlours but all the chicken/mutton shops are closed. It happened during the previous lockdown in 2020 as well. My point is why can’t some chicken and mutton shops be allowed to operate, maybe for a limited period during the day. My doctor has recommended chicken for better protein intake during the pandemic time but what do I do when it’s not available”, said Swaraj Singh, a retired government official. Swaraj Singh may not be able to get non-vegetarian food during the lockdown, but there are people, who claim that everything is available but at a premium. “The fact is that lockdown gives a chance to people, particularly those dealing in sale of non -veg stuff, liquor, cigarettes, to make money. Chicken, mutton, fish - everything is available but you have to pay extra money for it because it’s being sold in black”, said Rajendra Kulshreshtha, a businessman. Rajendra said that chicken, which was being sold at Rs 130 to Rs 140 per kg is now being sold for Rs 250-280 per kg and mutton, which was priced at Rs 400 to Rs 500 per kg, is being sold in black for Rs 750 to Rs 850 per kg. Rupali Bose, a working woman, said that she gets fish and chicken delivered at home and the shopkeeper, from whom she earlier got her non-veg, is still supplying it at home. “ Except for Rohu and prawn, other varieties of fish like Hilsa or Pomfret are not available. They get Rohu from Halali dam. Chicken or fish, it’s all being sold at a premium. I have bought fish for Rs 500 a Kg once. Then, there are other factors - if you purchase a whole fish, they will charge less but if you want a particular portion of a fish, they charge more. They give chicken not in Kg but in numbers- one chicken or two chickens. The chicken may turn out to be too large or very small, you have to make do with that”, she said. Zaid Bhai, who has a chicken/mutton shop in Bagh Sevania, admitted that non-veg food may be available despite shops being closed due to lockdown but said that he doesn’t sell it during lockdown. “ People may be doing it but I don’t do it. As it’s my shop right in front of Bagh Sevania police station”, he chuckled. He, however, added that even those who are selling chicken and mutton in black would like the shops to open because the sale in “black” is miniscule. Dietician, Amita Singh, said that non-veg food is indeed a good source of protein but at a time when they are not available, those who get bulk of their protein intake say from chicken may shift to milk, curd, paneer, groundnut, nuts, roasted gram, rajma, soybean and pulses as alternative protein sources. When asked how significant is rich protein intake for better immunity during Covid-19 pandemic, she said “Protein repairs and develops the body and its adequate intake is absolutely essential to enable the body fight any disease”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/non-vegetarian-palates-in-craving-mode-as-meat-eludes-their-plates/articleshow/82750492.cms||Ashutosh Shukla
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Only 3 teachers died on panchayat poll duty, says district magistrates' report||LUCKNOW: In sharp contrast to the claims of teachers’ unions that at least 1,621 teachers and staff died of Covid-19 after being assigned duty in recent panchayat elections, the state government on Tuesday said only three teachers lost their lives in the line of duty. The figure has been sent to the government by district magistrates who were asked to submit a report after verifying the number of deaths.  According to a communique released by the basic education department, the duration of election duty is considered only till an employee reaches the election training centre, polling booth or counting centre, and then returns home after the duty. Rashtriya Shaikshik Mahasangh, an RSS-affiliated body, had prepared a list of 1,205 teaching and non-teaching staff of primary schools across the state who reportedly died during election duty. “The officers responsible for verification are playing number game on papers while families of the deceased teachers are struggling to have their both ends meet. The government should show sympathy and sensitivity towards these families-.We will stand with the teachers till they get justice,” RSM’s organisational secretary Shiv Shankar Singh said. UP Prathamik Shikshak Sangh claimed that 1,621 teachers lost lives in election duty. “The number given by the government is misleading. The report is baseless. We have verified the death of hundreds of teachers,” said UPPSS’s state general secretary Sanjay Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/dms-report-only-3-teachers-died-on-panchayat-poll-duty/articleshow/82752348.cms||---

District collector Rajendra Bhosale on Tuesday issued an order stating that these markets will remain closed from May 19 to May 31. “The district disaster management committee met and reviewed the Covid situation in the district. The members felt there is an imperative need to close down these APMC to prevent the spread of the infection,” said Bhosale. Bhosale admitted although daily positive cases in Ahmednagar city has declined, the rural parts of the district are still registering around 2,000 positive cases per day. Those visiting the markets are not adhering to Covid-related safety protocols like maintaining social distancing and this could be a reason that the infection is spreading in rural parts of the district. Interestingly, Ahmednagar Municipals Corporation (AMC) has re-imposed closure of grocery and vegetable shops in the city from Monday, two days after it allowed them to starting functioning. Apparently violation of Covid appropriate behaviour prompted the civic body to take this decision. The civic body had ordered the closure of these shops from May 3. “The AMC has already closed down the APMCs based in the city areas. This has helped the civic body to bring down the cases. We feel that in rural parts of the district the markets should be closed down as well,” said Bhosale. The total number of active cases in Ahmednagar district is around 22,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/collector-orders-closure-of-apmcs-in-rural-ahmednagar/articleshow/82750479.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

---||Nagpur||Fear psychosis prevails among kin of Covid-hit||NAGPUR: Many recovered patients, bereaved family members and friends are now seeking psychological help to overcome fear psychosis instilled by the Covid second wave. Psychatirists say many patients are coming with the fear of not being fully out of Covid, even though they have recovered. Another group included many young women who have lost their husbands or childhood friends. Doctors said that since the closure of the relationship didn’t end in a traditional manner, people are unable to cope with the mental trauma. While those feeling scarred of still remaining infected are overcoming their anxiety within two weeks through counselling, doctors said those losing young members will need more than a year to come out of the bereavement. Dr Abhishek Somani, professor at IGGMCH’s psychiatry department, said, “Before the second wave, it was believed that Covid was fatal only for the elderly. Now, in second wave, more younger people are involved. A lot of people from different age groups who lost a son, husband or childhood friend are traumatised by the loss. Young widows and aged parents are finding it very difficult to tide over the sudden loss,” he said. Dr Somani added that another group of patients include those who were hospitalized or in home isolation but still fear they have not fully recovered. “There are also those fearing mucormycosis,” he said. Another type of patients approaching psychiatrists are those who are Covid negative but suffer from constant fear of getting infected and stay isolated, he added. Dr Sonakshi Jyrwa, assistant professor of psychiatry, AIIMS Nagpur, said with the second wave, they have witnessed an unprecedented rise in anxiety, despair, paranoia, and the fear of death, more in patients with Covid 19 admitted in their hospital’s ICU and isolation wards. “An overload of news about the rising number of cases and deaths for many within one’s family/friends/community on social media has instilled a sense of fear and panic in many,” she said. For patients admitted, the sights and sounds in the ICU and isolation wards can be frightening, Dr Jyrwa added. “In patients who are elderly, with severe Covid illness, the risk of “acute confusional state or ICU psychosis” is higher and due to multiple medical reasons inherent to the infection itself. Therefore, at AIIMS, a team of psychiatrist screen and monitor all patients admitted for mental health issues,” she said. Senior psychiatrist at Regional Mental Hospital Dr Praveen Navkhare said the psychological health under such conditions depend on the way a person generates an interpretation of the information available. “A healthy, helplful and correct way will lead to a healthy mental well being. Also, people already under psychological medication or distress are vulnerable and get easily driven by such developments,” he said. Dr Navkhare pointed out that the loss of loved ones is more challenging for the elderly. “The grief reaction generally last two weeks, but it may prolong beyond four weeks seen more in elderly persons. Losing a spouse at an advanced age may keep them mentally disturbed for a longer period or maybe the rest of their life,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fear-psychosis-prevails-among-covid-hit-relatives-and-friends/articleshow/82750490.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Vendor kidnapped, cigarettes worth Rs 62k seized in fake raid||MUMBAI: Posing as policemen cracking down on shops violating lockdown guidelines, two men kidnapped a paan vendor from Dahisar east and “seized” his stock.  Dahisar police tracked down the duo after the paan vendor lodged a complaint. A magistrate court has remanded the accused to police custody till Wednesday. The incident occurred earlier this month. The paan vendor resides at Anand Nagar in Dahisar and runs a shop in the same suburb. While he had stepped out of his shop, one of the accused, Sandeep Khot, landed up. Khot posed as a policeman and inquired why the shop was kept open despite a lockdown. He then “confiscated” cigarette packets worth Rs62,000. He also forced the vendor to get into the vehicle and took him to Kashimira. Khot and his accomplice, Ramesh Mishra, threatened the vendor at knifepoint. They emptied his pockets of Rs 7,000 cash. “After the duo dumped him at Kashimira and fled, the vendor returned to Dahisar and lodged a complaint,” an officer said. Investigators scrutinised CCTV footage along the entire route from Dahisar to Kashimira. Some of the cameras had captured the vehicle’s number plate. “The vehicle turned out to be an app cab. After making inquiries with the driver, we got leads on the two accused and picked them up from Nalasopara,” said the officer. Khot and Mishra have a previous criminal history, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-vendor-kidnapped-cigarettes-worth-rs-62k-seized-in-fake-raid/articleshow/82752342.cms||---
---||Delhi||Over 300 duped in name of Covid care, 4 arrested||NEW DELHI: One of the major con networks allegedly duping Delhiites in the name of Covid care has been busted by Delhi Police’s Crime Branch. The syndicate was operating from Nalanda in Bihar and four of its members have been arrested following a raid in the state. After police commissioner S N Shrivastava reviewed the incidents reported during the second wave of the pandemic, Special Cell and Crime Branch teams are learnt to be camping in five states to nab these cyber fraudsters. Over 500 cases have been registered in this regard. According to joint commissioner (crime) Shibesh Singh, an analysis of bank transactions so far shows over 300 people have been duped of over Rs 1.5 crore. This gang, which had earlier duped people by posing as bank representatives and asking for OTPs, was allegedly cheating Covid patients’ relatives by making false promises of supplying oxygen cylinders, concentrators, medicines and injections like tocilizumab and remdesivir. Divided into four verticals, the first section of the gang circulated phone numbers on social media and collected leads following which the other vertical would call up targets and convinced them to transfer even full amount in advance. Another section used to arrange wallets and accounts to receive the money. These were either rented from daily wage labourers etc or opened on forged documents. The fourth vertical used to withdraw the money through ATMs or banks immediately after the transfer. “Police have seized 21 mobile phones, 22 SIM cards, 23 ATM cards of different banks and account documents. A laptop has also been seized, besides Aadhaar and voter I-cards,” the joint CP said. The arrested have been identified as Deepak (21), Pankaj (26), Sarvan (35) and Mithlesh (36), all members of the Chhote Choudhary gang. Choudhary, a resident of Palni Village in Nalanda district, has been operating the gang for two-three years and has accumulated huge properties. He has engaged 200-300 people of the area in this racket, Singh said. The cops started tracking this gang after a man whose relative was admitted to DDU Hospital was contacted by these crooks offering to provide two cylinders for Rs 23,959. The victim paid the money into a wallet and a bank account after which the caller had disappeared. In another operation, a 47-year-old businessman was arrested for allegedly selling oxygen concentrators, originally meant for distribution among the needy, for Rs 1 lakh each. “The accused, Harminder Singh of Tilak Nagar, was arrested from Paschim Vihar and six oxygen concentrators and as many stabilisers were seized from him,” DCP Parvinder Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/over-300-duped-in-name-of-covid-care-4-arrested/articleshow/82783051.cms||Raj Shekhar
---||Delhi||More powers to LG: HC seeks Centre reply to plea||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Tuesday asked the Centre to respond to a PIL challenging the new law for the capital, which increases powers of the lieutenant governor. A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and justice Jasmeet Singh issued notice to the ministries of law and home affairs seeking their stand on the plea by law student Skrikant Prasad that the Act, which came into force on April 27, “re-defines Delhi government as the lieutenant governor” and curbs Delhi Assembly’s power to conduct proceedings. “Further, the Act provides that the opinion of the LG must be obtained before taking any executive action on decisions of Delhi government, on such matters as may be specified by the LG,” the petition has claimed. Prasad has contended that the provisions of the Act are in contrast with the Supreme Court order on the powers of LG and Delhi government, as the apex court had said that the LG would be bound by aid and advice of council of ministers except in matters of land, police and public order. The petitioner argued that the Act was only going to increase the suffering of the citizens of Delhi who are already grappling with the pandemic and related problems of shortage of oxygen, essential medicines and beds. He has alleged that the provisions in the Amendment Act are also contrary to various fundamental rights and Article 239AA of the Constitution. Article 239AA of the Constitution, among other things, provides that LG would be the administrative head of the National Capital Territory of Delhi and would be aided and advised by the Council of Ministers in relation to matters on which the Legislative Assembly has power to make laws.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/more-powers-to-lg-hc-seeks-centre-reply-to-plea/articleshow/82750520.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Black fungus kills four more patients; all had diabetes||LUCKNOW: Mucormycosis or black fungus has claimed the lives of four more patients who had successfully beaten Covid-19. However, during the course of treatment, they acquired the lethal fungal infection. All four deceased patients had diabetes. While three of them were women—a 40-year-old from Rae Bareli, a 52-year-old from Ayodhya and a 50-year-old from Lakhimpur—a 37-year-old man from Hardoi was the fourth victim. They had contracted the infection during treatment in other hospitals before being referred to King George’s Medical University (KGMU). The patients were admitted in advanced stage of the disease when the infection had already reached their brain and lungs, said Prof Sudhir Singh, KGMU spokesperson. With this, black fungus toll in the city has reached seven. It is a rare infection, but with high mortality rate. Meanwhile, three more mucormycosis patients were admitted to KGMU, taking the number currently under treatment here to 35 and overall in the city to 45. Ten patients are being treated in other hospitals. KGMU’s ENT department has conducted surgeries on six patients. “We have removed tissues damaged by the mucor in the internal area of nose, eyes and sinus cavities of patients to save their lives. Once the infection reaches the brain or lung, it becomes fatal,” said Prof Veerendra Verma, faculty in the ENT department. Doctors said black fungus affects Covid-19 patients who are diabetic and on steroids for a long period. Steroids are given to Covid-19 patients with severe lung infection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/black-fungus-kills-4-more-patients-all-had-diabetes/articleshow/82752363.cms||---

The PIL (WP-C No. 11315/2021) was filed by Chikithsaneethi, an organization based at East Peringottukara in Thrissur, through advocates Arul Muralidharan and Vineetha Vijayan. It is alleged in the petition that the government is going ahead with the decision to hold a large ceremony despite widespread criticism by health experts and others. Persons attending the ceremony would be traveling from Kasaragod to Thiruvananthapuram. The ceremony could have been live-telecasted so that only the MLAs need to attend it, the plea said. Giving particular privilege to the relatives of MLAs and denying the same to the common man, who is kept confined with lockdown, goes against the Constitutional right to equality, the petitioner contended. Such a serious violation will result in violation of government orders and will amount to disrespect and betraying the belief of the people, the petition added. As an interim relief, the petitioner is seeking a court directive that the ceremony should be conducted by allowing only those taking the oaths and those administering the oaths to be present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ensure-triple-lockdown-during-oath-ceremony/articleshow/82748707.cms||---
---||Nagpur||13 ‘guardian Covid officers’ to fight third wave, mucormycosis spike in rural areas||Nagpur: District collector Ravindra Thakare is deploying 13 ‘guardian Covid officers’ of deputy collector rank, one for every taluka, to coordinate with various agencies, create awareness and oversee health infrastructure, in preparation for third corona wave and mucormycosis surge. This is to prepare the rural areas, where the numbers of Covid patients has been on the higher side in the second wave. On Tuesday, around 250 medical officials from across the district were addressed by top ear, nose and throat surgeons like Dr Madan Kapre, Dr Prashant Nikhade and others in an online meeting on mucormycosis. Thakare said one key concern area currently is to protect Covid recovered farmers from mucormycosis attack. He said soon a massive awareness drive would be launched across the district, including urban areas, to ensure the masses are educated about the fungal infection and means to protect themselves. With the third wave anticipated to hit the rural parts more than urban, the district administration is reaching out to Covid recovered farmers, especially those with diabetes and immune conditions, who are expected to move in the fields in the coming sowing season during rains. The collector said the farmers would be asked to wear masks, gloves, full pants and full-sleeve shirts to protect themselves. “The farmers move in the fields, use manure and soil, where the fungal spores are ubiquitous. We will try to reach out to them in every revenue circle and taluka, telling them the need to be cautious about their health,” said Thakare. He also said rural doctors would be guided and groomed by volunteers of Indian Medical Association (IMA), with whom he shall have a meeting soon. “We will allot a group of IMA volunteers to each taluka, to use their medical expertise,” he said, adding the concept of telemedicine would be put to use for guidance by experts from urban areas. Renowned ENT specialist Dr Madan Kapre said the first bulk of mucormycosis patients were from the agricultural belt like Amravati, Achalpur and Paratwada. “The vulnerable lot, like Covid recovered diabetes patients, are required to be identified and their symptoms need to be picked up early,” he said. “People should be made aware about the red flag signs of mucormycosis,” he said.

---||Pune||Demand for medical oxygen drops after month’s stress in PMR||PUNE: The daily requirement of medical oxygen has dropped to 280 tonnes in PMR from an average of 350 tonnes recorded throughout April. “The decrease in the daily count of Covid cases, extensive use of oxygen control devices and regular oxygen audits carried out at Covid hospitals to reduce wastage have collectively led to the drop in the daily requirement of the essential gas in the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR),” said S B Patil, joint commissioner (drugs), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Pune branch. Besides, cryogenic tankers of medical oxygen being sourced from places such as Jamnagar in Gujarat and Murbad in Thane are now being supplied to Aurangabad, Nashik, Amravati, Akola and other districts of Maharashtra. “We are ensuring that these districts get the medical oxygen in time. We are evenly distributing the oxygen to hospitals in Pune,” Patil said. The sudden strain had left big hospitals with no option but to create more oxygen beds within limited spaces. The situation arose after the daily requirement of the district's Covid health units has shot up to an average of 350 tonnes as against the daily production capacity of 250 metric tonnes during mid-April.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/demand-for-medical-o2-drops-after-months-stress/articleshow/82752356.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Demand for local fish over river varieties pushes up price||KOLKATA: The prices of local and fresh fish varieties have shot up while that of river fish has taken a plunge following the news of suspected Covid victims’ bodies floating in other states. Fish vendors are having a tough time selling catfish, bigger varieties of rohu and katla. But smaller and fresher varieties of fish are being sold faster. The prices of local varieties have gone up by Rs 150-200 a kg in the last four days, said fish traders. Times ViewThere needs to be widespread dissemination of correct information to preempt an avoidable distress in the demand-supply chain. Supplies, anyway, would have taken a hit because of transportation problems. Any further disruption would add to the chaos and has the potential to hurt people in the supply chain.The demand for fish in the markets have remained high since Sunday with people keen to stock up to avoid making frequent trips to the fish markets “We anticipated the demand, so we activated local fishermen who catch in small quantities and sell on their own. We had done the same last year too. Such catches are now helping us,” said Subir Koley, a fish wholesaler at Lake Market. “Even on a Sunday we could not get the variety that people demanded. However, they bought the alternatives we had on offer. Bata, small prawns and Mourala were sold well. The price remained high though. Mourala was sold at Rs 400-450 per kg but our stocks were exhausted before we shut shops in the afternoon,” said Ashta Dhara, who has two shops at Gariahat and Kasba markets. The higher demand has pushed up the prices of local varieties. “Average prices of local variety rose by Rs 150 a kg in the last four days. If the parshe from the pond is sold at Rs 550-600, the river variety is priced at Rs 400. Local varieties like Rupchand and Tilapia (St Peter fish) rose by Rs 200 a kg,” said Amar Das, a fish vendor of Lake Market. Soumendra Bagchi, a retired professor of Manindra Chandra College, said, “I wanted to buy a Katla weighing 4kg for the whole week, but the fish available was below 3kg. So I bought bata, tyangra and mourala.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/demand-for-local-fish-over-river-varieties-pushes-up-price/articleshow/82750524.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Chandigarh||Punjab: Justice Ranjit Singh Commission, special investigation team reports never blamed Badals, says Bikram Singh Majithia||CHANDIGARH: Akali MLA Bikram Singh Majithia said on Tuesday that contrary to Congress falsehoods, reports of both Justice Ranjit Singh Commission and the special investigation team (SIT) filed by former IG Kunwar Vijay Pratap never blamed then CM Parkash Singh Badal or deputy CM Sukhbir Badal in the police firing cases post-sacrilege protests. Majithia said the SIT relied on judicial commission’s report and the HC judgment found no truth or merit in both. He reiterated SAD’s open challenge to critics in the Congress or the AAP to submit to the court in full public and media view any proof, which they claim that they had against Akali leaders on sacrilege. “If they had or have this evidence, but never produced it before the Khalsa Panth or SIT or the court, then this is an act of betrayal and treachery against the Guru Granth Sahib and the Khalsa Panth. It is a sacrilege not to use that evidence in order to punish the guilty,” the Akali leader said.  Majithia added, “Captain, Jakhar, Sukhi Randhawa, Channi or Sidhu they all owe an explanation to the Khalsa Panth and the judiciary why they have been hiding the evidence about those guilty of sacrilege.” The SAD leader produced pictorial and video evidence of Congress MLA Navjot Singh Sidhu touching the feet of Sirsa Dera head Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh and comparing him with Guru Nanak Dev. “This is the truth about the character of this hypocrite and follower of Gurmeet,” he said. The dera head had committed sacrilege by donning the robe associated with Guru Gobind Singh and instead of being outraged by this, Sidhu compares Guru Nanak with this ‘religious thug’,” he added. The SAD MLA strongly condemned the abuse of vigilance bureau to falsely implicate CM’s political opponents in or outside the party. “No one knows the pain of the vigilance bureau being abused as a tool of vendetta more than SAD does. The same Captain had used the same vigilance bureau to book former CM Badal and his son Sukhbir in false cases and send them to jail. We oppose this draconian practice,” he added. Commenting on the intra party war in Punjab Congress, Majithia said, “Captain and his gang are enacting a drama of political differences on this issue. The only reason why the Congress leaders had started the “rainy frog song” is their knowledge that they face a humiliating rout in the forthcoming elections.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ranjit-commission-sit-reports-never-blamed-badals-akalis/articleshow/82750519.cms||---

---||Delhi||Clouds of worry: Farm fire count doubles from last summer||NEW DELHI: With the rabi crop harvest season going on in the northern plains, the intensity of stubble burning has increased significantly over the last few weeks. The VIIRS satellite data (375m) analysed by Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) has recorded over 4,000 more farm fires in Punjab between April 1 and May 16 this year as compared to the same period last year. The figure is also higher than that of 2019. Similarly, fire counts in Haryana are almost double than what were recorded during the same period last year, the data shows. According to satellite imagery, Punjab recorded 12,033 fire counts between April 1 and May 16 this year, as compared to 8,172 during the same period last year. In 2019, 10,307 fires were recorded. Haryana, meanwhile, has shown an improvement from 2019, but the count is almost twice as compared to 2020. According to the data, 4,825 fires were recorded in Haryana this year as compared to 2,523 last year. In 2019, the figure was 5,443 for this duration. TimesViewFarm fires have been a major health hazard for the national capital and adjoining regions, especially for those with respiratory problems. Now with the nation in the grip of a virus that also affects the lungs, the need to control this menace was never more urgent.“Punjab and Haryana have recorded over 12,500 and 5,500 fires so far during this rabi harvest season. Fires during this season are witnessed every year but their impact on air quality is not as pronounced as summer conditions such as higher temperatures and wind speeds facilitate smoke dispersion,” said L S Kurinji, research analyst at CEEW. The impact is more during the winter due to stable atmospheric conditions with calm surface winds, she added. She states proactive measures to cut pollution from its sources during the winter season, including agricultural burning, will be critical. “State and central government agencies, and entrepreneurs involved in biomass management should coordinate with farmers to ensure they have access to viable crop residue management options. Year-round awareness campaigns will help demonstrate better residue management practices and address misconceptions around such practices.” Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy at Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said the focus on farm fires had generally been lower in summer, with the state machinery and the Centre often shifting focus towards stubble burning just before winter. However, she believes that due to the pandemic, “attention right now is to save lives and to ensure people are safe. Therefore enforcement around farm fires could be lax”. According to SAFAR, a forecast body under the ministry of earth sciences, active fire counts in the northern plains crossed upwards of 1,500 per day in the last two weeks. However, wind conditions have largely been unfavourable in terms of influencing Delhi’s air.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/clouds-of-worry-farm-fire-count-doubles-from-last-summer/articleshow/82750569.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

The road will be constructed at a cost of Rs 10 crore, he said, adding that the construction company would carry out maintenance work for the next five years. According to Sidhu, of the Rs 22 crore allocated for the project, Rs 12 crore has been spent on installation of sewerage pipes. Mohali mayor Amarjit Singh Sidhu or Jeeti Sidhu, senior deputy mayor Amrik Singh Somal and deputy mayor Kuljit Singh Bedi were also present on the occasion. For a long time, part of the main road from Mohali, Phase 11 to Balongi had been dug up and large sewerage pipes had been installed to solve the longstanding sewerage problem of Mohali. Over time, sewerage pipes laid when the city came into being were completely blocked, causing frequent overflow of sewerage. The project was launched under the Amrut scheme, with the Centre giving 50% of the funds and the state government pitching in with 30%. The remaining 30% will be spent by the MC. The health minister announced that the road would be constructed before the rainy season. MC officials said the tender for the road was alloted last month and construction would be started by the company, NS Construction. Construction work would start from phase 11.

---||Lucknow||Lucknow: FIR against three private hospitals for overcharging Covid-19 patients||LUCKNOW: After strict warning from the district administration, the office of the chief medical officer (CMO), Lucknow, on Tuesday swung into action and lodged FIR against three private Covid hospitals found to be overcharging patients. The district administration also issued show-cause notices to three other private Covid hospitals after an investigation into complaints by patients revealed that these facilities were charging more than the rates fixed by the state government. The three hospitals against which FIRs have been lodged under the Epidemic Act are located in Gomtinagar Extension, Indiranagar and Kursi Road, respectively. Earlier, a probe had found that these hospitals were charging up to eight times more than the fixed rates. Subsequently, on May 12, officer in charge of Covid-19 management in Lucknow, Roshan Jacob, had directed the CMO to lodge an FIR. However, when no action was taken till Monday, Jacob sent a reminder asking the CMO to take action at the earliest or be ready to face the music. The hospital on Kursi Road was allegedly overcharging patients for oxygen and not giving original bills to them, while the hospital in Gomtinagar charged Rs 1.6 lakh from a patient for just 24 hours of treatment. The hospital on Faizabad road was not only charging excessively but was also providing Covid treatment to patients without RT-PCR test confirmation and with no MBBS doctor at the facility. Meanwhile, three private hospitals in Dubagga, Gomtinagar Extension and Rae Bareli Road have been asked to explain why they have been overcharging patients. They have been asked to reply within 24 hours, failing which action will be taken under the Epidemic Act. According to officers, an inspection by a joint district administration and health department, led by Jacob, had revealed that the hospital on Rae Bareli Road was charging arbitrary fee for medicines, surgical items, consultancy and pathology tests. Similarly, inquiry revealed that the Dubagga-based hospital charged over Rs 10 lakh for eight days of post-Covid treatment from a patient who later died. The hospital in Gomtinagar Extension took Rs 5.25 lakh for eight days of treatment but didn’t give bills to the patient.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/fir-against-three-private-hospitals-for-overcharging-covid-19-patients/articleshow/82752395.cms||---

Refusing interim stay, a bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and justice Jyoti Singh, however, sought the Centre’s stand on the PIL that wanted it to set aside the permission granted by Drugs Controller General of India to Bharat Biotech to conduct the phase II/III trial of its Covaxin on the said age group. The court issued a notice to the Union ministries of health and woman and child development, Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation and Bharat Biotech seeking their response by July 15. The plea said permission to conduct trials on children was granted on May 12. According to Union health ministry, 525 healthy volunteers would be given by the vaccine by intramuscular route in two doses at day 0 and day 28. Covaxin is being used on adults in the ongoing Covid-19 vaccination drive. Sanjeev Kumar, an advocate, in his plea, had raised an apprehension that the children, who would be part of the trial, could suffer adverse health or mental effects due to the testing of the vaccine. He claimed that they could not be called “volunteers” as they were not capable of understanding the consequences of the trial or giving an informed consent for the same. Conducting the trial on healthy children would amount to “homicide”, the petition claimed and sought criminal prosecution of people involved in such trials or those authorised to conduct them, in the event of death or “loss of peaceful and pleasant enjoyment of life” of any of the toddler or minor who are part of the trial.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-refuses-to-stay-clinical-trial-of-covaxin-on-kids/articleshow/82783131.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Unregulated drug use, unhygienic lifestyle helped spread mucormycosis in Covid patients||NAGPUR: Though basically known to be a ‘hospital acquired’ fungal disease, mucormycosis has also affected Covid patients undergoing treatment at home. This has been attributed to various reasons, including unregulated drug use and lack of blood sugar surveillance during home isolation. Several medical experts said many Covid patients and their relatives resorted to various experiments with drugs, based on messages on social media, unscientifically shared prescriptions, and also suggestions from unqualified doctors, which had a detrimental effect on their health. Read AlsoCovid-19: Now, SOSs for injection to treat black fungusThe crisis cycle – ticking like a clock, from hospital beds to oxygen to remdesivir to ambulances since the second wave of the pandemic began ravaging Delhi-NCR in April – has now moved to Amphotericin B, the antifungal drug hospitals have been using to treat recovering Covid patients who haveRenowned physician Dr Jay Deshmukh, one of the directors of Sunflower Hospitals, criticized the practice of prolonged self medications of drugs like steroids, taking medicines on outdoor patient department (OPD) basis at a stretch without expert consultation, and also sharing prescription between people having similar symptoms. “No two schedules of the treatment can be the same, even if there are similar symptoms. Hence, such generalized way of taking medicines should be discouraged,” he said. Though most doctors feel mucormycosis was triggered by unregulated use of medicines on Covid patients without controlling blood sugar level, several others felt that post-Covid unhygienic lifestyle at home too paved the way for the black fungus to afflict immunosuppressed health systems. Renowned ear, throat and nose surgeon Dr Nandu Kolwadkar said there were three patients admitted under him at Orange City Hospital, who had been taking treatment for Covid at home before developing mucormycosis. “We learnt that the three Covid patients were prescribed medicines by some general physicians, who may not have kept watch on their sugar levels and other parameters. Two weeks later, they developed mucormycosis symptoms and landed up at the hospital,” said Dr Kolwadkar. Dr Mohan Nerkar, a director of Seven Star Hospital, also said diabetic and other immunosuppressed patients are highly prone to fungal infections like mucormycosis. “Many Covid patients had started taking medicines through self-treatment at homes with no monitoring or control of sugar. Some were also being advised by unqualified doctors, with medicines given without checking parameters, which is harmful. Some also resorted to home treatment remedies as per forwards on social media,” said Dr Nerkar. “Many people also used oxygen cylinders at home with tap water in the flow meters, which may also have led to fungal infections like mucormycosis. Also, unhygienic lifestyle of living, and unclean ambience can also lead to health complications and attract diseases,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/unregulated-drug-use-unhygienic-lifestyle-helped-spread-mucor-in-covid-patients/articleshow/82750589.cms||Soumitra Bose

Responding to a tweet by Lucknow-based poet Pankaj Prasun, requesting for 3 oxygen concentrators for villages in Rae Bareli, the actor replied within five minutes and assured, “Samjho Pahuch Gaya. Bas Pata Bhejie (They will reach you in no time. Just send the address).” The actor has come as a ray of hope for Prasun who has been providing help to Covid patients in towns and villages of Rae Bareli facing shortage of oxygen cylinders and medicines. The poet, along with newly elected heads of six villages, has started Team Covid Help, which provides free medical help to the patients. The team has also set up a Covid centre in villages for free counselling sessions with doctors. “Until now we have been providing the medicines through our own funds. But since these villages need the supplies in abundance, I personally tweeted to poet Kumar Vishwas and Sonu Sood for help. Kumar Vishwas and his team have been sending us kits which include an oximeter, thermometer, prescribed medicines for Covid, a sanitiser and mask. Since there has been an oxygen shortage also, I tweeted to Sonu Sood for it. The oxygen concentrators will arrive by Wednesday evening in Lucknow, and from there we’ll take it to Rae Bareli,” said Prasun. “Village folks have opened the doors of their schools to set up the Covid centre. From counselling to checking oxygen levels, our team will help the patients every day. We are trying to seek help from Anupam Kher Foundation, and other individuals who can help us so that the villages are free from the virus,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sonu-sood-vows-o2-concentrators-for-rae-bareli/articleshow/82752420.cms||Aditi Singh

Prima facie, the Kudghat resident had died by suicide. A Covid patient was found sitting on the third-floor cornice of Medical College and Hospital two weeks ago. He had escaped from the ward through the window. Disaster management team rescued the patient, who was put under counselling. The novel coronavirus, besides having the physical impact, is causing depression, anxiety and other mental health problems among many patients. Doctors have been coming across an increasing number of patients who need counselling as part of the treatment process. “The fear of death, the trauma on seeing others dying around, unable to see their loved ones for a long time and the thought that they might not be able meet their families again are some of the causes for distress among many hospitalized patients,” said Sanjay Garg, mental health and behaviorial sciences specialist at Fortis Hospital, Anandapur. A study on mental health of Covid patients by a team of doctors at Sanjiban Hospital found 84.2% suffered from anxiety, 77.2% from depression and 54.4% from stress. The 500-bed referral hospital for Covid in Howrah has been treating positive patients for more than a year now. The findings of the study, ‘The state of anxiety, depression and stress in hospitalised patients with confirmed covid-19 infections’ was published recently in the Asian Journal of Pharmaceuticals and Clinical Research. Conducted by doctors Subhasis Mitra, Dalia Mitra and Abhijit Dutta concluded that “such high prevalence of mental health outcome suggests the need for further evaluation and addressing the problem with immediate concern”. “I know the kind of trauma a Covid person goes through in hospital. I have seen death from close quarters. With people dying around, you need a mind of steel to emerge unscathed. It was a horrifying experience,” said SSKM Hospital ENT head Arunabha Sengupta, who had to be treated in ICU last year. Covid continueed to haunt many even after recovery. Doctors said that happened mostly to patients who had been in hospital for a prolonged time. The flashback of the close shave with deaths caused anxiety, panic attacks. “A large number of patients we see in our post-Covid clinic at ID Hospital suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. So their suffering goes much beyond the hospital stay,” said community medicine specialist Sanjib Bandyopadhyay.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fear-of-death-separation-cause-mental-health-issues-in-cov-patients-docs/articleshow/82750611.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The accused have been identified as Virender Singh (33), Gopal Singh (34) and Dilbagh (35), all residents of Rangpuri village, said DCP Rajiv Ranjan. On May 17, the police had received a PCR call about a person lying on the footpath near a hotel. On reaching the spot, they found the man dead. On contacting the last dialled number from his mobile, police got in touch with a travel agent, who told them that the victim, Jama Said Farah, had booked a ticket through him for Somalia. Farah’s daughter was then contacted who said that his father came to India two weeks ago for the treatment of his heart disease. “Due to Covid-19 pandemic, his treatment was postponed by a hospital. Hence, he was going back to his country via Somalia on May 17. However, he was denied immigration clearance at IGI Airport due to non-availability of visa of Somalia with him and was offloaded by the airline,” DCP Ranjan said. On being offloaded, he came outside the airport terminal and took a taxi (HR-55-AF-5435) for a hotel in Mahipalpur and was in touch with his daughter till then, the police were informed by her. She confirmed that Farah’s luggage was missing as well. During the probe, cops obtained the ownership of the taxi through the registration number obtained by them. The taxi was found registered in the name of Virender Singh. Police raided his house and arrested him along with his two associates. During interrogation, they revealed that the trio was seated in their taxi at Terminal-3 of the airport. The deceased took his taxi from the departure forecourt of T-3 to Mahipalpur. Later, the accused had an altercation with the Kenyan man over the fare of the taxi on the way near Mahipalpur red light. Thereafter, all three of them beat the man and threw him near a hotel and drove away from there. They also took the luggage and other valuable items of the deceased with them. Due to fear of being tracked, they left his mobile phone at the spot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/kenyan-killed-near-igi-over-cab-fare/articleshow/82750616.cms||---

Energy minister G Jagadish Reddy and Genco chairman and managing director D Prabhakar Rao held a review meeting on Tuesday with officials and BHEL, which is executing the project. TOI on Tuesday reported that nearly 5,000 of the 6,500 workers had left for their home states from YTPP after the 10-day lockdown was imposed.

It also sought the state government’s response on why paramedical staff was not being provided lodging facility after duty hours as they pose a risk of spreading infection to family members once they go home. The state government also sought the state counsel’s reply to a complaint of vaccine shortage for the 18-44 age-group. A bench of Justice Rajan Roy and Justice Saurabh Lavania passed the order on a PIL moved by local lawyer HP Gupta. Hearing the petition through video conferencing, the bench directed additional chief standing counsel H P Srivastava to seek detailed instructions on the issues. Earlier, the court kept open the question of maintainability of the PIL at Lucknow because Allahabad High Court was already hearing issues on Covid impact in the state, after taking suo motu cognizance. The bench said, “While we are conscious of the fact that similar issues have taken the attention of this court at Allahabad in a PIL, there are certain contentions which need to be taken note of. Therefore, keeping the question open as to whether this petition should be entertained and proceeded with or the petitioner should be asked to intervene in proceedings pending at Allahabad, we take note of contentions raised by the counsel for the petitioner Dr V K Singh.” The bench also asked the counsel for the high court administration Gaurav Mehrotra to obtain instructions on the feasibility of establishing a makeshift Covid hospital on the new campus of the HC at Gomtinagar for providing treatment to lawyers, judicial staff, employees and their family members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/hc-why-meds-not-given-to-home-isolation-patients/articleshow/82752448.cms||Ravi Singh Sisodiya

According to officials, in Vaguvarai estate under Kanan Devan Hills Plantations (KDHP), over 46 positive cases were reported in two days. Munnar panchayat vice-president Marsh Peter said, “We conducted a medical camp at Vaguvarai estate in Munnar and tested 50 people, of which 18 were positive. The Covid-19 positive cases are increasing in Chatta Munnar, Coffee Store and Vaguvarai areas. We suspect most people in the region were infected.” Devikulam sub-collector S Premkrishnan said, “In the wake of increasing positive cases in Vaguvari estate, I have recommended to the district collector to declare the region as a containment zone. We received information that positive cases are increasing inside tea plantations in various estates in Munnar.” “We are arranging quarantine facilities. The people in the region live in layams (cluster houses) and chances of the infection spreading is high,” he added. A senior official of the revenue department said that the increasing positive cases inside tea plantations is a cause for serious concern. “In three days, three Covid-19 deaths were reported in the region. Presently, over 100 tea plantation workers are under treatment in Munnar Shikshak Sadan. The main issue in Munnar is the lack of treatment facilities, and if the case numbers rise, it will result in more Covid-19 deaths in the region,” he said. To prevent the virus spread, KDHP had arranged mass vaccination drives for plantation workers and their dependents and company staff aged above 45 years. The drive in which over 3,000 workers were vaccinated was arranged in association with Idukki district administration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/covid-cases-rising-among-plantation-workers-in-munnar/articleshow/82748785.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

As the city woke up to a wet Tuesday morning, courtesy cyclone Tauktae, people risked rain and Covid to queue up for their favourite rainy day snack. As they lined up, throwing all Covid safety protocols to the wind, photographs of the rush went viral, causing the municipal officials to come down heavily on the dalwada joint owner and shut his shop. A serpentine queue of people was seen outside the Naranpura shop selling dalwadas. On getting to know of this, officials of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation rushed to the spot, dispersed the crowd, and sealed the shop. Teams of AMC’s solid waste management department took action against the shop.“The Covid situation in the city may have eased but we haven’t yet conquered it. People were seen without masks outside the snack joint. No one was maintaining social distancing either. Under such circumstances, we decided to shut the store,” said a senior civic official.According to civic authorities, no such incident was reported elsewhere in the city.

The decision was taken at the state committee meeting held in the state capital on Tuesday. Party national secretary Praful Patel attended the meeting in which it was decided that Saseendran would continue the full term. Earlier, there was a proposal to share the cabinet post between the two MLAs on term basis. Thomas K Thomas, the MLA designate from Kuttanad, also staked claim for the cabinet post in the state committee meeting. However, he did not get enough support in the committee though the party state president, T P Peethambaran, supported this. However, majority in the state committee supported Saseendran. The sharing of the minister post was turned down as Thomas was a first-time MLA and also came into politics after the death of his brother Thomas Chandy, who was the former MLA of Kuttanad. K Krishnankutty to continue: The national leadership of Janata Dal (S) has decided to continue with K Krishnankutty as the party’s minister in the second LDF government. Apart from Krishnankutty, the party also has Mathew T Thomas as MLA. Krishnankutty was the minister in the last Pinarayi government.

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Online classes to commence in varsities, colleges from May 20||LUCKNOW: After suspension of online classes for almost 10 days, schools (classes 9-12), colleges and universities across Uttar Pradesh will commence online classes from May 20. However, no student is allowed to be physically present on the campus. An order issued by special secretary higher education Abdul Samad said that instead of classroom teaching, classes for all subjects will be conducted in online mode. Heads of institutions have been asked to convince students to make maximum use of the digital library created by the higher education department. The digital library provides high-quality e-content uploaded by top teachers from state and private universities in UP. “The situation is changing for the better. We are geared up for online classes. We have held a meeting of all departmental heads to review their plans. The departments will furnish a weekly report for each programme. This will carry the students’ attendance,” said Prof Alok Rai, vice-chancellor, Lucknow University. The government has asked vice-chancellors and principals to decide whether or not to call teachers on campus. All other administrative staff and class IV employees are to be called on campus on alternate days. All higher education institutions have been asked to prepare a weekly roster so that on a given day, only 50% employees remain present on campus while remaining 50% work from home. In case a teacher or student has developed post-Covid complications, the departmental head and vicechancellor in case of universities and principal for college, in accordance with Covid-19 protocol, will decide on whether or not to run online classes for the subject. Directives have been issued to secondary education officers to conduct most of the academic work for online teaching from home. Schools recognised by UP Madhyamik Shiksha Parishad must strengthen online classes via Doordarshan, e-gyan Ganga and YouTube channels, it said. The government has fixed the responsibility of district inspector of schools (DIOS) for smooth running of online classes. All divisional joint directors have been asked to monitor online teaching. All DIOS have been asked to send a weekly report to the joint directors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/online-classes-to-commence-in-varsities-colleges-from-may-20/articleshow/82752493.cms||---

These plants would be set up at GMCH, IGGMCH and AIIMS with the help from funds received under corporate social responsibility (CSR) from Western Coalfields Limited (WCL), Coal India Limited (CIL) and Manganese Ore India Limited (MOIL). Earlier, collector through government pleader Ketki Joshi and additional pleader Deepak Thakare informed that total cost for setting up plants is Rs14.96 crore whereas the funds received from the WCL, CIL and MOIL collectively are Rs15.38 crore. “We’re of the view that since the total cost is almost according to the proposed one for which the CSR contribution has been made by these public sector units (PSUs), we grant approval to these proposals. Accordingly, the collector may issue the work-orders before Wednesday’s hearing,” a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Avinash Gharote said. While hearing a suo motu PIL based on TOI report of beds shortage where Shreerang Bhandarkar is appointed as amicus curiae, the bench asked the collector to clarify on names of the companies that agreed to contribute or already donated a total of Rs9 crore under the CSR, as mentioned by him in his affidavit. The HC in the last hearing had directed the companies providing CSR funds for Covid-19 pandemic to send their proposals as per the circular issued by the Government of India’s Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) on March 23. “We also direct the collector to inform companies to make their respective CSR contributions for undertaking various activities related to Covid-19 treatments and managements under Item Nos.(i) and(xii) of Schedule VII relating to promotion of healthcare, as per the MCA’s circular. It included preventive health care and sanitation and disaster management,” the judges said. They cautioned that the companies shouldn’t pass any specific resolutions for any particular activity under the head of Covid management while making their CSR contributions. The justices further asked the Vidarbha Industries Association (VIA)to submit a chart, giving names of companies, funds available under CSR head and their proposals for spending the fund before next hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/make-o2-plants-at-govt-hosps-operational-in-4-months-hc/articleshow/82750608.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has launched civil and electrical works for these plants. NHAI officials said that of the 28 captive medical oxygen plants, 6 will be set up by the Defence Research Development Organization (DRDO) and 22 by HLL Infra Tech Services (HITES). Nationally, DRDO will set up 400 plants while HITES will install 181 plants. Regional NHAI officials said work on one 100 litres per minute (LPM) and 500 LPM plant for a 30-bed hospital in Warud in Amravati district and a 100-bed district women’s hospital in Akola has already started. The 22 oxygen plants to be installed by HITES will be located one each at Dhule, Sangli and Warud, besides Pune (5), Ratnagiri (4), Jalna (4), and Hingoli (3). “All these 19 plants will have an oxygen generating capacity of 100 LPM. Three plants – the one at Latur will have a 200 LPM capacity while Jalna and Akola will have 500 LPM output each,” said officials. The NHAI officials informed that the six DRDO plants with 1,000 LPM capacity will be located one each at Dhule, Jalna, Pune, Nanded, Aurangabad and Latur. Pune and Jalna will have six plants. Oxygen will be provided to hospitals through the pipeline system and these plants will be established with aid from the PM Cares Fund. NHAI officials said sites have been identified and work on plants according to the priority list has begun. “As NHAI is the nodal agency for the civil and electrical works for these plants, the existing road contractors have been roped in to start work on these plants. We can complete this task by including this in the ‘change of scope’ of the ongoing projects. We have identified all the locations and tied up supplies for man and material,” they added. The ministry of health and family welfare has set a May 31, 2021 deadline to at least commission 52 oxygen plants in the country.

The action plan should be kept in public domain and should speak about how many people would be vaccinated with first and second doses respectively on each day, it said. Congress floor leader in the assembly, Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka, said the state government should involve the leaders of opposition parties in the high-level Covid-19 task force to collectively fight the spread of the novel coronavirus on the lines of the committee constituted by Tamil Nadu government. Bhatti lashed out at the TRS government stating that even the administration of second dose of vaccine has come to a halt since municipal minister KT Rama Rao was appointed by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao to head the task force on checking the spread of Covid-19. “People are being forced to buy Remdesivir in black market,” he alleged. Congress MLC T Jeevan Reddy wrote a letter to the CM demanding Covid-19 treatment be included in Ayushman Bharat and state’s Arogyasri in Telangana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-must-make-public-action-plan-for-vax-meds-supply-cong/articleshow/82752497.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kerala Infrastructure of Technology and Education to fix First Bell shortcomings||KOCHI: With the second wave of the pandemic prevailing intensely in the state, online classes and digital learning are likely to be the medium of education in the upcoming academic year too. To rectify the shortcomings and make digital learning more student-friendly and effective, Kerala Infrastructure of Technology and Education (KITE) has submitted a proposal to the state government. The proposal, submitted by KITE chief executive officer K Anwar Sadath, suggests a few additions to the existing First Bell programme based on the experiences gained over the last one year. KITE proposed to schedule the digital learning system in order to clear the academic gap in students. The plan is to keep a balance between centralized online classes, like the ones in Victers TV, and online lessons delivered by respective teachers at school level. Also, it must be structured in a way that teachers’ continuous support is provided to students along with the provisions for continuous evaluation. Suggestions at four levels —academic, technological, implementation and monitoring— were proposed by KITE to achieve the intended results. “Topics need to be covered in each term must be prescheduled assuming that online classes must be relied on throughout the year. After each session, instructions to teachers and parents must be given. Worksheets and assignments need to be available on Samagra portal and they must be simple and promote student’s ability to think. Session on arts, sports and lifestyle need more focus, considering the mental health of students,” said the proposal. KITE suggests that monitoring the effectiveness of online classes needs to be improved at school, sub-district, district and state levels. Remedial teaching measures need to be planned after completing each lesson. Also, activities of SCERT (academic), KITE (technological) and Samagra Shiksha Kerala need to be coordinated and monitored by the director of general education. The use of graphics and animations need to be increased in lessons. Artificial intelligence and augmented reality shall be used to improve teaching and monitoring the classes. Also, it suggests making use of interviews and team teaching without losing the academic content, and to give adequate training to teachers at regular intervals. KITE suggests an offline interaction, adhering to Covid protocols, between students of Class XII and their teachers within 10 days after the online classes begin. Direct online classes to students of classes X and XII can begin from mid-June and those to Classes VIII and IX from August. It also suggests to avoid relying on online classes completely for Class I to VII, considering the mental health of students. Common study centres can be opened at schools, anganwadis, libraries under the supervision of school heads and with strict adherence to Covid protocols. Also, if the pandemic situation allows, students can go to schools in small batches at least once a week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kite-to-fix-first-bell-shortcomings/articleshow/82748821.cms||---

Ramesh Chennithala has already expressed his desire to continue as the opposition leader and he received the support of a few members from the ‘A’ group unexpectedly. Former chief minister Oommen Chandy is learnt to have taken the decision to support Chennithala and he too conveyed this to his group MLAs at the meeting of ‘A’ group MLAs on Tuesday morning. In the Congress parliamentary party, ‘I’ group has 12 and ‘A’ group has 9 MLAs. However in the ‘A’ group, there was a split over supporting Chennithala as the opposition leader. These leaders had asked Chandy to demand the post for ‘A’ group. Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan is upset that his name was not even considered for the post by the ‘A’ group. Even from the ‘I’ group, sources said all MLAs did not support Chennithala and hence there was no consensus in the parliamentary party. The AICC leaders collected the individual opinion of all leaders and they will be submitting a report to the party high command in this matter. A decision is expected in a day or two. Both, Chennithala and Chandy are learnt to have reached an understanding that there should not be any change in leadership in Congress Legislature Party. However, the decision of the AICC will be the final one in this matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/chennithala-gets-support-from-a-group/articleshow/82748794.cms||---
---||Mumbai||State tops 2 crore shots, but only 5% adults get full dose||Mumbai: Maharashtra’s milestone of 2 crore vaccinations reached on Monday, the highest by any state, laudable as it is, translates into barely 5% coverage of the adult population with both doses. Experts said the country’s worst-hit state in both the waves must vaccinate with a greater degree of urgency in order to prevent a severe third wave. The state has an estimated adult population of 8.5 crore to be vaccinated, of which 2,00,90308 (18%) have got at least one dose and 42.77 lakh have got both doses. As far as complete vaccination of the most vulnerable age-group of 45 years and above goes, around 39.5% have got one dose, but only around 8% have received both. Above 92% healthcare workers have been covered with one dose and 72% have got both the shots. Of frontliners, 89% have got one dose and 52% have got both. States like Kerala, Gujarat and Rajasthan have all done between 7%-8% complete vaccinations. However, states with populations comparable to Maharashtra such as Bihar have given both shots to just 2% of their people. Uttar Pradesh, the most populous state, has covered less than 2.5% with both doses. Within Maharashtra, Mumbai is leading among districts with 28.92 lakh vaccinations, followed by Pune (26.17 lakh), Thane (15.28 lakh) and Nagpur (12.20 lakh). Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary, told TOI that the state has the capability to easily administer 7 lakh to 8 lakh doses a day, but vaccine unavailability has slowed down the drive. “We can even go up to 10 lakh doses a day, provided we get doses,” he said. On Monday, the state administered fewer than 1 lakh doses (99,699). A member of the state Covid task force said Maharashtra must consider more targeted vaccination of those working in markets and public transport, who are in touch with people, if they want to see an impact on disease severity. From the age group of 18-44, the most mobile population, just 1% have got the vaccine so far. Meanwhile, Mumbai on Tuesday saw a lukewarm response to its walk-in drive for 60 years and above, although vaccination opened after three days. A total of 16,754 stepped out to take the vaccine, including 9,474 senior citizens. Prashant Gaikwad, assistant municipal commissioner, D ward, said the response was poor for the walk-in drive. The drive was on at four centres in the ward, and each centre had 100 slots available. On an average, 40-45 people turned out at these centres, he said. Similarly, in Goregaon, a few centres remained shut due to leakage following rain. Medical officer of health Dr Nitesh Thakur said many may have stayed home anticipating bad weather. AMC Suresh Kakani said they are expecting footfall to increase on Wednesday. The walk-in option could be extended till Thursday since Monday’s drive had to be cancelled, said Dr Mangala Gomare, executive health officer. She added healthcare workers and frontliners wanting to take the first dose have to book online appointments hereon, though they can walk in for the second dose. Dr Dilip Patil, state immunisation officer, said Maharashtra has received 2 lakh doses of Covishield and one lakh of Covaxin, which should sustain the drive for a few days. Mumbai has received 19,000 doses of Covishield and 6,000 doses of Covaxin. A state official said they hope vaccine availability will drastically improve in the next one month.

---||Hyderabad||18-Citizen Reader’s Corner||Story-1 I finally made time for my art journal By Sritaja Mandala When the quarantine started, I was still in the final year of LLB. I was about to finish my studies and graduate, but then everything got delayed. At first, I was a little concerned about where my career would end up, but then I tried to be positive in this tough situation. I decided to utilise this time to do what I like the most -- start an art journal. I took a blank notebook that had been lying around the house for a while and started using it to create art every day. Art is something I have adored since I was a kid, but due to college and academics, I never got enough time to invest in art, except occasionally. So, I felt this was the right time for me to tick something off my bucket list. As we all know the lockdown lasted for a long time, I spent nearly 100 days on the journal, doing one art every day. Journaling indeed helped me relieve my stress and anxiety. Apart from that, I also took part in multiple virtual internships, participated in a few online competitions and also published blogs related to law. By the end of 2020, I graduated and got enrolled as an advocate. So, to all those feeling lazy, getting bored at home or waiting to step out and go on vacations, my simple suggestion is: relax. All of this is going to end and once it is over, we will get back to our normal lives again. At least till then, do what you like to do, do what you've always wanted to make time for and also take care of yourselves. Also, stay home and stay safe. (The writer is an advocate) …................. Story-2 In being alone, I found my creativity By Anand Menon The year 2020, began on a sour note. First the pandemic, which even today is a conundrum for me, then my feeling of insecurity post retirement. The question, ‘what next?’, kept playing on my mind. I started to feel that the proverbial ‘Damocles sword’ was finally falling on me. But then I decided to embark on a journey to tackle this turmoil. It took me a few days, but gradually I started the journey. I found myself surrounded by people of my age -- or even older -- who were in even severe situations, confined to their fate. Moved, I took up the challenge of moulding myself and transforming into a better human. This is when I took up to activities that would give me a wholesome atmosphere and take me away from worrying about the days to come. Firstly, it was meditation that I embraced along with my daily exercise regime -- a walking for a couple of kilometers and then some warm ups. This really rejuvenated me. My mind and body got in tandem and I gained robust health. The meditation, followed by listening to melodious rhythms, enhanced my hidden skills. This led to getting occupied in writing which increased my craving to read a little more. Thus, to a great extent, I found a glimpse of the answer to my question, ‘what next’. I have now come to realise that creativity backed by positivity can help one in achieving the best. I, therefore, urge everyone out there that, during such times of uncertainty, make small things count with a sense of purpose and make it certain. Now I am in the middle of publishing a book which contains random thoughts that blossomed out of the time I spent being alone.

Speaking to TOI, her husband Santhosh said that the Israeli President assured all possible support from the government to her family. “While speaking with the president, I told him that I wished to see the place where my wife was killed and he assured me that he would make the necessary arrangements for us to visit the spot and inform when things are ready. President Reuven Rivlin also assured us that he will meet me and my son during our visit to Israel. If Israel government makes all the arrangements for our visit, we will go,” he said. According to Soumya’s sister-in-law Sofi Mathew, the Israeli president called the family around 1pm and talked to them for 20 minutes. The president communicated to the family with the aid of a translator at Israel’s consulate in Bengaluru. “First, the president shared Israel’s condolence message with the family. Then, he said that Israel’s government would always be with Soumya and her family,” she said. “To arrange this talk, Israel’s embassy officials called us many times. They also noted the absence of state government representatives at the funeral of Soumya. An embassy official asked us why no government representative was present at the funeral or at Nedumbassery airport when the body was flown in from their country? At that moment, we felt the state government’s neglect,” she said. “We had hoped that someone from the government would come and inquire about our wellbeing and offer condolences. We don’t know why the government ignored us. We really felt that neglect after the embassy asked about us. We felt sad,” Mathew added. Santhosh said that he felt bad that no one from the state government came to the airport to receive the body or for the funeral. The family added that Union MoS (external affairs) V Muraleedharan will visit them at Keerithode on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/israel-prez-calls-soumyas-family-offers-support/articleshow/82748813.cms||Sandeep Thomas

---||Nagpur||Vax, economic activities, health infra priority for NMC, ZP before 3rd wave strikes||Nagpur: With second wave of Covid-19 receding day by day, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and Zilla Parishad (ZP) have decided to strengthen their health infrastructure, especially in the context of oxygen support, at private and public hospitals to ward off any threat of third wave looming large over the city. The two bodies have also started making plans to resume economic activities in the city by testing businessmen, their employees, vendors, home delivery boys and others to unearth, if any, cluster of cases and prevent them from turning into super spreaders, and vaccinate all eligible people. The district registered 1,189 positive cases on Tuesday which was slightly higher compared with that recorded a day ago. Cases were 971 on Monday. Tests increased to17,197 in the district on Tuesday due to special testing camps. Tests were 13,261 on Monday. Deaths also increased to 41 in the district on Tuesday. Fatalities dropped to 30 on Sunday and Monday. The cases and deaths on Tuesday were less compared with that registered on May 15. Cases were 1,510 and fatalities were 48 on May 15. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B told TOI, “Strategy is to keep test positivity rate (TPR) in single digit by focusing on testing. The vaccination will be intensified and cover all sections of people. Also, focus will be on increasing treatment capacity by adding more beds in private and public hospitals.” . The civic chief further said, “Special focus will be on issues like paediatric beds, pressure swing adsorption (PSA) plants to NMC-run hospitals, walk-in oxygen centres and better oxygen support to all hospitals.” CEO of ZP Yogesh Kumbhejkar said, “All blocks have been directed to increase number of tests. Tracing and testing of contacts of positive patients will continue. Strategy is to make all Covid hospitals self-sufficient in oxygen supply so that there is no shortage. Various types of works are underway to prepare for handling paediatric cases as per projection of third wave.” The NMC has already started testing people who meet multiple persons to prevent them from becoming ‘super spreaders’ when the economic activities will resume in the city. A team of NMC Satranjipura Zone led by zonal medical officer Dr Minakshi Mane on Tuesday launched ‘Testing At Your Doorstep’ programme for businessmen and their employees at Itwari market. Swab samples of around 217 persons were collected. The zone has also conducted tests on vegetable vendors a couple of days ago. “We arranged camp for shopkeepers and their staffers. But they informed us about their inability to come up to the camp. Therefore, we went to each and every shop and collected samples,” Dr Mane said. Special testing camp of auto-rickshaw drivers was undertaken a day ago. Testing of traders along with labourers at few major markets was also done in last three days. NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said testing of children will also be done from now onwards in contract tracing. “Earlier, our teams used to exempt them. Now, early testing and treatment of children is necessary in wake of projections of third wave,” he said. Joshi further said special testing camps will be increased in coming days. “The NMC had developed 11 mobile testing vans in first wave and all engaged in special camps. It is having 20 ambulances and 25 city buses were converted into ambulances. Now, demand for ambulance has gone down. Permission has been given to utilize these 45 ambulances in special testing camps,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vax-economic-activities-health-infra-priority-for-nmc-zp-before-3rd-wave-strikes/articleshow/82750686.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Mumbai||HC: Form board again in triplet abortion plea in Mumbai||Mumbai: The Bombay high court has reconstituted a medical board of J J Hospit-al doctors on a petition by a 41-year-old woman to permit the medical termination of her over 23-week triplet pregnancy. A bench of Justices Shahrukh Kathawalla and Surendra Tavade on Monday passed the order after taking note that while her prayer was for termination of her entire pregnancy, another HC bench, last week, had directed the dean to set up a medical board to examine her “for the possibility of termination of one foetus only”. The petition was filed by the woman and her husband, a transport worker. In October 2020, she underwent psychiatric treatment, but opted out due to financial strain. On April 10, a sonography showed she was 18-19 weeks pregnant with triplets, including one with an anomaly. On May 3, doctors at Wadia Maternity Hospital confirmed malformation of one foetus with anencephaly—a birth defect where a baby is born without parts of the brain and skull. On May 12, the couple’s advocate Aditi Saxena told a bench of Justices K K Tated and Abhay Ahuja that it is a case of delayed diagnosis of an unwanted pregnancy and while one foetus has an anomaly, they are seeking termination of the entire pregnancy. However, the bench directed the medical board to examine the woman on May 13, for the possible termination of only one foetus and submit a report on May 17. On Monday, the state’s advocate told the bench headed by Justice Kathawalla that she could not be examined as she had been to the hospital a day later. Saxena said her client was turned away on May 13 as it was a public holiday. The state’s advocate said the medical board has to find a foetal reduction specialist. “Do you need the court’s order for that?” Justice Kathawalla asked. Saxena said “the prayer was for termination of the pregnancy and not foetal reduction”. In their order, the judges said “the prayers show the petition is not confined to seeking permission for termination of only one foetus, but what is sought is the termination of the entire pregnancy.” They directed the dean to reconstitute a board comprising the dean, doctors and any other expert and “submit a report on the termination of the entire pregnancy as sought by the petitioner” on May 21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/hc-form-board-again-in-triplet-abortion-plea-in-mumbai/articleshow/82753129.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Hyderabad||Maths lecturer adds free coaching to his drive in helping the needy||Apart from providing ration kits and cooked food to the needy, a mathematics lecturer from the city is providing free coaching to students up to Intermediate. Jacob Joseph, who runs an academy in Uppal, said he provided coaching to 25 students during the academic year 2020-21, of which 12 students studied for free. "I provide free coaching for mathematics and science subjects to students from an economically poor background," said Joseph. During the pandemic, when majority preferred online classes, he divided a batch into five and took physical students whenever possible so that students understood the subject better. The 49-year-old said that he is unmarried and has no dependants, which is one of the reasons why he decided to help the needy. "I want to help as many people as possible," he said. Joseph, who works full time in a corporate institute in the city, said that during the past few days of lockdown, he started helping construction labourers and other migrant workers, who are struggling to make the ends meet and have no source of income. "I make it a point to verify that each request individually and ensure that I am actually helping a needy person. A few days back, I distributed ration kits with rice, dal, vegetables, oil, spices to 15 construction workers," he said, adding that each kit cost him 750. A resident of Uppal, who earns about 45,000 per month, Joseph said he is planning to distribute food packets to 50 people staying outside Secunderabad Railway Station. "We were not in a position to pay fees last year for my children to attend online classes," said Nandini Goud, whose children are in Class V and Class IX. "That’s when Joseph sir offered to teach them for free so that they can continue their education. For the entire year, my children studied at his institute."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/maths-lecturer-adds-free-coaching-to-his-drive-in-helping-the-needy/articleshow/82750671.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

---||Nagpur||Nagpur: This astrologer is making sure strays have a yummy future||NAGPUR: Whenever you go grocery shopping, don’t be surprised to see strays feasting on chicken biryani on the streets. In these times of ‘restrictions’, when even some sections of humanity is struggling to get one square meal, city’s Ranjeet Nath, fondly known as Ranjeet Dada, has been providing scrumptious chicken biryani to around 150 strays. The 58-year-old astrologer has been cooking nearly 35kg biryani daily since the onset of the pandemic. “He has been doing this even before the lockdown but his work grew manifold since the pandemic started,” says Rahul Motwani, who has been associated with Ranjeet. Such is his fondness for stray dogs that he calls them his “bacche” (kids). “I don’t like to call them dogs or stays. I consider all of them as my kids,” says Ranjeet. His day starts with preparations for the biryani. He starts cooking it from noon and goes around the city on his bike at 5pm daily to feed the strays. “I have 10-12 fixed locations and my ‘bacche’ know them. The moment they see me, they start running towards me,” says Ranjeet, who returns home around midnight after the entire vessel full of biryani is empty. He does it seven days a week. “Once on the streets, I do not discriminate against strays. I also feed cats but since the biryani has meat, I do not offer it to cows,” he says. There is less meat and more bones in the chicken biryani. “I get the bony part of the chicken at a cheaper rate which helps me to feed more dogs. Until last month, most of the expenditure was from my pocket,” he says. Since the last few days, Ranjeet has been getting donations from those ‘who don’t have enough time to feed strays’. “A video featuring Ranjeet’s kind gesture was uploaded by a food blogger after which donations started pouring in,” says Motwani. Ranjeet has the full support of his family. Initially, some neighbours did object to the biryani making but he convinced them by saying that it’s for a noble cause. “I live in a small house and cook the biryani in the veranda. The smell of the biryani irritates some neighbours, but when I tell them the reason, they oblige,” he signs off.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/this-astrologer-is-making-sure-strays-have-a-yummy-future/articleshow/82750682.cms||Sudhanshu Bisen

According to local residents, the issue of drainage overflow was persisting from several months before the officials took the initiative to fix it. “The drainage line opposite Patel’s Green Park, Maherr road frequently overflows on the main road. Despite repeated complaints, the issue was not being resolved. A week back, we finally saw the result as the officials came forward and fixed it,” said Alankritha Mandadi, the citizen reporter who highlighted the problem. Ahead of the onset of monsoon, residents fear that the situation may reoccur as it worsens when it rains heavily. Adding to the woes, they said is the piling up of garbage on the roadsides that leads to blockages. “Garbage dumping on the roadside is also an issue that needs to be addressed in the area. Several people residing in the neighbourhood dump their waste in a spot near Patel’s Green Park. Although the garbage is cleared by the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation, installing a dustbin at the location may resolve the garbage issue,” said Mandadi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sewage-overflow-plugged-after-report-on-toi-app/articleshow/82750693.cms||---

The call centre, which can be reached at 9447030801, was flooded with around 40 calls on day one where KVASU doctors and researchers responded to calls varying from clinical to farm management queries. The call centre is functioning at Mannuthy from 9am to 12noon and 2pm to 5pm on all days. “We have divided the calls into two sections — clinical and farm sectors. When we get a call, the technical staff will take the basic details and then connect to the concerned faculty through a mobile call conferencing system,” said Dr M K Narayanan, director of entrepreneurship, KVASU. More than 100 faculty, including veterinarians, have been looped into the call centre for helping animal farmers and pet owners looking for help and advice. “Because of Covid and lockdown, people are looking for experts to clear their doubts and we have been getting queries even on our social media page,” Narayanan added. While the technical staff will receive the calls from the farmer and connect to the concerned faculty, they will also return calls in case the discussion is long. The faculty will be available on call as per the schedule and answer to the immediate requirement. “In case of matters requiring detailed discussions, the clients will be asked to send photos and details through an email to clarify their doubts or they will be contacted directly at a convenient time later,” he said. Officials said that they are working to make it into a kind of tele-medicine facility by developing a mobile application wherein the sender can upload pictures, video or make live calls. That would be a 24-hour service. An evening animal health clinic is already functioning at Mannuthy campus for people to bring in animals in case of emergency. Doctors are on call from 4pm to 12 midnight. But this call centre will reach out to people across the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kvasu-opens-advisory-call-centre-for-animal-owners/articleshow/82748841.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

Over a 100 principals from state board schools log in every morning at 6 for yoga class, something which boasts of a cent percent attendance. An initiative of School Headmasters Charitable Association (SHCA), the morning yoga class was started as part of a solution to fight the Covid pandemic. The association’s founder-president Zafar Khan said, “Since March, we have only been hearing about Covid-19 news everywhere. Such negative news impacts mental state of those who read or view it. Hence, we decided that it’s high time something was done to address this issue.” The unanimous decision taken by SHCA’s executive members was to start yoga classes. Khan said, “Yoga benefits not only our physical well-being, but also mental health. Taking part in yoga early in the morning simply rejuvenates you for the long day ahead.” The classes are held over a web meet platform, rather than social media sites. “Going live on social media sites makes it a very public kind of event. Also, the interactive aspect is missing. Here our yoga teachers — Sachin Mathurkar and Monali Potdar — monitor principals through their screens and suggest correct postures,” said Khan. Ashnarayan Tiwari, principal of Adarsh Vidya Mandir (Gandhibagh) said, “Doing yoga gives us a major positivity boost. Seeing all other principals on screen also brings a smile to my face. It’s been quite some time since we all met, so through this yoga workshop we all catch up with each other and also start our day on a happy note.” Yoga guru Mathurkar said there are multiple challenges in teaching online, but it’s something he looks forward to. He said, “Technical issues crop up sometimes, but it’s something we have now learnt to navigate through.” He added that getting up early is one thing, but getting up early and doing yoga has ‘super benefits’. “I guarantee you that if you start yoga, then entire day there will not be a feeling of tiredness or lethargy. Yoga energizes your body and gives it enough fuel to see through the day,”said Mathurkar. Khan said he wants to take this yoga initiative to the next level now. “We ultimately want to reach out to every student in every school. For this to happen, training of teachers has to be done, so that they can take online classes for their students. Yoga has to become a part of our daily lifestyle, which is badly needed in these difficult times,” said Khan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/school-principals-join-yoga-classes-to-beat-covid-stress/articleshow/82748838.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

While the census did not witness any activity last year due to outbreak of Covid-19, evoking criticism, conservationists have demanded that the crucial activity can be carried out with the help of forest staffers without involving outside volunteers and experts. Honorary wildlife warden Kishor Pathak said that the schedule of wildlife census should be modified considering the pandemic situation. “As there is limitation on manpower joining the census due to Covid-related curbs, the forest department should carry out the census over a period of one week instead of a single day. The census activity is important for knowing the health of overall wildlife and should not go unattended for second consecutive year,” he said. As far as Marathwada is concerned, the census every year covers Gautala wildlife sanctuary from Aurangabad district and Yedshi Ramling wildlife sanctuary from Osmanabad district. The past census had recorded Chinkara, nilgai, jungle cat, monkeys, langurs, leopard, jungle cat, barking deer, hare, leopard, fox, jackal, bats, wild boar ,wolf, hyena, wild bear, black duck and hares, besides birds and other creatures at these places.

Also, total 10 deaths have been reported in last 48 hours by Tuesday which is also a record low number of causalities in the recent past. While the daily positivity rate dipped to 5.1% on Tuesday, Aurangabad is currently showing recovery rate over 96%. President of Aurangabad chapter of Indian Medical Association (IMA) Dr Santosh Ranjalkar said that people should continue follow Covid-19 prevention norms even if the curve seems to be flattening at present. “Everyone who is eligible should undergo vaccination as early as possible. Going by the stronger second wave as compared to the first wave, nobody can predict how the pandemic situation is going to unfold in future,” he said. The municipal limits of Aurangabad currently have 1,557 active cases, including highest number of 527 patients admitted in private hospitals, followed by home-isolation (480), CCCs (293), GMCH (123), DCHC Meltron (109) and district civil hospital (25). Meanwhile, MP Imtiaz Jaleel and local Shiv Sena MLA Pradeep Jaiswal on Tuesday met Aurangabad district collector Sunil Chavan to raise the demand of removing seals of commercial establishments that were recently found violating Covid prevention norms. “The district administration should show considerate and humanitarian approach towards shop owners as they were already suffering due to pandemic situation. The authorities should cancel stern action taken against such establishments from City Chowk and other market areas,” Jaleel said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/covid-19-cases-drop-below-200-in-aurangabad/articleshow/82746615.cms||---

Attention must be also given to providing medicines, oxygen and ventilators in sufficient numbers to all districts,” JIH state president RizwanurRaheman Khan said. In a memorandum submitted to the district administration, Khan said that the average cost of Covid treatment for patients having moderate to severe symptoms runs into few lakh rupees at many private hospitals. “Such huge amount is out of the reach of common man and many patients who were not able to spend have lost their lives. In all private hospitals, therefore, it should be mandatory to place a rate board at the entrance for treatment of Covid,” he said. Underlining the need of setting up a separate hospital for children in every district during the current pandemic, JIH has said that all such facilities must have paediatricians, ventilators and oxygen supply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/step-up-covid-combat-measures-jih/articleshow/82746632.cms||---

Shortage of medicines required for the treatment of Covid-19 continues to be a big challenge. To overcome this, city youngsters have started a campaign to collect leftover medicines from urban families, which will be distributed to the needy in rural areas. Started by Nagpur NGO ‘The Strength of Unity Foundation’, the idea is to collect unused medications and provide them to the underprivileged. “We have been coming across many recovered patients, who have left-over medicines and they don’t know what to do with them. That’s when the idea struck us. While there is shortage of medicines at many places, there are many people who can’t afford to buy medication. We want to lend a helping hand to them,” said Kunal Mourya. The youngsters are spreading the word through social media. “We are appealing to everyone to donate medicines which are not of use for them. These have to be basic medicines which are prescribed for Covid patients in home isolation. For examples, fabiflu, vitamin C, zinc, paracetamol, azithromycin and others. While donating, people should ensure that the medicines are not expired,” added Mourya. Once enough medication is collected, it will be distributed to needy patients. “These days, people are very active on social media and we get to know about medicine requirements for the underprivileged as well as people residing in rural areas. We will be handing over the medication directly to them after consulting medical experts,” said Mourya. Apart from the collection system, the organization is also willing to buy medicines for patients who can’t afford it. “There are many antibiotics, steroids and injections which are costly. If someone approaches us for help, we provide them the required medicines free of cost,” said Mourya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/citys-unused-medicines-to-help-rural-areas-tide-over-covid-surge/articleshow/82750718.cms||Manka Behl

The commission has called for a report from chief secretary and additional chief secretary, health, by May 28. In a release, the commission stated, it came to light that apart from corona, black fungus is also gripping patients. Cases of black fungus are increasing in Indore, Bhopal and Jabalpur and the death rate in the diseases is 55 per cent. The release also stated, it has also come to light that medicines for the disease are not easily available in the markets. Duplicate medicines are being given to patients and it is not clear if the deaths of patients are due to duplicate medicines or the disease. Beds are insufficient in hospitals and duplicate medicines’ rackets are thriving. The medicines are far from the reach of patients. It is important to call for regular report from district collectors on black fungus and on the availability of medicines and to ensure proper treatment offered to the patients. Commission also stated that a complaint was filed by Rajya Sabha MP, Vivek Tankha and the report has been sought on six different points from the government. MPHRC also asked how many patients of coronavirus and black fungus were found in MP between May 9 and May 18 and the number of patients who died due to not getting proper treatment, medicines or injections. “What were the measures initiated to ensure that medicines should be easily available for the patients. How many FIRs were registered for black marketing of drugs used in these diseases? What is the action initiated to stop black marketing of drugs? What is the total number of beds available in districts for these diseases? Whether beds are less than number of patients in any district and what was the alternative arrangement made in the districts,” the commission asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/rights-body-seeks-report-on-black-fungus-cases-storage-of-medicines/articleshow/82750700.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Eatala Rajender raises Gangula Kamalakar’s illegal granite biz||HYDERABAD: The ongoing fight between ousted health minister Eatala Rajender and BC welfare minister Gangula Kamalakar has escalated into a full-blown verbal war over the latter’s granite quarries in erstwhile Karimnagar district. While Eatala alleged that Kamalakar had destroyed the natural resources of the district by indiscriminate quarrying and also evaded paying taxes, the minister said vigilance enquiries had established that granite quarries owned by him were running legally. Addressing a press conference in Huzurabad, Eatala alleged that the minister was threatening the local elected representatives that they won’t get payment of bills for the works done by them in the constituency if they support him. “My dear bidda (son, referring to Kamalakar), remember power is not permanent. Karimnagar has become a cemetery (due to indiscriminate quarrying). I know how you have evaded government taxes and I will reveal it at an appropriate time. You got the post (minister) due to recommendations and you will face the same situation after 2023 when you won’t be in power,” Eatala said. After Eatala’s removal from the cabinet over alleged encroachment of assigned lands in Masaipet mandal in Medak district, Kamalakar, who represents Karimnagar assembly constituency, has been attacking the former and speaking to local leaders and elected representatives not to cross over to Eatala camp. In less than two hours after Eatala’s press conference, Kamalakar also held a media conference. He challenged Eatala, who is talking about pride, to resign from his MLA post which he had won on TRS party symbol. “The ex-minister said he would quit the MLA post after discussing with his supporters, but he is not resigning and is only meeting BJP and Congress leaders.” The minister said: “I have been running my businesses since 1985 before even Eatala became an MLA and I have never abused power like him. If he can prove that I had evaded taxes, I am ready to pay five times of the total amount.” He said the ongoing probe into Eatala’s Jamuna Hatcheries confirmed that he had encroached upon assigned and endowments land. He should hand over the land to the government. “As many as 30 illlegal quarries belonging to Tamil Nadu traders are running in Huzurabad constituency. Why did not Eatala stop illegal quarrying in his constituency,” the minister wondered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/eatala-raises-gangulas-illegal-granite-biz/articleshow/82748839.cms||Koride Mahesh

The wedding was cancelled and several relatives of the groom booked for murder and rioting, said police. Ram Kumar Kashyap, a resident of Bahedi area of Bareilly district, had fixed his daughter’s wedding with the son of Lalta Prasad of Bakarganj village in Nawabganj. On Monday, Ram Kumar, along with his brother-in-law Mansharam Kashyap, and other relatives had gone to attend the ‘tilak’ ceremony in Bakarganj, said police, adding that most of the guests from both sides were high on alcohol when they fought over the plates. Bhagwandas, a close relative of the groom, and four others attacked Ram Kumar and his guests, said police, adding that Bhagwandas stabbed Mansharam to death, while four others were injured in the brawl. Additional SP (rural) Rajkumar Agarwal said, “We have registered an FIR against Bhagwandas and four others for murder and rioting.

---||Delhi||Green furnaces at 3 crematoria run by north corpn to use 75% less wood||NEW DELHI: With new platforms, addition of eco-friendly furnaces and expansion of existing facilities, the infrastructure at Delhi’s crematoria has seen rapid expansion due to the pandemic in the past one year. North Delhi Municipal Corporation is now setting up brick-laden closed furnaces for cremating bodies at three of its Covid-designated sites. These furnaces use one-fourth of the wood that a conventional open pyre requires and the time taken to cremate a body will also be less. Mayor Jai Prakash said the construction work had started and six — two furnaces at each site — will be built initially at Panchkuian Road, Inderpuri and Mangolpuri cremation grounds. Officials say the metal lining and closed environment of the furnace helps in raising the temperature up to 1,000 degrees Celsius, which cremates a body in 1-1.5 hours while using less than 1 quintal wood. A normal cremation required four-five quintal wood. The mayor said the units would help in protecting environment by reducing the wood usage while smoke-capturing units could be placed on the chimney to reduce pollution. While the city witnessed the peak of funerals of Covid victims around April-end, more than 2,000 quintal wood was being consumed daily for Covid funerals alone. The corporations had to seek assistance from the forest department and neighbouring states to meet the demand. Recently, IIT-Ropar has come up with improved features for crematoria furnaces for better efficiency and some of these features will be incorporated in new furnaces, officials say. East Delhi Municipal Corporation will also open a CNG crematorium with two furnaces at Ghazipur in the next couple of days. Mayor Nirmal Jain said the first CNG unit in east Delhi was operationalised at Karkardooma two weeks ago. The overall crematoria infrastructure in the capital has been vastly improved during the pandemic. Before 2020, Delhi had CNG crematoria at two sites (Nigam Bodh Ghat and Punjabi Bagh) and an electric crematorium at Sarai Kale Khan, which was used for unclaimed bodies. New CNG furnaces have been opened at places like Karkardooma, Green Park and Subhash Nagar. South Delhi Municipal Corporation is also planning to upgrade the Sarai Kale Khan cremation ground as the key facility of the city with 150 traditional platforms, CNG furnaces and two existing electric furnaces.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/green-furnaces-at-3-crematoria-run-by-north-corpn-to-use-75-less-wood/articleshow/82750774.cms||Paras Singh
---||Hyderabad||ROAD TO RECOVERY: BEATING THE CORONAVIRUS||Story-1 Our children took charge; became our caregivers D Kanthi Sudha I Coordinator (Admissions) at VNR Vignan Jyothi Institute of Engineering and Technology It was supposed to be a day of highs when I got my Covid positive result. So even as I was honoured and awarded on an online event, during the day, and received an email stating that I had cleared my PhD colloquium, I still felt very low. The timing of the happy moment seemed flawed. Worse, I couldn’t even hug my daughter who had just got an article published and was over the moon. Keeping with protocol, I isolated myself in a room instead, along with my husband who’d also tested positive – leaving our two kids to fend for themselves. Little did I know that my 12-year-old daughter was all ready to be Covid warrior. Soon, she stepped in and took charge of the situation, taking care of us as well as her seven-year-old brother. While my close relatives were kind enough to provide food for us, the kids took up the mantle of running the rest of the house by themselves – without any fear. It is their fighting spirit that kept me motivated through the days thereafter, helping me stay positive about recovering from the illness soon. It helped me stay sane and not get hassled with the unwarranted information/opinions that landed on your phone every day – some judgmental and ridden with social stigmas about contracting Covid – most of which were baseless and forwarded without any cross-checking. Messages from close friends and family, however, proved to be a blessing in disguise. It renewed our hopes of recovery. “All is well” was the chant I used, whenever I tested the oxygen levels. Sharing my Covid experience with my colleagues who had tested positive after me, guiding them, assuring them -- all this subconsciously enabled me to get onto the road to recovery. Having lived through it, I am now trying to get my vaccine shot at the earliest! Pic Caption 1: Kanthi Sudha Pic Caption 2: Kanthi seen here with her children, Manyoktha and Vikhyath ….................. Story-2 Comfort of my home, mum’s food saw me through Anusha Devireddy I Class 12 student During the first wave of Covid-19, I was on the other side of the fence. Moved by images of people in distress I started a fundraising and awareness campaign by making tie-dye T-shirts and selling them on a website I had created. By the end of the campaign, I had raised as much as Rs 60,000 and donated it to the United Nations Refugee Agency that was helping refugees affected by the pandemic by distributing relief items and ensuring they were allowed to seek asylum despite the closure of borders. While working on this campaign, I never thought I would contract Covid-19, as I had was always very careful and abided by all precautionary measures. Cut to the second wave and towards the end of April, I suddenly felt extremely weak with horrible headaches, one day. Guessing it was a symptom, my family got tested. I was positive though my parents tested negative. Thus began the arduous journey being isolated in my room for 14 days. But while it was disconcerting initially, I thought about the displaced people who I had worked with closely and remembered – from my first-hand experience – how badly the pandemic had impacted them. I was at least fortunate enough to be isolated in the comfort of my own home and have access to my mother’s nutritious food for every meal. Being isolated also taught me the importance of time. During my time in isolation, my mind always pondered over how I had got infected since I rarely stepped out and always followed precautions. However, as the days progressed, I told myself that it didn’t matter how I got infected since it was impossible for me to go back in time and change it. I’d rather live in the present and embrace it. So, in the last couple of days of being isolated, I re-watched my favorite movies, painted, read a book and made sure I lived in the present and enjoyed my time. That’s the only way to beat this virus. Pic Caption 1: At 16, Anusha is passionate about Economics and Computer Science and plans to major in Finance Pic Caption 2: The t-shirts she made to share funds during the pandemic ............................................ Story-3  Family bond stronger than Covid-19 T Chakrika I Class 10 student Just as the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic engulfed the entire country, it made inroads into our house as well with my father, my sister and I testing positive, putting the onus of taking care of the household on my mother. We had read many stories of people being infected around us and in the newspapers. However, we only understood the gravity when it hit us. Initially, my sister and I developed fever and cough. As soon as we were tested positive, we got our act together and adopted Covid-19 protocols such as home isolation, wearing masks, taking steam, consuming hot water and household remedies such as ‘kaadha’, monitoring of temperature and oxygen saturation levels. As advised by our parents, we stopped surfing social media, focused on breathing exercises, a regular diet and taking rest. As we completed eight days of isolation, my father developed Covid-19 symptoms and was tested positive. He too isolated himself in another bedroom as the onus of taking care of the family fell on my mother. As three of us were tested positive, our flat was out of bounds for the apartment residents. Our neighbours pitched in to help us with fruits and cooked meals, our apartment watchman helped us in getting all other essential items on a daily basis. We kept ourselves together, mentally strong and helped and comforted each other for 20 days of our isolation. It was only through the bond that we share and the support that we received from our neighbours and the society members that helped us recover faster.

This is because the work productivity at the project sites has dropped significantly over the past few weeks due to exodus of migrant workers in the wake of the lockdown. TOI has learnt that 80-85% of workers at both the sites have already returned to their home states or districts, a clear indication that the situation is going to get worse in the coming days. While the six-lane 780m underpass due for completion in June may get delayed by at least a month, the 697-m-long flyover over the Parthala roundabout at the junction of Vikas Marg and the under-construction Faridabad-Noida-Ghaziabad Expressway (FNG) is likely to miss its December 2021 deadline.As against an earlier labour force of 150, some 20-25 workers are currently working at the Sector 71 intersection site. Authority officials, however, said the contractor is arranging new workers. “No doubt work has been affected by the lockdown, but we have not changed any deadline for any project. Contractors are arranging new workers. We are still trying to complete the underpass by June 30,” said Mukesh Vaish, senior manager from work circle 6.The six-lane flyover over Parthala roundabout, which saw construction in January this year, is also facing labour crunch. Against 70-80 workers deployed earlier, 15-20 are left for now, according to sources. “Between May 1 and 14, there were only 15-30% workers. But now we are increasing the labour force. We expect to meet the December 2021 deadline,” Vaish said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/labour-shortage-hits-two-key-infra-projects-in-city/articleshow/82752651.cms||Meenakshi Sinha

With availability of multifold D-type oxygen cylinders and their timely refilling from concerned oxygen plants and authorised vendors, the UT administration now has 24-hour oxygen backup for the Sector 48 hospital and eight-hour backup for GMCH-32 and GMSH-16. Yashpal Garg, nodal officer of oxygen supplies in UT Chandigarh, said they have also increased the daily oxygen quota of private hospitals and mini-Covid-19 care centres. The backup of oxygen supplies for government hospitals has been created as there was high demand and supply of the same. There was no backup in case of any emergency. Therefore, steps were initiated to create a back-up. Now, the Sector 48 hospital has 24-hour back-up and GMCH-32 and GMSH-16 have eight-hour back-up. Garg said they are regularly in touch with Panchkula and Mohali authorities for oxygen supply in case of emergency. In the recent review meeting, officials submitted that at GMCH-32, apart from the oxygen generated by the recently installed PSA plant, the daily consumption of liquid oxygen is more than 10 metric tonnes (MT) per day. Presently, there are 130 D-type cylinders and arrangements are being done to increase the number to 200. Similarly, at Sector 48 hospital, the daily oxygen consumption is around 3 MT per day. Presently, there are 218 D-type cylinders, which will be reduced to 150 cylinders after shifting them to GMCH-32.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ut-creates-o2-back-up-for-govt-hosps-in-emergency/articleshow/82750705.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

There are reports coming from many areas where wheat got soaked in the rain outside acquisition centres, while farmers waited in queues. There are also complaints that wet wheat is not being accepted at the purchasing centres.” In a second tweet, Nath said, “I demand that the state government immediately issue necessary guidelines to buy the drenched wheat and provide relief to farmers who are already facing a host of problems due to the Covid-19 pandemic.” Nath said that since there were warnings by the weather department in advance, the wheat lying outside the purchasing centres should have been shifted to safer places. “This is gross negligence and responsibility must be fixed.

Chemists/stockists and dealers of medicines are putting all effort to support the government to make available essential life-saving medicines to the public,” said A N Mohan, president AKCDA. He said that most stockists are working with limited staff as public transport is suspended and supply schedules are disrupted. “We are neither getting collections nor able to deposit the cash collections as banks are operating with 25% staff and have limited their operations up to 1pm,” he said. AKCDA has also sought the help of the drug controller to address this issue. “The companies should allow a minimum of 15 days extended credit period to their stockists to enable them to stock and sell essential medicines to the suffering people. Our plea is that they should not withhold supplies because of bouncing of cheques. They should also authorize stockists to pass on bonus schemes to the small players too so that they are not deprived of the benefits.” Mohan said that most medical stores are working with single staff. It is difficult to deposit money when people come down during the relaxation time to buy medicines. “Shops in containment zones and the triple lockdown period are facing a difficult time. Ensuring that medicines are available for customers is our priority now,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/chemists-body-calls-for-credit-extension/articleshow/82748881.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

Rathore made the statement on Monday while reacting to government’s efforts to make a trauma centre in Sitapur operational. Talking to TOI, Rathore said, he considered himself weak and could be slapped with a sedition case if he dared to speak up. Rathore, however, did not specify as to speaking against whom could attract action. “No one can understand my feeling. But yes, I do feel helpless and weak,” he said. In a video that has gone viral on social media, Rathore is heard saying: “Vidhayakon ki haisiyat kya hai? Hum zyada kahenge to deshdroh, rajdroh humpe bhi to lagega (What is the status of an MLA? If we speak too much, we will have to face sedition charges).” Rathore has questioned his party’s actions in the past too and has even been sidelined for his statements. Last year, he was served a notice by the party after he was allegedly heard saying in a viral audio clip that the idea of beating plates to defeat the coronavirus was “breaking the record for foolishness”. He was purportedly questioning the call made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to bang ‘thalis’ and light earthen lamps during the first wave of coronavirus pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-mlas-weak-will-face-sedition-charge-if-they-speak/articleshow/82752682.cms||---

All the issues related to the PGI are taken up by the administration at the highest level and resolved after necessary consultation. During the last hearing, Dr Kang had submitted that the present system of distribution of Remdesivir and Tocilizumab injections through the health department ensures transparency and also checks hoarding and black-marketing by unscrupulous elements. She had submitted that, “On May 7, a query was put by the HC as to whether drugs could be provided through a government controlled drug centre, preferably at GMSH-16 on payment basis against prescriptions. The matter was examined and it was informed that the present chemist shop at GMSH-16 is being run by private entity and there is no government control or government-run chemist shop at the hospital.” She had also submitted that, “The control and supply of Remdesivir and Tocilizumab is being looked after by the health department.

Of the total, 1,096 deaths that occurred more than a week ago, as part of a data reconciliation exercise, were added to the total toll in the last two days. The remaining 1,195 deaths occurred on Monday (516) and Tuesday (679) and were reported as part of the daily Covid bulletin sent by the state. The cumulative toll on Tuesday rose to 83,777 from 81,486 on Sunday. The state has also not given bifurcation of districts from where these deaths have been added. Dr Avinash Supe, former dean of KEM Hospital, Parel, who is a member of the state task force on Covid deaths, said data reconciliation of the toll is making analysis difficult. “We need good analysis so we can prepare our infrastructure accordingly (for the third wave). Maharashtra didn't suffer with oxygen and medicine requirements as much as other states did because we had prepared as per the previous analysis,” he said. A senior public health department official said delayed death reporting by hospitals has been raised at the highest level. “We are planning to ask hospitals to report deaths within 48 hours,” said the official. This is not the first time such large-scale reconciliation has been done. 1,328 old deaths were added to the cumulative toll in June last year after a statewide reconciliation exercise. Meanwhile, with deaths continuing to remain high in the 18 days of May, the state has added nearly 15,000 deaths, the highest addition in a month so far, ahead of last month’s total of 13,000-plus. Meanwhile, due to fewer tests conducted on Monday due to cyclonic weather, the state reported 28,438 cases. With this, the state’s total caseload rose to 54.3 lakh. Mumbai recorded its lowest daily caseload in more than two months as 961 tested positive on Tuesday. The city too had fewer tests conducted – 17,920 as against 28,000 on an average. AMC Suresh Kakani said the low patient load has allowed them to take the job of refurbishing the three jumbo centres at Dahisar, BKC and Mulund. “We will operationalise them by June 1. We have given contractors a shorter timeline of 10 days to finish all repair work, so that we are ready to admit patients before monsoon,” he said. The number of deaths, too, dipped marginally to 44, taking the overall toll in Mumbai to 14,316 since March 2020. Public health minister Rajesh Tope said patients suffering from mucormycosis will be treated for free under the Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana till September 30. Looking at the rise in incidence, the state has committed that the 1,000-odd hospitals empanelled under the scheme will treat the infection. Eleven surgical and eight medical packages are now available for treatment of mucormycosis, he said. He said antifungal medicines will be provided free in these hospitals. However, the medical fraternity has said more hospitals need to be empanelled in the scheme. Meanwhile, Thane city saw only 172 cases on Tuesday, with 8 deaths. In a positive sign, the Centre said there were 24 districts in the state that were showing a decline in cases for the last two weeks. Also, districts like Pune, Nashik and Nagpur that were hotspots for the last few months have reported a significant dip , said the Union health ministry. Meanwhile, active cases in the state continued to drop. On Tuesday, they dropped to 4.1 lakh, of which 31,790 were in Mumbai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/state-adds-1096-earlier-deaths-toll-now-83777/articleshow/82756573.cms||Bhavika Jain

---||Nagpur||State to provide Rs4L to Tauktae victims’ families: Min||Nagpur: Maharashtra relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar on Tuesday declared Rs4 lakh aid from the government to the victims’ families affected by the cyclone Tauktae that battered the coasts of Mumbai and Konkan and led to loses to life and property.He said the government would be rushing a letter to the Centre to immediately send its team to conduct a survey and declare help. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray would be talking to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in this regard.“I convened a meeting of all district collectors from the cyclone-hit districts and directed to provide all help to the affected families, like providing them temporary shelters as early as possible. Still, over 600 villages are cut off due to uprooted trees that are blocking the roads, along with felled electric polls. Efforts are on through the State Disaster Relief Force (SDRF) to reach these villages to help stranded citizens,” he told TOI.In order to avoid frequent power supply disruption due to cyclones in the coastal areas, the minister said he had moved a proposal to the CM to lay underground cables at such places. “Last time when a similar calamity struck these areas, it took a couple of months to restore the electricity there. There are also chances of loss of lives and property due to overhead wires. I had discussed the proposal in detail with the CM,” he said.Explaining the preparations taken by the government to maintain supply to Covid-19 hospitals, the Bramhapuri MLA said in their review meeting under the CM, they had instructed to have a power backup in the form of generators at all such centres for at least two days with sufficient diesel supply.Wadettiwar announced a help of Rs50,000 per hectare to the farmers, whose fruit orchards were damaged due to the cyclone. “In Konkan, a portion of the population survives on selling fruits. If their trees are uprooted by strong winds and thunderstorms, it would take at least five to seven years for a new tree to grow. We’re trying to compensate for their losses through our horticulture and other departments.”Admitting that Tauktae had caused massive damage to coastal areas like Sindhudurg, Ratnagiri, Raigad, Thane, Palghar and Mumbai districts, the minister said hardware stores would continue to operate amid restrictions with a view to help affected families to rebuild their homes. He directed principal secretary Asim Gupta and other subordinates to submit a preliminary estimate of the loss immediately to declare aid to the victims.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/state-to-provide-rs4l-to-tauktae-victims-families-min/articleshow/82750814.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Generate your power bill via WhatsApp, pay online||LUCKNOW: With coronavirus pandemic affecting doorto-door handheld billing of power consumers, the state energy department has decided to allow consumers to get their bills generated by sending photographs of the electricity meter readings on the phone numbers of executive engineers (XEN) concerned, sub-divisional officers (assistant engineers), junior engineers or the regular meter readers. Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited superintending engineer and incharge of electricity billing and collection, RK Jain, said a formal order would be issued soon. He said consumers would be required to send their electricity account number along with the photograph of the current meter reading on the WhatsApp number of XENs, SDOs/JEs/meter readers concerned. “The photograph sent by the consumers will be uploaded on the system which would generate the bill. The bill will be sent to the consumer through SMS. The consumers can pay their bills online,” he said. Officials said consumers who are unable to note the meter reading can make a five-minute video of the meter and send it to the power official concerned. The measure improves upon the system which was put in place during the first Covid-19 wave – while the handheld billing was stopped, consumers were asked to reach the sub-station with a photograph/video of their meter reading. The move comes amid reports of revenue recovery of UPPCL getting hit, with many meter readers, who go from house to house to generate electricity bills, contracting Covid. Officials said the phenomenon was largely reported in April when Covid cases rose sharply. In Purvanchal distribution alone, bills of nearly 4 lakh consumers, mainly those having nonsmart meters, could not get the bill. So was the case with other distribution companies, including Madhyanchal, Kesco and Paschimanchal. Jain said the new measure will be in addition to the existing system where a consumer can self-generate a fresh bill if the previous month bill is correct. He said that the facility is also available on e-nivaran portal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/generate-your-power-bill-via-whatsapp-pay-online/articleshow/82752726.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Lokayukta stops ‘miracle’ herbal cure for Covid in Nellore village||Hyderabad: Andhra Pradesh Lokayukta Justice P Lakshmana Reddy directed Nellore district collector KVN Chakradhar Babu to take immediate steps to prevent crowding of people in a village in Muthukur mandal running after a ‘miracle Ayurvedic cure’ touted to cure Covid-19. Following orders from the collector, officials of health, revenue and panchayat raj departments along with a team of Ayurvedic doctors visited Krishnapatnam village and stopped distribution of the ‘medicine’ immediately. They also collected samples of the herbal substance distributed by Borigi Anandaiah, who was preparing and administering it to thousands of people, and sent them to the state Ayurvedic lab in Vijayawada for a detailed examination. Following airing of news clips about thousands of people thronging the village and throwing caution to the winds by not adhering to social distancing and not wearing masks, the judge stepped in and issued the orders. In a report furnished to the Lokayukta by the collector, Anandaiah, who was dispensing the medicine for free, is not a qualified professional in Ayurvedic medicine. The formula he narrated to the officials does not form part of any standard preparation modes used in making Ayurvedic medical recipes. “He is using some herbs and adopting substandards methods to prepare the herbal substance. As he was administering the liquid medicine as eye drops, the officials warned that this may, in the long run, adversely affect the eyesight of those who used it. The inspection team told Anandaiah that he cannot distribute the medicine without getting a permission from the relevant government agency. The team of officials, who forwarded the report to the Ayush commissioner, asked Anandaiah to stop distribution of the medicine forthwith. The team also interacted with the people who came to the village for the Ayurvedic cure. “Different medicines were given by Anandaiah to those who tested positive and to those who did not have the virus. There were eye drops also made from the substance that will enhance the oxygen levels instantly and some people have deposed before the inquiry team that their O2 levels have gone up after the administration of the drops in their eyes,” the report said. The collector informed the Lokayukta that he would furnish a detailed report after the arrival of the lab report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/lokayukta-stops-miracle-herbal-cure-for-covid-in-nellore-village/articleshow/82748896.cms||---

The condition of four of the injured is stated to be critical with one of them losing an eye in the attack. The attack has once again brought to the fore the problem of man-leopard conflict. These big cats that dwell in the fringes of forests are being forced to come closer to human habitats due to deforestation and shrinking of grasslands that has resulted in depletion of herbivores, the natural prey of the leopards. The leopards that attacked the residents of Mustapur village are suspected to have strayed out of the forests of neighbouring Uttarakhand. Village head Raees Ahmad said, “Islam and his brother, Insaaf, were walking towards an orchard when the leopards attacked them. They ran towards the village, shouting for help. As people working in the fields nearby rushed to help, they too were attacked.” Surrounded by people, the leopards lashed out at them to make way to flee. Moradabad’s divisional forest officer (DFO) Kanhaiya Patel said, “Looks like the leopards have moved towards the social forestry area. Forest team will stay in the village for the next two days.” In Lakhimpur Kheri district, post cane harvest leaves the leopards exposed, making them vulnerable and nervous that leads to attacks on humans. That is what happened to a youth who went to the field on Tuesday morning in Isanagar area of the district. He came face to face with a lurking leopard and was mauled. It attacked a forest watcher who had come with a team to comb the area. While some 500 villagers have gheraoed the fields to kill the leopard hiding there, the forest department is struggling to save it. DFO Dudhwa (buffer) Anil Patel told TOI, “The condition of the watcher and the youth is stable. We are making efforts to minimize man-animal conflict in the area.” A similar encounter took place on Tuesday in Shahjahanpur’s Chapabhojhi village on Tuesday situated on the fringes of Khutar range of forests, where a leopard suddenly pounced on a 22-year-old girl who was cutting grass near a cane field. She used her sickle to fend off the animal but was injured. Meanwhile, a carcass of an adult leopardess was found in a field in Dhaurahra area of Lakhimpur Kheri district. Though cause of death will be confirmed after an autopsy, a man-leopard conflict could not be ruled out as cause of death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/man-leopard-conflict-leopards-stray-near-village-in-moradabad-battle-with-locals-injuring-9/articleshow/82743744.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Goa||3 days after Tauktae mayhem, power restored to 70% of Goa||PANAJI: Three days after Cyclone Tauktae decimated the state’s power supply system, over 70% of Goa had its supply restored, with electricity department personnel working round-the-clock to complete the remaining areas. Three workers in Curtorim and one in Sangolda suffered injuries after they fell from a height, and are in hospital, chief electrical engineer Raghuvir Keni told TOI. “Our people are onsite, working very hard to restore the (remaining) 30%. Almost all the high tension feeders have been restored except Corlim and Sancoale, where the towers have collapsed. These 30-metre towers were completely ripped by the cyclonic winds. Here, we have provided alternate power supply,” he said. Parts of Mapusa, Merces, several villages of Bardez, Santa Cruz and other urban and semi-urban areas continued to be in darkness for over 60 hours, while operations of banks and credit societies were hit in some parts of Bicholim town and surrounding villages. In Porvorim and Aldona, too, some areas had power, while others didn’t. In Bardez, fire services’ personnel used hydraulic cutters to clear the trees which had fallen on electric wires. Keni said the damage was large-scale and widespread, affecting everything from transformers, towers, high tension and low tension lines, and poles. Due to the Sancoale issue, the department rationed power supply to some industries and even to Goa International Airport, an official said. The officials said the vast destruction to the state’s power supply, distributed largely through an overhead line system, couldn’t even be compared to the 1994 cyclone. However, the department staff worked on, even though several linesmen, line helpers and their families are down with Covid and thus unable to help. “The restoration work will continue for a week, as the finishing touches will have to be given to the temporary work we had to do to restore power supply,” Keni said. Though the electricity department had requisitioned labourers from Maharashtra and Karnataka, less than 30 workers with electrical experience reached Goa. Officials said the manpower was less than expected. “External reinforcement of at least 15 workers are being flown in from Rajasthan by the 9:20am flight on Wednesday. Another contractor has promised to send 15 workers from Kolkata on Thursday,” an official said. “A lot of temporary work has to be strengthened and made permanent. It is impossible to finish all the work within three days. Besides other difficulties, our men have to overcome challenges of inaccessible terrain in many places,” the official said. He attributed the delay in restoration of power to the department concentrating on restoring high-tension feeders and then the low-tension feeders and the down-the-line supply to citizens, with over 1,000 poles damaged and workers having to restring the lines. In Salcete, power was restored in most parts. The Velim station, which supplies electricity to Carmona, is yet to be repaired, and was provided alternate supply. In Canacona, too, power came back in most areas including Shristhal, Gaondongrim and Cotigao, while work was in progress at Poinguinim and Agonda. Even Bicholim and the chief minister’s constituency, Sakhali, were yet to receive full supply. In many places, trees fell on power lines, causing obstructions. Mayem MLA Praveen Zantye said power supply has been restored in many areas in his constituency. “There are still problems in some areas like Shirgao, Chorao and Narvem,” he said. The official said the public, elected representatives and volunteers were reaching out to the department staff and providing them food and water and appreciating their work. But in Vasco, residents rushed to the electricity department office to vent their anger, but found the doors shut. A similar situation prevailed in Mapusa, where some wards got power quickly but Khorlim didn’t, compelling its residents to confront the department seeking to know when their power would be restored. In Anjuna and Calangute, too, residents marched to the department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/3-days-after-tauktae-mayhem-power-restored-to-70-of-goa/articleshow/82752715.cms||---

The general administration department has sanctioned Rs 28.30 lakh for setting up air conditioning and other electrical works in the water resources department in the Secretariat. As per the government order issued by the general administration (housekeeping) department, the funds will be used for air conditioning, setting up network connections and undertaking electrical works in the section of the water resources department, functioning on the ground floor of the Secretariat. Though such expenditures for maintenance of the Secretariat sections are not new, what is worth mentioning is the timing of undertaking such works. The government has been urging all government and other offices and commercial establishments to avoid air conditioning as the use of ACs and working for long hours in this closed atmosphere is considered to increase the chances of Covid-19 spread. And almost all government offices are functioning by switching off their cooling systems in current times. Even those wings in the Secretariat which are centrally air conditioned, like the finance wing, are functioning by switching off the air conditioning system. “There is nothing wrong in undertaking such works and the amount sanctioned may not be a large sum comparatively. But there is a degree of moral inappropriateness while spending for such purposes when the government is pooling funds for procuring vaccines, and cutting costs wherever possible,” a senior government official said. Last year too, the government was criticized for unjustified and extravagant spending when the state was going through a financial crisis, during the first wave of the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/govt-approves-rs-28l-for-fitting-acs-at-secretariat/articleshow/82748924.cms||KP Saikiran

Despite poor weather conditions a coast guard Chetak helicopter took off from Dabolim to rescue the two personnel. In the wake of Cyclone Tauktae, the west coast continues to record strong winds, squalls and restricted visibility. “The directorate general of light house and light ships informed us that two of their employees are stranded at the Vengurla Rock light house which has sustained damage during the cyclone Tauktae. Both the personnel were without water, food and electricity for the past three days,” said a Coast Guard official. “A coast guard helicopter was launched from Goa at 11am on Tuesday and it reached the island in 25 minutes. The area around the light house was rocky and did not provide any safe landing and winching area,” said the coast guard official. Taking a risk the pilots decided to hover above a small restricted open space with winds buffeting the helicopter. Both the stranded employees were winched up and taken onboard coast guard helicopter. The stranded personnel were flown to a pre-planned spot at Coast Guard air enclave, Dabolim and handed over to light house authorities in a healthy condition. A day earlier the Indian Coast Guard rescued a fishing boat ‘Milad’ with 15 crew onboard after the vessel got caught in the cyclone and suffered an engine breakdown close to the Redi coastline. The distressed fishing vessel was towed to Mormugao harbour for repairs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/workers-stuck-on-island-for-3-days-rescued/articleshow/82752759.cms||---

The three-round census will help find out exact data on nesting, roosting and breeding sites of the natural scavengers. The second round of the vulture census was proposed in May but Covid-19 pandemic delayed it. The census was planned for two-stages, pre-breeding and post-breeding. The pre-breeding exercise was done in mid-January. Mating and egg-laying takes place between October-December. By now, the vulture chicks would already be learning to fly. The baby vultures have a white, cottony band of feathers around the neck. This feature sets them apart from their parents and older pairs in the vulture colony. The next round of state-wide vulture census would count the chicks that survived. The surveyors plan to complete the second phase of the census before mid-June as the chicks would fly out of the nest to have an independent existence before monsoon. “I will write to the forest department shortly to let the census complete by May-end or first week of June,” said coordinator, Institute of Wildlife Sciences, Lucknow University, Prof Amita Kannaujia. Mostly, vultures lay a single egg and survival rate is very poor. The count of the chicks would show how many new ones have been added to the population. The second round would also help know how many of those counted in January were migratory. By now, the migratory population would have returned to their moorings at the higher altitude. The census using the GPS technique will give the first scientific data on vultures. The census is being done by the UP State Biodiversity Board and Institute of Wildlife Sciences, Lucknow University. Vultures are monogamous and form a pair after a long courtship. The habits and behaviour of each of the vulture species also vary. The census would help locate sites where different species of vultures nest, roost, mate and breed. The first round has counted maximum numbers in Maharajganj and Lalitpur but the exact findings would come after the comparison of the data of the two rounds of the exercise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/next-round-of-vulture-census-likely-in-june/articleshow/82752772.cms||Neha Shukla

Over time, this can take a serious psychological toll on them. Left unattended, sometimes this could pave the way for mental health problems like depression, addiction and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),” Singh said, adding that the session was aimed at inculcating a positive lifestyle with equal focus on mental as well as physical wellbeing of the police force. Popular clinical psychologist Prachi Khandeparkar and advocate Emidio Pinho addressed the participants and shared valuable tips to maintain physical and mental wellbeing. “By way of conducting such programmes, we wish to provide our staff with the opportunity to develop healthy coping skills and provide them with more tools to deal with the physical and psychological demands of their profession,” Singh added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/session-on-wellbeing-held-for-s-goa-cops/articleshow/82752765.cms||---

Popular figure on social media for his engaging videos creating awareness Covid, Dr Aggarwal was fully vaccinated more than 4 weeks ago. “Dr Aggarwal had a lot of co-morbidities. He was on a long-term immunosuppressant. So, it is possible he may have had a weak immune response to vaccination,” said Dr Ravi Wankhedkar, treasurer of the World Medical Association who worked closely with Dr Aggarwal. He said common people should not suspect the vaccine because it provides very good protection against infection and most importantly, against serious disease. “Doctors on field are more exposed to the Covid-19 virus and they are more at risk. So, they might get infected in large numbers. Total 270 doctors have died in the second wave till now. In the first wave, 736 deaths of doctors were reported. We are in process of ascertaining vaccination status of all,” said IMA general secretary Dr Jayant Lele. IMA has also created Covid Martyrs Fund and is helping the families of doctors who passed away in the line of duty. “Health workers and common people are altogether different categories. In fact, the Health Department of the Government of India and various states should maintain data of HCWS affected and died due to Covid with their vaccination status. Unfortunately, the government is not doing it. Hence IMA is trying to collect this data,” said Dr Wankhedkar. If separate data were maintained, it would show the mortality post-vaccination is negligible in non-medicos who don’t get exposed to coronavirus in a hospital setup. This will also create a positive notion about vaccination, which is the only remedy we have in hands to deal with Covid-19. “IMA data show deaths of doctors are declining in the second wave, despite the wave being more intense and doctors working in more challenging conditions. This shows vaccine is working. We must not fall prey to fake news about vaccine efficacy,” said Dr Sandesh Bhavik, who recovered from Covid-19 recently after suffering breakthrough (post vaccination) infection. TOI had reported on Monday about the breakthrough infections in doctors in Nagpur city. Many well-known senior doctors in the city got infected in the second wave and recovered quickly without severe complications. They stated that they felt positive effects of the vaccine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/dont-let-dr-aggarwals-death-shake-faith-in-vax-say-docs/articleshow/82750923.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Of the total 6,000 kits distributed daily, 30-35% would be set aside for the rural areas.According to officials, the kits are being distributed for the past three weeks. “We are urging people to start taking medicines soon after Covid symptoms are seen. Medicines have been given to community health centres and primary health centres for distribution. All center in-charges have been asked to prioritise screening and treatment of people with symptoms,” said a senior health official.Last week, Gautam Budh Nagar had also decided to ramp up testing in rural areas of the district after several deaths of people with Covid-like symptoms were reported. A 48-hour drive was launched to test all villagers with symptoms and contacts of Covid patients.Meanwhile, from 21% on May 12, the positivity rate in Ghaziabad is down to 4%. According to health department data, 591 Covid cases were reported on May 12 and 2,855 tests were conducted.

It pointed out to a municipality-owned premises at Malbhat, on land acquired for a pick-up stand, having sufficient number of rooms, that could be used as a vaccination centre or for any other related activity. The MMC ground having large halls, and BPS Club in Pajifond, Margao, are the other two locations suggested by the Shadow Council. “With nearly 2,500 positive cases under the Margao urban health centre alone, it turns out to be a desperate situation when patients, particularly Madgaokars, call for help to get admission in a hospital in Margao, and we can do nothing for them. SCM hopes the representatives assist the authorities in setting up the much needed additional facilities,” Savio Coutinho of the Shadow Council said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/3-covid-care-sites-available-in-margao/articleshow/82752815.cms||---
---||Delhi||Covid-19 in Delhi: 14-day isolation for 60 monkeys before ‘vanvas’||NEW DELHI: After eight lions tested positive for Covid-19 at Hyderabad zoo two weeks ago, Delhi forest department has quarantined nearly 60 monkeys recently caught in south Delhi. The simians will be released in Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary after they complete 14 days of isolation. The monkeys were caught from areas where Covid-19 cases were reported and the forest department decided to quarantine them as a precautionary measure. Forest officials said no monkey has shown symptoms of infection and they subjected the random animals to rapid antigen tests, which all returned negative results. Deputy conservator of forests (South) Amit Anand said, “As the lions had tested positive for Covid, we are taking preventive measures while releasing the captured monkeys in Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary. After South Delhi Municipal Corporation caught the monkeys from the areas where Covid cases have been reported among humans, we quarantined the simians at an animal rescue centre in Tughlaqabad. We conduct regular health checkups, and not one monkey has shown Covid symptoms. A few random samples tested negative. Of the 60 monkeys, we released the first batch of around 30 and the rest are under observation.” A forest official explained these precautions were being taken to ensure that the monkeys did not transmit Covid to other animals in the sanctuary. Among the wild animals found at Asola are leopards, nilgais, jackals and porcupines. “Our usual release spot for monkeys is near Neeli Jheel, but we are releasing these monkeys at another waterbody to prevent their mixing with the wild animals there,” the official said. “We are also preparing another feeding place for relocated monkeys near the water point.” According to a 2018 status report submitted in Delhi High Court, Asola Bhatti has approximately 25,000 monkeys, many of them transferred there from the capital since 2007 following a high court order. Forest officials claimed that nearly 2,500kg of food is provided to monkeys each day, with nearly Rs 8 lakh a month being spent on this. “For estimating the current population of monkeys within the sanctuary, we propose to conduct a census this year,” disclosed an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/14-day-isolation-for-60-monkeys-before-vanvas/articleshow/82750946.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Goa||Govt to HC: Let workers enter without -ve cert||Panaji: The Goa government on Tuesday sought relaxation from the negative RT-PCR certificate requirement for travellers entering Goa every day for work from districts in the neighbouring states. Although the court said it will pronounce its order in the matter on Wednesday, it stated that it was in favour of the government setting a protocol to regulate the entry of workers into Goa. Advocate general Devidas Pangam told the high court that Goa is similar to Delhi where people travelling to work was concerned. Pangam said Delhi relies on this workforce and on people in adjoining states that lay in proximity of its boundaries. In Goa, on the other hand, there are boundaries, but these are not real boundaries, Pangam said as he explained that the government could not create hurdles between Goa and Sindhudurg (Maharashtra) and Goa and Karwar (Karnataka). To the government’s submission that travellers testing positive constitute 0.1% of total active cases and that they wouldn’t be burdening the state’s healthcare system, an advocate for the petitioners said that it was unclear who the government has characterised as travellers in its daily Covid-19 bulletin. He argued that no monitoring or testing has been taking place at the borders and that this is not an insignificant and inaccurate representation of the number of people who have come into the state and have tested positive for Covid-19. He added that it was not explained who has been categorised as travellers in the health bulletin. Another advocate said that besides workers of the pharma sector and manufacturing medical equipment, the entry of the rest could be deferred till Goa’s Covid-19 positivity rate decreased. “We don’t know what other strains of Covid-19 could come. There is a need for caution,” he said, adding that it has been said that dangerous mutant strains entered Goa through the bordering states. The bench stated that it has not prevented any worker from coming into the state and added that its order states that people carry a negative RT-PCR certificate and then enter. An advocate also quoted the head of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Dr Balram Bhargava, who stated that lockdown restrictions should remain in place in all districts where the rate of infection is above 10% of those tested. “Goa has a positivity rate of 40%,” he submitted. He further submitted that not insisting on a Covid-19 negative certificate all this while has led to Goa going from the green zone to where it is today . To the government’s contention that symptomatic persons would not travel to Goa and would either remain in isolation or be treated in their home state, the advocate submitted that if all symptomatic persons were to isolate, the spread of Covid-19 could have been contained without imposing mask-wearing or a lockdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-to-hc-let-workers-enter-without-ve-cert/articleshow/82752817.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Telemedicine now backbone of treatment as patients avoid OPD||KOLKATA: With patients choosing to stay away from outpatient departments (OPD) fearing Covid transmission, online consultations — an improvisation forced by the pandemic last year — have made a roaring comeback. Most leading private hospitals have revived their online platforms and started an awareness campaign among patients, advising them to switch to virtual meetings with doctors. OPD footfalls have dipped by 80% in some Kolkata hospitals over the last two weeks. AMRI Hospital has resuscitated its online consultation platform that had been created in April 2020. Around 50 doctors across its three units — Salt Lake, Dhakuria and Mukundapur — have already joined the programme and more could follow in the weeks to come, according to AMRI CEO Rupak Barua. “With OPD attendance down to 20%, we are now focused on online consultations. All that the patients have to do is call a helpline number and seek a slot. If they can’t select a doctor, our assistants will guide them,” said Barua. Around 150 patients now seek online consultation at AMRI and the number could rise 10 times in three weeks, he felt. With the decline in OPD numbers, RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) has ‘reverted back aggressively to online consultation as the most convenient method for patients to seek doctors consultation. “We are using radio creatives, the social media, our call centre and website apart from our NH care app to promote online consultations,” said RTIICS zonal head R Venkatesh. Around 35 doctors have enlisted for video consultations at Peerless Hospital. The number of patients remains low, but the authorities expect an explosion soon. “We have an easy online system of registering through our website. There is a payment gateway, where, once the money is received, the receipt and the time of appointment are sent to the patient,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. Digital consultations can be useful for patients who need to follow-up on their treatment, said AMRI Salt Lake consultant Debashish Saha. “I have been providing consultations on WhatsApp for several years now, especially to my diabetes patients. They provide me updates on their blood sugar counts and I alter medicine dosage accordingly. Now, we will have multiple online platforms at our disposal letting us reach out to more patients,” said Saha. Charges are reasonable. While AMRI has been charging Rs 1,500 for specialists and Rs 1,000 for the rest, Peerless has a blanket rate of Rs 700. “With the pandemic showing no signs of ebbing, online consultations will be the backbone of treatment,” said Mitra. Medica Superspecialty Hospital has reintroduced online consultation in late-April after shutting down its OPD. “All our doctors are doing it and we get around 100-120 patients a day. It starts at 9am and often continues beyond 10pm,” said chairperson Alok Roy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/telemedicine-now-backbone-of-treatment-as-patients-avoid-opd/articleshow/82748984.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Goa||Goa: Firewood donations pour in to help Margao crematorium tide over shortage||MARGAO: With Covid fatalities on the rise, crematoriums and cemeteries across the state are staring at a resource crunch. However, at the 110-year old Hindu crematorium at Margao, it’s an outpouring of humanity. Responding to an SOS call by the Mathagramasth Hindu Sabha after it faced severe scarcity of firewood for conducting funerals of the rising number of Covid-19 deceased, truckloads of firewood have been arriving at the Pajifond crematorium everyday over the past few days, and many local youths have been coming forward to assist the kin of the deceased during the performance of last rites. “It’s by the grace of Dambab (presiding deity of Margao) and magnanimity of Goans that everything has been going smooth,” says Pandurang Naik, president of the Mathagramasth Hindi Sabha, who is popularly called ‘Bhai Naik’. “I am now flooded with calls from persons wishing to send truckloads of firewood from different parts of Goa. Just this morning, a caller from Curchorem said he is sending 10 truckloads, while yesterday another from Sanguem sent two truckloads of firewood.” Labourers are now engaged in cutting the timber into smaller stumps and stacking them in the two storage godowns inside the crematorium. Significantly, the sabha has thrown open its crematorium for cremation of Covid-19 bodies belonging to people of all faiths. While three pyres of the crematorium were earmarked for Covid-19 funerals during the first wave of the pandemic, four more were constructed earlier this month following a request to that effect from the district administration. Covid-19 funerals take place between 5pm and 6pm everyday. “During the initial phase of the pandemic last year, we had earmarked one funeral pyre for Covid-19 deaths when people were scared of conducting Covid-19 funerals. But as deaths increased, we made another two available for the authorities to conduct funerals on humanitarian grounds. However, making available even more pyres was difficult as other pyres are needed for conducting general funerals. So, we have now expanded the crematorium and constructed four more pyres,” Naik explained. However, the immediate task before the crematorium management is construction of a shed for the newly built four funeral pyres before the monsoon sets in. “I am sure we will be able to do it well before that,” Naik said. Cremation of unclaimed bodies by the Margao municipality also takes place at the Pajifond crematorium.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/firewood-donations-pour-in-to-help-margao-crematorium-tide-over-shortage/articleshow/82752833.cms||Govind Kamat Maad
---||Goa||Tauktae, a fallout of warming Arabian Sea region||Panaji: With climate change triggering extreme weather events in quicker succession than ever before, scientists view the very severe Tauktae (pronounced Tau’ te) cyclonic storm a fallout of ocean warming and also an indication of future calamituous events. A record eight cyclones - five in the quieter Arabian Sea and three in the usually raging Bay of Bengal - whipped up storms in the sub-continent during 2019. The trend continued in 2020 as five of these devastating wind-driven phenomena ripped through sea and land, driving home the grim reality. “More and more number of severe cyclonic storms are forming in the Arabian sea due to the unusual warming of the western equatorial Indian Ocean and southern Arabian Sea,” M R Ramesh Kumar, a meteorologist and retired chief scientist of the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) said. A recent study by NIO scientists has clearly indicated that this region will heat up in the near future, as indicated by predictions of several ocean atmospheric-coupled models. The study published in the journal Climate Dynamics indicated that Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) models project an ‘inhomogeneous anthropogenic’ (meaning, uncharesteristic environmental pollution originating from human activity) surface warming of the Indian Ocean by 2099 with “strongest warming in the Arabian Sea and Western equatorial Indian Ocean”. Previous studies have warned that this “Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)-like” warming pattern could yield more cyclones in the Arabian Sea. The study further showed that the warming of the Arabian Sea warming will be more than the Bay of Bengal in 80% of the model. Last year, in what was categorised as the very severe cyclonic storm, Nisarga wreaked havoc in Goa and other places and had formed in late May. It reached its peak in June boosting the onset of southwest monsoon. Tauktae this year sprung up even earlier. During the past 130 years there were 91 cyclones which formed during May - 63 in the Bay of Bengal and 28 in the Arabian Sea, Kumar said. “The last super cyclone in May 2020 was Amphan, but it had formed in Bay of Bengal on May 1 and dissipated on May 21.” The last two cyclones in the Arabian Sea were in May 2018, one was headed for the Gulf of Aden and Cycone Mekunu made landfall near Oman which was the strongest storm since 1959. The oceanic region nearer to the Indian subcontinent is already the warmer one. “In the global ocean scenario this region will be the warmest in future too, giving rise to more and more cyclonic storms,” Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tauktae-a-fallout-of-warming-arabian-sea-region/articleshow/82752838.cms||Paul Fernandes

If Covid is the cause of death, this should be clearly mentioned on the certificate, he added. The directive has come as a relief for those whose both parents or the sole bread winner have died, said a government spokesperson. “District magistrates and chief medical officers should ensure that on the death of Covid and non-Covid patients, death certificates are issued to families at the earliest. A government order would be issued immediately,” the CM said. He also directed officials to keep a check on private hospitals, which were fleecing patients. While this was against rules, it was also a crime against humanity in time of pandemic, the CM said. Strict action would be taken against such hospitals, he added. The government will also invoke National Security Act against any person caught hoarding or black marketing drugs like Remdesivir. Medics or paramedical staff found involved in such an activity would lose their degrees, the government spokesperson said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/dont-delay-issue-of-death-certs-cm/articleshow/82752825.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Son who sang to dying mom plans platform for bereaved||KOLKATA: Soham Chatterjee, the 24-year-old youngster who recently sang Kishore Kumar-Sushma Shrestha’s ‘Tera mujhse hai pehle ka naata koi’ as he bid his final farewell to his mother over phone, recorded a video of himself singing the same song and posted it online on Monday. The video moved many to tears and even made an impact on the likes of Indian stand-up comic, writer and poet Varun Grover and Bollywood actor Arjun Kapoor, who lost his mother nine years ago. Soham is now toying with the idea of starting an online platform for the bereaved. “One of the suggested names for a page is, ‘Loss Stories’. The posts will be run past a moderator before being shared,” he said. The only son of software engineer Dhurjati Chatterjee and psychologist Sanghamitra Chatterjee, Soham relocated to Kolkata last June after spending five months in Bengaluru. “Maa had a lot of co-morbidities. On May 5, we hospitalized her after her oxygen saturation dropped drastically,” he said. Her condition deteriorated and she lost the battle to the virus in a week’s time. Around 12 hours before Sanghamitra passed away, critical care doctor Dipshikha Ghosh of Apollo Gleneagles made the video call to Soham, who had then sung to his mother. Reliving that moment, Soham said, “I felt like the ground beneath was shifting. It was like I’d never get a chance to sing a song that defined our relationship. I hoped against hope that if she could hear me even once, she might come back, pulling off a miracle.” Soham’s voice got a little hoarse as he remembered how he sang that day. “I was crying before that. It was fine till I went to the stanza, ‘Dekho abhi…’ That’s when I broke down. Baba was standing right next to me and I said I couldn’t do it. He, too, sings well and his gestures implied that I had to complete the song for mom. That’s when I mustered up the courage to pull through,” he said. Soham doesn’t know if his mother could hear him sing. “She was unconscious for three days. Thankfully, she was kept in a supine position and so, I could see her face when I sang. I would love to believe she had heard me,” he said. Soham said this song defined his relationship with his mother. Hailing from a musical family—Pt Tarapada Chakraborty is his great-granduncle—he started receiving training in classical music from his mother and grandmother since he was four. “Maa was my music guru and this was our go-to song. More specifically, it was like our ‘abhimaan’ song she sang to melt my heart. At parties, when people asked ‘maa-chhele ekta gaan gaao’, she would hum ‘la la’ and I’d start with the first verse. She had other songs for lulling me to sleep.” Soham has mixed emotions when people applaud him for his resilience. “When I sang the song, I was not looking to send out any message or set an example. I was pushed against the wall and hoping for a miracle. It can’t say it is bittersweet for me when people now talk about my resilience because it is more bitter and less sweet. This is, too, expensive a trade-off. All this could have happened with her around.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/son-who-sang-to-dying-mom-plans-platform-for-bereaved/articleshow/82750957.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

With improved infrastructure, the doctors are trying their best to give quality care,” Rane said. Most of the patients were shifted to the new block last week as the GMC’s caseload increased manifold owing to the steep rise in infections since May 15. With all beds taken, patients had to be accommodated on the floor, wheelchairs and trolleys. The hospital’s administration also came under fire after more deaths were reported between 2am and 6am corresponding to the dips in oxygen supply from the central line. The government, however, refused to link the deaths to disruptions in oxygen supply – the problem has been now sorted out with the installation of the 20,000-kilo litres of oxygen tank – while Rane last week told reporters that the state must investigate why several people were dying between 2am and 6am.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rane-reviews-operations-at-superspecialty-block/articleshow/82752830.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Nirav Modi staffer’s bail plea rejected||Mumbai: A 46-year-old senior executive of Nirav Modi owned Firestar Group, Arjun Patil, arrested in 2018 in the Rs 6,498 crore Punjab National Bank scam, was denied interim bail sought on grounds that he was Covid positive and not receiving adequate care. The court held that the fact that he was admitted at GT Hospital, a “renowned” facility run by the state government”, did not support his complaints of inadequate care. Patil has been in jail since his arrest in February 2018. Seeking interim bail, Patil’s lawyer submitted he was falsely implicated and not a beneficiary of the alleged proceeds of the crime. It was also submitted that Patil was Covid positive on April 30 and moved to hospital. The lawyer submitted that Patil had lost tremendous weight, was suffering from weakness and was unable to take care of himself. It was claimed that his chances of recovery from weakness were very low, as jail authorities were not taking proper care of inmates. Poor hygiene conditions in jail were also cited.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/nirav-modi-staffers-bail-plea-rejected/articleshow/82752837.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Cablemen plead for Covid warrior status||KOLKATA: Cable operators have urged the chief minister to grant them frontline Covid warrior status so that their vaccination can be prioritized to protect them from the virus. Around 18 cable operators and their employees have succumbed to Covid in the second wave. Pointing out that they have been providing uninterrupted cable television and broadband service to 30 lakh households in Kolkata and over 1 crore households in the rest of the state, All Bengal Cable & Broadband Operators’ United Forum joint convenor Tapash Das said the industry desperately needed the government’s support in this hour of need. “We have risked our lives to ensure services all through the pandemic. During the lockdown last year, people depended on our services more than ever. Stranded at home, the only form of entertainment was cable. And work or study from home required stable internet service. We provided both. In the wake of the massive disruption caused by Amphan a year ago, the cablemen spent days and nights out in the streets, restoring services,” said Das. While they want the cablemen, most of them aged below 44 years, to be vaccinated, they are also concerned about customers’ refusal to go digital while making payments that has led to increased contact. Working with 50% men during lockdown and the current restriction, it means greater exposure for the few men at work. “It isn’t just our boys who can get infected while making house-to-house visits to collect subscription, they can also spread the infection as they come in contact with hundreds of households. There should be a concerted effort to push for digital payment to reduce the risk,” said Shankar Mondal, another co-convenor of the operators’ forum. Incidentally, the DTH industry does not face the problem as 95% of the payment is done online. Also, unlike DTH service providers, cable TV operators do not have any service charge for looking into problems that households may face in transmission. “In the cable industry, people make calls at the flimsiest opportunity,” said Chandranath Pyne, yet another co-convenor of the forum. Another worry for the operators is dues that have piled up with 10%-15% customers delaying payment for at least a month. At an average of Rs 250 per customer, the dues in Kolkata alone amounts to nearly Rs 7.5 crore to Rs 11.3 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cablemen-plead-for-covid-warrior-status/articleshow/82749003.cms||Subhro Niyogi

Back home, the brothers wondered if they contribute something somewhere against the free doses they got. The duo became the first among people who got free shots from government vaccination centres to contribute to the West Bengal State Emergency Relief Fund (WBSERF). “We availed of the service for free at a government hospital since no private facility is offering the second dose. So we thought why not contribute that amount somewhere,” said Bishnu Mittal, a spice trader. Son Ajay Mittal then suggested WBSERF. Like the Mittals, more recipients who could have afforded the vaccine at a private facility but have taken it from government hospitals have started chipping in. “Even as I feel that free vaccines should be availed only by people who cannot afford it, my mother and mother-in-law had to take their second dose from a government facility for free in the absence of supply in private hospitals. If more people contribute to WBSERF, it would help the government in purchasing more doses,” said Bhowanipore resident Vijay Agarwal, who runs a travel business. Both Covishield and Covaxin doses were being charged Rs 250 per shot in private facilities before May 1 when the supply came from the Centre. Private hospitals are now buying a dose of Covaxin and Covishield for Rs 1,200 and Rs 600, respectively. “I saw many people coming in cars for getting the vaccine at government hospitals. It is evident that they could have afforded the vaccine. I appeal to them to contribute the amount they would have spent for the vaccine to state fund,” said Hiren Patel, who runs a lab research chemical business. Since May 1, most private facilities closed their inoculation drive for days. Only a couple of private centres have procured their vaccines, forcing people who had got their first shot at private facilities to seek the service at government centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/got-free-jabs-at-state-hosps-now-they-help-back-with-relief-fund/articleshow/82749017.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The response comes after the court took cognisance of wildfires devastating several hundred hectares of forest land in the hill state, and asked the state to consider possibilities of artificial rain to douse the flames. The affidavit submitted by the Head of Forest Force (HOFF), Rajiv Bhartari, revealed that the department had sent a letter to the Centre in mid-April seeking guidelines/instructions on possibility of using cloud seeding but the DG, forest and special secretary, Government of India in its response “concluded that even though the cloud seeding and artificial rains could be a theoretical solution for mitigating forest fire over NW India, there are many practical difficulties for the same”. The Centre added that there is “need to choose other viable options for mitigating forest fires which are practised elsewhere”. Cloud seeding is a technology that creates artificial rainfall by spraying particles of salts on clouds. These salt particles draw the moisture within the clouds towards them and leads to formation of raindrops that precipitate. The department also informed the court that it has conducted trials using gel like substances to prevent forest fires. The trials, affidavit said, were conducted in April in Lachhiwala forest range but its results are still awaited. “If this method (gel fluid method) is proved to be effective in controlling forest fires it can also be applied in future incidents/cases of forest fires,” read the affidavit.The forest department has also said that it has written to the state government and taken several other steps to fill up over 65% vacancies for the post of forest guards, 82% vacancies for the post of assistant conservator of forests and the vacancies for the post of conservators as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/cloud-seeding-not-viable-solution-state/articleshow/82749048.cms||Prashant Jha

It rained in the district on Monday evening. At that time there were around 24 patients in the Covid ward, which was built last year on old building premises of the district hospital to provide better treatment to Covid-19 patients, said sources. Water started leaking from the roof as soon as it started raining, and it leaked at several places, putting patients at unease, a few were later shifted, claimed sources. Civil surgeon of the hospital, Dr SS Parihar, however, told TOI, “Only one side of the roof leaked and it has impacted only one bed and only that patient was shifted. There were only 10 patients on the side where there was leakage. The leakage was due to a duct of an air-conditioner, which had remained open. The entire roof is still under warranty and it was repaired by the concerning contractor. Now we are also checking if it has been properly repaired or not.” “Water entered from the open duct into the false ceiling from where it spread and leaked. It has been repaired now,” he added. “Patients were, and are, still admitted there, only one bed was affected due to the leakage”, Parihar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/roof-leak-leads-to-chaos-in-rajgarh-hospitals-covid-ward/articleshow/82750938.cms||Amarjeet Singh

The accused are natives of Rajasthan and they used a stolen bike after replacing the original registration number, to commit the offences. Two days ago, the accused committed a chain snatching in Jawaharnagar and prior to that, the same offenders committed another snatching offence 10 days ago. During the investigation, police found out that the same gang was involved in two more offences last month in Jawaharnagar and surrounding areas. After the offenders committed an offence during the lockdown period two days ago, police came up with a strategy to nab them by deploying multiple teams between 6 am and 10 am when lockdown is relaxed. The 10 special teams waiting for the accused at various points in Jawaharnagar to track the suspects, located them at Balaji Nagar. The team alerted other teams when the offenders were travelling from Balaji Nagar to Yapral and sub-inspector D Mohan and constable Mahender intercepted them near the firing range. The duo were pinned down by the cops and taken into custody. During the interrogation, the accused confessed that they had used a bike stolen on March 19 at LB Nagar to commit the offences. Cops are in the process of recovering the stolen property.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/2-chain-snatchers-held-used-stolen-bike-to-commit-offences/articleshow/82752850.cms||Mahesh Buddi

As such, the tenth dialysis centre was made operational at the community health centre, in Bicholim, on Tuesday. Chief minister Pramod Sawant has fully supported the initiative, the health minister said. Rane said that from a single dialysis centre at the Goa Medical College (GMC) and hospital in Bambolim, the state government has increased this number to 10. “We shall further work towards adding five more centres shortly,” he said. The state has over 1,000 patients on dialysis who take the treatment at various centres. The government then reimburses them the cost of dialysis. The facility at CHC Bicholim was inaugurated by Bicholim MLA and assembly speaker Rajesh Patnekar, who thanked the chief minister and health minister for ensuring that patients from Bicholim do not have to travel long distances to avail of the facility. Mayem MLA Pravin Zantye appealed to people to take benefit of the service, which will be on offer to dialysis patients totally free of charge. This unit is managed by Apex Kidney Care, with Dr Sheetal Lengde as nephrologist. Apex Kidney Care manages 10 units all over Goa.

Against 3.1 lakh active cases at the peak of second wave on April 30, the number of active infections as on date is 1.36 lakh. Active infections are an indicator of the extent of pandemic activity. Officials believe a 50% dip within a 20-day span is good news. However, experts point out that the outcome is a result of several factors, including natural fall in pandemic activity, curbs, testing and treating, individual and government efforts to weaken the chain. They also said, it was important to continue following Covid-19 protocols in individual and social interest. Additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad, said, of the total active cases, 92,000 were in home isolation while others were undergoing treatment at government or private hospitals. He said, 21,108 persons had recovered from the infection in past 24 hours, taking the total count to 14,83,249, which pegs the recovery rate above 90%. Of the new cases, Lucknow (502), Meerut (453), Saharanpur (374), Gautam Budh Nagar (345) and Muzaffarnagar (337) were main contributors. However, Covid-19 deaths continued to remain a cause of concern with 255 lives lost to the pandemic in past 24 hours, taking the tally to 18,072. Meerut topped the list with 20 entries, followed by Lucknow where 19 persons died.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/active-covid-infections-in-state-down-50-since-peak/articleshow/82752843.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Kolkata||Amid tourism blues, Kolkata travel agents see hope in Russian vax vacation||KOLKATA: After nearly a year with hardly any revenues, travel agents in the city have received a shot in the arm following a nod from Russian authorities to promote vaccine vacation to the country. With the wedding season in the offing, the agents expect honeymooners to particularly grab the opportunity. While the vaccination trip plans floated by a couple of Delhi-based travel agencies are currently doing the rounds, agents in Kolkata are working on packages and are expected to firm up proposals by this weekend. Roughly, the trip duration will be for 24 days: 20 days in Moscow and four in St Petersburg. "We had a word with authorities at the Russian consulate as well as travel agents in Russia. They have confirmed that vaccinatoin will be offered to tourists. The vaccination drive in Russia has been so successful that from May 15, people aren't required to wear masks. Indians can travel to Russia after getting an RT-PCR test done and can either enjoy a vacation without the hassle of quarantine or can opt for a vaccination package that will include two shots within 24 days in addition to the sightseeing opportunities," said Travel Agents Federation of India chairman (east) Anil Punjabi. City travel agents said they were already getting inquiries about the vaccine holiday proposed in Russia. Some though are just waiting to see how it takes off. "Once the restrictions that are currently in place in Kolkata eases and the mood lifts, there will be many takers, particularly in the upper middle class families that have not had a vacation in a long time," said Travel Agents Association of India chairman (east) Manav Soni. Another travel agent said the higher efficacy of Sputnik V vis-a-vis both Covishield and Covaxin that are currently available in India could also be a draw for the segment that can afford the vacation. Sputnik is also set to be manufactured in India and is in comparative analysis trials in hospitals. The Russia vaccination holiday, priced between Rs 2.2 lakh and Rs 2.4 lakh per person, will include 24-day stay at 3-star hotels in Moscow and St Petersburg, sight-seeing and guided tours to all major tourist spots in these cities, flight and train fares as well as local sightseeing transport and ticket costs. The parity in Russian Rouble and Indian Rupee means the rather long trip will not be as prohibitively expensive as to some other European countries. Also, hotel tariffs are at an all-time low. In December, some travel agents had prematurely floated proposals to take a vaccination holiday to the UK. But it did not materialize as BritaÐin did not open up vaccination to tourists. The industry feels UK too will open up the doors and use vaccination as a bait to attract tourists now that it about to complete vaccinating its population. Soni believes vaccination tourism will be a reality in the UK, the US and the UAE and open up travel and tourism opportunities to these countries as well. “Right now, India is on the red list. But once the restrictions are eased and they allow travel after an RT-PCR test, many will hop on to a flight,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/amid-tourism-blues-city-travel-agents-see-hope-in-russian-vax-vacation/articleshow/82749077.cms||Subhro Niyogi

---||Goa||Goa: Cyclone abruptly ends turtle nesting season at Canacona||POINGUINIM: Although the Olive Ridley turtle nesting season was brought to an abrupt end due to the impact of Cyclone Tauktae, the Canacona forest department is upbeat as it managed to release 3,254 hatchlings into the sea from 32 nesting pits at Agonda and four at Galgibaga before the cyclone struck. Range forest officer in-charge Anant Velip told TOI that the turtles visited Agonda beach 35 times and Galgibaga four times this season, but that the cyclone ruined three nesting pits at Agonda, prompting the forest department to save 3,080 hatchlings. Also, while the eggs in the four pits at Galgibaga had hatched, just 174 hatchlings could be retrieved. Others were lost due to a possible rise in water levels on the beach, Velip said. The protected nesting site at Galgibaga has been a concern of late, as only four turtle nests were protected here this season. The nests carried 435 eggs of which 174 hatchlings were released into the sea. Tourist inflow and noisy surroundings are also believed to be affecting and endangering eggs, as a result of which many eggs were shifted to the forest department’s interpretation centre for protection during the incubation period. To protect the area under incubation, the forest department employed locals to keep a close watch round-the-clock to deter people or stray dogs from interfering with the eggs. ‘No development zones’ have been put in place on beaches by the local authorities along with stricter regulations on building of beach structures, said Velip. Considering the need to protect the endangered Olive Ridley turtles, the government has taken up the conservation programme and the forest department has fenced the coastal area at Galgibaga to ensure proper protection to the turtles. Officials insist that protection measures are needed as unchecked tourism activities in the area could prove detrimental to the safety of turtles arriving to the shore to lay eggs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cyclone-abruptly-ends-turtle-nesting-season-at-canacona/articleshow/82752853.cms||Albert Fernandes

Since April 14, the village has recorded 44 deaths, mostly due to influenza-like illness, similar to Covid-19 sickness. The cause of death is being recorded as ‘unknown’ or cardiac arrest. Since April 16, not a single day has passed that the village has not recorded at least one death. “Not a single corner of the village is left untouched by the second Covid wave. Other than 7-8 people who died due to the dise-ase in hospitals, the rest all have symptoms like cold, cough, fever etc. It may be and may not be Covid,” said sarpanch Choga Nath. Former sarpanch Ikram Khan Cheetah says over 60 graves were dug in the past 30-40 days. “An aerial survey of all graveyards can give a clear picture that the death figures being quoted by the elected representatives are a lie. By not acknowledging the problem it is like putting the lives of others in danger,” he said. The reason why the local administration does not act is due to lack of data reflecting the actual situation. Asha worker Geeta Kathat, who has 800 houses under her management, has tracked only 19 persons with influenza-like symptoms and has a record of 10 people in home quarantine.

---||Patna||Experts say radical policy rejig only way to robust health infrastructure in Bihar||PATNA: There was a time when people from neighbouring Nepal and Bhutan used to come to the Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) for treatment, but now even people from humble backgrounds think twice before getting their loved ones admitted despite the improvement in the infrastructure over the years. Though the government hospitals, which form barely 30% of the health facilities in the state, are at the forefront of the fight against the Covid-19 virus yet the pandemic has exposed Bihar's creaky healthcare infrastructure. No wonder the pandemic has raised the question that has been asked many times before, what ails the state health sector, and how can Bihar regain its place as the health hub of the region? "We are corrupt, and we allow corruption," observed renowned surgeon Dr A A Hai when asked the question and pleaded for lateral entry of experts in the decision-making process on health. Dr Hai advocated long-term cool and calculated scientific planning as the Covid pandemic has exposed the system, and health will be a major issue for governments in the coming days. "Bihar health policy needs to be brushed up and the government should increase budget allocation for the health sector from less than 2% to at least 7-10% of the GDP. Though CM Nitish Kumar is trying his best to improve the situation despite so many handicaps, things are not percolating down to a lower level because of rampant corruption," Dr Hai told TOI. He added, "The government should avoid knee-jerk reactions and doling out cash in the name of ex gratia payment without ascertaining the exact reasons for deaths. The state needs money for building infrastructure, hiring doctors, paramedical staff and professionals, as a long-term plan, instead of wasting resources on non-productive things." He further said, "At least 15 out the top 20 top epidemiologists in the world are Indians. Dr A K Jha from Bihar is the Dean at Brown University School of Public Health in the USA. Why can't we engage experts in policy-making in their respective fields." Dr Hai's call for lateral entry of experts is in line with poll strategist Prashant Kishor's assertion, in an interview to a portal, that the telecom, missile, UIDAI (Aadhaar), White and Green revolutions in modern India were successful because of lateral entry of experts and not because of the bureaucrats, who get transferred to different departments frequently and are not supposed to be the master of all. While ADRI director Prof Prabhat P Ghosh attributed the sorry state of health in Bihar to "the huge resource gap and insignificant per capita expenditure on this sector", IMA (Bihar) secretary Dr Sunil Kumar blamed poor infrastructure, half the posts of doctors lying vacant and lack of technicians to handle equipment available in the hospitals. "The state government is recruiting doctors on contract for one year while more than half of the 13,000 (approximate) sanctioned posts of basic grade doctors and around 4,500 teaching faculties in medical colleges are vacant. Hardly 10 of around 100 ventilators sent by the Centre from PM Cares Fund are functional and the rest lie wrapped owing to lack of technicians despite hospital superintendents writing to the department. It shows total lack of coordination in the health department," Dr Sunil said. Economist and assistant professor at ADRI, Bakshi Amit Kumar Sinha said, "Bihar is far behind other states in health expenditure. Remarkably, 75% of the health expenditure is borne by the poor and only 25% by the state government. In a state where the rural population has an estimated Rs7000-8000 per capita income, even the poor have to spend around Rs2,000 on health while agriculture contributes around 18% to the GDP." Bakshi said the health expenditure in Bihar increased from 4.35% of the total expenditure in 2016-17 to 6.08% in 2021-22 while its share in GSDP increased from 1.3% to 1.75% during the same period. In general, per capita, health expenditure in Bihar is Rs 1,078 crore while total expenditure on health sector has gone up to Rs13,265 crore in 2021-22 against Rs 5,493 in 2016-17. Stressing the need for "structural changes", the former principal of Patna College, Prof N K Chaudhary, said the Supreme Court should make health one of the fundamental rights, like education. Blaming the collapse in the public health system due to the rich who could afford treatment anywhere in the country and the world, Chaudhary said medical and nursing education has always been neglected since Independence. "Health for all should be the war cry now since the pandemic has taught a lesson even to the rich that a strong public system is the only answer to the ailing sector. When 90% of the population suffered, no one was bothered. The soul of the public health system lies in doctors and paramedical staff. Only hospital buildings will not help. The government has set up hundreds of primary health centres (PHCs) and additional PHCs, but most of them in rural areas are in real bad shape," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/expert-say-radical-policy-rejig-only-way-to-robust-health-infra-in-bihar/articleshow/82749139.cms||Jai Narain Pandey

The Supreme Court had asked the hospital to examine the rebel YSRC MP after he had accused the Andhra Pradesh police of custodial torture. Raju has been arrested on charges of sedition by the state CID. The high court, it is learnt, has dispatched the sealed cover to the apex court through a special messenger. The military hospital authorities confirmed that Raju was brought to them on the night of May 17. “We admitted him to the hospital after procedural formalities,” the authorities said in a statement. “The medical examination was conducted by a medical board of three doctors of our hospital in presence of a judicial officer nominated by the Chief Justice of Telangana high court during the night of 17 May 2021 under videography.” The MP is now under medical care at the hospital. The Supreme Court has said that his stay will be treated as judicial custody. “We are performing our tasks under strict Covid-19 medical protocols,” the hospital statement said.

---||Dehradun||Second black fungus death in Uttarakhand||DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand recorded its second Black Fungus fatality on Tuesday after an 81-year-old Aligarh resident succumbed to the infection at AIIMS Rishikesh. Also, the cumulative cases of Black Fungus (or Mucormycosis), a Covid-triggered disease, shot up to 35 in the hill state after 10 more people were found with the infection at AIIMS Rishikesh on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the state government on Tuesday issued a directive to medical facilities asking for judicious use of Amphotericin B, the antifungal drug used for treating Black Fungus cases, in the wake of a shortage of medicine in the market. It is suspected that doctors are hoarding the drug. The directive was issued by secretary Pankaj Pandey. “The medicine, Amphotericin B, will only be issued to medical colleges and district Covid hospitals, if available and no other private centres should be entertained. The hospitals have to fill the fully detailed form to get the medicine and the demand could be raised twice a day,” states the government advisory. The order adds that protocol should strictly be followed by all hospitals in the treatment of mucormycosis. The procurement requests for Amphotericin B by the medical facilities in the Garhwal region will be entertained by Dr Narayanjeet Singh and Dr SR Saxena has been tasked with verifying the genuineness of the demand. For the medical facilities in the Kumaon region, Dr Rashmi Pant will look after the requests and Dr Kailash Gunjiyal is tasked with issuing the drug after analysing the need of the drug on a case-to-case basis. To ensure greater transparency, the hospitals have been asked to deposit the empty vials of medicine again to the nodal officers. According to doctors, Covid-19 patients with comorbidities, especially diabetes, are at the risk of contracting the fungal infection which can be fatal, if not cured in time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/elderly-dies-of-black-fungus-at-aiims-r-10-new-cases-found-in-ukhand/articleshow/82749096.cms||Ishita Mishra

---||Nagpur||Alprazolam misuse: CP brings pharmacy owners on radar||Nagpur: City police chief Amitesh Kumar on Tuesday said the stringent narcotics drugs and psychotropic substances (NDPS) Act would be invoked against pharmacy owners and consumers of scheduled drug Alprazolam, which is used to treat anxiety and panic disorders, if anyove is found misusing it. This drug, belonging to the class of Benzodiazepines, is used as a sedative as well. In the backdrop of at least two murders in Pachpaoli where maximum minors were involved and also the overall misuse of the Alprazolam drugs by addicts, Kumar has issued a sweeping check on pharmacies across the city to detect the unregulated sale of the medicine without prescription. He has started a crackdown on narcotics drugs and such substances as a large chunk of youngsters and criminals are resorting to their abuse. Kumar said the association of pharmacists has been requested to furnish the sale and purchase of the Alprazolam drug which is being misused for addiction and seems to be having a direct or indirect association with crime. “Though the checking of the drug sale and its irregularities are covered under the Drugs and the Cosmetics Act, we have decided to invoke the more stringent NDPS Act against violators as the misuse of the drug is triggering serious crimes,” said the top cop. “If the sale of Alprazolam is more near slums and criminal-infested areas rather than at places having hospitals or clinics in the vicinity then it’s a matter of serious concern and investigation which will prompt us to check pharmacies in such places to check whom the drug was issued and how,’ he said. Kumar had initiated a raid at 86 places on Monday by an equal numbers of teams from different police stations and crime branch across the city. In the raids, more than 24 persons were arrested and substantial narcotics and contraband substances worth Rs 24 lakh were recovered and seized. Search operations were undertaken at 36 places too under the supervision of the CP and other senior officers. “We have also initiated a process of checking the purchasers of the costly narcotic drugs Mephedrone (MD) after peddlers were arrested,” said the top cop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/alprazolam-misuse-cp-brings-pharmacy-owners-on-radar/articleshow/82750976.cms||Soumitra Bose

He was 52. A first-time MLA from Muzaffarnagar’s Charthawal constituency, Kashyap had tested positive in the last week of April. Known for his proximity to RSS, Kashyap became a minister when CM Yogi Aditynath expanded his cabinet in August 2019. Besides Kashyap, the state has lost two other ministers, Chetan Chauhan and Kamal Rani Varun, who died in the first wave. Four other MLAs, Suresh Srivastava, Ramesh Chandra Diwakar, Kesar Singh Gangwar and Dal Bahadur Kori and SP MLC SRS Yadav have succumbed to Covid. CM Yogi condoled his death in a message which said: “The death of my colleague and minister of state for revenue and flood control Vijay Kashyap is extremely sad. I pray to Lord Ram to give him place in heaven and strength to the bereaved family to bear this loss.” Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya also offered condolences to Kashyap’s family. “I am deeply saddened by the death of Charthawal’s extremely popular MLA and state minister Vijay Kashyap. The demise of this leader, who was committed to social service, is an immeasurable loss for the state and the party (BJP),” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-revenue-minister-vijay-kashyap-dies-of-covid/articleshow/82752936.cms||---

In the last one month alone, the recovery rate in the PMC areas has jumped by over 13%, bringing down its active caseload to 16,523 as against 55,900 recorded in mid-April. The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) limits have also recorded a 5% rise in its recovery rate in the last one month, while the overall recovery in the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR) has increased to 91.5%, which is higher than the state’s average of 90.2% recorded on May 17. In the PMC areas, more than 4.36 lakh Covid patients have recovered successfully so far as against 4.61 lakh progressive case count. In the last one month especially, the recoveries in the PMC limits have stayed way ahead of new infections. Sanjeev Wavre, assistant medical chief at PMC, said the daily additions were at peak around mid-April when city had added over 6,000 patients on a single day, which has now dropped to below 2,000. There has been a steady decline in cases for a month now, after a constant rise of almost one-and-a-half-month, he said. Besides the constant drop in daily cases, the daily positivity rate has also declined. On April 18, the PMC had added 6,434 cases at a positivity rate of 26%. On May 17, the new infections dropped to 684, with a positivity rate of mere 9%. Mayor Murlidhar Mohol said the administration had been asked to stay alert though the cases have been on the decline. “The daily cases have gone down. On Monday, the fresh caseload slipped to 3-digit for the first time since March. It is a good indication but we are still on alert. The administration is preparing for the possible spurt. The oxygen plants have been commissioned and more beds have been added in the last two months,” Mohol said. The health officials said they were keeping a watch on the situation. They urged citizens not to let their guard down.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/recovery-rate-surges-to-95-in-pmc-areas-active-tally-shrinks-to-just-16k/articleshow/82750962.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Delhi||Enough free ration for all beneficiaries, says Imran Hussain||NEW DELHI: Food & civil supplies minister Imran Hussain on Tuesday assured that sufficient ration was available in the city and fair price shops would remain open seven days of the week. Delhi government had already announced free ration to the 72 lakh ration card holders for May and June and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday further said those who were poor but didn’t possess a ration card would also start getting ration within a few days. TimesViewIt's a welcome move that even those without ration cards will be given free rations. Delhi is home to millions of migrants and other people living on the margins many of whom who don’t have a ration card. This scheme, if implemented properly, will surely help them.The capital has around 17.8 lakh households with ration cards covering 72.8 lakh beneficiaries, including 68,732 Antodya Anna Yojna (AAY) households having 2.8 lakh beneficiaries. Hussain, who conducted surprise inspections of fair price shops in Shalimar Bagh to check availability and distribution of free ration items, warned strict action as per law against ration dealers who do not open shops regularly, collect cost of foodgrain illegally, distribute less than stipulated quantity of ration or indulge in other malpractices like diversion of foodgrains, hoarding, black marketing or misbehaving with beneficiaries. During the inspection, Hussain assured beneficiaries that sufficient ration was available and there was no need to panic in obtaining the ration. He also said that in case the beneficiaries were not able to get entitled ration under National Food Security Act or Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Ann Yojna, might visit their fair price shops again to get the remaining ration. He said fair price shops were open on all seven days from 9am to 1pm and from 3pm to 7pm, without any weekly off and beneficiaries didn’t need to panic at all. He advised beneficiaries to observe social distancing norms and wear masks while obtaining ration. Hussain said that apart from department officers, members of the vigilance committee were also monitoring the distribution process and area MLAs had also started inspecting fair price shops. In case beneficiaries face any problem in receiving ration free of cost at a fair price shop, they may contact officers of the food and supplies department. Women and child development minister Rajendra Pal Gautam also conducted a surprise door-to-door inspection in the JJ colonies in Wazirpur, Shakti Nagar Extension, Ashok Vihar and Subzi Mandi to inspect the quality and quantity of ration items being provided to pregnant women and children under Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS). Under ICDS, nutritious food is given to children younger than six years and pregnant or lactating women twice a month. Gautam said the main objective of his visit was to ensure that the beneficiaries got high-quality nutritious food according to the prescribed standards and send a message to the anganwadi workers and officials that they won’t be spared for any irregularities in the quality of the ration or its distribution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/enough-free-ration-for-all-beneficiaries-says-hussain/articleshow/82750972.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Electricity executive engineer Vallabh Samant said that around 300 trees that either uprooted or of which branches collapsed due cyclone Tauktae have broken cables at at least a hundred places and have damaged 60 electric poles. Parts of Ponda town had experienced a similar power shutdown for around two days in the early 1980s due to the failure of a Maharashtra grid. The situation had forced people to either use battery-operated lights or kerosene lamps. Samant said his staff have repaired the cables and restored power to almost 90% of the affected areas. Many areas across the state still continue to face no electricity for the third day running, with staff from the power department working overtime to restore supply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-power-in-parts-of-ponda-for-over-40-hrs/articleshow/82752915.cms||---
---||Delhi||Plasma therapy: Experts & docs say will go with ICMR guidelines||New Delhi: After the Indian Council for Medical Research dropped convalescent plasma therapy from the Covid-19 treatment protocol, experts that TOI spoke to said that the advice was based on scientific evidence and would be duly followed. Belief in the therapy’s efficacy had led to huge demands for blood plasma in recent days. “The study was conducted by various institutions and the results are in front of us. The use of plasma has been seen not to have an impact on the mortality or the progression of the disease,” said Dr Anant Mohan, head of pulmonary medicine at AIIMS. Other doctors told TOI that they would discontinue the therapeutic use of plasma except as a last resort. It was believed that the antibody-rich plasma from a recovered Covid patient, when injected into an ailing recipient, would aid the fight against the infection. Dr Vineeta Taneja, director of internal medicine at Fortis Hospital in Shalimar Bagh, said, “ICMR and AIIMS conducted tests across various centres in the country. What they found was that plasma neither improved mortality chances nor prevented the progression of the disease. Even studies carried out in other countries have come up with similar results. The advice is not to use plasma in treating Covid and we should heed it because a study has been conducted and the results are not in its favour. And if it’s not beneficial, there are obviously disadvantages to the therapy.” Taneja, however, added that plasma therapy could still be used if at all on compassionate grounds. “If there is any patient for whom we can’t use any steroid or no other treatment is working, then we could try plasma therapy as the last option,” she explained. Dr Aparna Mukherjee, who was the principal investigator of the ICMR study, said, “The investigation was conducted at 39 centres, including private and government hospitals, involving 464 patients, almost half of whom were given plasma therapy. It was established that convalescent plasma therapy was not helping in minimising the chances of death or checking the progression of Covid. No improvement or benefit was seen. Other foreign countries, including the UK and Argentina, had also conducted studies and come up with similar results. The decision was not based on just one study, but considered all studies on the subject.” Doctors told TOI that delisting plasma therapy as a Covid treatment was good because a huge number of people were desperately going on social media platforms to arrange for and access blood plasma from recovered Covid patients. “Some patients have told us they paid for the plasma. In some cases, patients had to pay the donor for the transportation and other expenses, ending up with an expense of several thousand rupees,” said one doctor. “So many people were posting SOS messages for plasma on social media. At least they can now stop this because the therapy was not actually helping fight the infection in any way.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/plasma-therapy-experts-docs-say-will-go-with-icmr-guidelines/articleshow/82750977.cms||---

The normal onset date of south west monsoon over Kerala, based on data from year 1961 to 2019 is June 1 and the normal date of onset over Panaji from the same period of data is June 5. Monsoon arrives in Goa only after its onset in Kerala. The progress of monsoon currents depends on many factors and it’s not necessary that every year it would take exactly four days for monsoons to reach from Kerala coast to Goa coast. It can be shorter or longer based on the conditions favouring northward progression of monsoon, IMD scientist, Rahul M said. The IMD issues forecast of monsoon onset over Kerala only, and not for its progression state wise. Though the onset date has been advanced by a day, the IMD Goa maintained that Cyclone Tauktae may not have played a prominent role in advancing the onset date. “When Cyclone Tauktae formed and moved northwards, it enhanced the cross equatorial flow of monsoon currents, but we cannot say that simply because of this system that monsoon onset has moved one day prior,” Rahul said. “There are still some systems expected to be formed over the Bay of Bengal in the coming days. These are expected to enhance the progress of monsoon in the Indian subcontinent,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/imd-forecasts-early-monsoon-this-year/articleshow/82752961.cms||---

---||Pune||In hypoxic patients, limit steroid course to 10 days: Advisory||PUNE: Not more than 6mg of the steroid dexamethasone is recommended daily for Covid patients on oxygen support for 10 days, experts from the national Covid-19 task force have clarified. They added that there's also no need to increase or prolong the dosage if there's an increase in disease severity. The advisory extends to similar drugs as 6mg of dexamethasone is equivalent to 40mg of the steroid prednisolone or 32mg of another steroid, methyl-prednisolone. Experts have said that there has been unchecked use of steroids even among Covid patients with mild disease and those isolated at home. They reiterated that patients with mild Covid should not be prescribed steroids. Also, those who were hospitalised with Covid should not be prescribed oral steroid tablets after discharge. Irrational steroid use, along with high incidence of diabetes in the population and a tendency to self-medicate with over-the-counter antibiotics has led to an unprecedented surge in mucormycosis cases, the experts said. "The national task force guidelines allow only 10 days of steroid use, for hypoxic Covid patients requiring oxygen support," said task force member and infectious diseases expert Sanjay Pujari. He added, "The key rationale for steroids is: in the right patient, at the right time, in the right dose and for the right duration." Steroids impair the immune system and can trigger mucormycosis in those unable to fight off secondary infection. "In many instances, discharged Covid patients were prescribed oral steroids. But these drugs should not be continued after hospital stay. Patients should also avoid self medication," Pujari said. Some experts also believe the one-size-fits-all approach with steroids should be discouraged. Besides, patients with severe Covid tend to remain hypoxic beyond Day 10. "Steroids dosage and duration are different in patients with Covid-19 pneumonitis with low oxygen levels and those in ICU on assisted ventilation with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)," said infectious disease expert Bharat Purandare. A subset of patients has steroid-responsive hypoxia (state of low oxygen levels). "If we withdraw steroids, they again develop hypoxia. So they need prolonged steroid use to keep them away from oxygen support," Purandare said. Another infectious diseases expert, Parikshit Prayag said, "Unless there is a very specific reason (like pneumonitis), there is no reason to extend the duration of steroids." Quite a few studies have also not shown any benefit in high dosage of steroids for long durations. "In fact, higher doses can be potentially harmful. The risk of secondary bacterial and fungal infection increases with higher steroid dosing," Prayag said. Doctors treating Covid at prominent Pune hospitals said they stop steroids as soon as the patient is off oxygen support for 24 hours. "This is the practice we follow at Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital. But we often see home-isolated patients (referred to us) who were prescribed steroids, which is absolutely not advisable. We have also had patients who were given much higher doses of steroids for an extended period of time. This is a completely wrong practice while treating Covid," Prayag added. Experts said that in addition to irrational use of steroids, there must be another trigger that places Covid patients at risk of contracting mucormycosis. "Steroids have been used for decades to treat many other medical conditions. But we haven't seen so many mucormycosis cases. We have also seen mucormycosis in mild or asymptomatic Covid 19 who were not hospitalized or given steroids," Purandare said. Extensive studies are needed to conclusively establish the steroid-mucormycosis link. "Science needs to find that association before plainly labelling that rampant use of steroids is leading to mucormycosis in Covid patients," Purandare said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/in-hypoxic-patients-limit-steroid-course-to-10-days-advisory/articleshow/82750978.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The deceased, Ram and Laxman Solunke, were residents of Nagapur Khurd village — around 15 kilometer from Beed town. Pimpalner police have registered a case of murder against the suspect youth who is currently on the run. Assistant inspector Sharad Bhutekar told TOI, “Around a month ago, the suspect had an argument with the brother duo. The issue was resolved amicably by the villagers and it never reached the police station.” He added, “It appears the suspect could not overcome humiliation even a month after the incident due to which on Monday night called one of the brothers and started abusing him over the phone. The suspect even challenged the brothers to come face-to-face so that he could teach them a lesson.” Following this, the brothers along with former sarpanch decided to meet the suspect’s father and bring the issue to his notice.

Besides children, the family’s eleventh member, a pet dog was also struggling to stay afloat as their home kept getting flooded inch by inch due to incessant rain. This is the story of the Sutar family who live in their old heritage home near Mala lake, Panaji. According to the volunteers, the family members and their dog were drenched in water since Saturday night and continued to wait for the next 24 hours for the water to subside. But the water level only kept rising, until they were forced to seek shelter at an under-construction building on Sunday, before sending out an SOS for help, citizen volunteer, Natasha Parekh said. “We usually respond to SOSs for Covid related help like beds in hospitals, but on Sunday we received this call to help the family with food and shelter. Luckily, I had enough clothes and food to respond to the family in distress,” she said. She reached out to Sankalp Gadekar, another citizen volunteer who came to the aid of the family along with fellow volunteer, Gaurav Kandolkar. The duo - Gadekar and Kandolkar - were on their way distributing food packets to underprivileged people and migrant workers in Mapusa and Panaji when they received the SOS. As they made their way to help the family, Parekh kept clothes, bedding and dental kits ready to pass on to the Sutar family. She also packed tea bags, coffee sachets, bottled water, electral powder for the family, which were picked up by the duo to be delivered to the family in Mala. “The family was camped at an under construction place near their home when we met them. Later in the night, locals in the neighbourhood managed to provide them with a space to spend the night. They are now safe and sound in Dona Paula where they will wait till their house is in habitable condition.” Kandolkar and Gadekar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/volunteers-rescue-family-of-10-stranded-at-mala/articleshow/82752943.cms||Nida Sayed
---||Nagpur||Hit by curbs, auto drivers switch jobs to earn daily bread||Nagpur: The pandemic-induced curbs have hit the city’s autorickshaw drivers hard. With no commuters and zero income, many auto drivers have switched to other jobs to earn their daily bread. “After sitting at home for almost three months in 2020 when the pandemic hit the city, I was extremely frustrated and the government kept extending the restrictions every 15 days. So, I decided to change my job and joined a private security guards’ agency,” said Sudhakar Sorgile, a former auto driver. The Maharashtra government had announced a Rs 107 crore package for the 7.5 lakh autorickshaw drivers in April under which each one of them would have got Rs 1,500 as relief. The relief was only for permit holder auto drivers. But even after a month, there was no sign of the meagre relief, pointed out Sorgile. Like Sorgile, Shailesh Sahu, Pramod Khobragade and Vijay Tambe, too, stopped plying autorickshaws and are doing other jobs to make ends meet. Sahu has been selling vegetables, while Khobragade and Tambe have joined a private security guards’ agency. “The amount announced by the government is nothing but rubbing salt into our wounds,” said Tambe, who is finding it difficult to pay EMIs of his three-wheeler since one year. Pre-Covid, most of us used to earn at least Rs 20,000, which sufficed to meet our daily needs. But now we are struggling to survive, they said. Similar is the story of almost all autorickshaw drivers in the city, said Vilas Bhalekar, president of Tiger Autorickshaw Sangathan. Many auto drivers are facing difficulties in getting their vehicles serviced due to no income. According to statistics, more than 20,000 autos with permit ply within Nagpur city limits. “However, many autorickshaw drivers have switched to other jobs to earn a living,” said Bhalekar. Many auto drivers have taken bank loans for purchasing vehicles, but due to the Covid-19 restrictions, they are not able to pay instalments on time. Bhalekar claimed that he recently wrote to Maharashtra transport minister Anil Parab to draw his attention towards the promised relief package. “I got an assurance that the government would soon start disbursing the relief package,” he said. Deputy RTO and in-charge of both city and east office Vinod Jadhav too admitted that the state is yet to release the Rs 1,500 relief to every autorickshaw driver. Only drivers with autorickshaw permits will get the benefit. There are 18,491 permit holders in the city, he revealed. “Once the portal is ready, the state will start disbursing the funds,” the deputy RTO said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hit-by-curbs-auto-drivers-switch-jobs-to-earn-daily-bread/articleshow/82751001.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

---||Delhi||Covid-19 admissions at N corpn hosp stopped without notice: AAP||New Delhi: AAP functionary Durgesh Pathak on Tuesday accused North Delhi Municipal Corporation-run Balak Ram Hospital of stopping admission of new Covid patients without any prior notice. “BJP-led corporations have around 3,400-3,500 beds in Delhi. They gave some reason or other to people and turned them away to other places. Without any information, Balakram Hospital has been asked to stop taking Covid patients. There wasn’t a written order, but a doctor in Balakram Hospital’s WhatsApp group wrote that a higher authority had ordered them that Balakram Hospital would not take in any patients,” Pathak claimed. The AAP functionary said that the number of cases was going down over the past few days, but that does not mean that the Covid threat was over. “Shutting hospitals through back-door manipulation is wrong and a criminal act,” Pathak alleged. He urged the corporations to ensure that these hospitals be allowed to treat Covid patients. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said that Pathak was misleading the people. “New patients’ inflow into Covid facilities has rapidly gone down and discharge is steady as patients are now recovering well. This is the reason why hospital beds are vacant both in MCD and Delhi government hospitals. It is shameful that AAP wants to play politics even in the pandemic,” said Kapoor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-19-admissions-at-n-corpn-hosp-stopped-without-notice-aap/articleshow/82751010.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Backlog of 40,000 surgeries in hospitals after second wave surge||LUCKNOW: Amid the second wave of Covid-19 in the city, a backlog of about 40,000 elective surgeries has been created in various government and private hospitals since April 1. The estimates are based on the number of such procedures done earlier. Elective surgeries are procedures which are planned in advance and have no emergency requirement. Doctors say some elective surgeries can be postponed for up to six months, but agreed that some procedures, if delayed, can complicate things or even turn fatal. According to official estimates, the three major government hospitals— King George’s Medical University (KGMU), Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences (RMLIMS) and SPM Civil hospital— altogether used to conduct an average of 300 daily elective surgeries before the second wave hit. These numbers are apart from the emergency cases. However, after the surge in April, hospitals restricted the number of non-Covid procedures because of diversion of hands to Covid care and the risk of infection to patients. Now, KGMU is performing 25 elective surgeries daily, RMLIMS 20 and SPM Civil hospital two-four weekly. As a result, in these hospitals, a backlog of about 11,000 has been created in the past 45 days. Similarly, a backlog of 13,000 elective surgeries has been created in SGPGIMS, Balrampur Hospital, Era’s Lucknow Medical College, other government facilities and private medical educational institutes. Further, a backlog of 16,000 elective surgeries has been created in around 250 private hospitals and nursing homes. President of Private Nursing Homes’ Association Dr Jyotirmoy Bhramari said, “In March, private hospitals were performing around 700 surgeries daily but now we are able to perform only 40-50% of elective surgeries.” When asked how they plan to tackle the situation, KGMU VC Lt Gen Dr Bipin Puri said, “We will reschedule elective surgeries on priority to manage the rush after the second wave subsides and normal functioning starts. Patients with complicated issues will be operated first. We are already working on plans to execute maximum possible surgeries without compromising the efficiency.” RMLIMS spokesperson Dr Srikesh Singh said, “We are in touch with patients and those whose ailments are in advance stages will be operated on priority once elective surgeries begin in full swing.” “We have a plan to extend OT timings post-lockdown to address the issue of backlog,” said chief medical superintendent of SPM Civil hospital Dr SK Nanda. Till then, doctors are counselling patients on the phone, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/backlog-of-40000-surgeries-in-hospitals-after-2nd-wave-surge/articleshow/82753013.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan
---||Pune||Health minister Rajesh Tope bats for RAT to boost testing in rural Maharashtra||PUNE: State health minister Rajesh Tope is considering the deployment of rapid antigen test (RAT) surveillance to improve testing in the rural areas of the state. The potential move comes in the backdrop of the limitations in rural areas, with inadequate infrastructure to carry out RT-PCR tests. Tope said door-to-door surveillance would also be carried out. ‘Where we do not have RTPCR laboratories, we should increase RATs so that we can improve testing in rural areas. Clusters that have registered many cases will be monitored thoroughly and door-to-door surveillance will be carried out,” Tope told TOI. The state has been carrying out over 2.5 lakh tests per day, and health officials said 70% were using the RT-PCR method. State task force member Shashank Joshi said apart from strengthening rural testing infrastructure, it was also important to de-stigmatize Covid-19, as people continue to fear quarantine. “It is imperative to use innovative techniques while carrying out door-todoor surveillance,” he said. “There is a need to focus on tests that have a faster turnaround time. The latest CRISPR technology tests or saliva tests and RATs should be in place for door-to-door surveillance,” Joshi said. He said the focus for rural areas must be on testing, tracking, and isolating, as the current strain is known to be more infectious. “Though cases are slowly coming down, we cannot become complacent and must continue testing and isolating, and avoid superspreader events,” he said. Training of Asha workers and other healthcare workers in swab collection techniques is another challenge that needs to be addressed to improve testing in the rural areas, said senior health officials. Central health officials have already stated that rural areas should focus on identifying samples of suspected Covid cases and testing them using the rapid antigen technique or refer them to the nearest Covid-19 testing laboratory. The officials also said community health officers and ANMS must be trained in performing rapid antigen tests. The Centre has directed the states to ensure that RAT kits were made available at all public health facilities, including sub-district centres, health and wellness centres, and primary health centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/health-minister-tope-bats-for-rat-to-boost-testing-in-rural-parts-of-state/articleshow/82750985.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Dehradun district magistrate Ashish Srivastava apprised the PM of the steps taken to contain the infection in the state capital, like community surveillance, decentralized testing, sending home isolation kits and making telemedicine arrangements. Union home minister Amit Shah, chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat and chief secretary Om Prakash were also present in the meeting. After the session, CM Rawat said that officials must focus on micro-level plans to arrest the spread of the virus. “Testing should be increased in the state. Committees should be formed at the assembly level as well as the gram panchayat with the help of public representatives. A separate plan should be chalked out for the vaccination of differently abled people,” the CM said. Rawat added that all Covid facilities should be prepared for the monsoon and ensure there are no power disruptions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/pm-takes-stock-of-covid-preparedness-in-ukhand/articleshow/82749244.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Dehradun||Pets in Covid-affected families in want of care||Dehradun: Taking care of pets is proving to be a challenge for families affected with Covid-19 in the city. With more than one member down with the infection, families are facing problems looking after their pets and taking them out for walks. Many are approaching pet boarding facilities and hostels to keep their pets till they recover but some of these are not willing to keep a pet from a Covid-infected family.  “We receive at least 20 calls every week from such families but for the sake of safety we refuse to bring in their pets. There have seen reports that animals too can transmit the virus,” said Vishal who runs a pet boarding facility in Dehradun. Vikas Sharma from a dog hostel at GMS road said, “We first try to convince the families to retain their pets even if one member is Covid-negative. We send our teams for taking such pets out for walks and for other services, like grooming. As of now we have four to five dogs with us from families where all the members are down with Covid. We are being vigilant to avoid any transmission.”  Veterinarians, however, said that dogs cannot transmit the virus to the humans. Dr Priyank Vyas, a city-based vet said, “People should not confuse the canine coronavirus, whose vaccine administered to dogs, with the coronavirus that’s causing the pandemic. It has not been proven that dogs can infect humans in any way.” Some pet boarding facilities are accepting pets from Covid-affected families but with adequate precaution. Vijay Ramakrishnan from Happy Puppy said, “We tell families with Covid patients to keep the dog away for at least one day before it comes to our facility. If possible, give it a bath before sending it here otherwise we give them a bath first thing to avoid any surface transmission .”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/pets-in-covid-affected-families-in-want-of-care/articleshow/82749227.cms||Abhijeet Singh

The worst hit was the Patnem underpass, which is in the jurisdiction of the Canacona Municipal Council. Two-wheeler riders and pedestrians had a tough time passing through the area. Water from three service roads accumulated at the underpass as the rivulet opening is narrow and has not been desilted for a long time by the concerned authorities. Only recently, Canacona MLA Isidore Fernandes had inspected the area and WRD officials were instructed to study the matter and take preventive measures. PWD assistant engineer Subhash Pagi said the issue of flooding had been discussed with Canacona disaster management authority. Pagi also felt that as the cyclone effect is still there, during high tides the water gushes onto the mainland. He said he has informed the concerned authority about the problem. Several areas in Gotcamolem, Colsor and Talpona also witnessed water-logging on account of choked drains.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/heavy-showers-leave-low-lying-areas-at-canacona-water-logged/articleshow/82753019.cms||---

In the past fortnight alone, the Pune police have registered cases against 150 people on the charges of uploading defamatory posts, including some below the belt remarks, on various social media sites, blaming political leaders and party office-bearers for the prevailing situation, including deaths. Of these 150 people, 130 were booked by the Pune cyber police and another 20 by the Airport, Vishrambaug and the Hadapsar police. At the same time, The Sangvi police in Pimpri Chinchwad have filed a case against 19 people. A police officer said, “Altogether five FIRs have been registered during this period and another 10 complaint applications are being verified for action.” Deputy commissioner of police (Cyber) Bhagyashri Navatake said, “We have now decided to merge party-wise complaints, instead of registering new cases. We are regularly receiving complaint applications against the members of one or the other political party.” Inspector D S Hake of the Cybercrime police said, “We have taken down the URL IDs and IP addresses used to generate and upload abusive and derogatory posts on different social media sites. We will soon take action against them.” The police have registered these cases under various sections of IPC and the IT Act against the persons involved in the online mud-slinging.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/abusive-posts-flood-social-media-during-second-wave-of-pandemic/articleshow/82751016.cms||---
---||Delhi||No clarity yet on impact of Centre’s move on plasma therapy in capital||New Delhi: A day after the central government dropped the use of convalescent plasma from the treatment protocol for Covid-19, there isn’t much clarity on the future of the therapy in coronavirus management in the city. The Indian Council for Medical Research said plasma therapy hadn’t proved beneficial in reducing the progression to severe disease or death. Delhi government runs two plasma banks. Lok Nayak Hospital, which has a plasma bank, alone provided plasma therapy to around 1,000 patients and claimed that it was successful in 99% of the moderate cases (patients with oxygen saturation between 85% and 92%). The plasma bank set up at the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences in Vasant Kunj by Delhi government has provided the blood component to far more people. There was no reaction from Delhi government on the Centre’s notification. Plasma use will now be restricted and given only in cases where doctors deem it very necessary. A doctor at a government hospital, who did not want to be identified, pointed out that the Centre had taken convalescent plasma off the treatment protocol but not banned its use. “It can be used on a case to case basis, but we haven’t received any guidelines from Delhi government’s health department in this regard,” the doctor said. Many private hospitals did not comment on the issue. A private hospital said it has suspended the use of plasma in the wake of the new central guidelines. In Delhi, plasma therapy was first tried in April 2020 on four serious patients and yielded encouraging results. Since then plasma therapy has been widely employed in the fight against Covid. Health minister Satyendar Jain was given plasma therapy when he was infected with Covid last year. East Delhi Municipal Corporation recently received the central government’s approval to set up a plasma bank at Swami Dayanand Hospital in Dilshad Garden. A question mark hangs over that facility’s future now. EDMC mayor Nirmal Jain said, “We will see if the plasma bank can be used for other purposes, but we will ensure adherence to all government of India guidelines.” EDMC has so far collected seven units of plasma, of which two units were given to Covid patients. The collection effort was slow and EDMC had started sending SMS and WhatsApp messages appealing for plasma donations. People between 18 and 60 years who have recovered from the infection are potential donors. “Though we had provided a special contact number— 011-22581036 — so that eligible and willing donors wouldn’t have problems getting through to us, the response was tepid and we had, therefore, started sending bulk messages and promoting the concept through different mediums of communication,” said a civic official. The civic body had also requested its employees who had recovered from Covid to volunteer as plasma donors. North corporation mayor Jai Prakash had also announced that a directory of recovered municipal employees would be created so that if someone needed plasma, these employees could be approached.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-clarity-yet-on-impact-of-centres-move-on-plasma-therapy-in-capital/articleshow/82751049.cms||Alok K N Mishra

Soon after, the Congress members set on fire an effigy of the Union government terming it as a “failure in handling Covid situation.” Meanwhile, BJP hit back strongly alleging the Congress of “using the sensitive issue as a political agenda to mislead people.” Congress vice-president Suryakant Dhasmana said that it’s the role of a healthy opposition to point out the shortcomings of the government and help them take decisions in favour of its people. “BJP government at the Centre and in the state has proved a complete failure in handling the Covid situation. When there is shortage of vaccine in the country, one fails to under the urgency to export it,” he said. Dhasmana further added, “The posters have been put up to remind the ruling party members about their mistake while urging them to act quickly in saving the lives of its people by ensuring vaccination as soon as possible to each and every individual.” BJP state chief Madan Kaushik retorted that the Congress party rather than “helping in the fight against Covid was more interested in politicizing the issue.” He said, “The Congress party has hardly made any contribution in the campaign against Covid-19 and is just trying to mislead the people by means of derogatory messages.

Health authorities have confirmed two deaths due to the disease in Sirsa. Experts are verifying details of four more suspected deaths due to black fungus. All four patients had died of Covid-19. As per IDSP report, 177 patients with mucormycosis are admitted in hospitals of Haryana. Of them, Amphotercin B has been requested for 22 patients. Technical comittee has approved injections for four patients (7 vials each). Demand for 12,000 vials of Liposomal Amphotercin B have been sent to Haryana Medical Services Corporation Limited. In related development, Haryana health minister Anil Vij said the government had prepared 20-bed wards in all medical colleges in the state to control black fungus and specialists will treat patients suffering from the disease. He said all district medical officers of the state had been directed to refer black fungus patients to nearby medical college immediately for treatment. Medical colleges have all facilities and specialist doctors for treating black fungus. Till Monday, 115 cases of black fungus had been reported in the state. The Haryana government has adequate medicines for the treatment of black fungus, said an official. Soon, the central government will also start importing injections from abroad for treating the fungus. Follow rules or face action: Govt after suspected outbreak The suspected outbreak of mucormycosis (black fungus) among immune-compromised patients, post Covid-19 especially, has forced the Haryana government to tell individuals and institutes to go by certain new rules or face action under Section 3 of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897. The violation is also punishable under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860). Additional chief secretary for health Rajeev Arora said on Tuesday that the civil surgeons’ committee will review any disobedience. The committee will include specialist of internal medicine, ophthalmology, and ENT, besides epidemiologists. The civil surgeon has the power to issue notice to any violator (individual or institute). The district committee will examine the reply, and if that doesn’t come within the stipulated time or is found to be unsatisfactory, it will be grounds for action under the Epidemic Diseases Act. The ACS said these might be called ‘The Haryana Epidemic Diseases (Mucormycosis) Regulations, 2021’ and shall remain valid for a year. All the hospitals (government or private) must follow the health ministry’s guidelines for screening, diagnosis, and management of mucormycosis. They must report every suspected or confirmed case to the health department through the civil surgeon concerned. Misinformation, peddling of unpermitted cures will not be excused. For meds, hospitals must email pamel The Haryana government has constituted an expert committee to decide on the distribution of anti-fungal injection Amphotericin-B among individual patients in the public and private hospitals. An official spokesperson said the committee comprised PGIMS-Rohtak ophthalmology professor Dr R S Chouhan, Panchkula ENT surgeon Dr Sukhdeep Kaur, Haryana Ophthalmological Society general secretary Dr Indermohan Rustagi and general director health services office’s DD (blindness) Dr Jagdeep Singh Basur. The committee will seek opinion on case-to-case basis from Rohtak PGIMS assistant neurosurgery professor Dr Amarnath, Panchkula Civil Hospital senior dental surgeon Dr Shivani Hooda, and Panchkula Alchemist’s ENT surgeon Dr Prachi Jain. The committee will formulate an objective criterion like first-come-first-served to decide these cases. It will have a prompt mechanism for processing the requests received on e-mail (amphobharyana@gmail.com). Dr Jagdeep Singh Basur, DD (blindness) of the director general health services’ office, will also coordinate with the committee. For the allocation of the medicine, the hospitals will email their request to the expert committee through their directors, medical superintendents, or ICU heads with details. The injection will be free of cost in the government’s medical colleges and hospitals. Both government and private medical colleges will get the injection from the Rohtak PGIMS, while the private medical colleges will deposit the actual cost into the SKS account of the civil surgeon concerned. Both categories of hospitals will get the injection from the civil surgeon concerned, while private hospitals will transfer the amount to the civil surgeon’s SKS account. The private hospitals will get it for the actual cost. The civil surgeon will indent the drug and issue it to the committee-approved hospitals. Black fungus reportings are rising in the post-Covid cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/52-new-black-fungus-cases-in-hry-2-deaths-confirmed/articleshow/82753098.cms||---
---||Pune||Army exam paper leak: Arrested Lt Col sent to police custody till May 25||Pune: The court of special judge SR Navander on Tuesday ordered the remand of arrested Lieutenant Colonel in police custody till May 25 in connection with the question paper leak of the all-India entrance exam for soldiers (general duty). The exam, which was to be held on February 28, was cancelled following the paper leak. On Monday, the Pune police had arrested the Lt Col, who headed the question paper printing panel set up by the Army Recruitment Office (ARO), Secunderabad, from his unit of posting in Secunderabad. It is the police’s case that the Lt Col was in touch with some of the previously arrested accused in the case and used a mobile messaging application for sending the question paper to one of the co-accused lodged presently in police custody. The Lt Col is the 11th suspect to have been arrested so far in the case. Two serving army majors are among the earlier 10 arrested suspects. Assistant commissioner of police (crime II) Laxman Borate, investigating the case, produced the Lt Col before the court and moved a plea through additional public prosecutor Prem Agarwal, seeking his custodial remand for 10 days. Agarwal submitted that the Lt Col’s custodial interrogation was required to establish how he managed to leak the paper and who are the other persons to whom he may have sent the paper. The prosecutor submitted that the Lt Col, in his capacity as the head of the printing committee, did not follow the standard operation procedure framed by the ARO. The remand report claimed that the Lt Col has admitted to having used a social networking service from his cellphone for sending the question paper before the exam to an earlier arrested suspect, Veeraprasad Kotiswamy Narnepati, a store keeper of the central ordnance depot at New Delhi. Narnepati was arrested on May 14. “The police needed sufficient time to probe the financial transaction between the Lt Col and Narnepati and they also need to interrogate him about his cellphone,” Agarwal submitted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/army-exam-paper-leak-arrested-lt-col-sent-to-police-custody-till-may-25/articleshow/82751023.cms||Asseem Shaikh

---||Nagpur||Police Line Talao to get new lease of life after grant from Gadkari||Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has undertaken the work of cleaning the Police Line talao in west Nagpur, which was dying a slow death after it was completely covered with weeds. “The NMC has received Rs 50 lakh from city MP and Union minister Nitin Gadkari and the amount is being utilized for rejuvenation of the lake and beautification of its surroundings,” NMC Mangalwari zone’s junior engineer Keshav Sonone told TOI. Once rejuvenated, the NMC will ban immersion of idols in this lake, the officer said and added that the lake cleaning work will take at least 45 days. TOI visited the site and found that the lake had almost dried up and the contractor entrusted with the cleaning work did some dewatering to pave the way for poclains to get into the water body to clean the weeds. “The entire lake was full of weeds and the poclains have removed almost 60% of them,” said the officer. TOI had reported how sewerage water from nearby areas and immersion of idols and pooja material had polluted the lake. But neither the NMC nor city police, which has the lake under its control, took any measures to prevent pollution. The NMC had undertaken the work following recommendations of the then commissioner of police Ankush Dhanvijay. A proposal was prepared to conserve and beautify the lake in 2011. The then municipal commissioner Sanjeev Jaiswal prepared the proposal after Dhanvijay’s request. The standing committee had approved Rs25.5 lakh for the work. The civic administration succeeded in removing the weeds but they resurfaced, bringing to the fore the shoddy cleaning work done. However, this time around, environmentalists expressed staisfaction with the way the cleaning work has been undertaken. Kaustav Chatterjee, founder of Green Vigil Foundation, said cleaning of the lake was much awaited. “Superficial cleaning was done many times in the recent past but did not yield any result. The NMC is now removing the weeds, including water lilies and water hyacinths, from the roots so that they do not grow again,” he pointed out. However, post-cleaning, maintaining the place is of utmost importance. “Most importantly, sewage and dumping of garbage need to be stopped,” he said. Sewage has nitrogen and phosphorus which act as nutrients for weeds to grow. “Weeds deplete dissolved oxygen levels in the lake, resulting in the collapse of the lake ecosystem. It is always advisable to introduce artificial oxygen supply such as a fountain for maintaining the dissolved oxygen level in the lakes. It is also the responsibility of citizens to maintain cleanliness of the lake. It’s high time we realized that lakes are natural resources and not dumping grounds. The NMC initiative is praiseworthy and we hope that soon, other lakes too will be cleaned,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/police-line-talao-to-get-new-lease-of-life-after-grant-from-gadkari/articleshow/82751045.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

Bhavnagar district officials confirmed five deaths on Tuesday. Tauktae wreaked havoc in the district with 8,638 kutcha (mud) houses and 725 pucca houses getting flattened. Three government buildings also suffered damage. At least 43 villages were the worst-hit by the cyclone with maximum damage inflicted in coastal talukas of Mahuva, Ghogha, Talaja and Bhavangar rural.  Around 30,000 people were evacuated before the cyclone made landfall.  The district continued to reel under strong winds gusting up to 80kmph on Tuesday too while it rained 161 mm in 12 hours ending 6pm. District collector Gaurang Makwana said, “Five people lost their lives because of heavy winds and nine animals also died.” Electricity supply was disrupted in 733 villages as 1,950 poles collapsed, but it was restored in 54 villages on Tuesday. An oxygen plant in Sihore was also provided with electricity on a war-footing. District administration teams and cops were busy removing trees that blocked the main roads after getting uprooted. Around 5,220 trees collapsed in the district. Officials clarified that there was uninterrupted electricity supply in 61 Covid hospitals. Luvara bridge on Shetrunji river in Gariyadhar taluka was closed for traffic after water level was increased above 24 foot. The nearby villages were also alerted looking to the increasing water level in the river. Six workers were trapped in Bhagavati Salt Pan and rescued. In Amreli, 18 Covid hospitals were on the edge as electricity supply was badly hit across the district which was in the direct line of Tauktae and experienced wind speeds going up to 160 kmph on Monday night. According to official figures, 43 sub-station of 66 KV out of 73 were out of order and electricity went off in all the 603 villages. It was expected to be restored in the next one or two days. Around 48 urban feeders and 138 Jyotigram feeders were damaged while 2,610 electricity poles came crashing down. PGVCL has prioritized power supply to the hospitals but looking to the extent of devastation, immediate restoration looked difficut . Collector Ayush Oak could not be contacted despite several efforts Rajula and Jafrabad taluka were the worst hit and formal communication channel also collapsed. Around 145 internal roads were blocked due to uprooted trees and 19 teams were engaged in clearing the blockages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/after-battering-struggle-to-recover/articleshow/82747187.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

With the fresh stock, district health officials here told TOI that inoculation sessions would resume in both the Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad civic limits from Wednesday. Inoculation was suspended in both the areas for two days because of vaccine shortage. An additional 1 lakh doses of Covaxin were also given to the districts. The stock was 75% less than what is required to give second doses of the vaccine to those due in Maharashtra. Maharashtra immunization officer Dr D N Patil told TOI, “The 2 lakh Covishield doses that we distributed on Tuesday were from the state’s vaccine quota (directly purchased from manufacturers) and will be utilized on priority for second jabs (45+ age group) of those due. The rest will be used for the first shots of this age group. We received another Covaxin lot from the Centre’s quota, which too has been distributed to the districts. This lot will be used only for the second doses of Covaxin recipients who are due.” Another health department official told TOI that supplies of vaccines are expected to increase by the end of May in state, with nearly 20 lakh Covishield doses expected for Maharashtra and 2 lakh for Pune district, directly procured from manufacturers. “There are still about 4.5 lakh Covaxin recipients who are due for the second doses in Maharashtra. The 1 lakh doses distributed on Tuesday from the central supply will fall short, as they will cover only 25% of those due for second doses,” a state health department official told TOI. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI, “Pune district received 7,400 doses of Covaxin on Tuesday. Of this, Pune rural has got a share of 3,400 Covaxin doses, PMC 2,500 and PCMC 1,500. These doses have been provided entirely for second doses. Since we have received the doses now, vaccination will restart in Pune from Wednesday.” Of the 20,500 Covishield doses, Pune rural has received 9,000 doses, PMC 7,500 and PCMC 4,000. “Covishield will be used for both first and second doses. as the number of those who have to receive second jabs (of Covishield) has reduced after the increased interval between two doses of this vaccine,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maha-distributes-2l-covishield-doses-among-dists-pmr-gets-20500-shots/articleshow/82751038.cms||Neha Madaan

Additional chief secretary (health) Pratyaya Amrit said letters in this regard were sent by the health department to the administration of the two major hospitals on Tuesday. The decision was taken in the wake of spike in the cases of the fatal disease. Amrit said in a briefing on Tuesday that Bihar has registered 56 cases of black fungus so far, including 24 at AIIMS-Patna and 10 at IGIMS He said AIIMS-P and IGIMS have been designated as centres of excellence for mucormycosis based on guidelines issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on May 9. Mucormycosis is a fungal infection that mainly affects people who are on medication for other health problems that reduces their ability to fight environmental pathogens. The advisory for ‘screening, diagnosis and management’ of the disease mentions that mucormycosis, if uncared for, may turn fatal. Sinuses or lungs of such individuals get affected after fungal spores are inhaled from the air. “The establishment of centre of excellence for treatment of mucormycosis at a healthcare facility requires several specialists, including a microbiologist, biochemist, ENT specialist, dentist and orthopaedic. The two hospitals – AIIMS-P and IGIMS –fulfil all thse criteria. Hence, they have been made the centres of excellence for treatment of black fungus,” Amrit said. He added few hospitals in the state have been sent Amphotericin-B injection for treatment of patients suffering from mucormycosis. “Based on recommendations from a committee comprising experts from AIIMS-P and IGIMS, a letter was sent to the Union ministry of health and family welfare on May 14 to allow use of Amphotericin-B injections in treatment of mucormycosis. We were given the approval for the same on Monday, though a formal letter for the same is expected to arrive anytime,” Amrit said. Earlier on May 16, health minister Mangal Pandey had tweetd that 6,000 doses of Amphotericin-B injection have been sent by the health department to various government and private health facilities in the state to treat black fungus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/aiims-p-igims-to-treat-black-fungus-infections/articleshow/82749427.cms||Piyush Tripathi

Interacting virtually with village panchayats represented by more than 2,000 heads/members across over 4,000 live locations in the state through LED screens, the chief minister informed them that his government had already sanctioned permission for sarpanches to utilize up to Rs 5,000 per day from panchayat funds for emergency Covid-19 treatment, up to a maximum of Rs 50,000. He asked the sarpanches and panches to start ‘theekri pehra’ in their villages to prevent infected persons from entering, and also distribute Fateh Kits to every person who tests positive, besides ensuring proper treatment in case oxygen saturation level goes below 94%. He also urged villagers to immediately quarantine themselves in case of any symptoms and get themselves tested to ensure early detection of the infection. He added that the state government was making all-out efforts to procure sufficient stocks of vaccine from various sources for inoculation of 18+ age group, besides constantly pursuing with Centre for more vaccine doses for those above 45 years. He said earlier when the state government had an adequate supply of vaccines, people were not forthcoming for inoculation, but now the trend was reversed, with people coming in huge numbers. The CM exhorted villagers to strictly adhere to the health protocols and guidelines issued by the state government from time to time. He said the state government had set up 24x7 helpline ‘104’ for assistance, with all the home isolation patients being monitored through daily calls by health teams.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/rs-10l-for-punjabb-villages-with-100-vaccination-cover-cm/articleshow/82753153.cms||---

The world’s largest shipbreaking yard at Alang in the district too has witnessed noticeable damage. However, there were no reports of casualties of workers as they had been shifted to safer places, said industry players. The exact estimate of damage, according to industry bodies, can be known only after a day or two as most of the business owners in these towns could not access their units on Tuesday. “Our primary estimate suggests a minimum loss of Rs 25-30 lakh to each onion dehydration unit on account of damage to stored raw onions, finished goods, and structural damage to cold storages,” said All India Dehydration Association president Manoj Ram, who also owns an onion dehydration business in Mahuva. Ram added: “On average, the industry has suffered a cumulative loss of at least Rs 40-50 crore.” There are about 125 dehydration units in Mahuva and the town accounts for 80% of onions dehydrated in India. Each unit had a stock of raw onions ranging from 5,000 to 50,000 bags, which has been affected. “Apart from this, roofs of several cold storages have been blown away affecting the finished goods stored there,” Ram said. The town has 50-55 cold storages. The onion dehydration units are unlikely to resume operations for at least a week, he said. “The situation is very bad in Bhavnagar, Talaja, and Mahuva. Roofs of several cold storages have been blown away,” said Kirit Soni, president, Saurashtra Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Soni added: “Goods such as dehydrated onions, dry fruits, and other food items stored in these cold storages are feared to have been impacted.” Bhavnagar houses about 100 cold storages. Meanwhile, industrial units in areas such as Alang, Rajula, Jafrabad and Bhavnagar town have been hit hard. “The Alang shipbreaking yard has witnessed massive damage to infrastructure as sheds as well as solar panels have been blown away by gusty winds,” said Haresh Parmar, secretary, Ship Recycling Industries Association of India (SRIA). Alang currently has 135 operational plots and 70-80 ships await dismantling at the shipbreaking yard, where activity was stopped for a month due to the non-availability of industrial oxygen. “Although the infrastructure has been damaged, the exact loss can be ascertained only after some time,” said Vishnu Kumar Gupta, president, SRIA. Steel re-rolling mills across Sihor in Bhavnagar remained closed . Similarly, about 200 units in Dahej and Vilayat were shut due to the disruption in power supply. “There was not much impact on industrial units in Kutch district,” said Nimish Phadke, MD, Federation of Kutch Industries’ Association (FOKIA).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/onion-dehydration-units-battered-alang-infra-hit/articleshow/82751050.cms||---

In a chain of philanthropic actions by people who were strangers to each other, help was mobilized from Nagpur through an all-women ‘WE7 Care foundation’ which ensured delivery of food to the Mumbai-based family of an IT engineer. It’s learnt, a woman posted a message in a social group having around 152 members helping others during the pandemic, requesting for food delivery to the family fighting Covid-19. She was approached by a colleague of the IT engineer. “My two brothers, father and me are admitted to the hospital. We wanted some nutritious food at the hospital and hence we requested a colleague to do something. It was really intriguing that help was routed from Nagpur to Mumbai,” said the IT engineer. The local group member contacted one Vikash Sharma from Mumbai, who had posted a message on Facebook offering help to anyone during the pandemic. Sharma, who has a group of around 350 social workers, contacted like-minded hotelier Nagesh Shetty from south Mumbai to help the family at Saint George hospital near CST railway station. “I twice delivered food to the family of four after getting a call as my hotel is close to the hospital,” said Shetty. Social worker Neerja Pathania, who had taken up the initiative, said the motto of their group was to help those in need during the pandemic without knowing each other.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nagpur-group-helps-covid-patient-in-mumbai-get-food/articleshow/82751059.cms||Soumitra Bose

---||Pune||Govt to soon decide if Covid-cured should wait 6-9 months for jab: Experts||PUNE: Tweaking India’s vaccination strategy by delaying jabs of those who have recovered from Covid by a few months will free up lakhs of doses for those without infection-induced antibodies, a senior member of a top government panel on Covid said on Tuesday, adding that the country can expect a decision on the matter soon. The panel member, requesting anonymity, said, “It is yet to be decided if the deferment interval (between recovery and vaccination) should be six or nine months. A decision on this period is likely in the next couple of days. It will be based on how long antibodies last after infection. Scientific evidence, in the Indian context, is being studied to assess how long antibodies survive during a six to nine-month period after Covid infection.” The official said a decision to delay vaccinations for those who have had Covid is based on the premise that they already have substantial antibody levels. “During the Covid peak, nearly 3 lakh infections were being recorded daily, which meant nearly one crore cases per month. If vaccination is deferred for this group, it will help save an equal number of doses for the period it has been deferred for this chunk of population,” the official said. Dr Gagandeep Kang, one of the country’s leading experts on vaccines, said there is evidence that supports delayed vaccination in the recovered. “Data from the SIREN (Sarscov2 Immunity & REinfection EvaluatioN) study in the UK shows people who were previously infected with Covid had at least seven months of good protection from severe disease. The WHO recommends that in a time of vaccine scarcity, previously infected people can wait six months after infection to be vaccinated,” she said. Dr Naveen Thacker, president-elect of the International Pediatric Association (IPA), said, “Those who have recovered can get the shot 14 days after recovery as they will not infect others any more. But a longer interval is advised for a better immune response — four to eight weeks or even after six months. This is because immunity in such cases has already been triggered after infection.” Dr Thacker added, “If people who have recovered do take a shot too early, there are chances of mild reactogenicity or minor side effects, but they may not be serious. We also believe that someone who has had Covid recently doesn’t need more than one dose due to immunity induced by natural infection.” The Covid panel member said though the possibility is remote, vaccination close to Covid recovery could even neutralize a vaccine dose. He added that the government is also setting up a tracking platform to determine vaccine performance, frequency of breakthrough events (infection despite vaccination) and their severity. The official confirmed that the platform should be ready in a couple of weeks, with weekly briefings based on data to be released into the public domain. "Some decisions on vaccination could be revisited after studying this data. The information can help us decide if one dose is enough or if interval between doses should be reduced," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/govt-to-soon-decide-if-covid-cured-should-wait-6-9-mths-for-jab-experts/articleshow/82751051.cms||Neha Madaan

On Tuesday, Tauktae wreaked havoc in Gir and other areas of Saurashtra, uprooting thousands of trees. It is the peak nesting season for many birds, especially the insectivores. Visuals of juvenile cattle egrets, herons, and other birds being crushed to death after falling from treetops have offered a glimpse of the terrible destruction the cyclone has brought to Greater Gir. The area is part of the Asiatic lion landscape today. Tauktae has destroyed as many as 40,000 trees that lay in its path, especially in Saurashtra region, according to state government sources. “Herons, egrets, and cormorants build nests in large colonies in trees and hence they faced a greater threat from the cyclone,” said Uday Vora, a retired forest officer and an avid birder. Uprooting of one tree could lead to the destruction of as many as three hundred nests, he said. In Babra, about 650 small birds resembling chicks of babblers and sparrows have succumbed to the cyclone, he said. He said that it was nesting time in Gir for small insectivorous birds including black drongo and golden oriole. In Amreli, seven to eight trees with a large number of parakeet nests had been uprooted, he said. Several videos were circulating on social media on Tuesday showing scores of dead birds. Dushyant Vasavada, chief conservator of forests, Junagadh division, said that till Tuesday evening there were no reports of any substantial harm to wildlife inside the Gir sanctuary area. The sanctuary has been closed for visitors for some time now due to the pandemic. The sanctuary is home to over 300 species of birds, both resident and migratory. About half of these species have their nesting sites in Gir at different times of the year. This is the nesting season for king vulture, according to Vora. In a video showing a temple site at Jasdan, hundreds of small birds are seen lying dead on the ground, hit by the cyclone. The video suggests that the death count is about 2,000. The state forest department on Tuesday rescued 89 cattle egrets from Fulwadi Ashram in Chamardi village of Vallabhipur taluka in Saurashtra, according to a senior forest department official. “The cyclone could have killed thousands of birds. It will be difficult to arrive at any estimate given that the destruction is so widespread,” said another government official.

---||Varanasi||Tyre, petrol used to cremate body in Ballia; five cops suspended||Varanasi: Five police constables of Fefna police station in Ballia were suspended by SP Vipin Tada on Tuesday for their insensitivity, after a video showing tyres and petrol being used by a man to cremate a body found in the Ganga in their presence went viral on social media. SP Ballia Vipin Tada told TOI on Tuesday, “The video depicting insensitivity of the cops was shared widely on social media on Monday. I sought details from Fefna police station and the five policemen seen standing near the body were identified and suspended with immediate effect today. ASP Ballia has been asked to probe the incident.” Initial probe revealed that the incident had taken place at Maldepur ghat under Fefna police station in Ballia district on Monday morning after a decomposed body had washed ashore. The five police constables had called a local and asked him to cremate the body. The video showed the man also using a tyre and throwing petrol on the pyre while cremating the body. The video showing insensitivity went viral at a time when the issue of floating bodies in the Ganga and its tributaries amid Covid menace has created a stir, left senior police and administration officials ruffled. The administration and police have already launched a massive drive to check the practice of immersion of bodies in rivers. Varanasi divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal said, “When bodies were spotted in rivers we deployed teams along rivers and at cremation ghats in rural belts to make people aware not disposing bodies in rivers and to inform them that provisions have been made from state finance commission to bear the cost of cremation by local bodies if the kin are in financial distress.” Bodies were found floating in rivers in Ghazipur and Ballia after Buxar administration and Bihar police claimed over 70 dead bodies had flown down from UP and put a net in the river. The Opposition used the issue to target the UP Government and even alleged under-reporting of Covid-19 deaths in the state. The administration then deployed police and PAC personnel to patrol the rivers on boats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/tyre-petrol-used-to-cremate-body-in-ballia-five-cops-suspended/articleshow/82751055.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

There were four committees — UNHRC, UNSC, WHO and IP — in the second edition of the event. Delegates in the UNHRC committee deliberated on the topic, ‘Human rights violations with special emphasis on freedom of expression with regards to journalistic safety’. In the UNSC committee, the delegates discussed “maintenance of peace and security with special emphasis on peace-building in post-conflict regions” and the WHO committee’s delegates debated “establishing preparedness protocols for epidemics and pandemics”. The debate was supervised and summarized in text by the International Press and the delegates were cross-questioned in the closing ceremony. A caricaturist depicted the discussions. The virtual MUN was conceptualized, planned and executed by students Kush Bhattacharya and Nakul Siddharth, with teachers Naomi Solanki and Dhanalaxmi Sutar. Several schools across India participated in MUN, which served as a stepping stone for delegates keen to participate in similar forthcoming events. MUN ended with the announcement of the awards, which were given to Siddharth Thadhani (Best delegate UNHRC), Bryan Lobo (Best Delegate UNSC), Parth Gupta (Best delegate WHO) and Shrisha Rananaware (Best Journalist). The MUN ended with art gallery video. Summer Camp — Mission Paani at EIS The Educon International School organized a summer camp to sensitise students about the importance of water conservation. Experts from the Paani Foundation delivered a talk. The Paani Foundation mobilizes and trains villages in Maharashtra to fight drought. Many activities were intertwined with the theme ‘Mission Paani’, such as dance and music, slogan and poster-making, creative expression (skit, elocution, story weaving), research and analysis (surveys, debate, panel discussion). EIS students made a water filter using materials available at home. This easy method of filtration helps in conservation of water as the used and filtered water can be reused for watering plants, cleaning verandahs, among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pawar-public-school-amanora-hosts-second-e-mun/articleshow/82749380.cms||---

---||Pune||Pune: Vaccination drive to resume today, focus on better management at jab sites||PUNE: The civic body has issued guidelines for better management of its vaccination drive, as inoculation is set to resume on Wednesday following arrival of fresh stock of doses. The Maharashtra government on Tuesday distributed about 2 lakh Covishield doses among all districts, with Pune, Thane and Mumbai getting the maximum share. With the arrival of the fresh stock of vaccines, health officials said inoculation sessions would resume in both the Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad civic limits from Wednesday. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) on Tuesday issued guidelines for better management at the vaccination centres. The PMC made it clear that only those registered on CoWin should be allowed at the vaccination sites and directed its officials to file criminal offences against people creating any nuisance at the facilities. An official said the guidelines were expected to reduce confusions caused by the token system introduced by people with political affiliation. Only civic officials would be allowed to give tokens to beneficiaries for any on-the-spot registration. The PMC has also finalized the priority list of the beneficiaries and stated that no advertisement or boards of any private entity should be allowed at the centre. The official said information about availability of vaccines and the type of vaccines should be on display at the sites. Such information should be shared with newspapers and other media outlets, the official said. Key facilitators should be appointed to help citizens such as those belonging to the nomadic and transgender community, prisoners, beggars, inmates of mental hospitals, priests and saints. “The orders have been issued in accordance with relevant sections of The Disaster Management Act, 200, and The Epidemic Disease Act, 1897,” PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/vax-drive-to-resume-today-pmc-issues-orders-for-better-management-at-jab-sites/articleshow/82751061.cms||Sarang Dastane

In fact, the presence of mobile tea sellers has drastically increased in the city now as many people who lost their livelihood after the lockdown have shifted to selling tea on wheels. S John Peter was a battery shop owner in Palakkarai before the lockdown forced him to explore other avenues to look after his family. Launching his tea sales as early as 4 am, John covers Gandhi market area on his bicycle serving the brew to labourers, vegetable vendors and fish market dealers. “I have provided my mobile numbers to the workers to call me whenever there is a need for tea. My family supports me in this new role as my shop has been remaining closed for weeks,” John told TOI. The tea sellers, equipped with containers on bicycles and two-wheelers, are concentrated around places such as hospitals, grocery shops, petrol bunks, pharmacies and even truck terminals during morning and evening. A cup of tea for Rs 10 finds more takers as the tea enthusiasts have no other go because of the shut outlets. With people like John Peter, who were in other businesses till the lockdown was clamped, resorting to tea sales, the number of mobile tea sellers on roads has gone up. S Kalaiselvan, who was a waiter at a restaurant in Cantonment, earns about Rs 400 a day now. “A few days ago, there were only a dozen mobile tea sellers. Now, as more people have taken to selling tea, my sales have come down marginally,” he said. The tea vendors said they are ensuring facemask during their sales.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/mobile-tea-vending-turns-boon-for-many-who-lost-job/articleshow/82751063.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Dehradun||Pithoragarh woman feeds strays in Dehradun amid lockdown||PITHORAGARH/DEHRADUN: Many good samaritans are playing saviour for strays during the Covid curfew when it has become difficult for animals on the road sto get food. Shruti Lohani, a resident of Pithoragarh town, is one such who has been looking after stray animals, dogs, monkeys and cows. During the pandemic’s first wave last year, when she noticed that the behaviour of stray dogs had changed due to the lockdown, she decided to feed them. This year, she has resumed the work and feeds strays at five intersections of the town. “When restaurants suddenly closed down last year and people disappeared from the streets, stray dogs, who survived on food given from eateries were stranded. They turned aggressive and were fighting among each other. I am an animal lover and seeing their friendly nature turn hostile, decided to collect food and start feeding strays at different points in the city. Once they have been fed, you can see a marked difference in a dog’s behaviour,” Lohani said. Like last year, Lohani has been collecting rice, bread, biscuits and other food items for the city’s dogs. However, she says her resources often get strained and she has to look out for people who can support her. “Seeing as the number of strays was growing at a high rate in the city, I suggested to the municipal board to sterilize some of the dogs. They allotted me a home for the purpose but due to some difficulties, the initiative hasn’t taken off yet,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/seeing-hungry-dogs-get-aggressive-pithoragarh-woman-starts-feeding-strays-in-city/articleshow/82749448.cms||Prem Punetha

---||Coimbatore||Daily caseload jumps by 60% in Tirupur||Tirupur district reported a record high of 1,561 fresh Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, sending health authorities and the public into a tizzy. At 60%, this is the sharpest spike ever in the district from 985 cases on Monday, when there was a marginal dip in the cases that had crossed the 1,000-mark past week. While the garment units had shut operations voluntarily from last Friday, the sharp rise in the cases is suspected to be a fallout of the spread that could have happened in the units past week. Now, Tirupur is the district with second highest daily caseload in the western region after Coimbatore and the sixth highest in the state. The total number of cases has breached the 39,000-mark in the district, which presently has 7,092 active cases. The district also reported three Covid deaths on the day. Health officials are perplexed over the sudden spike in cases and working out ways to handle the situation. With the district constantly reporting an increase in the daily caseload, the stress on the health infrastructure continues to grow as well. There are efforts to ramp up oxygen beds in Tirupur, where the shortage is acute. Presently, there are 800-odd oxygen beds in government and private hospitals. But the demand keeps growing and there are instances of patients waiting in ambulances for hours together for oxygen beds. After an oxygen bus was pressed into service to provide O2 for the patients waiting for beds, the district administration, with the help of industrial units and NGOs, is setting up a 112-O2 bed facility in Tirupur Kumaran college and another 30-O2 bed facility at an undisclosed location.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/daily-caseload-jumps-by-60-in-tirupur/articleshow/82751062.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Trichy||Snags in crematorium leave kin, ambulances waiting with bodies||Trichy: Poor maintenance and mismanagement of Trichy corporation’s electric crematorium in Oyamari are adding to the woes of distressed family members of Covid-19 victims. As the local body has been reluctant to improve the facilities in the crematorium since last year’s outbreak, snags continue to delay cremations forcing families to wait for up to five hours with the bodies.The delay, besides increasing the risk of spread also makes the ambulances carrying the bodies remain stationed, depriving those desperately looking for ambulances for hospitalisation. Established in 2004, the Oyamari electric crematorium situated on the banks of river Cauvery is sentimentally preferred by locals over other cremation grounds. Post the outbreak of Covid, the crematorium, from burning five to six bodies daily, is now handling 15, operating till 9.30pm.Although the surge was anticipated, the corporation failed to develop the facility. While there are two furnaces, only one works most of the time. Serpentine queue of ambulances is seen at the crematorium as it takes 45 minutes for a body to be completely cremated and another 15 minutes to recover the ashes. “Piles of domestic garbage are dumped near the furnaces attracting stray dogs and cattle,” said a 47-year-old man from E Pudur, who had come to cremate his uncle. Ambulance drivers said that they could not attend any distress calls until they handed over the body to the crematorium workers. Though a proposal was mooted in January to renovate the Oyamari ground at a cost of Rs 4 crore, the civic body reportedly did not approve the contingency plan. Three toilets in the facility remain unusable, forcing visitors to urinate and defecate in the open space.“Corporation will be directed to take up temporary arrangements for improving the facilities by providing a shed for families to wait. Officials will be told to set up a helpline to avoid crowding for cremation by diverting the willing families to other available crematoriums,” Inigo Irudhayaraj, Trichy East MLA said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/snags-in-crematorium-leave-kin-ambulances-waiting-with-bodies/articleshow/82751057.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Ajmer||44 ‘suspected’ Covid-19 deaths in 34 days in Rajasthan village||JAIPUR: Somalpur in Ajmer district is yet another rural village in Rajasthan that has recorded an unusually high number of deaths over 30 days. Since April 14, the village has recorded 44 deaths, mostly due to influenza-like illness, similar to Covid-19 symptoms. The cause of death is being recorded as ‘unknown’ or ‘cardiac arrest’. Since April 16, not a single day has passed in the village without recording at least one death, leaving its residents petrified. Initially, sarpanch Choga Nath had denied that the deaths were due to Covid in Somalpur. Later, when he was countered with facts, he admitted to the horror the village was facing every day. “Not a single corner of the village has been left untouched by the second wave. Other than 7-8 persons who died due to the disease in hospitals, the rest have all had symptoms like cold, cough, fever, etc,” he said. “It may be or may not be Covid,” Nath said. Former sarpanch Ikram Khan Cheetah says that over 60 graves have been dug in the past 30-40 days. “An aerial survey of all graveyards will give a clear picture. The death figures being quoted by elected representatives are a lie. By not acknowledging the problem, it is putting the lives of others in danger,” he said. "At least 10-15 persons are presently in hospital, 25-30 in self-quarantine and members of many families are showing influenza like illness (ILI) and are potential Covid patients," he claimed. The local administration has not acted as the data does not reflect the actual situation. Asha worker Geeta Kathat, who has 800 houses under her management, could track only 19 persons with ILI symptoms and has a record of 10 people in home quarantine. This is far from the situation on the ground. “The survey is done from what a family tells us and we have no mechanism to crosscheck the information received from a household,” she said. Dr Hukum Singh, the in-charge of the health and wellness centre at Somalpur, has prepared a report of every death and submitted it to the local administration. He has confirmed 44 deaths, including seven who passed away while fighting Covid. “Bahadur Cheetah, who died today morning had severe chest pain since Monday. But due to the fear of testing positive for Covid, he allowed his condition to deteriorate and revealed it only after damage has been done by the virus.

---||Jaipur||44 ‘suspected’ Covid-19 deaths in 34 days in Rajasthan village||JAIPUR: Somalpur in Ajmer district is yet another rural village in Rajasthan that has recorded an unusually high number of deaths over 30 days. Since April 14, the village has recorded 44 deaths, mostly due to influenza-like illness, similar to Covid-19 symptoms. The cause of death is being recorded as ‘unknown’ or ‘cardiac arrest’. Since April 16, not a single day has passed in the village without recording at least one death, leaving its residents petrified. Initially, sarpanch Choga Nath had denied that the deaths were due to Covid in Somalpur. Later, when he was countered with facts, he admitted to the horror the village was facing every day. “Not a single corner of the village has been left untouched by the second wave. Other than 7-8 persons who died due to the disease in hospitals, the rest have all had symptoms like cold, cough, fever, etc,” he said. “It may be or may not be Covid,” Nath said. Former sarpanch Ikram Khan Cheetah says that over 60 graves have been dug in the past 30-40 days. “An aerial survey of all graveyards will give a clear picture. The death figures being quoted by elected representatives are a lie. By not acknowledging the problem, it is putting the lives of others in danger,” he said. "At least 10-15 persons are presently in hospital, 25-30 in self-quarantine and members of many families are showing influenza like illness (ILI) and are potential Covid patients," he claimed. The local administration has not acted as the data does not reflect the actual situation. Asha worker Geeta Kathat, who has 800 houses under her management, could track only 19 persons with ILI symptoms and has a record of 10 people in home quarantine. This is far from the situation on the ground. “The survey is done from what a family tells us and we have no mechanism to crosscheck the information received from a household,” she said. Dr Hukum Singh, the in-charge of the health and wellness centre at Somalpur, has prepared a report of every death and submitted it to the local administration. He has confirmed 44 deaths, including seven who passed away while fighting Covid. “Bahadur Cheetah, who died today morning had severe chest pain since Monday. But due to the fear of testing positive for Covid, he allowed his condition to deteriorate and revealed it only after damage has been done by the virus. Those with symptoms are hiding their illness, which in many case is leading to their deaths,” he said. TOI repeatedly called up Ajmer collector Prakash Rajpurohit and CMHO K K Soni but received no response.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/44-suspected-covid-fatalities-in-34-days/articleshow/82751064.cms||Shoeb Khan
---||Nagpur||Fake DL racket busted, terror angle to be probed||Nagpur: Nagpur rural police and Regional Transport Office (rural) claimed to have busted a racket of fake driving licence by arresting one Nawab Jamir Baig, a resident of Mouda, on Monday. The joint team of police and RTO also seized a computer, printer, photo paper, eight fake driving licences, and material being used to print licences and other materials worth Rs 65,040. Assistant motor vehicle inspector Amit Karad said the raid was carried out after a citizen tipped off the Mouda police that Baig, who runs a photo studio in the city, used to prepare fake driving licence. Subsequently, the police along with a team of rural RTO laid a trap and on Monday raided Baig’s studio. “During a search of the premises, we recovered substantial evidence of Baig being involved in making fake driving licences,” he said. Sources said that the police would also investigate whether the fake licences prepared by Baig were being used to provide fake identity to anti-social elements in terror activities in the country. The Maharashtra police had found a similar fake driving licence from the German bakery bomb blast accused in Pune in 2010. Meanwhile, the Kalamna police have made no headway into the bogus four-wheeler registration certificates complaint filed by deputy RTO Vinod Jadhav. In the month of March, Jadhav had filed a complaint after his east Nagpur office had recovered seven fake four-wheeler registration certificates. “There is no progress into the case,” said Jadhav.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fake-dl-racket-busted-terror-angle-to-be-probed/articleshow/82751072.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Nagpur||Rise in awareness about nature loss as eco-wakening grips globe||Nagpur: New global research conducted by Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) and commissioned by WWF shows that public interest and concern for nature has risen markedly (16%) in the past five years (2016-2020) and continues to grow during the Covid-19 pandemic. The figures come ahead of International Day for Biodiversity May 22, celebrated by the UN to increase understanding and awareness of biodiversity issues. People all over the world, particularly in developing economies, are increasingly aware of the planetary crisis, and this is affecting their behaviour in a rapidly growing global mood that WWF has dubbed an ‘eco-wakening’. In a clear validation of a growing trend, individuals concerned and consumers are acting on their concerns and demanding action over nature loss and biodiversity in an assortment of ways. The report entitled ‘An eco-wakening: Measuring global awareness, engagement, and action for nature’ shows digital activism at play with a 65% increase in the number of Twitter mentions, amplifying concern for nature worldwide, with mentions of nature and biodiversity increasing from 30 million to 50 million in the last four years. A variety of influencers such as spiritual leaders, politicians, major news organizations and celebrities, have used their voice on behalf of nature, including the Pope, the BBC, and The New York Times, with social media posts reaching a combined audience of almost 1billion people worldwide. The research also reveals that consumers are voting with their Google clicks that are showing the growing popularity of nature-related searches driven primarily by Asian countries such as Indonesia (53%) and India (190%). Additionally, increasingly large numbers of people see nature loss as a serious global problem, with 96% of respondents located in Latin America indicating this, the highest of any region surveyed. This shift in public sentiment reflects a hard reality, as people in emerging markets are most likely to experience the devastating impacts from the loss of nature. Building on an era of protests and petitions, more consumers all over the world are now changing their behaviour, such as amending their purchasing habits in line with their values. The analysis found a staggering 71% rise in popularity of searches for sustainable goods since 2016, in high-income countries, such as the UK, the US, Germany, Australia, and Canada. However, the trend goes beyond these countries - in fact it has also accelerated in developing economies. This pressure is forcing corporations to respond, particularly in the cosmetics, pharmaceutical, fashion, and food sectors. But despite the extraordinary speed of its destruction, nature is rarely at the top of the global agenda, even though its loss represents a huge threat to the global economy and our health. “The results of this research are crystal clear. Concern over the impact we are having on the natural world is growing rapidly and particularly in emerging markets, where people are feeling more acutely the impacts of deforestation, unsustainable fishing, species extinction and the decline of ecosystems,” said Marco Lambertini, director-general of WWF International. Lambertini continues: “The science and the economics are clear. The public sentiment is now clear. And - the solutions are clear too. Society is supporting a transformation of our economic and development model towards one that finally values nature as our moral duty to all life on Earth, and for the crucial services it provides to our economy, wellbeing, health, and security. This is a truly historic ‘eco-wakening’ and the chance to rebalance our relationship with the planet.” Loss of nature is increasing our vulnerability to pandemics, undermining efforts to tackle the climate crisis, and threatening livelihoods. Leaders are scheduled to make critical decisions later this year on climate and the environment. Together, they represent a momentous opportunity to reverse biodiversity loss and secure a nature-positive world this decade, in support of climate action and the sustainable development goals. ACTION FOR NATURE * Research shows an undeniable shift in behaviour in response to planetary crisis * Concern about loss of animal and plant species increased from 82% to 90% in India and the popularity of Google searches relating to nature loss and biodiversity grew by 190% in the country * A staggering 71% rise in popularity of searches for sustainable goods over the past five years, even during the Covid-19 pandemic, worldwide||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rise-in-awareness-about-nature-loss-as-eco-wakening-grips-globe/articleshow/82775493.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

A few parts of the Pudukkottai district also received substantial rainfall as an effect of the cyclonic storm over the Arabian Sea. While the daytime saw a sultry ambiance with no sign of downpour, the city witnessed dark clouds laying a blanket in the evening. About 7 pm, summer showers accompanied by thunderstorms lashed Rockfort, Ponmalai, Cantonment, and Melapudur localities. Ponmalai and Trichy airport received 32 mm and 28 mm rainfall. The sudden downpour had disrupted electricity distribution for a brief period till midnight on EB Road and Big Bazaar Street. The core city and parts of Thuraiyur, Navalur Kottapattu and Manapparai received ample rainfall. Viralimalai in Pudukkottai district received 40 mm rainfall till Tuesday morning, the highest recorded rainfall in the state. Independent weather blogger N Selvakumar said that the summer rainfall was an effect of Cyclone Taukte. He added that the central region is unlikely to get further rainfall on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-city-receives-summer-showers/articleshow/82751065.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Cyclone Tauktae: Forest department to carry out survey for missing lions||AHMEDABAD: Cyclone Tauktae cast its destructive shadow on wildlife in the state, too. At least 18 lions were reported missing from the coastal districts of Amreli, Gir-Somnath, and Bhavnagar which bore the maximum brunt of the cyclone. Senior forest officials said that 18 lions were reported missing from Rajula and Jafrabad talukas in Amreli, Una and Kodinar talukas in Gir-Somnath and Mahuva taluka in Bhavnagar. The three districts are reportedly home to 40 lions. While there was apprehension over the fate of the missing animals, many hoped that the big cats had taken refuge in high altitude areas. In fact, considering that Saurashtra — the only abode of Asiatic lions in the world — was severely battered by a severe cyclone, the forest department will undertake a comprehensive survey of all the 674 lions last counted in the 2020 Purnima Avalokan exercise. “Cyclone Tauktae affected almost all the districts in Saurashtra. Forest beat guards and officials have been directed to report about the well-being of all 674 lions which were counted in the last informal census held in 2020,” said a senior officer. It needs to be mentioned that of the 674 lions, some 340 reside outside Gir sanctuary in the revenue areas of neighbouring districts namely Amreli, Bhavnagar, Porbandar, Gir-Somnath, and parts of Junagadh. Experts said that in the past lions are reported to have climbed hillocks and moved to the safety of higher altitudes in a bid to escape flooding. “During the Amreli flash floods in 2015, 20 lions had gone missing. Of these, 14 died while the rest were found sitting on hillocks,” said a senior forest official. Local experts, however, were apprehensive whether the lions were equipped to sense a major adverse event like an extremely severe cyclone. “Such a natural calamity has seldom occurred on the Saurashtra coast. Hence one is not sure of how the lions may have behaved in its wake,” said a lion expert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/forest-dept-to-carry-out-survey-for-missing-lions/articleshow/82751089.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

A mobile team from the city corporation took the tests in the presence of police in a bid to deter people from stepping out of their houses during the total lockdown. A corporation official, who was part of the mobile testing team, said the chances of identifying infected people are high in random sampling. However, a similar approach was not followed in other parts of the city. Further to check any assembly of the crowd, the city police used a drone camera on Cross Cut Road and Oppanakkara Street. The city police booked 1,100 cases under the Motor Vehicle Act and 400 cases for Covid-19 norm violations. “We used a drone camera on Dr Nanjappa Road - Gandhipuram Junction stretch and Cross Cut road. Based on the drone camera footage, we sent our team to various places to prevent the violation of Covid-19 norms,” assistant commissioner of police (central sub-division) Premanand said. Deputy commissioner of police (law & order) G Stalin said, “People should visit nearby shops to buy essential needs. They should avoid coming to streets and co-operate with the state government to contain the spread of Covid-19.” Watch Coimbatore: Corpn officials make lockdown violators undergo Covid testing||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/corpn-officials-make-lockdown-violators-undergo-covid-testing/articleshow/82751068.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||601 more PG seats expected in Maharashtra state med colleges in 2022-23||Mumbai: Medical aspirants seeking admissions to MD/MS courses in the 2022-23 academic year are likely to have 601 more seats to choose from in government colleges in Maharashtra. The state has proposed to increase seats across 15 colleges by 23% based on their current infrastructure. At least six government medical colleges, which offered only undergraduate courses till now, will also add some of the sought-after postgraduate courses including general surgery, community medicine (relevant in a pandemic), anaesthesia and pathology. Seats will also be added to existing courses in some colleges. Currently, Maharashtra has around 2,651 postgraduate medical seats. A proposal to increase the number of seats has already been sent to the National Medical Commission (NMC). At JJ Hospital’s Grant Medical College, the state has proposed to add 92 seats, the highest number in any medical college. Since Grant Medical College uses the infrastructure in GT, Cama and St George hospitals along with JJ —which adds up to a total bed capacity of 2,800 —it has the requisite number of faculty and beds to add more seats, said Dr T P Lahane, director, Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER). He said the state needs more doctors, especially to handle a pandemic like the ongoing Covid-19. “More PG seats will add to our manpower. We have proposed to increase the seats by almost 25% in colleges which meet the NMC criteria for beds and faculty,” Dr Lahane added. The increase in seats will be approved by the NMC after inspection. Postgraduate courses will be introduced in government medical colleges (GMCs) in Chandrapur, Jalgaon and Gondia. BJ Medical College in Pune, another sought-after institute, will see seats going up by 63 in 15 subjects. Of the total 601 seats, 577 are proposed in GMCs and 24 in a civic-run college in Pune. Around 45-65 seats will go up in courses in general surgery, pathology, and community medicine (see box). The Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS) has also given its consent of affiliation for the increase in seats. “Earlier people visited a general practitioner for minor illnesses, but now they prefer going to specialists. There is a huge demand for specialised doctors and there is also a national policy encouraging colleges to add more seats, wherever possible. The state has added several hundred seats in the last two years,” said K D Chavan, registrar, MUHS. Ajay Bhamare, whose son is in final-year MBBS, said that it is a welcome move and will help more students pursue postgraduate courses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/601-more-pg-seats-expected-in-maharashtra-state-med-colleges-in-2022-23/articleshow/82753359.cms||Yogita Rao
---||Ahmedabad||Cyclone Tauktae: Rain washes out 30 lakh tonnes of salt in Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: The unseasonal rainfall brought by Tauktae to Gujarat on Tuesday has caused a loss of 30 lakh tonnes of salt. At least 15 lakh tonnes lying on salt mounds in various parts of the state couldn’t be moved ahead of the cyclone and was destroyed, according to Indian Salt Manufacturers’ Association (ISMA). The remaining 15 lakh tonnes will be the production loss as the salt production season is now curtailed. The salt production season typically lasts from October to the initial half of June, roughly 8-8.5 months. “There was more than 5 inches of rainfall in various parts of Saurashtra and the entire stock of harvested salt could not be moved from the salt mounds,” said Bharat Raval, president, ISMA. “This is a clear loss of labour. Moreover, with such heavy rainfall, the remaining salt production season has been completely wiped out.” Raval said more salt production cannot be achieved as the land will take time to dry. “Before the onset of the monsoon, the process will not be completed,” he said. According to estimates, salt manufacturing is gravely impacted in the coastal belts of Amreli, Junagadh, Bhavnagar, and Bharuch districts. “The situation was more or less the same in Maliya taluka of Morbi district, which is one of the salt production hubs in the state,” said Dilubhai Jadeja, president, Maliya Salt Manufacturers’ Association. “We are yet to assess the damage to the infrastructure because heavy rainfall has rendered the roads to the desert hinterlands unapproachable.” Jadeja added: “But a lot of stock of salt is bound to get washed away.” The adverse impact came as a double whammy for salt manufacturers who were already reeling from production shortfall due to a delayed salt production season. Gujarat produces at least 75% of the total salt in India. The salt production season typically lasts from October up to the second week of June. In 2019-20, Gujarat produced 1.9 crore tonnes of salt and this year, the production was expected to decline by 20% due to the delayed season. The figure will further reduce by 15% as a consequence of the washout caused by Tauktae.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rain-washes-out-30-lakh-tonnes-of-salt/articleshow/82751067.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra tops 2 crore shots, but only 5% adults get full dose||MUMBAI: Maharashtra’s milestone of 2 crore vaccinations reached on Monday —the highest by any state—translates into barely 5% coverage of the adult population with both doses. Experts said the state must vaccinate with a greater degree of urgency to prevent a severe third wave. The state has an estimated adult population of 8.5 crore to be vaccinated, of which 2,00,90,308 (18%) have got at least one dose and 42.77 lakh both doses. In the age group of 45 years and above, around 39.5% have got at least one dose, but only around 8% have received both. Above 92% healthcare workers have been covered with one dose while 72% have got both the shots. Of frontliners, 89% have got one dose and 52% have got both. Mumbai leads among Maha districts with 28.9 lakh shotsMaharashtra has covered 5% of its adult population with both doses. States like Kerala, Gujarat and Rajasthan have all done between 7%-8% complete vaccinations. But states with populations comparable to Maharashtra such as Bihar have given both shots to just 2%. Uttar Pradesh, the most populous state, has covered less than 2.5% with both doses. Within Maharashtra, Mumbai is leading among districts with 28.92 lakh vaccinations, followed by Pune (26.17 lakh), Thane (15.28 lakh) and Nagpur (12.20 lakh). Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary, told TOI the state has the capability to administer 7 lakh to 8 lakh doses a day, but vaccine unavailability has slowed down the drive. “We can even go up to 10 lakh doses a day, provided we get doses,” he said. On Monday, the state administered fewer than 1 lakh doses (99,699). A member of the state task force said Maharashtra must consider more targeted vaccination of those working in markets and public transport, who are in touch with people, if they want to see an impact on disease severity. From the most mobile age group of 18-44, just 1% have got the vaccine so far. Mumbai on Tuesday saw a lukewarm response to its walkin drive for 60+ although vaccination opened after three days. 16,754 stepped out, including 9,474 senior citizens. Prashant Gaikwad, assistant municipal commissioner, D ward, said the response was poor for the walk-in drive. The drive was on at four centres in the ward, and each centre had 100 slots available. On an average, 40-45 people turned out at these centres, he said. Similarly, in Goregaon, a few centres remained shut due to leakage following rain. Medical officer of health Dr Nitesh Thakur said many may have stayed home anticipating bad weather. AMC Suresh Kakani said they expect footfall to increase on Wednesday. The walk-in option could be extended till Thursday as Monday’s drive had to be cancelled, said Dr Mangala Gomare, executive health officer. She added healthcare and frontliners wanting to take the first dose have to book online appointments hereon, though they can walk in for2nd dose. Dr Dilip Patil, state immunisation officer, said Maharashtra has received 2 lakh doses of Covishield and one lakh of Covaxin, which should sustain the drive for a few days. Mumbai has received 19,000 doses of Covishield and 6,000 of Covaxin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-leads-among-maha-districts-with-28-9-lakh-shots/articleshow/82751207.cms||Sumitra Debroy

---||India||Never exported vaccines at the cost of people of India: SII||MUMBAI: Defending its decision to export vaccines, Serum Institute of India (SII) said on Tuesday that it was based on several factors, including the build-up of a large stockpile in January, while cases were at an all-time low in India, and in the spirit of mutual cooperation. “We would like to reiterate that we have never exported vaccines at the cost of the people in India and remain committed to do everything we can in support of the vaccination drive in the country,” the company said in a statement. Faced with vaccine shortages, the company as well as the government has faced flak over large quantities of exports at a time when India needed doses to vaccinate its population against the deadly virus that was first spotted in China. The company plans to resume deliveries to Covax, and honour its commitments to other countries by the end of this year. “The cooperation between countries also forms the basis for us getting access to technology and aid for healthcare,” the SII statement said. The support and cooperation between countries has also shaped India’s pandemic response since its start in 2020. “Today, it is this reciprocity, where India has helped other countries with the supply of HCQ and vaccine exports, that has in turn led to support from other countries.” It was important at that time (January) as several countries were facing an acute crisis and were in desperate need of help. “Our government extended support wherever possible during this period. It is this spirit that had initially led to cooperation between countries when the virus first emerged in the beginning of 2020.” The company said it delivered 200 million doses till now, making it amongst the top three manufacturers globally. This is despite the fact that it received emergency authorisation approval two months after the US pharma companies. “We continue to scale up manufacturing and prioritise India,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/never-exported-vaccines-at-the-cost-of-people-of-india-sii/articleshow/82756488.cms||---

But three such vessels hired by ONGC and a drill ship owned by the state-run company going adrift after breaking loose from anchors due to cyclone Tauktae raises questions whether its severity was underestimated or the tempest deviated from its predicted path with a sudden drop in pressure. People in the know told TOI the ‘Master’ of each vessel takes a call after evaluating warnings. “The Master, based on weather inputs, may decide that moving ‘X’ nautical miles away from the projected path of a cyclone will be safe. Here saving human lives and not infrastructure takes precedence,” a former ONGC executive said requesting anonymity. Company insiders said the cyclone deviated from its projected path and there was a sudden dip in pressure, creating more intense conditions than were anticipated. But weathermen said there were enough warnings about the intensity. Cyclones are known to deviate and that is why error margins are taken when deciding on a safe distance from the path. “An accommodation vessel is as high as three-storeyed building. Each has eight anchors of 3-4 km length. Lifting them takes several days as these have to be pulled by other vessels and then winched on the barge. Same is the case while dropping anchor,” an ex-member of a barge crew told TOI. Former ONGC director Ved Prakash Mahawar said: “Suppose a well is being drilled at 4,000-feet depth. You can’t just stop and move. The well has to be secured and the drill pulled up to avoid a bigger catastrophe. ONGC’s drill ship Sagar Bhushan was ready and so was free to drift after its anchors snapped,” he said adding barge Papaa 305 sank because it hit a platform after getting astray. So did the crew follow the protocols for such situations? Was there not enough time to move the barges? Was the flow of information adequate? Or is there a need to update the protocols in view of the number of cyclones increasing and their intensity rising? These are some of the questions that will have to be answered. The spokesperson of Afcon, which owns and operates the barges, did not respond to calls and messages from TOI. ONGC executives said the company has a 24X7 state-of-the-art control room constantly monitoring weather and other parameters. These are communicated to offshore assets. But the real picture will emerge only after a quick and impartial probe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/did-judgment-error-cause-barge-mess-or-was-it-cyclones-path/articleshow/82756564.cms||Sanjay Dutta
---||India||Andhra Pradesh media house moves contempt plea in SC||NEW DELHI: An Andhra Pradesh media house moved the Supreme Court on Tuesday seeking initiation of contempt proceedings against the state’s chief secretary, the principal secretary and the additional DGP for filing an FIR against its TV channel for airing views on alleged mismanagement of the Covid-19 situation in the state. A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah had passed an elaborate order on April 30 disapproving the police filing FIRs against people for circulating social media posts critical of governments in managing the Covid-19 situation or scarcity of oxygen and essential medicines. Petitioner Shreya Broadcasting, through advocate Vipin Nair, said the TV channel had attempted to present the views of all stakeholders, including doctors and medical experts, on the efforts to control the deadly second wave of Covid-19 and had also highlighted deficiencies in government actions in several areas of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Taking umbrage at the coverage and airing of views on the TV channel, the Andhra Pradesh government registered an FIR against the media house and slapped sedition charges against it and its top editor, Nair said and claimed that the registration of FIR on May 14 was in clear violation of the SC's April 30 order. "The above-said FIR was registered after Raghurama Krishnam Raju, a sitting Member of Parliament belonging to the ruling YSRCP, gave an interview on the TV channel of the petitioner. The FIR specifically alleges that the petitioner’s channel and its heads conspired with Raju against the government to commit the alleged offences," the petition said. "The FIR discloses that Raghurama Krishnam Raju has been making offending speeches and that the petitioner, through its media channels, gave him premeditated and organised slots. At this point, it is to be noted that the FIR is completely oblivious to the functioning of media channels and attempts to make something routine into a dreaded offence," the media house said. "The FIR intends to create a chilling effect for news channels in the state so that every news channel is wary of hosting any content which is critical of the government. By filing a vague FIR and abusing the process of law, the state intends to silence its critics and the media, which is discharging its duty," it added. In its order on April 30, the bench of Justices Chandrachud and Shah had said, "It is with deep distress that we note that individuals seeking help on such platforms have been targeted, by alleging that the information posted by them is false and has only been posted on social media to create panic, defame the administration or damage the national image. We do not hesitate in saying that such targeting shall not be condoned, and the central government and state governments should ensure that they immediately cease any direct or indirect threats of prosecution and arrest to citizens who air grievances or those that are attempting to help fellow citizens receive medical aid." Issuing a contempt warning, the bench had said, "If this does keep happening even after the current order, this court shall be constrained to use the powers available to it under its contempt jurisdiction. We also direct that all directors general of police shall ensure compliance down the ranks of the police forces within their jurisdictions.” ends||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/andhra-pradesh-media-house-moves-contempt-plea-in-sc/articleshow/82756577.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The Doppler radar, installed at the Regional Meteorological Centre in south Mumbai, was not functional due to a technical snag. Such radars help the IMD in gauging intensity of rainfall in the city. Asked about the non-functional Doppler radar, Rajeevan said it was an important tool but the IMD had other platforms which could help it make a “perfect forecast” of Tauktae, its track, landfall location, time and intensity.

A one-time payment of Rs 50,000 will be made to families in which anyone has died due to Covid. Kejriwal also said the government will give free rations to anyone claiming to be in need even though that person may not have a ration card. The pandemic has devastated scores of families and left many children orphaned and left surviving family members in financial distress besides trauma. The CM said, "All those children who have lost both parents to Covid; or if their single parent to Covid, and have been orphaned, every such child will be given Rs 2,500 per month till the age of 25 and those children will be provided free education. These steps will be implemented within the next few days and will be passed by the Cabinet." Money saved by avoiding extra expenses to fund relief: CMThe pandemic has hit an ordinary person on every side. The lockdown imposed due to the pandemic has brought several challenges, including financial. People are losing livelihoods, are running short of food supplies, and if affected with the virus, face problems with respect to hospital admissions. “There are many people who are poor, and do not possess a ration card because the ration quota got fulfilled for Delhi. The Delhi government will provide ration to such people too. All those people who will declare that they are poor and need ration will be provided with ration,” Kejriwal said during a digital address to the media. CM said last year also the AAP government provided ration to people who did not have ration cards. “Similarly, we will provide ration to all those who do not possess a ration card. This will be implemented within 3-4 days. One does not need to provide any income certificate to avail of this,” said CM. He said many people have died because of Covid. “While we cannot compensate this loss, we can try and support families in such difficult times. All those families where there have been deaths due to Covid will be given an ex gratia amount of Rs 50,000,” the CM announced. He further said, “In families where there has been a loss of the earning member, along with the ex gratia amount, a monthly pension of Rs 2,500 will also be started. If the husband dies, then the pension will be given to the wife, if the wife dies then the pension will be given to the husband, and if a person is unmarried then the parents will be provided the pension.” Kejriwal said the government will fund the expenses through the money it has saved through avoiding unnecessary expenditure in various projects. “In the past six years, in every governmental work we do, we have saved money by avoiding unnecessary expenditure. My ministers, officers and I have come up with different ways to save and withdraw expenses from, and drawn up these four crucial policies,” CM said. Meanwhile, food minister Imran Hussain, during a surprise inspection of fair price shops in Shalimar Bagh, found three fair price shops (FPSs) closed and two FPSs opened. Hussain directed the officers of the food department to take strict action as per law against the defaulting FPSs. In Delhi, ration under National Food Security Act as well as under the PM’s free ration scheme is being distributed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rs-50000-relief-for-losing-kin-to-covid-delhi-cm-arvind-kejriwal/articleshow/82756619.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Mangaluru||Karnataka still not getting its full quota of oxygen||BENGALURU: Despite emergency supply from the Centre, many hospitals in several Karnataka districts, including Bengaluru Urban, continue to grapple with a severe shortage of medical oxygen. In a video conference with chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Monday, several deputy commissioners requested additional supply of the resource to tide over the crisis. While the state government has not shared any data on precisely how much it has received from the Centre, it has been claiming that the central government has heeded its request and is distributing adequate supply. But a TOI reality check threw up a very different scenario. Two weeks ago, the Karnataka high court had ordered the Centre to supply 1,200 tonnes of liquid oxygen to the state every day. The Supreme Court had also, on May 8, upheld the HC order. Officials said the Centre increased the state’s allocation to 1,015 tonnes per day from May 11 with an assurance to increase it to 1,200 tonnes in a few days. However, all that the Centre has allocated and supplied to the state is 800 tonnes. Confirming this, Munish Moudgil, senior IAS officer who is also nodal officer for supply of oxygen said: “Practically we are getting, on average, around 800 tonnes of oxygen everyday as against allocation of 1,015 tonnes. This has left us with a hand-tomouth situation as far as oxygen availability is concerned.” He said efforts are on to enhance supply. Jagadish Shettar, industries minister, who is incharge of oxygen supply, said the daily requirement of medical liquid oxygen is around 1,400 tonnes and the state would be comfortable if it receives 1700 tonnes. The demand has fallen slightly over the past week as Covid-19 cases are coming down in Bengaluru for the past few days. Many DCs highlighted the shortage of oxygen during their video conference with Yediyurappa. Minor irrigation minister JC Madhuswamy even expressed his displeasure over the government not meeting the oxygen demand of Tumakuru district, which he is in-charge of. An official from the industries department said one reason for the allocationdemand-supply mismatch is that the Centre has allocated supply for Karnataka from Odisha. “Since it takes a minimum of two days to bring oxygen from Odisha to Karnataka, it is difficult to ensure consistent supply. This is causing the problem. The shortage of oxygen tankers is only exacerbating the issue,” the official said. Karnataka had requested the Centre to allow it to use whatever oxygen is generated within the state. This will not only save time and transportation expenses but will also help with planning distribution. However, the Centre is yet to respond. Part of what the state generates is being shipped to Andhra Pradesh and other states under the Centre’s allocation plan. Officials say the state produces around 920 tonnes of the resource every day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/karnataka-still-not-getting-its-full-quota-of-oxygen/articleshow/82758333.cms||Anil Gejji
