"On specific information regarding dropping of arms and ammunition by a drone in the Samba border area, BSF troops carried out a search operation in Samba sector on Friday morning," the spokesperson for BSF Jammu Frontier said. At about 11.30 am, BSF troops recovered an item wrapped in yellow polythene from a field. One AK-47 assault rifle, one pistol, one magazine, 15 rounds for a 9 mm weapon, one wooden frame (used to attach the payload to the drone) and wrapping material was recovered approximately 250 metres inside Indian territory. "The efforts of alert BSF troops deployed in a multi-tiered grid have once again resulted in neutralising the designs of Pakistan anti-national elements acting in deep connivance with the Pakistan Rangers," the BSF spokesperson added. In the same area, a tunnel was detected on November 22, 2020, and a Pakistani intruder was killed on May 5, 2021. The BSF had neutralised a Pakistani hexacopter in the area on June 20, 2020 and recovered a large quantity of arms and explosives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bsf-troops-recover-weapons-dropped-by-pakistani-drone-in-jk/articleshow/82642803.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

Last month, AIFF technical director Isac Doru had made a detailed presentation before executive committee members and state association officials, explaining why there should not be any relegation in the I-League. Doru provided examples from 23 countries across the world, including Netherlands (Eredivisie), Argentina (Liga Profesional de Futbol), Mexico (Liga MX), Romania (Liga 1) and Japan (J-League and J2-League), all of whom have frozen relegation during the time of the pandemic. “I have been in conversation with all club coaches during the pandemic. Everyone mentioned about the challenges faced, which included short duration for preparation, reduced training hours, difficulties in organising friendly matches, transfer problems amongst others,” said Doru. During the AIFF league committee meeting on Friday, I-League CEO Sunando Dhar also threw his weight behind the move. “The AIFF approached all participating clubs and all of them have unanimously mentioned to us in writing that under current circumstances relegation should be frozen,” said Dhar. The league committee listened to all parties and then recommended to the executive committee that no team should be relegated from the I-League, and that Neroca FC be granted permission to compete in the 2021-22 edition of the I-League, subject to getting the requisite license as per the decision of the club licensing committee. The AIFF executive committee will take a final decision on relegation. The committee also discussed about hosting other events – Indian Women’s League, Futsal Club Championship and I-League Qualifiers -- and decided to meet in a month’s time to assess the Covid-19 situation across the country. Retaining relegated teams in the I-League has become a norm rather than an exception for the AIFF. In 2015-16, Aizawl FC were marked to go down after finishing in the relegation zone but were still retained. Churchill Brothers FC were relegated from I-League in 2017-18 but the former champions were allowed to play in the top division since there was no representative from Goa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/i-league-clubs-tell-aiff-to-freeze-relegation/articleshow/82643599.cms||---
---||India||Government hopeful of vaccinating entire adult population by December||NEW DELHI: A rapid scale-up of Covid-19 vaccine availability from next month should ensure the current crunch, particularly for the 18-44 age group, will ease by July, following which it will be possible to inoculate India’s entire adult population of around 95 crore by this December, government sources say. “We have all expectations and are fully confident of being able to achieve the goal of vaccinating the above 18 population by year-end,” said a senior official. The shots can be delivered to those willing to be vaccinated as there will be no shortfall in the number of vaccines, sourced mainly from Indian manufacturers. Providing a break-up of anticipated vaccine availability, the official said the number of would be 8.5 crore in May, 10 crore in June, 15 crore in July, 36 crore in August, 50 crore in September, 56 crore in October, 59 crore in November and 65 crore in December. The estimates are “dynamic”, but on the conservative side. Read Also90 lakh doses/day will be needed in August-December to achieve targetThe government has projected the possible availability of 200 crore doses of Covid vaccines during August-December and said it should be possible to vaccinate India’s entire adult population by year-end. Having started vaccination on Jan 15, India has completed four months or 120 days of vaccinationExplaining availability of Russian-made Sputnik, sources said around 60 lakh doses are expected to be delivered in May, followed by 1 crore in June, 2.5 crore in July and 1.6 crore in August. The makers have an arrangement with Dr Reddy’s Laboratories which has tie-ups with other firms as well, and the vaccine numbers will further increase post-August, exceeding 7 crore a month in November and December. As regards availability of vaccines in May, around 40% of doses have been delivered and the rest will follow, though there might be some spillover to June. The estimated availability of Serum Institute of India's Covishield is expected to be 6.5 crore in June, 7 crore in July, 10 crore in August and 11.5 crore in September, October, November and December. Covaxin availability is likely to be 2.5 crore in June, 7.5 crore in July and August,7.7 crore in September, 10.2 crore in October and November and 13.5 crore in December. The government’s estimates do not take into account start dates of vaccine production sub-contracted by firms such as Dr Reddy’s, which is making Sputnik, for example, until November. Companies such as Stelis, Shilpa and Gland Pharma fall in this category, the official said, emphasising that the vaccine estimates were carefully arrived at. Around 1.6 crore of Sputnik doses are to be in use in August, rising to more than 7 crore in December. The Biological E candidate, which used recombinant protein methodology, is in stage three trials and doing well. In fact, with two vaccines in use, the government is confident that candidates that do well in phase one trials are more likely than not to be developed successfully. It is anticipated that Novovax is likely to get approvals abroad soon and will then become eligible for use in India while simultaneously carrying out bridging trials. Gennova’s mRNA and Bharat Biotech’s internasal vaccines are in phase I trials and doing well and are expected to be in use by September. Pre-clinical stage vaccines of Bharat Biotech (Rabies vector), Seagull (Virosome) and Intas (Adeno-associated virus) are not part of the Centre's calculations as yet. Results of SII’s repurposed BCG vaccine are awaited and, if successful, can offer some protection. “We believe the target of getting the vaccine to those eligible, or the 18-plus group, is very much within grasp,” the official said.

There we were, crowding around her in a large room on the fourth floor of Times House, wondering what this was all about. “Nothing,” she said, “I just wanted to meet all of you personally. I am so happy to see so many women here!” She got even more enthused when The Sunday Times of India journalists introduced themselves and informed her that theirs was an all-women’s department.

The column that was started in 1996 by Samir Jain and edited by Ranjit Hoskote in Mumbai, initially, inspired by Indu Ma’s passion to share inspiring, positive and thought-provoking knowledge and information, drawn from ancient scriptural wisdom, teachings of spiritual masters and contemporary philosophy hitherto not readily accessible to most readers. The intention was to give relief to readers who were on a daily diet of death, destruction, disease, disaster and doom — to provide an oasis of hope that all is not lost, yet.

---||India||90 lakh doses/day will be needed in August-December to achieve target||The government has projected the possible availability of 200 crore doses of Covid vaccines during August-December and said it should be possible to vaccinate India’s entire adult population by year-end. Here’s a look at the numbers that would need to be delivered for this target to be achieved. Having started vaccination on Jan 15, India has completed four months or 120 days of vaccination on Friday, May 14. Over these 120 days, it has administered about 18 crore doses, an average of 15 lakh doses a day. To fully vaccinate an adult population estimated at just under 94 crore, according to census projections, it would need to administer a further 170 crore doses in the remaining 231 days of the year. That would require an average of 73.6 lakh doses a day, weekends included, a nearly five-fold increase over the average so far. Of course, the average for the four months so far is lowered by the initial phase in which daily vaccination levels were much lower. But even if we take the last week, the average has been only somewhat higher at 17 lakh doses a day. Read AlsoGovernment hopeful of vaccinating entire adult population by DecemberA rapid scale-up of Covid-19 vaccine availability from next month should ensure the current crunch, particularly for the 18-44 age group, will ease by July, following which it will be possible to inoculate India’s entire adult population of around 95 crore by this December, government sources say.By the government’s own estimates, the supply situation for vaccines will significantly improve only by July-end. In other words, over the next two-and-a-half months, the average daily vaccination is unlikely to be dramatically higher than the current levels. For all of May, for instance, the states are to be allocated a total of 6.12 crore doses (combining their direct procurement from manufacturers and what they get from the Centre) as per the Centre’s affidavit in the Supreme Court. The private sector should get another 2 crore taking the total for the month to just over 8 crore. It seems reasonable to assume, therefore, that the average vaccination stays at about 25 lakh doses a day in May. In June, the government expects total supplies to reach 10 crore and in July 15 crore doses. Assuming these supplies do indeed come through, by July end, or over the next 78 days, India would have administered another 33 crore doses. That would still leave 137 crore doses to be administered between Aug 1 and Dec 31, a period of 153 days. That is an average of over nearly 90 lakh doses a day, seven days a week. No country so far has managed even a single day of half this level of vaccination and India’s highest, also the highest in the world, has been 41.6 lakh doses on Apr 5. Maintaining an average of 90 lakh would mean more than double that peak every day for five months. Vaccinating 90 lakh crore people a day is not merely a challenge of supplies. It would mean adding many more vaccination centres than have been used at any point in the vaccination drive and finding the extra personnel needed to man them and to administer the doses. Even if it is possible to add centres, there is still the challenge of finding extra personnel. Of course, this would be a moot question if the anticipated supplies don’t materialize. Experts agree that the projection of 2 billion doses by year end is quite optimistic. It would mean all existing manufacturers reaching their projected scaled-up capacity by end of July and vaccines currently in trial stage or pending approval coming through in time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/90-lakh-doses/day-will-be-needed-in-august-december-to-achieve-target/articleshow/82644530.cms||---

There is yet not clear whether the cyclonic storm will cross the Gujarat coast or just skirt it by May 18. “It is very likely to intensify into a cyclonic storm during the next 12 hours and is very likely to intensify further during the subsequent 24 hours and move north, north-westwards,” IMD’s late Friday update said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/tauktae-set-to-intensify-into-very-severe-cyclone-may-hit-gujarat/articleshow/82644874.cms||---
---||India||Government may buy 50 million Pfizer Covid vaccine doses by Q3||NEW DELHI: The government and Pfizer are in “high-level” discussions that could see the pharma giant sell 50 million of its Covid vaccine doses in India by the third quarter of this year with the current negotiations pointing to a successful conclusion. Top government officials are believed to have negotiated availability of these vaccines in a series of meetings with senior Pfizer executives with the main hurdle being the firm’s insistence of indemnity that will shield it from legal action in India. While the nature of an agreement on this contentious issue is not yet clear, senior officials said the issue and other matters will be made clear in due course. The vaccines will be available for purchase by government only for its Covid immunisation programme. Pfizer vaccines are fairly expensive but there is a growing demand for expanding the pool of vaccines available for the population in addition to the shots being made in India. Read AlsoGovernment hopeful of vaccinating entire adult population by DecemberA rapid scale-up of Covid-19 vaccine availability from next month should ensure the current crunch, particularly for the 18-44 age group, will ease by July, following which it will be possible to inoculate India’s entire adult population of around 95 crore by this December, government sources say.State governments like UP, Maharashtra and others have announced that they are floating global tenders for vaccine makers to sell their shots here. However, there are not too many free stocks available and the results of this exercise need to be seen even as officials said they will work with states to see what best can be done. The current surge of the Covid pandemic in India has sharpened the demand for mass vaccinations. The European Medicines Agency on Wednesday said the mRNA vaccines approved by it would be able to fight the new variant detected in Maharashtra. “EMA is monitoring the data on the Indian variant very closely. We are seeing promising evidence that mRNA vaccines will be able to neutralise this variant,” it said. The EMA has authorised Pfizer, Moderna, Astra Zeneca and J&J vaccines for the continent. While the US still doesn’t allow Pfizer or Moderna vaccines being produced there to be exported as long as Americans need it, European manufacturing centres are probably going to be the source for the Pfizer vaccines that India intends to buy.

The CM’s directions have come as a number of bodies were found floating in the Ganga recently, triggering suspicion that the abandoned corpses could be those of Covid patients. The State Disaster Response Force and the Provincial Armed Constabulary should patrol rivers and ensure that no bodies are disposed of in rivers, the CM ordered, according to a statement. He said in areas on banks of rivers, committees including village development officers and village heads should be formed to ensure that no one dumps bodies in rivers. “All those who died deserve cremation with respect. The state government has already sanctioned funds for performing the last rites,” the CM said. “No one should be allowed to dispose of bodies in rivers,” the CM added, stressing that if need be, a fine may be imposed at the local level to prevent it. “The government is also running a special campaign for cleaning of rivers. Home, urban and rural development departments should make a policy to prevent it,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/up-cm-orders-patrolling-to-curb-disposal-of-bodies-in-rivers/articleshow/82645400.cms||---

Equally worrying is that deaths have also shot up -- it is three times the figure compared to last year. Pauri, the worst-affected hill district, recorded 5,215 cases between March 2020 and March 2021. In the period between April 1 and May 13, though, the district’s tally shot up to 12,970. Till March 31 this year, Pauri had 60 Covid-19 deaths. The number went up to 200 in the period between April 1 and May 13. Another significant spike has been in Almora where cases went up from 56 between March 2020 and March 2021. It was 1,318 between April 1 and May 13 this year. The number of deaths went up from 26 to 89 in the corresponding period. The situation in Uttarkashi, another prominent hill district, is no different. The district reported 3,828 cases between March 2020 and March 2021. In the period between April 1 and May 13 this year, 5,492 fresh cases were recorded. Deaths went up too — from 17 between March 2020 and March 2021 to 43 in between April 1 and May 13 this year. Coronavirus: Live updatesUttarakhand is among the eight states red-flagged by the central government where Covid cases are increasing rapidly in rural areas. According to health department officials, returnees, weddings and funerals are primarily fuelling this spread in the hills. “We believe that migrant workers who have returned have mainly caused this rise. There were many who also visited Kumbh mela and tested positive after returning from there,” said additional chief medical officer, Bhatwari, Dr Bipul Biswas. Similar instances of mass infections were reported in Kumaon’s Champawat district which has seen a three-fold rise in cases as well as deaths. Here, a cluster of villages that is at least eight km away from any motorable road reported three deaths of people with Covid-likesymptoms. They could not be tested since medical teams could not reach the area. Anoop Nautiyal of Dehradun-based Social Development for Communities Foundation, an organisation closely tracking the pandemic in the Himalayan state, said it was a matter of great concern in the hills of Uttarakhand. “This is a big jump,” he said, adding, "Immediate measures are required to improve testing in the hills, provide medicines and improve healthcare facilities. Secretary (health) Amit Negi said, "Uttarakhand is already testing the maximum people per lakh population compared to other states in the country. The second wave has gripped the entire nation equally. We are increasing tests and healthcare facilities and trying to reach patients in remote areas as much as we can.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/coronavirus-cases-deaths-surge-across-uttarakhand/articleshow/82645645.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Delhi||Even fully-vaccinated need mask, distancing: AIIMS chief Dr Randeep Guleria||NEW DELHI: Wearing of mask and physical distancing need to continue even by those who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19, AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria said underlining that the virus is constantly mutating and there is still uncertainty about how much vaccines can protect against the emerging variants. On Thursday, Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the US said fully vaccinated people no longer need to wear a mask and can resume activities like prior to the pandemic. However, in India, government officials and the medical fraternity said it may be too early for such an announcement. “I think there is need to be cautious and at least till we have more data. Keeping in mind that this virus is very clever and keeps mutating, we cannot say what will be the protection from vaccines as far as new emerging variants are concerned. It is better to wear masks and maintain physical distance because no matter what the variants are, masks and physical distancing will protect,” Dr Guleria said. Official sources in the health ministry said there is no plan to revise the advisory in India as of now. “We cannot take such a risk at this stage and though very few, there have been breakthrough infections. There is no way the masks can be kept aside,” a senior official said. Experts said CDC’s advisory could be with a view to promote vaccination as vaccine hesitancy is quite prevalent in the US. Some also felt that this could also be linked with the government’s intention to restart economic activities there. “Covid-19 vaccines are effective at protecting you from getting sick. Based on what we know about Covid-19 vaccines, people who have been fully vaccinated can start to do some things that they had stopped doing because of the pandemic,” CDC said. According to CDC, people are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after their second dose in a 2-dose series, and two weeks after a single-dose vaccine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/even-fully-vaccinated-need-mask-distancing-dr-randeep-guleria/articleshow/82646119.cms||Sushmi Dey

Those who took the second dose after six weeks are now concerned about its efficacy. “We took the second dose in 6-8 weeks but the latest advisory suggesting an interval of 12-16 weeks has left us confused,” said Sridhar MS, 61, from Bengaluru. Dr T Jacob John, retired professor and head of clinical virology and microbiology at Christian Medical College, Vellore, said there isabsolutely no problem if the second dose of Covishield is delayed. “The protection it offers after a four-week interval is nearly 100% against a severe form of the disease,” he explained. “But it is not 100% against mild and moderate Covid. If you increase the interval up to 12 weeks, the efficacy against mild to moderate disease increases.” Dr John conceded no study has been conducted to test efficacy beyond a 12-week window. “What is known so far with all vaccines is that even if you delay the second dose by a year, the first dose is still effective. Given the situation, a four-week interval is ideal. But if there is a problem with supply, is it better to delay it so more people get the first dose,” he said. “If someone has missed the second dose of Covaxin, it can be taken within a year as well,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/1-year-vaccine-dose-interval-fine-but-4-weeks-is-ideal-top-virologist/articleshow/82646420.cms||Sunitha Rao R
---||Business||Patent waiver: India, US seek to rope in others||NEW DELHI: India and the US on Friday discussed a strategy to push for patent waiver for Covid vaccines at the World Trade Organization (WTO), with Washington expected to reach out to some of the naysayers to rally for support to the proposal that has been endorsed by over 125 members of the multilateral body. During a call with US Trade Representative Katherine Tai, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal also flagged the need to keep the supply chain open for vaccine manufacturers — an issue that seems to have been addressed after PM Narendra Modi’s discussion with US President Joe Biden. “Both sides agreed to work towards the common resolve of increasing vaccine availability and saving lives,” an official statement said. Tai’s interaction with Goyal came a day after a similar dialogue with South African trade minister Ebrahim Patel. Last October, India and South Africa had jointly moved the proposal for flexibility under TRIPS to enable production of vaccines that are patented. Along with patent waiver, technology transfer and assistance are key ingredients for the plan to succeed. Although some other trade-related issues also cropped up during Goyal’s call — with India pointing to moves for free trade agreements with the UK and the EU — the main focus was on vaccines, sources said. “The US will be working with some of the countries that have not yet endorsed the proposal,” said a government source. Separately, the Modi government is also reaching out to its trade partners and is hopeful that the PM’s pitch at the EU summit will help convince some of the members of the trading bloc. Countries such as Germany and Spain have not endorsed the plan yet with even the UK being among those who are opposed to diluting the TRIPS Agreement. Even the US has offered limited backing, which is confined to relaxations for talks on vaccine manufacturing as opposed to India and South Africa’s demand to extend the facility to Covid drugs and diagnostic kits. The government is, however, keen to pursue the entire strategy instead of limiting itself to vaccines. Sources said that a revised proposal will be presented to WTO later this month with India and the other developing countries keen on a solution by July. “I am hopeful that in an early timeframe, some decision will be reached at the WTO,” commerce secretary Anup Wadhawantold reporters, adding that the move will help scale up production of vaccines and other essential Covid-related products.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/patent-waiver-india-us-seek-to-rope-in-others/articleshow/82647060.cms||Sidhartha
---||India||I feel every loss my countrymen feel: PM Narendra Modi||NEW DELHI: Calling Covid-19 an “invisible enemy” challenging the world, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday warned rural India against rapid spread of infections and said every government department was fighting the pandemic with all its might, working day and night to ease the nation’s pain. “As the prime minister of this country, I feel every loss my countrymen feel… India is not a nation that loses hope in tough times. I am sure that we will overcome this challenge with our strength and dedication,” Modi said, releasing the eighth instalment under PM-Kisan scheme of Rs 2,000 each to over 9.5 crore farmers, including over 7 lakh from West Bengal for the first time. On the Covid-19 menace in rural areas, the PM urged village panchayats to ensure awareness and sanitation and made a strong pitch for vaccination. “The Centre, along with state governments, is ensuring Covid vaccines reach citizens as quickly as possible. We are driving the largest vaccination drive. One way of defeating the virus is by taking the Covid vaccine. Over 18 crore people have already been vaccinated so far,” he added. With the country having seen widespread suffering due to lack of hospital facilities to deal with a surge in cases, struggles for oxygen supplies and a large death toll, the PM said, “I feel your pain, being your pradhan sevak, I am with you when you are going through pain and suffering.” He had similarly dedicated his previous ‘Mann ki Baat’ radio talk to Covid-19, saying the infections had shaken the country even as he said it would overcome the situation. A total of over Rs 20,667 crore was directly transferred to farmers’ bank accounts. Farmers of West Bengal received the assistance for the first time since the scheme was launched in February 2019. Two instalments of Rs 2,000 each, amounting to over Rs 281 crore, were released to farmers of Bengal in one go. Under PM-Kisan, all landholder farmers’ families get Rs 6,000 each annually in three equal instalments. Though farmers of all states/UTs had been getting the amount since 2019 as their respective governments joined the scheme, the West Bengal government did not do it. The state joined the scheme only days ahead of the recent assembly elections. The remaining farmers of West Bengal will get the benefit under PM-Kisan once the state government shares their details with the agriculture ministry. PM Modi also requested states to ensure strict laws to counter black marketing of medicines and medical supplies. “The government is dedicated to making Covid hospitals and Covid care centres, oxygen plants are being set up with the latest technology. Armed forces are working with full strength to ensure oxygen supply in these tough times,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/i-feel-every-loss-my-countrymen-feel-pm-narendra-modi/articleshow/82647447.cms||---

Former deputy chief minister and Goa Forward Party president Vijai Sardesai said the 13 people died between 1am and 6am due to oxygen shortage, but GMC’s nodal officer Dr Viraj Khandeparkar told TOI that the “13 deaths were recorded between 8pm and 8am”. “A total of 75 people died in the dark hours of 1am to 6am over the past four nights. Basically, they have died due to oxygen shortage and mismanagement of oxygen supply in GMC,” Sardesai said. Khandeparkar agreed that oxygen fluctuation was one of the “contributory factors” for the 13 deaths on Friday. “We cannot blame oxygen alone. It is a multifactorial problem. Oxygen and many other issues, infection, lung condition, comorbidities, as also genetic make-up of the patient,” he said. GMC, the state’s premier government hospital, has over 900 Covid patients, and reported 39 of the 61 casualties on Friday. “There are transitory oxygen pressure drops, and if at the same time four or five patients desaturate, then the doctor is helpless,” Dr Pratik Savant, president of the Goa Association of Resident Doctors (GARD), said. He said that on Thursday night, there were a few such drops. “It is not as much as earlier. The situation has improved because the overall oxygen supply has increased,” he said. On Tuesday, health minister Vishwajit Rane said that 26 people had died due to oxygen supply problems in the early hours. The next day, too, oxygen dipped, and unconfirmed reports said 21 people had died. On Thursday, 15 more patients died due to the problem. The oxygen shortage issue at GMC was first flagged by TOI on its May 10 edition. The Goa bench of the Bombay high court, which is hearing a PIL on the state’s Covid management, on Wednesday asked the state government to ensure no deaths take place due to lack or shortage of oxygen. However, even as the deaths continued, on Thursday night, four IAS officers kept an all-night watch at the hospital to cut down fluctuations from the central line and to ensure the movement of trolleys carrying oxygen cylinders was smooth. The state government, in the status report filed before the high court on Friday, said the officers were present to monitor the situation at the new manifold site. “No complaints were received by us during this period about the drop in pressure,” it said. The report to the high court made no mention of the deaths. Over the past 24 hours ending Friday evening, 62 oxygen trolleys were supplied to GMC. In addition, a total of 600 jumbo cylinders and 47 small cylinders were also supplied, the report said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/13-more-die-as-o2-dips-again-in-goa-government-hospital/articleshow/82647600.cms||Bindiya Chari
---||India||Allow doorstep jabs to cover max population: IMA||The Indian Medical Association (IMA) — the national body of medical practitioners in the country — has supported the Bombay high court’s directive to the Centre to reconsider its policy and include door-to-door vaccinations against Covid-19. IMA members said this would speed up the current pace of inoculations and cover the maximum population in record time. “The Union government needs to revise its policy now,” senior surgeon and IMA national president J A Jayalal told TOI. The IMA, with 3.56 lakh members across the country, will write to the Centre about this, reports Umesh Isalkar. “Our members would wholeheartedly participate in the process as vaccinators or as members of standby medical teams supervising such vaccinations at small medical units, housing society premises and school and college campuses,” Jayalal said. Sanjay Patil, chairman of the IMA’s Hospital Board of India (HBI), Pune branch, said, "Mass inoculation through door-to-door vaccination will help us achieve herd immunity quickly. We are ready to support the government and district administration as medical experts to achieve this goal." Clinical epidemiologist Amitav Banerjee said, "The elderly and people over 45 with co-morbidities need to get focused protection by isolation and vaccination on priority. Mass inoculation through door-to-door visits can enable quick vaccination of the country’s vulnerable population in a short span."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/allow-doorstep-jabs-to-cover-max-population-ima/articleshow/82647866.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Considered an auspicious occasion to buy gold, this year too, like 2020, Akshaya Tritiya was celebrated under the shadow of the pandemic. Gold prices were up Rs 13 a gram at Rs 4,485 a gm in the Mumbai market on Friday.Paytm and its subsidiary Paytm Money witnessed a 30% year-on-year (YoY) value growth in digital gold sales on their platform this year. Paytm Money chief executive officer (CEO) Varun Sridhar said, “In the last three days, we have recorded 50kg of gold sales. The average ticket size has grown from Rs 1,600-Rs 1,700 to Rs 2,300-Rs 2,500 per transaction.” Over the last three years, among Paytm’s over 500 million users, over 62 million users have purchased digital gold on their platforms. Augmont Enterprises, an integrated precious metals management company, saw a 150% YoY surge in sales volume on Friday, compared to Akshaya Tritiya last year.Augmont Enterprises director Ketan Kothari said, “Gold coins and gold bars in the range of Rs 3,000- Rs 4,000 are preferable for buyers this year. We’ve sold around 35kg of (digital) gold on account of Akshaya Tritiya this year.” Delhi-based startup IndiaGold’s director Deepak Abbot said it has surpassed its average monthly sales volume on a single day on account of Akshaya Tritiya.World Gold Council managing director (India) Somasundaram P R said, “With the second lockdown, many organised jewellers have adopted digital and omni-channel strategies to reach out to their consumers, learning from the lockdown experience of 2020.”On the other hand, Kalyan Jewellers’ executive director Ramesh Kalyanaraman said, “Most markets in India remained closed and the overall sentiment was muted. Only 20% of our showrooms were operational and functioned under strict guidelines with reduced working hours. As expected, tractions in these showrooms were minimal. It is not appropriate to compare this year’s Akshaya Tritiya with any of the pre-Covid years.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/gold-shines-bright-on-digital-platforms-for-akshaya-tritiya/articleshow/82641318.cms||Mamtha Asokan

At an online meeting with MLAs under Patna Sahib parliamentary constituency as well as Patna district magistrate, the minister also said a medical oxygen plant would soon be set up at Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences. “Chairman and managing director of Medanta, Dr Naresh Trehan, has assured us that treatment of Covid patients will commence at the hospital at Kankarbagh here from next week,” the minister said. He also suggested that status of availability of beds, including ICU and ventilator beds, should be readily available in public domain. State Health Society has already launched an online portal for checking availability of beds in government as well as private hospitals. Patna DM Chandrashekhar Singh told the minister that there is no shortage of oxygen in the district. The minister said Covid test reports should be handed over to the people within 48 hours to ensure their timely treatment. He also stressed on the need to expedite Covid vaccination, especially for women in the age group of 18 to 44 years. The minister said 75 oxygen concentrators would soon be made available to Patna. “These cylinders will be sent to different hospitals for treatment of Covid patients,” he added. The minister later held a separate meeting with deputy CM Tarkishore Prasad and state health minister Mangal Pandey.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/covid-treatment-at-medanta-hospital-from-next-week-minister/articleshow/82641371.cms||---

They would remain closed till May 24 as part of the efforts to control the virus spread among the workers.The closure of the units has, however, sparked an exodus of guest workers from the textile town to the north Indian states.While garment manufacturing units were exempted from the lockdown, Tirupur Exporters’ Association (TEA) had decided to close the units from Friday after a meeting with district collector K Vijayakarthikeyan a few days ago.TEA president Raja M Shanmugam said they had taken the decision voluntarily to help the government authorities in the fight against Covid. Accordingly, the units had expedited their work to complete the existing orders as much as possible over the past few days.Since the garment units have shut the operations, allied units, which were dependent on each other, too have come to a standstill. The decision to stop the production has been timely, as several garment units were reporting Covid cases among the workers. The closure has, meanwhile, prompted the guest workers to return to their hometowns.

He said active Covid cases in the state are very high and oxygen supply has fallen far short of requirement. “Rajasthan now has the 4th highest active cases at 2.11 lakh, which is 5.72% of the total active cases of the country. The present oxygen allocation is 435MT, including 125MT of ASU (air separation units),” he tweeted. “The situation is extremely fragile as there are also constraints in lifting 100MT of allocated oxygen from Burnpur and Kalinganagar in the East and this quota has not been adequately utilised by us despite best efforts. I sincerely request to revise the allotment of oxygen from Jamnagar and Hazira immediately as active cases are going down in many states and also allotment of more imported oxygen at the earliest,” CM added in the tweet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/gehlot-sends-sos-to-centre-on-o2-shortage/articleshow/82643585.cms||---
---||Business||GoAir, promoter spar over trademark amid IPO plan||MUMBAI: After flying for 17 years as ‘GoAir’, owner Nusli Wadia, in an abrupt move, changed the carrier’s brand to ‘Go First’. The rebranding was initiated ahead of taking his company Go Airlines public. Go Airlines didn’t divulge the reason for the rebranding but its draft IPO prospectus filed with India’s capital markets regulator Sebi revealed that the GoAir brand was owned by Wadia’s younger son Jeh and not the company. Apart from the main brand, Jeh also owns two other marks — Go Airlines and www.goair.in, used exclusively by the IPO-bound company. In March, Jeh had stepped down from the MD’s position at Go Airlines while remaining as its co-promoter. Go Airlines, which will be the first Wadia Group company to hit the Street in over three decades (another one Bombay Burmah is the second-oldest publicly quoted company in India), said it will pursue legal options to establish “its ownership over all the trademarks and domain names”. For some period (2006 to 2009 and from 2013 to 2014), there were written licence agreements between the airline and Go Holdings (Jeh’s company) governing the use of the GoAir brand. For the remaining years, the use of intellectual property rights was not by way of a written licence agreement, the company said in its draft IPO document. While Go Airlines has started to use ‘Go First’, the registration of this wordmark and logo are pending approval from authorities, it added. In March 2021, Go Holdings, said the IPO-bound company, filed two applications to register ‘Go Airlines’ and ‘www.goair.in’. A month later, Jeh made an application to the National Internet Exchange of India to transfer 115 domain names registered in the name of Go Airlines from one domain registrar to another domain registrar. “Our company is opposing the aforesaid applications and have also applied for the registration of these two wordmarks (Go Airlines and www.goair.in) in our own name,” it said. “There is no assurance that these matters will be determined in our favour or that there will not be claims regarding our intellectual property from Go Holdings in the future. Any such events could have a material adverse effect on our business,” added Go Airlines, which plans to raise Rs 3,600 crore via the IPO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/goair-promoter-spar-over-trademark-amid-ipo-plan/articleshow/82642342.cms||Reeba Zachariah
---||Patna||Bihar government ready to buy vaccines from open market, says health minister Mangal Pandey||PATNA: A day after Niti Aayog member (health) Dr V K Paul announced that altogether eight manufacturers will supply 216 crore Covid vaccine doses in the country by August-December, state health minister Mangal Pandey told this newspaper that the state government is ready to buy the vaccines from the open market to meet its requirement. “The success of the vaccination programme would depend on the availability of vaccines. The state government has accorded top priority to this programme and, hence, all efforts are being made to procure maximum vaccines from different sources to get all the people vaccinated at the earliest,” Pandey said. Despite the minister’s claims, experts are not very optimistic about the vast population of the state getting vaccinated soon. Even if the Niti Aayog’s announcement materializes, the state is unlikely to get the desired number of doses in time, they appended. Former president of IMA’s state unit, Dr Bimal Kumar Karak, said so far only 2.3% population has been vaccinated in the state and at this rate the drive won’t be completed even after one and a half years. The government would have to procure vaccines from open market and even abroad and allow the private hospitals to take up the vaccination job. He further said that so far only people above the age of 18 are being vaccinated, but what about those who are below 18. Vaccines are yet under trial for children and unless 25% of the state population (children below 18) are vaccinated, the fear of Covid infection would remain. He suggested that vaccination booths should be started with all safety norms at different places to get the maximum number of people vaccinated at the earliest, Karak added. Paediatrician Dr Arun Shah hoped the country would be able to manufacture sufficient doses of the vaccines by the end of December, but he pleaded that the state would have to take up the task of vaccination on a war footing for the success of its drive. Even if 80% of the state’s population is vaccinated till December, it would be a success. Dr Shah pointed out that as per revised guidelines, pregnant women and lactating mothers can take the shots as scheduled and the gap between two shots has also been increased for the greater efficacy of vaccines. He opined that more vaccination centres even at the level of primary health centres and schools should be created. “More emphasis should be given on this programme in rural areas where also Covid infection has spread in alarming proportion. The vaccination job should also be handed over to the private sector, even if they charge some nominal amount form the people. Most people want to avoid long queues and, hence, sufficient number of vaccination booths should be set up just like voting booths in all the areas,” he said. PMCH’s former superintendent Dr Rajiv Ranjan Prasad regretted that the pace of ongoing vaccination programme in the state is not satisfactory and it needs to be speeded up considerably. If the state government is able to procure sufficient number of vaccines from different agencies, the vaccination programme may be completed by the end of the current year, he said. Principal of Government Ayurvedic College, Patna, Dr Dineshwar Prasad Singh said getting the entire state population (12 crore) vaccinated is not an easy task. He said on an average, 100 people are being vaccinated at the college centre daily and there are hardly 20 such centres in the state capital. At this rate, it will take a very long time in vaccinating all the people. Dr Singh said the entire medial forces, including allopathic, ayurvedic, unani and homoeopathic doctors, should be pressed into service for the success of this campaign and the services of voluntary social organizations should also be sought for this drive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/state-govt-ready-to-buy-vaccines-from-open-market-health-min/articleshow/82640079.cms||B K Mishra
---||Rajkot||Gujarat: Second wave proved to be a killer||RAJKOT: The number deaths registered in four cities of Gujarat, especially Rajkot, in April have almost tripled or quadrupled compared to the same month last year, indicating the high mortality caused by the monstrous spike in Covid-19 in the second wave. The average death figures every month in Rajkot city till March was reported to be between 1,000 and 1500. However, when the second wave hit, the city registered a massive five-fold rise in mortalities in the month of April alone. Official data of Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) reveals that 6,600 people died in 30 days. In the first 10 days of May, nearly 3,000 deaths have been reported. Going by the figures, nearly 220 people died every day in the month of April, which includes death from Covid-19, natural deaths, accidental deaths and suicide. RMC gets the death entries from hospitals and the mortuary vans of the fire department of all those who have died in the city jurisdiction. However, there are large number of people from the rural areas of Rajkot and other districts who take treatment for Covid-19 in the city. A senior officer of RMC’s birth and death office told TOI: “We got entry of 6,651 deaths on our portal from April 1-30 from various hospitals out of which 3,582 were males and 3,069 females. A total of 4,475 people approached us for registration of their relatives deaths.” As per rule, a person has to report the death of a relative to the RMC registrar within 30 days. In the first 10 days of May, 2,245 people have registered deaths of their relatives while the civic body got entries of nearly 3,000 deaths from various hospitals. According to RMC data, the highest deaths of 3,025 were registered in September last year followed by 2,301 deaths in December 2020. A number of doctors whom TOI spoke to said that many people died as they could not get beds in hospitals, medicine and oxygen. In Vadodara too, the average number of deaths registered in the months of March and April this year have increased significantly due to the pandemic. In April, particularly, the numbers are scary with mortalities shooting to over three times as compared to 2020. Officials said that besides the obvious increase due to the pandemic, deaths of patients from outside the city in local hospitals is a major contributor. These include patients from not only Gujarat, but also outside the state. In 2020, despite the pandemic the number of deaths had gone down largely due to the lockdown. Other ailments had also spared the citizens. Surat also registered almost double the average monthly deaths during April compared to past years. According to Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) officials, the numbers are high due to Covid-19 while deaths were less in April last year due to lockdown. "Of the total recorded deaths in the city, nearly 25% are of Covid-19 patients who died in the city but they were residents of other places outside city or state," said an official. The average daily death registrations in Ahmedabad have gone up to 175 from 124 in April.

Krishiket Kumar was kidnapped from his residence near Kumhrar Talab in Daudbigha under Agamkuam police station area in Patna on Wednesday evening. His parents reported the matter to police on Thursday after which they swung into action. City SP (east) Jitendra Kumar said the police recovered the boy before any ransom calls could be made to his parents and arrested the kidnapper, identified as Manoj Mandal of Mahadev Nagar in Katihar. Krishiket is the son of Mandal’s houseowner Sujeet Yadav. SP Kumar said Mandal had kept the boy hostage at the residence of one of his cousins, Pankaj Pal, at Pahartalli. He said Krishitesh’s father is a private school bus driver but he has a an immovable property at Daudbigha. “Mandal had recently come to know about Yadav’s property and hatched the conspiracy to kidnap his son,” he said. Kumar said even though the child was recovered from Pal’s residence, he was not arrested. “Pal is blind and didn’t have any knowledge about the kidnapped child being kept at his house,” he said. The SP said police suspected Mandal as he was also missing from his rented accommodation. The Patna police contacted the Lakhisarai counterparts and got the lead. “We raided Pal’s house in the wee hours and found Mandal fast asleep with the child beside him inside the cattleshed,” Piri Bazaar police station SHO Prajesh Kumar Dubey said. Dubey said the the photographs of both Mandal and the child were sent to Patna police for confirmation. “Both of them have been taken to Patna by a police team which had reached here in the day,” Dubey added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/six-year-old-kidnapped-boy-recovered-from-lakhisarai/articleshow/82639940.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||PIL challenges decision to transfer dairy corporation’s assets to Amul||VIJAYAWADA: YSRC MP Raghurama Krishna Raju moved the Andhra Pradesh high court with a public interest litigation petition challenging the state government’s decision to transfer the assets of Andhra Pradesh Dairy Development Corporation Limited (APDDCL) to Amul. He argued that the government’s decision was arbitrary and in violation of settled principles of law. In his petition, Raju argued that the cabinet resolution passed on May 4, 2021 was arbitrary, irrational, and hit by Article 14 of the Constitution. He said that a transparent procedure was not followed which amounts to conferring undue benefits to Amul. Picking an agency of the state government’s choice in secrecy is nothing but transgression of law and colourable exercise of powers, he said. Though Amul is a reputed organisation, the state government failed to notice that outside the state of Gujarat, its activities are commercial in nature and it had been carrying out business across the country. Handing over the state’s resources to a commercial organisation would destroy existing dairy industry in the state, he argued. As the lease of assets is in nature of commercial transaction, the state government cannot transfer the assets without a transparent procedure like issuing tender notification. The state government resorted to unilateral conferment of benefit to Amul by handing over its assets which are valued at Rs 500 crore even by conservative estimates, he said. He added this conferment was done without safeguards in place. Raju further argued that if the state government was interested in leasing out its assets it should have considered a better alternative like National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) which already has a dairy in AP. He also found fault with the statement that the decision was made to revive the dairy industry. He said the statement is factually wrong as revival indicates dysfunctional, but the dairy industry in AP is one of the best performing in the country. The high court is yet to take up the petition for hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/pil-challenges-decision-to-transfer-dairy-corporations-assets-to-amul/articleshow/82640723.cms||Srikanth Aluri
---||Goa||Archaic system, crumbling infrastructure behind Goa Medical College’s Oxygen woes||PANAJI: Virtually scoffing at the state government’s move to blame “logistical issues” for the erratic oxygen supply, doctors and industrial oxygen users said that the pattern suggested that infrastructural lacunae and lack of clear guidelines were responsible for the dip in supply to patients. Engineers, doctors and industrialists said that the Goa Medical College’s reliance on a trolley-based oxygen supply system is an outdated model for hospitals. Present day hospitals use an independent liquid oxygen plant which generates medical oxygen on site similar to the ones already installed at the South Goa district hospital and the super speciality block. “The oxygen manifold panel at the GMC is designed to pump 2,500 litres of oxygen per minute and is good enough for a 1,500 bedded hospital, but the medical gas pipeline system is not designed for a Covid hospital,” an official said. A senior engineer, who is on site at the GMC, said that with the surge in Covid-19 cases, the oxygen supply system is overburdened. “The GMC kept asking for the oxygen pipelines to be added to more and more wards which was done,” the engineer said. Goa Association of Resident Doctors (GARD) president Dr Pratik Sawant said that the demand supply ratio of oxygen is skewed and that the oxygen supply is just not enough to cater to the increase in Covid patients. “The government should have thought about this and improved the infrastructure at the GMC before the second wave,” an engineer who oversees the maintenance of the GMC’s infrastructure said. The government appears to have finally swung into action and has installed a modern 23,000 litre liquid oxygen tank within the GMC’s campus. The tank has been taken on a long-term lease from Praxair India Pvt Ltd and has been shifted from Bicholim. The tank has been erected and installed while the distribution pipes and welding of the oxygen gas pipelines will be completed by Saturday. An additional 6,000 litre oxygen tank will be purchased and installed by Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation in the weeks to come. “The 23,000 litre tank is expected to be operationalised by Monday and once the second 6,000 litre tank is installed next to the manifold, the dependence on oxygen trolleys will end,” a source said. In a submission before the high court, the state government blamed “logistical issues” such as the lack of “expert drivers” as the reason for the erratic supply of oxygen. The passage where the tractor trolley has to manoeuvre and deploy the oxygen cylinders is narrow. “A doctor in any of the critical Covid-19 wards has to manage 40-50 patients and if there are transitory oxygen pressure drops and if at the same time four or five patients desaturate, then the doctor is helpless. He can help just one or two patients. It cannot be called a logistical issue when there are lapses in the oxygen supply in the night or delay in transport,” Sawant said. For over a fortnight, the GMC has reported fluctuations in the oxygen supply which has resulted in an additional burden for doctors. A Goan industrialist, who uses industrial oxygen, said that medical oxygen is a cold gas and if the usage requirement of gaseous oxygen exceeds the original design requirements for an excessive amount of time, the system may be overdrawn and will cause a build-up of frost or ice near the internal valves, regulator or in the distribution system. “The government should check if this is the case with a flow meter or if the regulator itself is faulty,” industrialist Chandrashekar Chari said. The government constituted a three-member committee to inquire into the issue of interrupted oxygen supply in the GMC. The committee comprises IIT director B K Mishra as chairperson and former GMC dean Dr V N Jindal as member and secretary (urban development) Tariq Thomas as member and convenor of the committee. Doctors also said that the technicians in-charge of the switch-over of the oxygen cylinders need to be given clear guidelines on the process to switch over the oxygen cylinders so that the least amount of time is taken and that doctors also need to be kept informed when the cylinders are being changed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/archaic-system-crumbling-infra-behind-gmcs-o2-woes/articleshow/82644777.cms||Newton Sequeira
---||Business||IDBI Bank settles loan with Aircel founder Siva||MUMBAI: IDBI Bank has said that it has accepted the one-time settlement offer by Siva Industries’s promoters — a part of Aircel founder C Sivasankaran’s group — as it would lose more money otherwise. IDBI Bank had initiated bankruptcy proceedings against Siva Industries in 2019. The loans were availed by a group company that later merged with Siva Industries. Sivasankaran is facing investigations by the authorities for causing a loss to banks. According to banking sources, IDBI Bank has already written to the CBI, which has confirmed that commercial dealings will not affect the criminal investigation process. “Recovery for the bank through one-time settlement will be higher vis-a-vis recovery through NCLT liquidation based on the valuation of assets available as security. This OTS (one-time settlement) and exit from NCLT does not prejudice the CBI complaint. The case with CBI continues,” IDBI Bank said. Lenders led by IDBI Bank, with claims of over Rs 5,000 crore, had initiated bankruptcy proceedings against the company. International Asset Reconstruction Company held 22% of the admitted debt followed by IDBI Bank (17%) and Union Bank of India (12%). LIC, SBI, Yes Bank and Bank of India were the other lenders. According to a report in ET, a Mauritius-based investor Royal Partners had complained that its bid for the company was deliberately ignored. However, IDBI Bank has said that the OTS offers it a better deal. While the insolvency process does not allow defaulting promoters to acquire their company, bankers can do a one-time settlement with lenders if enough of them agree. IDBI Bank responded to allegations in a statement on social media where it said that although Siva Industries was referred to the NCLT by lenders in July 2019, there was no successful resolution applicant. “The promoter/shareholder made a one-time settlement offer which was higher than the liquidation value. Creditors voted in favour of the settlement in the first week of April 2021.” It added that the NCLT is yet to approve the settlement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/idbi-bank-settles-loan-with-aircel-founder-siva/articleshow/82642228.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Patna||After two days, Uttar Pradesh government allows cremation of bodies from Bihar||SASARAM: Following the intervention of Kaimur district administration, the Uttar Pradesh government, after two days, on Friday allowed the cremation of bodies from Bihar on the banks of Ganga at Jamania in Ghazipur district. Incidentally, the bodies from Rohtas and Kaimur districts were not being allowed to be taken to Ganga ghats in the neighbouring Ghazipur for cremation after a dozen of decomposed bodies, many suspected to be of Covid-19 victims, were found floating on the river bank in UP as well as in Buxar earlier this week. After that, the Ghazipur administration had banned the entry of bodies from Bihar for cremation. Ghazipur district administration has created three police checkposts on Bihar border and the police are allowing people to carry bodies only after making entry of the details of the deceased and their family members and giving undertaking that the bodies would be properly cremated on the earmarked Ganga ghats. Gazipur DM Mangla Prasad Singh told this newspaper over phone on Friday that a control room had also been set up at the cremation grounds and only people reporting there would be allowed to cremate the bodies in the presence of police personnel. “The step was taken after the reports of dumping of bodies in the Ganga clandestinely by the kith and kin of the deceased,” the DM said. Kaimur SP Raklesh Kumar said the matter has been resolved amicably after talks with his Ghazipur counterpart and three checkposts have been created on the Bihar border to assist the UP police. “Ghazipur SP has also advised us to ask people from Bihar to carry funeral pyres with the bodies, so that there would be no doubt about dumping the bodies in Ganga river,” the Kaimur SP said. Locals claimed that many families from Aurangabad, Rohtas and Kaimur districts preferred to perform cremation of their kith and kin on the Ganga river bank at Varanasi, but long queue on the two cremation grounds forced them to head towards Kakarait ghat of Jamania in UP. Several people, who visited Varanasi to perform the last rites of their kin, said they were kept waiting for 15 to 24 hours for the cremation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/after-2-days-up-govt-allows-entry-of-bodies-for-cremation/articleshow/82639313.cms||Alok Chamaria
---||Patna||Bihar: Eid celebrated with prayers at home amid Covid pandemic||PATNA: Eid-ul-Fitr was celebrated in a subdued manner for the second consecutive year as Muslims spent the day with their loved ones and families in their homes amid the lockdown in Bihar due to Covid-19 pandemic. As large gatherings are prohibited and mosques were closed, the devotees offered ‘Eid namaz’ (prayers) at home in small congregations. The festival, one of the most important in the Islamic calendar, is traditionally celebrated with Eid prayer performed in an open area followed by family feasts, socialising with friends, relatives and neighbours and exchanging gifts and sweets. With most of them staying indoors, the Muslims connected with their friends, relatives and family via video-calling this Eid and exchanged greetings while assuring of having a grand celebration once the situation normalises. The markets in the morning also wore a deserted look and there was less movement of people on the streets in the state capital. Bilal Ahmed (29), a resident of Bhattacharya Road, said he offered namaz at home with his brothers, father and uncle and thanked the Almighty for all the blessings during the month of Ramzan. “As the Covid-19 infection rate was higher this year, we are fortunate that no one suffered any severe symptoms. I enjoyed the feast prepared by my mother and sister. However, I missed all the fun I used to have with my friends on the occasion,” he said. “This time, the aroma of sweet itar (perfume) was overshadowed by that of the hand sanitiser and disinfectants. Only a few closed relatives attended a small feast at my home. But instead of offering itar before the meal, we gave hand sanitisers to the guests. The feast was a low-key affair as I prepared only a few traditional dishes -- sevaiyyan, sheer-korma, biryani and mutton chop,” said Aafiya Khatoon (41), a resident of New Azimabad Colony. For many, this Eid celebration was about fitrah (charity) to the needy people and some distributed food items. Mohd Aalim (35), a resident of Sabzibagh said, “Eid is about sharing love and helping people in need. We distributed food, clothes and essential items among the poor and helped those in financial crisis.” For Sanya Ahmed (12), the Eid celebration was about savouring feast, dressing new clothes and receiving Eidi (gifts) in the form of money from elders. “I love sevaiyyan, especially with lots of dry fruits and milk. Several of my relatives sent me gifts as they could not come,” she said. Sajjid Anwer, a resident of Phuwarisharif said, “It is a tough time for all, but the tradition has to go on. We offered namaz at home and shared greetings with the family members and relatives over the phone.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/eid-celebrated-with-prayers-at-home-amid-cov-pandemic/articleshow/82640274.cms||Faryal Rumi

Police said the injured were identified as Inder Kumar and Pradeep Kumar. Inder is the councillor of ward number 7 of the cantonment board while Pradeep is a ward supervisor. Shahpur police station SHO Dheeraj Kumar said the incident took place around 12.30pm when the two were sitting together at Kurha Toli. “Two bike-borne criminals reached the spot and fired from a countrymade pistol,” he said. Kumar said Inder received bullet injury in one of his knees while Pradeep sustained injury in his abdomen. “Both the criminals had kept their faces covered due to which the injured persons could not identify them. The reason behind the incident is yet not clear,” he said. Kumar said both the injured were undergoing treatment at a hospital and their condition was stable. He said raids were on to nab the suspects involved in the crime.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/councillor-among-2-shot-at-in-shahpur/articleshow/82639502.cms||---
---||Patna||Bihar: Only one mortuary van for 2 Sasaram-based hospitals||SASARAM: Despite 210 deaths due to Covid-related ailments in the district since April 1, Rohtas continues to face shortage of healthcare resources. Apparently, there is only one government mortuary van for both Sasaram Sadar Hospital and Narayan Medical College and Hospital to take the bodies of Covid victims for cremation. Additional chief medical officer (ACMO) Dr K N Tiwary admitted said the single mortuary van does not meet the requirement as it takes four to six hours to follow the Covid protocol for cremation of a body. “So people, instead of waiting, prefer to arrange private vehicle themselves for carrying the bodies,” he said. Rohit Kumar, who lost his father and mother within 72 hours at Narayan Medical College and Hospital last week, said he had to pay Rs4,000 to private ambulance each time for bringing their bodies to the cremation ground at Sasaram, hardly 12km from the hospital. “I waited for at least 18 hours for government mortuary van, but it did not reach there. So, I had to hire private ambulance,” Rohit rued. His troubles didn’t end there as he had to pay Rs20,000 for cremation of each body. The state government’s direction to the local administration for providing firewood free of cost for last rites of Covid victims has not reached the district administration yet. When asked on the issue, the in-charge of district disaster management, Khushbu Patel, advised to contact deputy election officer, Rohtas, Satya Priya, who is heading the cell formed for the last rites of the Covid victims. Satya Priya said he was entrusted with the task to expedite the handing over the bodies to the family members as per the Covid protocol. Talks with more than two dozen family members of Covid deceased revealed that they received no help from the administration for the last rites of the Covid victims. Also, efforts by the administration to operate 10 ventilators provided under PM CARES Fund last year, received a jolt when no candidate responded to the advertisement floated by the district health society recently seeking technician for running the ICU and ventilators. The ACMO said process for inviting fresh application for technicians for ventilators is underway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/only-one-mortuary-van-for-2-sasaram-based-hospitals/articleshow/82639581.cms||Alok Chamaria
---||Patna||Patna: Denied financial support, man kills elderly parents with help from wife, son||PATNA: Denied financial support and property share, a man allegedly killed his elderly parents with the help of his wife and 20-year-old son at Shivaji Chowk under the Ramkrishna Nagar police station area in Patna on Thursday. The three accused – Ranjan Kumar (50), Sanju Devi (45) and Avinash Kumar – were arrested on Friday. The victims were identified as Braj Kishore Prasad Singh (70) and his wife Kamal Lata Devi (68). Singh, a retired physical training teacher at a government school, had settled in his three-storey house at Shivaji Chowk post superannuation. Police found strangulation marks around the victims’ necks, which suggested that they were murdered. The accused couple had earlier tried to mislead the police by claiming that Singh and his wife had died of Covid-19. The accused trio had made all arrangements to take the bodies for cremation when the police reached the spot for investigation. City SP (east) Jitendra Kumar said there were bloodstains in Avinash’s nail, which strengthened the suspicion of the police. The SP said Ranjan was unemployed and his parents had stopped supporting him financially. “Ranjan, his wife and son were neither getting anything from Singh’s pension nor the rent the latter was getting from his six tenants. Singh had not even given any property share to his son,” the SP added. SHO of Ramkrishna Nagar police station Rajeshwar Prasad said Ranjan had attempted to kill his father earlier too. “Singh’s married daughter had also died a few years back,” Prasad said. The SHO added Ranjan has confessed to his involvement in the crime. “Ranjan had once tried to kill his father when the latter was in service to get a job on compassionate ground. He had recently sought financial assistance from his father so that his daughter could study engineering, but didn’t get anything. Sanju also used to spend a lot though her husband was unemployed. She did not have good relation with her father-in-law,” the SHO added. He said an FIR was registered against the trio on the basis of a written complaint filed by Satish Kumar, brother of Kamal Lata Devi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/denied-financial-support-man-kills-elderly-parents-with-help-from-wife-son/articleshow/82639885.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Patna||3 bodies fished out from Ganga in Bhojpur||ARA: Three bodies were fished out from the Ganga at Sinha Ghat under Barhara block in Bhojpur district on Friday. The local administration swung into action after a video went viral showing four bodies floating in the river at Sinha Ghat in the morning. Barhara circle officer (CO), block development officer (BDO), Ara Sadar SDPO and SDO sadar, with a team of health department reached the ghat and pressed two boats into service. Three bodies, including of a woman, were fished out and search was still on for the fourth one, Bhojpur DPRO in-charge Rashmi Choudhary said. “The bodies had no burn mark and were bloated due to being in the water for a long time. It is assumed that they have come from upstream. After postmortem, the bodies will be cremated as per the procedure,” the DPRO said. In order to prevent recurrence of such incidents, Bhojpur DM Roshan Kushwaha has ordered intense river patrolling and round-the-clock vigil by the village chowkidars at the cremation ghats. The COs of Shahpur, Barhara and Ara Sadar have been asked to intensify vigil at the cremation ghats, so that no unburned body is found floating in the river. Municipal commissioner and nagar panchayat officials in urban areas and BDOs in the rural areas have been asked to ensure cremation of all bodies with dignity. The Bhojpur district administration also issued two phone numbers for giving any information about any floating bodies in the rivers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/3-bodies-fished-out-from-ganga-in-bhojpur/articleshow/82639372.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Families choose to stay at home this Eid, wish virtually to stop spread of infection||Kolkata: A large number of Muslim families not only stayed home this Eid, but also did not visit parents and siblings, something unthinkable in normal times. They said that this was what they consciously decided to do as part of their contributions against infection spread. Video calls, day-long chats on WhatsApp, sharing pictures, e-greetings and getting food home-delivered were some of the activities people indulged in to keep themselves busy. But most said that the novelty factor of virtual meetings had worn off and they were now weary of these. Shabana Ahmed, an image consultant on Dargah Road, who has recovered from Covid just a month back, had asked her parents Jamal Ahmed and Razia Jamal, who live just five minutes away from her place near Ladies Park on CIT Road, not to visit her even for Eid. “I know I am negative now, but I just cannot take any risk. This is a deadly disease. I was looking at the old photographs of past year celebrations with my parents and called them up several times,” she said feeling sad. Some families decided to celebrate from their different locations by ordering and eating the same lunch spread and connecting the entire affair over virtual meets. Leather exporter Rehan Ahmed, who lives on Palm Avenue and has one brother and three sisters in different locations, ordered an elaborate lunch for all the families. “It was a typical Eid menu of dal Bukhara, nihari, biryani, lachchha paratha, galouti kebabs and firni. The food was delivered to all five homes on time, virtual meet links were sent to all and we ate together virtually. Despite the good food, we longed for physical company of our loved ones. Usually, they all assemble at my place for Eid,” said Ahmed’s wife Zeba. For her married daughter Samira Zarrin Waris, who lives in Rajarhat, 72-year-old Farhat Waris cooked her favourite sheer korma, mutton korma, shammi kebab and chicken biryani and sent it over. “I just didn’t want her to risk it, the second wave should be taken very seriously. We are living in dangerous times,” she said. Samira’s brother Rehan, a public relations professional, too, decided not to go and visit his sister to keep his mother safe. Perhaps the only exception was social entrepreneur Imran Zaki, who lives in a joint family under the same roof. Four generations of the same family came together on the terrace this morning for Eid Salah (prayers) and the Eid Khutbah (sermon). “At a time when the rest of the community is pining to physically meet, we have thanked the almighty for keeping us together as a joint family. Seeing my father praying along with his giant family down to his great grandson on our large terrace was an emotional moment,” Zaki said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/families-choose-to-stay-at-home-this-eid-wish-virtually-to-stop-spread-of-infection/articleshow/82641631.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

A communiqué issued by Bihar Foundation manager (public relations) Vikas Sarkar said of the 184 oxygen concentrators, 23 have been given to Savera Hospital (Patna), 69 to Bhabha Cancer Sansthan (Muzaffarpur) and 92 to the state health department. “The oxygen concentrator is simple to use. It does not require electricity and can be placed beside the bed of the patient,” Sarkar said, adding it draws air from the surroundings, separates nitrogen from it and provides 96% of oxygen concentration. “The flow of oxygen through the device is 5 litres per minute and is useful for the moderate patients,” he added. Earlier, through a gazette notification issued by the state disaster management department on May 6, Bihar Foundation was made the nodal agency to receive relief materials provided by donor agencies and distribute them among the credible entities in the state. Accordingly, the US-based NGO was contacted through the ministry of external affairs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-foundation-procures-184-oxygen-concentrators-from-us/articleshow/82641412.cms||---

The medical doctors at GMERS medical colleges across the state including GMERS Medical College and Hospital, Gotri resumed both Covid and non-Covid duties from Friday morning itself. Earlier, high drama had unfolded at Gandhinagar, where a couple of office-bearers of the association were allegedly detained by the cops at GMERS Gandhinagar campus. The association had alleged that cops were illegally using provisions of the Epidemic Act to threaten them and pressurize them to end the strike. Later, the protesting doctors had a meeting with Jadeja late on Thursday night after which Jadeja assured that all the pending problems of GMERS medical staff will be addressed. “All our eight basic demands which were not being addressed since the last seven years have been resolved with state home minister’s intervention,” said Dr Hiren Prajapati, president of GMERS Faculty Association, a body of faculty members of all eight GMERS medical colleges in the state. Doctors and nurses of GMERS were demanding proper promotion policy, government contribution to PF, allowances as given to government employees and arrears that they have not received after implementation of 7th Pay Commission. They had also demanded filling up vacant posts and increasing strength of permanent staff members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/after-high-drama-gmers-doctors-nurses-end-strike/articleshow/82639556.cms||---
---||Business||Covid drains bank accounts of uninsured||CHENNAI: Besides its debilitating health impact, Covid is draining the finances of its victims, particularly the uninsured, causing some to get into long-term debt. While 49-year-old Mukund Murli got away with a Rs 20,000 bill for his hospital stay due to a health cover purchased by his employer, fellow Chennai resident S Hari Charan had to take a personal loan, which requires him to pay an EMI of Rs 6,500 for four years to clear his hospital bill. The surge in cases and the subsequent capacity constraints are forcing the middle-class to avail of private healthcare services they cannot afford. Manoj Dubey found himself paying out-of-pocket to the extent of Rs 5 lakh after his two children and uninsured aged parents were hit by Covid, requiring hospitalisation. Although Dubey had insurance for his wife and kids, he had to borrow from family and friends due to the non-availability of cashless treatment. There are several stories of companies going the extra mile to help employees through financial support, but there are also thousands who have lost livelihood or suffered pay cuts. Those who lost their jobs face the double whammy of losing income as well as their employer’s group health cover. Financial planners say that the pandemic has underlined the need for health insurance now more than at any other time in the past. Last year, the insurance regulator asked companies to offer a low-cost cover for Covid treatment — Corona Kavach. This cover was to expire in March this year, but the regulator has told companies they can renew it until September. While over a crore have already availed of the policy, there is still a very large uninsured population. “It can be a financial nightmare. It could be a once-a-year premium for medical insurance of Rs 6,041, or without it Rs 6,600 a month for four years if a personal loan is availed of,” said Suresh Parthasarathy, CEO of financial planner myassetsallocation. When there is a Covid infection, in many cases, more than one family member gets infected. “The costs rise proportionately,” Parthasarathy added. The MD of Star Health, S Prakash, said insurers settle 90% of required medical treatment costs and at least 50% of protective equipment. “For the premium one pays, he gets tax breaks, and a continuing policy will give the policyholder accruing benefits. We are seeing more people signing up for policies now,” said Prakash. Insurance aggregator InsuranceDekho’s co-founder & CEO Ankit Agarwal said, “In the current scenario, customer awareness around the need for protection has increased. The pandemic is changing the dynamics of the general insurance industry. Health insurance having overtaken the motor insurance business for the first time ever to emerge as the largest portfolio in the general insurance industry.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/covid-drains-bank-a/cs-of-uninsured/articleshow/82641442.cms||Rajesh Chandramouli

---||Patna||Bihar: Manjhi demands allowance for state unemployed youths||PATNA: Former CM and Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) chief Jitan Ram Manjhi has not been ceasing to surprise CM Nitish Kumar and the NDA government, as on Friday he demanded that the government pay Rs 5,000 as unemployed allowance to unemployed youths in the state. Manjhi said his demand was in tune with his party's poll manifesto for the assembly elections. The HAM(S), along with Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP), is a smaller constituent in the four-party NDA combine that includes JD(U) of Nitish and also the BJP. “Our party, in its poll manifesto, had pledged to pay Rs5,000 as allowance to the unemployed youths if it came to power to make them tide over economic crisis,” Manjhi tweeted on Friday. “I request @Nitish Kumar to pay Rs5,000 as unemployment assistance to youths,” Manjhi also said. Incidentally, this week, it is the second time that Manjhi has flung a surprise before both Nitish and the NDA government. After the arrest of Jan Adhikar Party (Loktantrik) chief Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav for his alleged involvement in a 32-year old kidnapping case, Manjhi had expressed his reservations on the incident. Pappu earlier was actively engaged in providing assistance to the corona-infected patients, among other related matters. Pappu had also “raided” the premises of a voluntary group at Amnour in Saran district, where ambulances purchased by the BJP’s Saran MP Rajiv Pratap Rudy with the MPLAD fund were parked, even as people were facing problems in finding ambulances amid the raging coronavirus pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/manjhi-demands-allowance-for-state-unemployed-youths/articleshow/82639747.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Patna||Bihar: BJP MLC raises question over Pappu’s arrest||PATNA: Days after NDA allies Jitan Ram Manjhi-led HAM(S) and cabinet minister Mukesh Sahani’s Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) disapproved of the arrest of JAP (L) chief and former MP Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav, some senior leaders of ruling BJP and JD(U) have now questioned the wisdom of the police administration to arrest the don-turned-politician at a time when he was tirelessly working to save the lives of Covid-19 patients by providing them necessary medicines and oxygen cylinders. BJP’s former national secretary and MLC Rajnish Kumar has even demanded immediate release of Pappu from jail so that he and his team could resume their work of helping the patients in this unprecedented pandemic. “The arrest of Pappu Yadav is giving a message that the people or people’s representatives who are working for the welfare of people during the Covid-19 pandemic are being discouraged. I say his arrest is against the humanity. If Pappu saved the life of even a single Covid-19 patient, he must be praised by the society and the state government so that more people come forward and serve the patients like Pappu had been doing. I protest the arrest of Pappu in this scenario of pandemic. His arrest is very unfortunate,” Ranjish told TOI over phone on Friday. Rajnish, however, clarified that he was not speaking on behalf of the BJP. “I am giving my opinion as an elected people’s representative. I am not a supporter of Pappu Yadav. But the way he was working to save the Covid-19 patients, he should not have been arrested,” Rajnish said. Senior JD(U) leader and well-known JP movement activist Sushil Tiwari too has questioned the arrest of Pappu at a time when he was “fearlessly working” to help the Covid patients and their families. “Pappu’s fearless works in corona period is a courageous step, which should be welcomed by all. In such a pandemic situation, the act of sending him (Pappu) to jail is ‘neither appropriate nor justified’,” Tiwari said in his Facebook post on Friday. Twari has also said Pappu’s action of exposing parked ambulances was not a “wrong step”. The JD(U) leader has also said that “non-action against the Saran DM and the Saran MP in the ambulance case is sending a wrong message in public about the state government”. Tiwari told TOI that he has not criticized the state government. “Rather, I have shown a mirror to the government,” he said. Pappu was arrested in Patna on Tuesday first for violating the lockdown rules and then in a 32-year-old kidnapping case lodged against him in Madhepura. But there is a strong twist in this case as Raj Kumar Yadav, the man who was allegedly kidnapped, denies the allegations and said the police registered a criminal case against Pappu in utter confusion. Pappu has now been shifted to Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital for his treatment under judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bjp-mlc-raises-question-over-arrest-of-ex-mp-pappu-yadav/articleshow/82639839.cms||---

While some vented their anger at the officials present, many took to social media to convince Telangana CM K Chandrasekhar Rao to allow them into the state. “A few years ago, this place was very much part of united Andhra Pradesh. In this hour of medical crisis, can’t the two governments coordinate and allow our beloved ones to travel for better treatment?” a youth grieved as the ambulance his father was in was stopped.  In another video, a young woman in tears and with folded hands makes an emotional appeal to save her husband. “We have arrived from Tirupati and are heading to Hyderabad. My husband’s pulse has been dropping fast as they have made us wait since 4 am. I don’t know if he will make it as his oxygen levels are critical, please allow us to go,” the woman said, crying inside the ambulance. Four hours later, her husband was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment and later allowed to go after health officials confirmed her hospital reservation. Many lamented that despite meeting the Telangana government’s requirements’ the vehicles were still stopped and made to wait at the border. “Dear KTR garu, My father (with Covid-19 symptoms) is waiting at Telangana border toll gate and we have the reserved bed in Hyderabad hospital. Control room person says that no officer available to review the request and confirm the entry. Please help to enter to Hyd (sic),” Veera S Reddy tweeted, attaching a permission letter from a private hospital situated in Kacheguda.

The GVMC would execute the project through the Greater Visakhapatnam Smart City Corporation Limited, the special purpose vehicle constituted to execute Vizag Smart City initiative. The GVMC expects that this would provide uninterrupted internet services to critical GVMC offices, ward secretariats and municipal schools, apart from working as a backbone for smart city projects such as city operations centre, data centre, CCTV surveillance system, solid waste management system, city bus intelligent transport system, adaptive traffic management & control system, smart poles, etc. Under this initiative, the length of underground fibre to be laid out across the city is estimated to be around 95 kilometres of core layer, 190 kilometres of aggregate layer, and 79 km in the last mile. According to GVMC officials, the civic body is spending Rs 3-4 crore per annum on private broadband services. The own underground OFC network will establish a core ring, connecting zonal offices in the city, and access rings that connect various points of interest for the Greater Visakhapatnam Smart City Corporation Limited. The network, in the initial phase, will support the inclusion of almost all digital assets onto a common platform. This would ensure confluence of data from multiple sources, applications, sensors, objects and people. A GVMC official said that the project will provide a high quality, reliable, cost effective and sustainable network to the city administration. “The network will be the provider of seamless connectivity solution for all surveillance systems. The provisioning of this network backbone will ensure connectivity to the data centres and control rooms with scalable capacities to allow for expansion in the future,” said the GVMC official. The GVMC, under the smart city project, has added several smart components to the city, including establishing the city operations centre with about Rs 140 crore. As part of the project, the civic body planted smart poles across the city. Each smart pole comprises a fixed CCTV camera and one to two pan–tilt–zoom cameras (PTZ cameras) capable of capturing high definition remote directional and zoom control video surveillance, environmental sensors, Wi-Fi hotspots, emergency call system, public announcement speakers, lamps, etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/gvmc-mulls-developing-its-own-fibre-network-in-vizag/articleshow/82640716.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

---||Coimbatore||Flower trade withers due to Covid-19||Coimbatore: Flower traders and sellers at the busy Poo Market say they are worried about losing their livelihoods permanently, as the second wave of the pandemic has already forced them to either shut their shops or conduct hardly 20% of their usual business. After a pay cut, their employees too are considering alternate sources of income.Poo Market used to draw at least 600 tonnes of flowers of various varieties and colours before the virus breakout. “There is an economy that functions around the market,” says Hamidul Asiq Ilahi, who has been running Cheran Bouquet Shop for more than a decade. “We have floriculture farmers, who sell to distributors, who in turn sell the flowers to us for a margin. We, wholesalers, sell the flowers to small-time sellers who sell flowers and garlands outside temples and on streets. By closing the market, livelihoods of all these people are destroyed.”The market houses 37 big and 150 smaller shops on the main and side roads. The big shops, says Ilahi, employ at least 50 people each.“With our shops closed, I had no option but to sell them on my two-wheeler. Our main business comes from weddings, festivals and funerals. Now, they have become low-key affairs. Since temples are also closed, we depend on daily customers, who buy flowers just for their house poojas,” says 27-year-old Mohammed Thameem, who is selling three different varieties of jasmine flowers.The drop in demand and sale has hit the flower prices, which have plunged. “The price of green jasmine (pachai malli) has come down to Rs 120 per kg from Rs 350. Still, a large quantity of flowers go waste as we have to stop the sale at 12pm,” says Thameem.Sixty-five-year-old Shahul Hameed, who is known for his marigold garlands, agreed with Thameem and said at least 20kg flowers worth Rs 3,000 were going waste.Peer Mohammed, a member of flower garlanders’ welfare association, said the first wave had hit them badly, as the shops were completely shut. “But we soon got hope of reopening and returning to normal. This time, we are allowed to do business at Shastri Maidanam and Poo Market, but we are scared about the future. We can’t afford to shut our shops down every time a few of us test positive for the virus.”Six people from the market had contracted the virus last weekend, forcing shops at Shastri Maidanam and Poo Market to down shutters for a couple of days. Then came the total lockdown. “However, shops are open behind the shutters and selling flowers to customers,” says Mani Velan, who waits outside his shop to canvas the customers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/flower-trade-withers-due-to-covid-19/articleshow/82643581.cms||---

Amul India’s MD R Sodhi says sales have come down to 30%-50% in this year. The company has cut production by 60%. Ice cream manufacturers say they have not revised their pricing despite increased input costs. Logistics costs have also risen 20%, while packaging costs are up 40%. “This year we were seeing some improvement in sales from states like Maharashtra. However, we are losing sales in states like Uttar Pradesh currently,” Sodhi added.Hatsun Agro Product — which owns Arun Ice Cream — also saw sales drop to 30%-40%, due to the lockdown imposed in April. Its managing director RG Chandramogan said the normal summer season sales were wiped off in the last two years. However, we expect to do 30% sales better than April and May 2020 due to low base effect. We are not running in production full capacity. We are also absorbing the cost like an increase in packaging cost of 15%. On the other hand, online selling FMCG startups like Habbit Health and Nutrition which sells in Delhi NCR, say sales have increased three times. Its CEO Dhruv Bhushan says demand for our nutritious ice cream category has increased from Rs 6 lakh in March, 2021 to Rs 17 lakh in April, 2021. “Customers are going for the ‘nutrition’ quotient and are gifting our products to friends and family during the lockdown. We are seeing the same growth trend in May too.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/for-second-year-in-a-row-ice-cream-cos-face-subdued-sales/articleshow/82641695.cms||Mamtha Asokan
---||Vijayawada||Plea in HC against Sangam Dairy order||Vijayawada: The state government moved the high court, challenging the single judge order of suspending the GO issued to take over the management of Sangam Dairy. An appeal petition was moved before a division bench seeking to set aside the order of the single judge. The state government had issued GO 19 to transfer the management of Sangam Dairy to Andhra Pradesh Dairy Development Corporation Limited (APDDCL). These orders also withdraw the GO issued on July 17, 1978 through which the management of Sangam feeder balancing dairy was transferred to Guntur District Milk Producers Cooperative Union (GDMPCU), which was subsequently converted into a mutually aided cooperative society and then a producer company under the name of Sangam Dairy. The dairy management challenged the GO before the high court. Justice D V S S Somayajulu after hearing both sides passed an interim order suspending the GO and said the management can continue in its position but not encumber or alienate the properties of the dairy without prior permission of the high court. The state government in its appeal petition argued that the single judge erred in suspending the GO observing that the state government do not have powers to do so. The state government argued that the single judge did not consider its arguments in entirety and said that it has all powers to take over the management of the dairy and sought to set aside the order of the single judge. The high court is likely to hear the matter on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/plea-in-hc-against-sangam-dairy-order/articleshow/82640730.cms||Srikanth Aluri

---||Business||Finance ministry to states: Protect bank staff, prioritise vax||MUMBAI: The finance ministry has again written to state governments asking them to put in place a dispensation for vaccinating bank and other financial sector employees. It has also asked the states to protect financial sector employees after incidents of bank staff being manhandles by police enforcing a lockdown came to light. Debasish Panda, secretary in the department of financial services at the finance ministry, said in a letter to all states’ chief secretaries that the home ministry has categorised the banking industry as a provider of essential services. Since bank employees have to necessarily commute from their homes to offices, and offices must remain physically open, the chief secretaries have been asked to communicate to all district magistrates and police chiefs not to hinder or impede their functioning or movement. “This letter is very pertinent, and the messaging will help in boosting the morale of bank employees,” said Rajkiran Rai, chairman of the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA). “It sends out a message to everyone that bank employees should be treated with respect,” he added. Earlier this week, videos of police caning a bank employee on his way to work had gone viral and had caused outrage. In March, the IBA had sought frontline worker status for bank staff. At that time, the association had pointed out that there were around 600 casualties due to Covid among bank employees. Since then, the number of casualties has doubled with the maximum deaths during the last six weeks when the country saw a surge of cases in the second wave. Although the finance ministry has made requests to states for vaccination of bank employees, some senior executives feel that the communication for priority in vaccination needs to come from the home ministry for states to take cognisance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/finmin-to-states-protect-bank-staff-prioritise-vax/articleshow/82642274.cms||---
---||Patna||Patna: Hospitals start planning to face third wave of Covid||PATNA: The apprehension by the scientific community that the third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic is likely to hit in a couple of months has put the big hospitals of Patna on alert to begin advance planning to face the challenge. The director of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna (AIIMS-P), Dr P K Singh, said though there was no direction from the government, the hospital, currently engaged in the treatment of those infected in the second wave, has begun reviewing its preparations, particularly with the apprehension of the virus affecting children in the third wave, which may require some new measures. He said children, both in urban and rural areas, could be highly susceptible to get infected as some new variant of the virus may be part of the third wave. The hospital has a 60-bed paediatric ward but the number of beds may be increased, if the situation demanded so, he said. “In case of children falling victim to the virus, several other issues would need attention as how to allow their parents or attendants to be in the Covid ward. The children, depending on mother’s milk, would need special care,” he said. Dr Singh, however, stated that the AIIMS-P is able to make new arrangements any time. Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) superintendent Dr IS Thakur said the paediatric ward had about 200 beds, including those of surgery and orthopaedics. “We would soon hold a meeting with the doctors of the paediatrics department to review preparations for saving the children from the Covid infection and also also seek direction from the state government in this regard,” Dr Thakur said. He, however, stated that since the Covid virus was undergoing mutations, producing new strains with varying symptoms across the world, the medical fraternity would have to be cautious on cases with new symptoms seen in children. Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) superintendent Dr Manish Mandal said a 40-bed ward with oxygen support and five ICUs were available in the children ward there. The Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH) has 60 paediatric beds, but may add 50 more if needed for treatment of children, said its superintendent Dr Binod Kumar Singh, a paediatrician himself. He said as speculated worldwide that the third wave may affect children, there is an urgent need to start vaccination to save children who are highly susceptible to catch infection, both within their homes and outside. “Malnourishment in children of lower strata of the the society poses a high risk in them as nobody knows the virulence and rate of transmission of any new strain of the virus. In case of the Covid-19 third wave, it could be more severe than the two previous waves,” he said. “If another wave hits Bihar, our un-immunised group, say children, could be the the worse hit,” says Dr Satyajeet Singh, director of Ruben hospital. After witnessing the virulence of the second wave of the viral infection, the medical fraternity now stresses the need for immunisation of children below the age of 18. He said a thorough training of healthcare workers is needed to reach every corner of our villages, screen the children suffering from malnutrition. Strengthening of healthcare system at all level are among the measures to help the society against any third wave of the pandemic. He said Ruben hospital has made an advance planning to create a children’s ward in its new 90-bed unit under development.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hosps-start-planning-to-face-third-wave-of-covid/articleshow/82640132.cms||VK Tripathi

That, too, when more than 800 employees of the Danapur division, including officials, doctors and paramedical staff, have tested positive and 27 of them succumbed to the deadly virus so far. However, frontline employees like loco pilots, guards, station masters and healthcare staff have not showed their back at this hour of crisis, Danapur divisional railway manager (DRM) Sunil Kumar said. “Danapur, which is a passenger oriented division, created a record in the railways when it loaded two million tonne goods in the pandemic hit 2020-21 fiscal,” the DRM said. A separate control room has been set up at Danapur for the Covid-infected railway employees to keep a close watch on their welfare and provide all possible assistance, including monetary and medical care, to them in their fight against the virus,” he said. The division has also created a sort of record when it effectively dealt with the operations of 400-odd shramik special trains, which brought migrants to Bihar from other states during the lockdown period. To carry out medical screening and giving meals to them was a herculean task, but the employees did with all smiles on their faces, the DRM said, adding about 280 pairs of special passenger trains are either originating from or passing through Danapur division daily. Amid the Covid-19 surge, employees of the division built a freight terminal at Chakand on the Patna-Gaya line and made other goods sheds functional to transport essential items, the DRM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/danapur-rly-staff-brave-pandemic-serve-people/articleshow/82640291.cms||Kumod Verma

Amid the raging pandemic, jewellers were happy to see that life has not halted in the city. Jewellery shops, following the restrictions on timings, remained open from 12pm-3pm on Friday. The long queue of cars at Bowbazar was missing, but customers dropped in. Compared to a complete shutdown last year, it was a relief for nearly 350 jewellery shops that have witnessed the worst days since the pandemic broke out. At Gariahat, shops witnessed a moderate turnout of customers. “Even in the morning, we did not expect such a turnout. We were skeptical and more than 100 buyers visiting our store has far exceeded our expectation,” said Rupak Saha, zonal member of Gem and Jewellery Trade Council of India. Gold has already been trading low in India in tune with the international market trend. Two days back, gold price at the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) dipped by Rs 311 for 10 gm. On Friday, gold in Kolkata was hovering around Rs 47,130 for 10 gm. May 5 rate of the yellow metal in Kolkata, was however, the lowest in last couple of months—Rs 46,400 for 10 gm. Prices increased after that. “Imagine what it was just a year back. We were just been hit by the pandemic and everything was shutdown. At least we have overcome the gloom to some extent,” said Bablu Dey of Swarna Shilpa Bachao Committee. “There are around 350 shops in Bowbazar, 250 in Gariahat and around 100 in Hatibagan. Most of them had a limited footfall on Friday. We cannot even expect the crowd to match past years’ levels at present. Many of the buyers are placing orders over phone and visiting the shops to make payment. We are talking to our members to workout a home-delivery mechanism,” Dey said. Suvankar Sen, CEO of Senco Gold and Diamonds said that the stores that were open witnessed limited footfalls. “Customers who purchased from the stores physically, bought heavier festive pieces and wedding jewellery for the upcoming wedding season. Gold coins were also purchased from different stores,” Sen said. “We had a good response which we never expected. We thought buyers would stay away this time. But they proved us wrong. Many of came maintaining Covid-19 protocol. Sales will not be very high, but the spirit of Kolkata has reinforced our faith,” said Roopchand Sawansukha, director of Sawansukha Jewellers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/biz-boost-for-city-jewellery-stores-on-akshay-tritiya/articleshow/82641745.cms||Rohit Khanna

All of a sudden, their car crashed into a tree on the state highway at Firozabad-Etawah border leaving four baratis dead and the groom along with another person seriously injured. The groom was shifted from Firozabad district hospital to SN Medical College in Agra on Friday morning. Saurav Singh, son of Brijraj Singh, was about to get married to Pooja. And Saurav along with five of his family - all residents of Etawah district - were on their way to Nagla Balu village. According to police, a Maruti Ertiga carrying the baratis rammed into a tree near Katfori police outpost. "Three died on the spot while the fourth succumbed during treatment at the district hospital. The bridegroom suffered serious injuries in both his legs and chest. He has been referred to Agra," the police said. The four deceased were identified as Saurav's cousins Yogendra (26), Yogesh (22), uncle Khempal (45) and Rajkumar (38), a relative. The wedding had to be cancelled. ASP Akhilesh Narayan Singh said, “People at the site said that the accident took place after a vehicle tried to overtake the car. The driver lost control and rammed into a nearby tree."

This is the first litter of leopards recorded this year. However, for LK, this is the fifth litter. It has now given birth to a total of 12 cubs. Last year too, the leopardess gave birth to three cubs. “The cubs are around 2-3 months old. We had some indication that the big cat had conceived and delivered,” said an official with the reserve. “We have now increased monitoring. LK is an able mother not simply because she has previously given birth but for the fact that a majority of her offspring have survived,” the official said. Last year too, the reserve saw the birth of 10 cubs. In December, leopardess Leela was spotted with two cubs, thereby becoming the sixth leopardess to give birth in the park since January 2020. In May 2020, leopardess Jalebi was captured on camera with its cub. Similarly, leopardess Flaura was sighted with three cubs in the beginning of this year. Three other female leopards, LK, Mrs Khan and Sharmili, gave birth to cubs, resulting in an increase in young population. It is believed that the leopard count has steadily gone up in this particular forest area mainly due to efficient monitoring as well as efforts to provide a protected environment for the wildlife. Jhalana is spread over 22sqkm area. There are four dominant males, Rambo, Bahadur, Bagheera and Sultan, in Jhalana and two, Bluethunder and Prince, in the Galta region. “At present, there are 31 leopards in the reserve. and The big cats find the environment as well as resources conducive here for delivering the litter,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/3-leopard-cubs-caught-on-camera-trap-at-jhalana/articleshow/82643604.cms||---

On Friday morning, circle inspector at Kapasan Himanshu Singh and tehsildar Mohkam Singh donned PPE kits to remove the body of a woman who died due to Covid after hospitals refused to do the same as she had died in home isolation. The woman, Rekha Lohar, had died at home while in Covid isolation and her family members contacted a hospital for removing the body as per corona protocols. But the medical team refused to assist claiming that they would do so only for patients who died in the hospital. If patients die at home, families have to arrange for removing them, the staff said. The woman died around 10am on Friday and her family and kin did not dare go near the body in fear of catching the infection. SHO Himanshu Singh received information that a Covid victim’s body was lying unattended at a home for three hours. He went to the house along with tehsildar Mohkam Singh to find out the details. The officers then sought help from several sources, including municipal administration, to remove the body but in vain. Calls made to municipal authorities went unanswered. Finding no other way, the cop and the tehsildar decided to remove the body themselves. They donned PPE kits and started the process. The SHO’s courage and kindness inspired other cops to assist. They carried the body to the ambulance for cremation. As per norms, municipal bodies have been authorised to ensure respectable cremation of bodies of Covid victims. However, in many places, it has been reported that families have been made to pay a heavy price to remove bodies as per pandemic protocols. Recently, in Udaipur too, hospital staff were accused of demanding money for removing the body of a corona victim.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sho-tehsildar-help-remove-covid-victims-body-for-cremation-in-chittor/articleshow/82643614.cms||---
---||Agra||AMU alum create a low-cost oxygen concentrator; successfully test it at govt hosp||AGRA: A startup run by a group of young engineers in Aligarh has developed a low-cost oxygen concentrator to combat the ongoing oxygen crisis in the country, and the prototype has been successfully tested on Covid-19 patients in government hospital, Aligarh. The prototype was successfully tested on Covid-19 affected patients at the government hospital in Aligarh. The machine is a low-cost alternative to imported oxygen concentrators that cost over Rs 90,000. The Aligarh model, in comparison, costs just Rs 35,000. The startup, Engineering & Environmental Solutions (E&E Solutions), is being run by Syed Abu Rehan, 31, Mohammad Faizan Ali Khan, 33 and Mohammad Hamza, 31. All three have done their schooling from AMU’s Minto circle school. While Rehan completed his M Tech in Civil Engineering from IIT Kanpur, Faizan and Hamza have completed their masters in environmental and petrochemical engineering respectively from AMU. They founded E&E in 2015 and today they have a staff of 50 people. Research and development head at the startup, Syed Abu Rehan, said that they have used the PSA (Pressure Swing Adsorption) technology to develop the low-cost concentrator. In this, zeolite – a commercial adsorbent -- acts as a molecular “sieve” to block nitrogen molecules at high pressure and allow oxygen molecules to pass. The process concentrates oxygen above 90 percent which can be used by patients. However, due to non-availability of zeolite the startup is not able to scale at present. “Otherwise, we can produce 100 oxygen concentrators per day,” Rehan claimed. To scale up their production, E&E shared their design with Aligarh-based company, Precision Advanced System, owned by Manish Bansal. Bansal told TOI that around 20-25 of these concentrators are being used by NGOs and some of the hospitals after it was successfully tested at the government hospital. “I have contacted other countries, too, to get medical grade zeolite,” he said. Divisional commissioner (Aligarh range), Guarav Dayal, told TOI that he has provided them nearly 15 kg zeolite so far but for mass production they would need more. “We are trying to help them further,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/amu-alum-create-a-low-cost-oxygen-concentrator-successfully-test-it-at-govt-hosp/articleshow/82640014.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Rachakonda police registered a murder case and apprehended two suspects. While police were trying to locate the whereabouts of the contractor, Amudalapalli Ramurthi Naidu, his decomposed body was found in Annaram Cheruvu in Nagaram on Thursday. The body was identified by Ramurthi’s family members. On Wednesday night, A Srinivas, a mason from Kothapet, lodged a complaint with Kushaiguda police alleging that his maternal uncle, Ramurthi Naidu, left home on May 10 and did not return. “My uncle left the house saying that he was going to Kushaiguda area to meet a known person, Srikanth, but did not return,” Srinivas alleged. Ramurthi Naidu was a resident of KPHB Colony. As the phone of the victim was switched off, family members enquired with Srinivas Reddy, who was with Ramurthi when he left the house, and searched for him for two days. “After failing to locate him, they approached us and a missing case was registered,” Kushaiguda SI Madan Lal said. Police shifted the body to Osmania General Hospital for postmortem. Police altered the missing incident to murder case. Police suspect the involvement of Srikanth alias Antony, a chitfund businessman, and Srinivas Reddy behind the murder. Police reportedly apprehended the suspects and are trying to find out the reasons for the murder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/missing-contractor-found-dead-in-lake-2-suspects-held/articleshow/82643631.cms||---

As companies engaged in the work are finding it difficult to get parts of solar plants from different countries on time, the UT’s project planned to start this year got delayed. A senior UT official said the administration is at the moment completely focusing on saving lives. Solar power generation will be taken up once the crisis is overcome. The target set by the end of 2022 is likely not to be completed and they will now fix revised deadlines, he added. The ministry of new and renewable energy had enhanced the city’s solar power generation target from 50 megawatt (MW) to 69 MW, to be achieved by 2022. Till date UT has achieved generation of around 40 MW. The UT had planned to achieve more than the target fixed, setting a goal of 100MW by 2022. Recently, the Joint Electricity Regulatory Commission (JERC) had also turned down UT administration’s plea of implementing Resco (Renewable Energy Service Company) model for solar plants installation in city. The Chandigarh Renewable Energy and Science and Technology Promotion Society (Crest), had moved JERC for implementing Resco model in city. Crest, the project's nodal agency, had proposed this model after the approval of UT administrator V P Singh Badnore as residents were wary of the initial capital investment. Under the Resco model, the UT had planned that private companies will install solar-energy plants on private property, and in return, charge the building owner a much lower tariff (Rs 3.44 per unit) than the normal electricity rate (Rs 2.75 to Rs 5.20) for about 15 years (or whatever period is agreed in the tender). Thereafter the house owner will get the plant. The building owner and the private company will sign a deal. The plant will be installed under the net metering mode, whereby a solar-energy unit is connected to the building's electricity system and the solar energy exported to the grid is adjusted in terms of units imported from the electricity department during a billing cycle. Deadline not extended after March 31 The UT administration last year had extended the solar installation deadline till next March 31, 2021. But recently, the UT had not extended the deadline. Last year, the deadline was extended as lockdown was in force. AT that time the UT administration had also decided not to impose any penalty on residents till the lockdown gets over. The administration in a notification issued on May 18, 2016, had made installation of rooftop solar power plants mandatory in residential houses measuring 500 sq yd and above and group housing societies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/second-wave-slams-brakes-on-uts-solar-dream/articleshow/82640063.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

---||Agra||UP: Families of the dead to watch cremation live on mobile phone||AGRA: With crammed crematoriums and strict Covid protocols leaving little space for families to bid farewell to their loved ones, the management of Agra's only electric crematorium has now decided to livestream the funeral process. Arrangements are being made to ensure families are able to at least watch the funeral on their mobile phones. A password with 30-minute validity will be issued and a team of software engineers are working to develop the set up, Tajganj crematorium caretakers said. There are four furnaces for electric cremation at Tajganj at present. The compound has 16 CCTV cameras. Live CCTV footage can be viewed from the main office only, as of now. On Friday, Tajganj crematorium in-charge Sanjeev Gupta said, “Families of the deceased are facing a tough time as they are unable to attend the funeral. So, we have planned to livestream the ceremony. A relative will be provided a password to view the last rite for 30 minutes. Engineers are working on it. Optical fibre is being laid at the crematorium. After successful implementation at the electric cremation facility, platforms for traditional wood cremation will be also covered." In wake of the second Covid wave, the number of bodies arriving at the crematorium has increased thrice in April. Earlier, 450 bodies were cremated in a month. The number was 1,700 last month. A caretaker at the Tajganj crematorium said, “More cremations are taking place since the second week of April. Normally, 15 bodies are cremated here. But, in the last 24 hours, over 50 bodies have arrived. We have asked the family members of the deceased to wait as there is no vacant space as of now." The families are not even allowed to mourn at the cremation ground. They are asked to stand at a distance due to lack of space. Moreover, cremations are usually avoided after sunset. But, the last rites are continuing round the clock. “The district administration has ordered night cremation due to the heavy workload," the caretaker added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/families-of-the-dead-to-watch-cremation-live-on-mobile-phone/articleshow/82640081.cms||---

The administration has already deployed its senior officials at the plant of INOX, Barotiwala, Baddi and three vendors in the city. Sources said in a recent meeting between Manoj Parida, UT adviser, and Yashpal Garg, nodal officer of oxygen supplies, it was discussed to ask the officials deployed there to submit a report to Garg. Recently, Garg had even written to UT SSP for providing round-the-clock security at the oxygen generation plant at Industrial Area after the plant and its employees braved four attacks within a week from people not eligible for refilling of cylinders. The Chandigarh director general of police (DGP) had provided police escort facility to tankers carrying liquid medical oxygen from INOX Barotiwala (Baddi) plant to the city on the request of the UT health department. The administration had recently held a meeting with all private hospitals to monitor the oxygen supply to them. The administration had also directed that private hospitals and mini Covid care centres would inform it regarding the requirement of oxygen cylinders by 12 noon every day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ut-seeks-report-on-o2-plants/articleshow/82640104.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: SoBo loses green spot as BMC starts axing trees||Mumbai: Cutting of trees has begun at the BMC-run Tata Garden on Bhulabhai Desai Road (Warden Road) in south Mumbai, one of the most verdant spaces in the city. A large portion of the 1.1 acre garden is expected to make way for the first interchange of the proposed coastal road which will exit towards this garden carrying traffic headed to Malabar Hill, Peddar Road, and Mahalaxmi. In December 2018, TOI was the first to report on the BMC’s plans to acquire a portion of the garden for its coastal road project. The tree authority has sanctioned cutting of 61 trees and transplanting of 79 on the stretch between Bhulabhai Desai Road and Tata Garden. BMC officials said they plan to extend the garden towards the sea. “The contractor is carrying out tree cutting works along with a horticulturist and consultants, while we are inspecting the same. The trees to be transplanted will be taken to a plot identified in F North ward,” said a civic official. Dr Nilesh Baxi from the Breach Candy Welfare Group, which moved court to save the trees and also held ‘Rakhi Bandho Vriksh Bachao Abhiyan’ in 2019, said the cutting is unfortunate. “All our requests have fallen on deaf ear as neither the courts nor the civic body were ready to pay heed,” said Baxi. Activist Zoru Bhathena said the plans to extend the garden seem unconvincing. “Why destroy one garden to make way for another? Residents have proposed alternatives to the interchange which have not been considered,” he said. Nawroz Pathanki, who lives across the garden, said the markings for the trees to be cut and transplanted started on Thursday itself. “I have been going to the garden for the past three decades and it is unfortunate to see the trees being cut,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sobo-loses-green-spot-as-bmc-starts-axing-trees/articleshow/82644899.cms||Richa Pinto

---||Bhopal||Medicine buying frenzy puts many drugs out of stock||BHOPAL: Shops are closed during corona curfew in the city except for medical shops but the crowd of buyers at the medical shops gives an impression as if you were at a grocery shop or a supermarket. Fear or desperation writ large on their faces, people asking for medicines without prescription, some showing names of medicines on the screen of their mobiles. Not all of them are ill or buying medicines for someone ailing in the family, many of them are buying things like Betadine Gargle or nebulizer or Carbol (plus) or Zinc tablets or multivitamins as a preventive measure at a time when unprecedented surge in cases of Coronavirus has put everyone on high alert. And, this “frenzied” buying has put many of these items out of stock. It’s only now that tablets like Zincovit or a piece of nebulizer have to be searched in several shops or a chemist in your neighbourhood tells you to come in the evening for nebulizer because by then the new stock would have arrived. Coming to medicines being prescribed by the doctors for Covid-19, Fabiflu is out of stock at most of the shops and its alternative (with the same formula as the chemist tells you) is being offered to the buyers, in place of Ceftum 500, you again have its alternative at several shops, if you ask for LCZ Cold, the chemist may offer Cheston Cold saying both have the same formula. Doxy and Ivermectin, you get at some shops and don’t at many others, but, somehow, its alternative *(with the same formula) is seldom offered by the chemists. It’s not only the allopathic medicines (prescribed or not by the doctors) that is being searched by the people to prevent or treat Covid-19, Ayurvedic and homeopathic medicines are also quite in vogue. After searching for Faviflu and ultimately searching for its alternative, and person accompanied by his son, who had come to buy medicines for his niece, started looking for Coronil in the Ayurvedic shops nearby at Bittan Market but was disappointed when told that it would only be available at Patanjali store in MP Nagar or any other place. Giloy juice or Giloy-Tulsi- Neem juice is being used by many to boost immunity and escape the attack by lethal virus. A Homeopathy medicine, which is said to boost the Oxygen level in blood and keep it stable, is also being purchased by people for any eventuality. If medical shops are crowded, the diagnostic centres, who have the facility of CT scan , are all the more crowded. People of all age groups can be seen there sitting for their turn to get chest CT scan. “Doctors don;t want to take any chances. RT PCR reports get delayed. And, their prime concern is to save the patient from infection spreading into the chest, so doctors are relying on CT scan a lot. Besides, some people are getting it done on their own”, said owner of a diagnostic centre on the condition of anonymity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/med-buying-frenzy-puts-many-drugs-out-of-stock/articleshow/82641868.cms||Ashutosh Shukla
---||Agra||Woman gets bail two years after cops fail to mention her mental illness in chargesheet||AGRA: In prison for two years after police failed to mention her mental illness in the chargesheet, a woman undertrial, 30, was released from jail on interim bail on Friday. The bail was granted to Pushplata a month after TOI highlighted her plight. She had been incarcerated for the past two years on kidnapping charges in Aligarh district jail and a mental health facility in Varanasi. The bail was granted on orders of a high-powered committee in compliance with the Supreme Court directives to release all undertrial prisoners in cases with imprisonment less than seven years. The order was issued in a bid to decongest prisons amid the second wave of Covid-19. Pushplata had wandered off while on her way back home from a prenatal checkup at a hospital in Delhi on July 22, 2019, and had somehow reached Aligarh. She was arrested for trying to kidnap a child. After a month, she delivered a baby boy in the district jail on August 16, 2019. As she was mentally unfit to take care of the child, he was given to the child protection home in Agra in absence of such a facility in Aligarh. She is mentally fine now after her treatment in Varanasi, said Pramod Kumar Singh, jailor of the district prison. On Friday, she met her husband, Ravi Ranjan, who came to pick her up along with her father, Durgesh Prasad. She was united with the husband and they all left for Bihar after picking up the child from Agra. Talking with TOI, Pushplata said, “I can’t express my happiness after seeing my little boy. I will call him Krishna,” she said, adding that earlier he was not coming to her but now, he is comfortable. She told TOI that she will be heading to Bihar after completing all formalities at the child welfare committee here. She will also go to Jharkhand, where her daughter, Gauri, lives with her grandparents. Asked about her arrival in Aligarh two years ago, she said she does not remember anything. When contacted, SSP Kalanidhi Naithani said a probe is on into the matter (of the mentally ill woman being in jail) but has been delayed due to preoccupation in handling the Covid-19 situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/woman-gets-bail-2-yrs-after-cops-fail-to-mention-her-mental-illness-in-chargesheet/articleshow/82640150.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Child panel notice to DEO over school blocking student||JAIPUR: Rajasthan State Child Rights Commission sent a notice to the District Education Officer of Jaipur on Thursday on the complaints of one Sunil Yadav, about his ward being blocked from online classes by Jayshree Periwal High School (JPHS). A copy of the letter was sent to the school as well. Although, the school administration unblocked the student on Friday. According to the complaint filed by Yadav, his child was blocked by the school from online classes on May 3 and even after saying that he will pay fees as per the Supreme Court guidelines, the school didn’t act. “According to SC, we can pay fee for 2020-21 session in six instalments from March to August. I said, I will pay the fee accordingly but without any warning, the school blocked my child. I called up everyone in the administration and after my request, the child commission took cognizance of the matter. Although on Friday evening, my child was unblocked, but the kind of mental agony I had to go through is unimaginable,” he said. Sangeeta Beniwal, chairperson of the commission said, “We got the complaint, on which we acted. We usually send a notice to the DEO and school authorities. DEO is supposed to investigate on the complaint and if sufficient answer is not received, we call the authorities in office. But it is good that finally the school has unblocked the student.” TOI tried to contact JPHS principal Madhu Maini, but she was not reachable. Parents’ complaints that students whose parents have paid the entire fee for last year are unblocked but parents who are taking their time are blocked without any warning. Shruti Singhal’s children were blocked by JPHS and were immediately unblocked after she paid the entire fees in one go. “What are we supposed to do? In lockdown, our children cannot go outside and with online classes being blocked, we were left with no option then to just pay the fees. We were thinking we will just follow the SC guidelines but the school has its own tactics,” said Shruti.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/child-panel-notice-to-deo-over-school-blocking-student/articleshow/82643661.cms||---

Now, except grocery, vegetable, meat and fish shops no outlets will be allowed, and even these essentials will be allowed to remain open only for four hours – from 6 am to 10am. E-commerce entities like Dunzo can deliver goods only till 10am. Also, there will be no more tea shops in neighbourhoods and on roads, as they too have been banned completely, along with pavement sale of vegetables, fruits and flowers.

However, allopathic as well as native medical pharmacies will be allowed to remain open as usual, along with ATM and fuel outlets.

However, this e-registration system would come into effect from 6am on May 17. The 10pm to 4am night curfew in force will continue and complete lockdown will be imposed on two Sundays —May 16 and 23.

Dilip Kumar (40) and Ashish Kumar (32) are accused of demanding Rs 10 lakh and Rs 5 lakh, respectively, to help the company in a tax evasion case investigation.In two separate orders rejecting their bail pleas, the court said witnesses in the case include employees of the I-T department and other connected persons. “Obviously, the possibility cannot be ruled out that the accused may try to influence the witnesses before completion of investigation,” said special judge Jayendra C Jagdale. Moreover, the investigating agency claimed that the bribe was collected for distribution among other I-T officers. “Obviously, the investigating agency is required to probe as for whom the bribe amount was collected by the accused,” he added. After a written complaint by the MD on April 6 , the investigating agency caught the duo red-handed two days later, Ashish Kumar allegedly threw the bag of cash given to him by the complainant’s driver but was caught after a chase. The prosecution said after the arrests, a search at Dilip Kumar’s Ulwe flat led to recovery of unaccounted for cash of Rs 7 lakh. Seeking bail, Dilip Kumar’s defence submitted that he had cooperated and that he had no past record. Ashish Kumar submitted that he was falsely implicated by another officer with whom he did not share a cordial relationship. The court said vital evidence in the form of taped conversations between the complainant and accused was collected prior to the trap and the accused were caught red-handed. “There was no question of any cooperation. Therefore, the contention of the investigating agency that the probe is at an initial stage and not yet completed, has a material bearing with this present matter,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/probe-not-over-no-bail-for-i-t-staffers-in-bribe-case-in-mumbai-court/articleshow/82644958.cms||Rebecca Samervel

Two more drugs, used in place of Ampho-B, too were unavailable as patients’ kin ran pillar to post amid rumours of black marketing. The district administration is still trying to form a distribution strategy, even as it too was clueless about the exact quantity of the anti-fungal drugs in stock, with demand soaring with each passing day among Covid recovered patients. It’s been around a fortnight now that acute shortages of Ampho-B are being reported as cases of Mucormycosis started increasing at a rapid pace. The situation is a challenge for the district administration and Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) too. Read AlsoWhat’s black fungus? Queries flood hospsNoida/Ghaziabad: As the battle with Covid continues, its after-effects are increasingly becoming a cause for concern among patients. Over the past few weeks, hospitals in Noida and Ghaziabad have been getting many calls about mucormycosis, the black fungal disease that is being reported in patientsThere was an online meeting with around 50 experts like ear, nose and throat (ENT) doctors, infection disease specialists, ophthalmologists and maxillofacial surgeons, hospital representatives, FDA and Covid task force members on Friday. District collector Ravindra Thakare assured ‘justifiable distribution’ once stock arrives among institutions ‘as per their patient needs and numbers’. Thakare has now asked for compiling of district-wide data of Mucormycosis patients at each hospital and their requirements to formulate a distribution policy. Making matters worse, shortages were also reported of Ampho-B’s two other cheaper replacements, which are Amphotericin Deoxycholate and Amphotericin B Emulsion, now. Apart from the Amphotericin family, anti-fungal Posaconazole too is learnt have disappeared from the shelves.

In a separate press statement, the Union healthThakare said an expert committee would gauge demand and assess the ground situation related to Mucormycosis and prepare comprehensive guidelines. “We have updated data of stock of Ampho-B family of drugs in our official website (nagpur.gov.in) from the period starting May 1. Our aim is to ensure justifiable distribution once stock is available,” he said. The district administration is also contemplating deregulating the Remdesivir distribution as stock is in surplus now. Around 50% of the hospitals have refused the stock as it is not required by them. Dr Anup Marar, convener of Vidarbha Hospitals Association, said the collector may pool available quantity of key drugs of Ampho-B family to ensure proper distribution. “The task force, and professionals can agree on guidelines for distribution so clinical management of the disease can be accomplished within limited resources,” he said. Task force member Dr Ravindra Sarnaik said awareness regarding usage of scarce drugs must be created among the community and also stockists. “A local plan along national guidelines on management of the fast spreading disease using limited resources is needed,” he said. Dr Prashant Nikhade, president of ENT association, said the challenges are now manifold as replacement drugs too are in short-supply along with the key drugs. “The hospitals are left with very less stock,” he said. Hetal Thakkar, president of the Druggists and Chemists Association, said the superspecialty drugs, especially the injectables, must come with a price capping now, with reduced gap between the price to the whole-seller and the MRP. “Many drugs are being diverted out of Vidarbha and routed elsewhere,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-relief-in-sight-for-mucor-patients-as-drug-crunch-gets-more-serious/articleshow/82643675.cms||Soumitra Bose

According to them, when some of them questioned their college management for the excess charges, not only was their individual fee hiked citing various reasons, but they were also threatened with dire consequences. These colleges included many engineering and management ones, apart from those offering professional courses. NU Board of Examination and Evaluation (BOEE) director Prafulla Sable admitted there was some error in BBA fees circular, where colleges were told to levy late fees on those filling up forms after the deadline. “However, we corrected it as soon as we came to know about it through the media. Even students called me about this discrepancy. The students now don’t have to pay the late fees even if they filled up the forms after the last date,” he told TOI, adding that NU had stopped imposing late fees since the outbreak of coronavirus. Sable, however, said NU didn’t receive any complaint from students from engineering and management institutions charging extra fees. “NU’s exam fees are the same for all colleges, which is approved by our authorities. Only in case of courses involving projects, it increases slightly. In fact, since the last three years, the university hasn’t increased the exam fees for the students. If any college is charging excess fees, the examinees must lodge a complaint with the NU Examination Section,” he said. Social worker Shashank Gattewar, who’s active on social media, said he received a plethora of complaints from students of many colleges under NU. Even those from autonomous colleges were going through the same ordeal, he said. “NU authorities immediately need to probe the complaints as private colleges are exploiting students in the name of pandemic. In the situation, where many have lost jobs or their salaries are reduced or their business isn’t doing well due to lockdown and curfew, it’s very unfair on the part of colleges to charge extra from students, who’re already worried,” he told TOI. NU officials told TOI that private colleges were already saving a huge chunk, as they were conducting classes online since last one year and their infrastructure wasn’t being used. Moreover, none of them had reduced the fees they charged for professional courses. “In the time of such unprecedented crisis, the college management should help them out,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nu-students-claim-many-colleges-charging-excess-exam-fees/articleshow/82643731.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

While the operation of the facility started with 20 beds, the next 80 beds will be operational in a fortnight, said I C Agarwal, patron of FORTI. “People are suffering due to the shortage of oxygen beds. This facility will reduce the load on the hospitals. We have arranged oxygen concentrators for all beds and some cylinders also.” Agarwal said that treatment and medicines will be provided free of cost. Medicines and injections like remdesivir will be available for patients. Local MLA and FORTI member Rafiq Khan has also been instrumental in putting up this facility. “The industry is equally concerned about the suffering of the people. We have arranged doctors, nurses, and other support staff to look after the operation of the Covid care Centre,” added Khan. The facility is located at Janata Colony.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/industry-bodies-set-up-100-bed-covid-care-centre/articleshow/82643729.cms||---

The copy of the complaint has gone viral on social media . The cop alleged that he was transferred to the traffic wing for the first time and was “surprised to see the level of corruption”. The complainant alleged since the DSP (admin) took charge, corruption in the wing has increased. “Cops who can pay the money are getting deployed in offices and those who cannot on field jobs,” the complaint alleged. The complainant alleged despite the traffic wing facing a shortage of staff, the husband of the DSP was provided a driver and a personal security officer apart from two PSOs, two drivers, two cooks and two homeguards already deployed at her residence. “A munshi of the traffic lines has been collecting money from cops and giving them favourable deployment. Two other cops and the personal assistant of the DSP are also involved,” the complainant alleged. The complainant requested senior officials to check the deployment and duty roster of the traffic wing, saying they would find some of the cops have not been deployed on the overspeeding nakas for the last two months. “Some cops are working only 10 days in a month after allegedly paying bribes,” the complainant alleged. The complainant pointed out that when the DSP was the SHO at the Maloya police station, the CBI had booked her driver and two other cops in a bribery case. It is not the first time that a cop has alleged corruption in an anonymous complaint to senior officials. In September 2017, an anonymous complaint raised the matter of “cash-for-leave” in the Indian Reserve Battalion (IRB). In his complaint, an IRB constable had alleged that some of their colleagues had been paying 7,000 to 15,000 to senior officials for marking themselves present when they were actually on leave. The complainant had also named the constables, who paid the money and got full salary when they were on leave. NO formal complaint: SSP Manisha Choudhary, SSP (traffic), UT, said, “I have not received any such complaint through any formal channel so far. As and when it is received, we will get it inquired into.” A senior police official said it would be better if the complainant came forward. “Sometimes, it is difficult to conduct an inquiry on anonymous complaints because some of them had been earlier made only to settle personal scores.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/dsp-heading-cash-for-duties-scam-in-traffic-wing-alleges-anonymous-cop/articleshow/82640217.cms||Pawan Tiwari
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Healthcare & frontline workers due for 2nd dose to get priority||MUMBAI: In the wake of the Centre’s decision to extend dosage interval of Covishield, the state’s immunisation in-charge Dr Dilip Patil said a meeting has been called with all district officials on Saturday to gauge their stock positions. “We are willing to give the first dose to 45+, but before that we will have to prioritise healthcare and frontline workers who qualify for the second dose. Only 60%-65% from these two categories have taken the second dose,” he said. He added the state had 5-6-lakh doses of Covishield to sustain vaccination for 3 days. Numbers show 11.3 lakh healthcare workers have taken the first dose, while a little over 6.89 lakh have taken the second in the state. Similarly, 15.51 lakh frontline workers have taken the first dose and 6.8 lakh have taken both. The drive for healthcare workers had started on January 16 while that for frontline workers had started on February 3. He said a decision will be taken after Saturday’s meeting. For Covaxin though, priority will be given to those waiting for a second dose as their interval remains unchanged at 28 days-42 days. The state has received 1.13 lakh doses of Covaxin on Friday, which will be mainly used for second doses. Immunisation officials had to return to their drawing boards. Mumbai, for instance, had called off the vaccination drive on Saturday and Sunday to conserve doses for three days of walk-ins from Monday. Officials said the walk-in plan is likely to remain unchanged for Covaxin seekers on Monday. AMC Suresh Kakani said they would also rejig their plans for next week. “Because of the new rule, we suddenly have few people eligible for a second shot from more than a lakh. The walk-in planned for Covaxin and those who qualify for Covishield (if they have completed 84 days) will most likely go on, but we will take some decisions on Saturday,” he said. Executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare said the city has 50,000 to 60,000 doses. “We may consider giving the first doses depending on what the state decides,” she said. She added around 10,000 to 15,000 frontliners are waiting for their second dose. On Friday, 23,924 people got vaccinated in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-healthcare-frontline-workers-due-for-2nd-dose-to-get-priority/articleshow/82643834.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The holy month of Ramzaan ended sans embraces, handshakes and daawats, as the city witnessed muted Eid-ul-Fitr celebrations. With the second wave of Covid-19 ravaging people’s lives and livelihoods, good samaritans extended help by offering them Fitrah. After Ramazan, it is an obligatory charity that is offered after the sighting of Eid-ul-Fitr moon. “I donated ration kits consisting essential items such as rice, oil, sugar, lentils, spices, and the like to 10 families. In many of these families, the breadwinner either lost job or suffered a pay cut. Due to the pandemic, I decided that I would celebrate Eid by helping out others,” said Mohammed Arif, second year student of Sultan-Ul-Uloom College of Law. Prayers were offered in mosques as well as Eidgahs among limited people, as they had been shut as part of the 10-day lockdown imposed by the Telangana government. Mecca Masjid in Old City, where thousands would assemble to pray on the festive day usually, too wore a deserted look. Families savoured Eid delights such as biryani, khichdi and kheema, sheerkhurma within the confines of their homes and skipped visiting their relatives due to the lockdown. “This time, the second wave impacted so many of our friends and family members that we didn’t want to celebrate it in a big way. We had an extremely low-key Eid where we didn’t even purchase any new clothes. We offered Namaz at home and prayed that this pandemic comes to an end soon,” said Shaik Salauddin, founder and state president, Telangana Gig and Platform Workers Union.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/corona-scare-and-curbs-low-key-eid-in-hyderabad/articleshow/82643758.cms||---

Reacting strongly to chief minister Chouhan’s claim, Kamal Nath said, “In this epidemic, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan left people in the hands of God and got busy with Damoh elections and the remaining time was busy campaigning in the assembly polls in other states,” Kamal Nath said in a statement on Friday. “People kept looking for the whereabouts of the health minister. Will the chief minister send this model of Covid control to Prime Minister Modi? And will the Prime Minister send this model to other states to break the Corona chain?” the senior Congress leader asked. Kamal Nath alleged that since the beginning of the second wave till date, treatment is not available in hospitals, there are no beds available, no oxygen available, no life-saving drugs and injections available. “Because of this shortage, thousands of patients have lost their lives and are still dying. Madhya Pradesh has reached the top in the list of states where patients have died for lack of oxygen,” LOP and state Congress president Kamal Nath said. He argued that BJP has ruled the state for 16 years and did not set-up a single oxygen plant during this time. “Today, we are dependent on other states for oxygen.

The two leaders are learnt to have discussed the reasons behind the party’s rout in the by-election and role of local leaders who have been facing action.  The BJP on May 7 suspended youth leader and Jayant Malaiya’s son Siddharth and four mandal heads for anti-party activities and also issued a show-cause notice to former minister Jayant Malaiya for allegedly hatching conspiracy against the party’s official nominee Rahul Singh Lodhi. Lodhi had openly blamed Malaiya and his son for conspiring against him during the by-polls, which helped Congress candidate Ajay Tandon register a record 17,000 vote margin victory against the ruling party.  After the notice, Malaiya called on BJP president Sharma and clarified his stand. The leaders discussed the matter in a closed-door meeting for almost half an hour. Malaiya defended his son Siddharth on his role during the election and claimed that he along with other party workers had left no stone unturned to support the BJP candidate Rahul Singh Lodhi. It was Lodhi’s personal image which resulted in the party's defeat, sources said.  “The meeting was cordial and we shared a cup of tea over the discussion.

---||Chandigarh||Hry Covid drug directions only on paper, patients hit||Chandigarh: Doctors in Haryana’s Covid-19 hospitals are continuing to give prescriptions to attendants to arrange the anti-viral drugs remdesivir and tocilizumab on their own, say attendants and chemists in the state. The practice — a violation of recent state government guidelines on prescribing the drugs — is giving a window to black marketeers to make money. Haryana had categorically issued guidelines about providing remedisiver and tocilizumab injections directly to beneficiaries on ICU/ventilators on the recommendation of a three-member district committee. Police tighetening the noose around black marketeers has made things worse for attendants who have to arrange the injections for a higher price now. In all, 67 persons have been arrested with injections. “We have been requesting hospital authorities and urging them to follow guidelines. They claim their stocks are nil. In such circumstances why will black marketeers not come into the action? We were forced to arrange this from Punjab, and that too at a high cost,” said a resident of Arunai village of Pehowa subdivision in Kurukshetra who had been asked to get remdesivir injections. Drug stores near civil hospitals in Karnal, Panchkula, and few other distiricts confirmed to have got prescription slips from hospitals. Haryana claims it has an adequte stock of medicines and injectables for patients in home isolation and in hospitals. The guidelines for direct supply of the drugs has created an artificial shortage of sorts, say chemists. “Ever since the government issued the directions, we stopped receiving supplies at our shop. Now companies directly supply these to hospitals or to the central store. We don’t understand why doctors are prescribing this. Why doesn’t the government put boards outside each Covid ward about the latest guidelines,’’ said a chemist in Sector 6 of Panchkula, close to the town’s only civil hospital. An official in CMO reiterated the guidelines. He added the guidelines were issued when there was an acute shortage of the two drugs, accompanied by panic-buying. “Now, we are providing this injection from hospitals after scruitiny; hence, nobody should give this prescription. We shall look into it and an adequte action will follow,’’ he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hry-covid-drug-directions-only-on-paper-patients-hit/articleshow/82643745.cms||Manvir Saini

As part of the mechanical inspection, structural, electrical and fire audits of hospitals were done and the reports of 2,513 facilities were uploaded. District collectors have been asked to ensure time-bound compliance of the lacunae found. Officials said that most audits had found leakage in oxygen valves or ducts leading to wastage. It also poses a fire hazard, they added.  “There are guidelines issued by the Centre regarding the amount of oxygen that is to be given to different types of patients. We are a monitoring agency and flag obvious wastage, but we leave the judgement to the treating doctor,” said another senior official, who was part of the oxygen audit team. He added that after the audits, oxygen utilisation at many government medical colleges reduced by 10-15%. “Patients who are recovering have to be weaned off oxygen slowly, but in many places it was not happening. The situation is changing now,” said the senior official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-after-audits-10-15-drop-in-o2-consumption-at-govt-hosps/articleshow/82645063.cms||---

A basic patient transport ambulance can charge Rs 1,500 for the first 10km and Rs 25 for every additional kilometre.  For a basic life support ambulance with oxygen, the cost should not exceed Rs 2,000 for the first 10km and Rs 50 for every additional kilometre. Advanced life support ambulances with ventilators, defibrillators and multiple monitors can charge Rs 4,000 for the first 10km and Rs 100 for every additional kilometre. If users complain of additional charges, the government will initiate action, including cancellation of driving licence and immediate confiscation of the vehicle, said the order issued by health secretary J Radhakrishnan on Friday. On Wednesday, Tamil Nadu Health Systems Project director Dr S Uma had told the state health department that patients are transited from testing labs, screening centres and to hospitals on GVK EMRI 108 ambulance services. The state has a fleet of 1,303 ambulances of which at least 400 have been dedicated for Covid-19 patients. The 108 call centre says it gets at least 35,000 calls a day and transfers at least 6,000 patients – about half of them have Covid. The service is free. Although the ambulance service transports only patients with breathing difficulty (SPo2 below 90), there is delay in pick-ups as ambulances are busy throughout the day. To ensure more ambulances are available as cases rise, private operators were allowed to ply.

Tiwari’s visit was part of Delhi BJP’s campaign ‘seva hi sangthan’ under which party members are helping Covid patients and their family. “Under the campaign, each party worker, including MPs, MLAs and councillors, is leaving no stone unturned to provide necessary items, such as medicines and other equipment, to the needy,” the former BJP president said. Hitting out at chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, Tiwari said the AAP government was busy in taking credits. “Even the free ration scheme started by the Centre is not being spared by it. It would be better if Kejriwal rose above petty politics to ensure needy get all the relief provided by the Centre,” he claimed. He added that Delhi government had ordered dismantling of four Covid care centres arranged by him in northeast Delhi, which together created over 800 beds. Taking to Twitter on the issue, BJP functionary Amit Malviya said, “Manoj Tiwari had arranged for 808 Covid beds across his constituency, linked to a dedicated hospital. But they were dismantled on the orders of Delhi government out of vendetta. Kejriwal must explain why.” No response was available from the district administration or the AAP government on Tiwari’s claims. Delhi BJP in-charge Baijayant Jay Panda met Delhi party chief Adesh Gupta and other functionaries to take stock of the Covid situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/four-covid-care-centres-dismantled-alleges-tiwari/articleshow/82667049.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

According to a forest officer, 55-year-old Poonkodi, who was working with the Tamil Nadu Tea Plantation Corporation (Tantea), was trampled to death by a wild tusker around 9pm on Wednesday when she was on her way to the toilet close to her quarters at Pandalur tea estate. “Her body was sent to the nearby government hospital, where postmortem was performed on Thursday.” There were reports that an elephant herd had been roaming around Devala Hatty, Vazhavayal, Sethakolli and Samiyar Colony, among other places, in Pandalur range for the past one week. Taking stock of the incident, the forest minister directed the forest officer of Gudalur division to chase away the tusker and other elephants into the deep forest. “Officials need to track the movement of elephants in the area and in Pandalur and Gudalur taluks on a regular basis without fail.” Ramachandran also appealed the public to cooperate with the forest department to curb the incidence of man-animal conflicts, for which he promised the government would also take appropriate initiatives in due course.

---||Delhi||Lekhi, Cong in war of words over Kalra||New Delhi: BJP MP Meenakshi Lekhi on Saturday alleged that Delhi restaurateur Navneet Kalra, who is accused of hoarding and selling oxygen concentrators in black market, has a long history of association with Congress and strong ties with several party members, including Sonia and Rahul Gandhi. “If you see Kalra’s Facebook timeline, he has blamed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the Covid-19 pandemic. His restaurant's chef has pics with Rahul and Sonia Gandhi. They call them India's first family,” Lekhi said. The BJP MP claimed that when Congress member Ajay Makan was urban development minister, he had nominated Robert Vadra as Delhi Golf Club member in 2004-05 and Navneet Kalra as a club member the next year. She alleged that Kalra had hoarded oxygen concentrators worth over Rs 13 crore and sold them at highly inflated rates at a time when Congress members were targeting the Centre for oxygen shortage amid the second surge of the pandemic. “Congress’ hands are always with black marketers and hoarders. Navneet Kalra is directly in links with Congress. Over 7,500 oxygen concentrators, worth Rs 13 crore, were seized from Navneet Kalra and Matrix Cellular CEO Gaurav Khanna's gang,” Lekhi said and added, ”While Rahul Gandhi and his Congress friends create chaos about oxygen shortage, Kalra was hoarding the concentrators.” Congress Rajya Sabha MP Shakti Sinh Gohil rubbished Lekhi’s claims as “baseless allegations by a frustrated politician”. He said the two individuals who looted the country the most— Vijay Mallya and Nirav Modi— have photographs with Narendra Modi, so that should make the PM culpable for their crimes too, by her logic. “Lekhi forgot to notice that it was the BJP former corporator’s son in Surat, who was caught making duplicate Remdesivir, and BJP president in Gujarat was hoarding injections,” Gohil said. Lekhi alleged another Congress member, Abhishek Manu Singhvi, is the advocate for all black marketeers. Navneet Kalra has been on the run since Delhi Police seized 524 oxygen concentrators from three restaurants owned by him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lekhi-cong-in-war-of-words-over-kalra/articleshow/82667074.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Shuttered hospitality sector seeks relief on electricity rates||JAIPUR: Unlike manufacturing units which are still running with a reduced capacity of about 30%, the hospitality industry remains completely shuttered. With no business and income, the hospitality sector is urging the state government to defer the payment of fixed electricity charges and allow them to pay at industrial rates as per their status. “Before the outbreak hit India last year, and the lockdowns started from latter half of March, the hotels had normal business. So the industry had some money to see through them after the lockdowns were clamped down. But now, the situation is very difficult. The government should look at offering the industry some relief, at least in waving the fixed power charges,” said Surendra Singh Shahpura, executive member of Federation of Hospitality and Tourism of Rajasthan (FHTR). He said the industry has already started receiving average electricity bills at a time when they have no business income or any funds with them to pay. Last year, the state government had allowed the hotels and restaurants deferred payments for two months, but after that they received the bills to pay at one go instead of staggered way. Abhishek Mishra, director at a city hotel, said, “First of all, the electricity rates in Rajasthan are one of the highest in the country. Secondly, despite being declared as an industry, the hotels are made to pay at commercial rates. It’s high time for the government to offer industry benefits to the hospitality sector. And no time could be better than now as the industry is facing one of its existential moments.” Some states like Maharashtra have already started offering industry status to hospitality sector. After continuous demand from the industry, the state finance department has also given directions to the tourism department to prepare a proposal for it. “We urge the government to expedite the process and announce the decision. The industry needs relief right now. We have filed all taxes for last year and renewed our various licences for the new financial year and are left with no money,” added Shahpura. Mishra said there are many city hotels, unlike resorts on outskirts, that neither got the wedding business in the last quarter of 2020 nor tourists. “The situation is worse for such hotels. We don’t have money to deposit instalments. There is risk of the units being declared as NPAs,” added Mishra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/shuttered-hospitality-sector-seeks-relief-on-electricity-rates/articleshow/82643846.cms||---

For the past two weeks, water board officials have been testing the device. Three years ago, the water board came up with a proposal to use robotic devices to clean choked sewer lines and remove silt and solid wastage, but could not go ahead with its plans. The pandemic caused the the water board to realise the necessity of using the robotic device, and they have introduced it in Fathenagar section of SR Nagar area. “Fathenagar section consists of individual domestic consumers, apartment residential complexes and a small portion of slum area. We receive many sewerage-related complaints from this Fathenagar section,” HMWS&SB general manager (O&M division VI) Harishankar told TOI. “A sewer croc is a robotic cutting system developed to disintegrate and flush out blockages in a sewer line. This is designed to make use of a water jet from a jetting machine to spin the turbine at a very high speed and cut the roots and other blockages and sediments,” an official said. Six rows of teflon wheels are aligned with variable stiffness springs to suit the size of the sewer and the same will prevent damaging the sewer lines. The turbine is positioned at the centre with cutting blades which are centrally positioned at any time of the operation. The vehicle-mounted robot can travel in narrow lanes of the residential colonies. Soon, a sewerage complaint cell will also be opened at SR Nagar water board’s office to receive sewerage-related complaints from consumers of SR Nagar area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sewer-crocs-to-clear-choked-lines/articleshow/82643839.cms||Sunil Mungara

This new 60-bed Covid facility was formally dedicated to Nagpurians on Friday. Union minister Nitin Gadkari was the chief guest. Maharashtra minister for animal husbandry Sunil Kedar, mayor Dayashankar Tiwari and Dr Pinak Dande were present on the occasion. Social worker Anantrao Gharad presided over the function.“I have always stood by private doctors who work for the cause of social welfare. Dr Dande is one such doctor who keeps this commitment,” said Gadkari adding the task of converting the abandoned building into a modern hospital wasn’t an easy job.“When Dr Dande came to me with the proposal, I outrightly rejected assuming it wasn’t possible. But, he was confident. Today, I must appreciate his efforts,” said Gadkari.The Nagarik Sahakari Hospital used to be the first of its kind multi-speciality hospital in Nagpur. It was closed following conflicts and legal tussles. Recently, the Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court had ordered to use this building only for hospital purpose.Dr Dande narrated how the task was completed. “When patients were dying because of non-availability of beds, we, at Dande Foundation, decided to convert this building into a Covid facility. My labourers worked days and nights for three weeks to bring this into a reality. All 60 beds in the hospital have oxygen facility. There are 15 ICU beds. Ventilators and BiPAPs gifted by Nitin Gadkari are being used in this hospital,” said Dr Dande.Gharad and Kedar also praised Dande Foundation for this work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/once-abandoned-building-is-now-60-bed-covid-centre/articleshow/82643898.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

---||Delhi||Will antibody cocktail help: HC to Centre||New Delhi: One of the largest pharma companies has told the Delhi high court that a new “antibody cocktail” is on the anvil, which can replace Tocilizumab, a drug used in severe Covid 19 cases but in short supply. It claimed that the drug “significantly reduces the risk of hospitalisation or death by 70% and it can also significantly shorten the duration of symptoms by four days” so it is trying to supply 1,00,000 doses of the cocktail drug to India by the end of May. Following the statement by Roche, the high court asked the central government to find out if demand for Tocilizumab would be reduced if Roche provides its new drug that has been approved for emergency use in India for coronavirus patients. Justice Prathiba M Singh also asked the Centre what quantities of the antibody cocktail would be required for the purpose of reducing demand for Tocilizumab, after Roche candidly admitted in an affidavit that its focus is on bringing the “antibody cocktail Casirivimab and lmdevimab used in the treatment of Covid-19, especially for the treatment of mild to moderate Covid-19 in patients who are at high risk of severe Covid-19.” Roche further submitted that it can only try to supply Tocilizumab but cannot assure to meet the market demand for the same, even though patients are willing to pay for it even as the Centre told the high court it has placed sufficient orders, which reflect the demand of Tocilizumab 400 mg, with Roche India but the company has been unable to supply. It said the government was following up with Roche India to increase the quantum of imports to India. As Roche was unable to give any assurance regarding supply of Tocilizumab and since it was required by patients here, the court asked the Centre how it intended to obtain the medicine through the drug major or its global manufacturers, FHoffman-La Roche Ltd in Switzerland and Chugai Seiyaku Kabushki Kaisha in Japan. The court also asked the government when the results for the phase III trials of Tocilizumab, approved in favour of two Indian companies—Hetero Biopharma Ltd and JSS Medical Research India Pvt Ltd—were expected and what were the applicable guidelines. During the hearing on May 12, Roche told the court that a consignment of 45,000 Tocilizumab 80 mg vials, which would cater to around 9,000 patients, arrived in India last week in the form of humanitarian aid extended by it. Besides that, 1,00,000 vials of Tocilizumab 80 mg, to cater to 20,000 doses, had also been imported by Roche. The high court is hearing petitions by kin of two Covid-19 patients who were prescribed Tocilizumab by doctors but were unable to immediately arrange the medicine from anywhere. They later received the required medication and are stable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/will-antibody-cocktail-help-hc-to-centre/articleshow/82642096.cms||Abhinav Garg

CM: 800 docs, 800 nurses to be recruited to augment med infrastructure He then went on to seek forgiveness from youngsters, who were supposed to get married on the auspicious occasion of Akshay Tritiya but it had to be postponed aas marriages are not allowed in the month of May". "It was necessary because nothing is more important than the lives of people", he said. Referring to the untimely death of a lot of people due to the pandemic, he said that the state government would give a pension of Rs 5,000 to families, who have lost their breadwinner and he would take care of the children orphaned in the pandemic. He said that Madhya Pradesh has been able to reduce the Coronavirus positivity rate from 24% to 11%. But, we have to fight a long battle, go a long way before the task of eradicating the Coronavirus is completed. He expressed gratitude towards the Prime Minister, Narendra Modi for uninterrupted supply of Oxygen and other medical equipment. Chouhan urged the members of Crisis Management Groups in villages to accompany the survey teams going door-to-door under the "Kill Corona" campaign and motivate people to come forward if they have any symptoms of Covid-19. If "home isolation" is not possible, people should be sent to Covid Care Centres, he said. The Crisis Management Group at the block level would keep a watch that Coronavirus doesn't spread in any village under the block and the District Crisis Management Group would work to effectively implement "Corona Curfew", prepare a list of children orphaned by Coronavirus pandemic and ensure free treatment of Ayushman card holders in government hospitals and empaneled private hospitals. The chief minister said that in the next one month, 800 doctors, 800 nurses and the same number of technical staff would be recruited in hospitals in the state to augment medical facilities for the people and oxygen beds for Covid-19 patients are also being increased by 5,000. On school exams, he said the high school exam has already been cancelled and students will be evaluated on the basis of internal assessment and higher secondary exams will be conducted when the situation normalises.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/chouhan-rules-out-lifting-curfew-urges-people-to-change-behaviour/articleshow/82642106.cms||---

Former MP and editor Shahid Siddiqui said he was questioned by police about the Remdesivir injections given by Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and former MLA Mukesh Sharma for his ailing wife. With the hashtag “I stand with IYC”, Rahul Gandhi tweeted, “The one who protects is always bigger than the one who harms.” The police action and the reaction created a sideshow in the morbidly overwhelming atmosphere of pandemic and suffering. AICC spokesman Randeep Surjewala called it “raid dharma, not raj dharma”. Expressing solidarity, Congress MP Deepender Hooda, who is heading intensive relief work in Haryana through a network “TeamDeepender”, said, “This is the other face of cruelty. The police questioning of Srinivas who is selflessly helping people without caring for the divisions of party, ideology, religion and caste, is sheer misuse of the government machinery out of political malice. We are proud of you Srinivas, we are all with you.” According to sources, police told the IYC that their action was a follow-up to a PIL in the high court which has alleged illegal distribution of relief material by political persons. Sources involved in IYC relief said the police action would scare many people into curbing their involvement in relief activities. Srinivas said, “We will continue our work irrespective of what they do.” Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, responding to Siddiqui’s disclosure about police questioning, tweeted, “If helping someone in need is now a crime, I will commit it again and again. To my mind, it’s a far greater crime to silently watch and do nothing while people die desperately searching for medicine and gasping for air.” Neeraj Kundan, president of Congress’s student wing NSUI, said, “Helping people in the time when the whole system collapsed. Right from medical facilities to food requirements, IYC-led by Srinivas helped as much as possible and is still continuing.” Congress spokesman Shaktisinh Gohil criticised the low vaccination rate in the country and lashed out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi for not doing enough. “The vaccine will help us vanquish the pandemic, not the PM’s speeches. The PM should focus on saving lives, not on his image-building.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-relief-cong-slams-cops-for-questioning-youth-chief/articleshow/82642112.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

While maintaining that it was not a custodial death, he said the actual cause of death will be ascertained by the viscera report. “The doctors, after post-mortem, concluded that 80-90% of his lungs were damaged. He had vomited blood before dying in the police station. He was an alcoholic and used to drink country-made liquor,” said the superintendent of police. Meanwhile, administrative (by Newai SDM) and police investigations have been initiated to find out if there were lapses on part of the police. Moreover, cases of murder and kidnapping have been registered against four persons who brought Pappu Meena to the police station and later fled. Locals assembled at the police station on Wednesday night and vandalised police vehicles after Meena died. “The ASI (Suraj Mal Gurjar), who belongs to Gurjar community, has been suspended following allegation of custodial death by the party. He will remain suspended till investigations are complete. Complete videography of the post-mortem has been conducted and no injuries were found on the body,” said Prakash. “Four persons kidnapped Pappu Meena and brought him to the police station where he died. This is not a case of custodial death. We have registered an FIR of murder and kidnap against the liquor contractors. These include Bharat Singh Rajawat, Madan, Kalu and Radhe Shyam Meena. On Wednesday, the ASI refused to register a case when they brought him to the station and later false charges were levelled against him saying it was a case of custodial death. They are still at large, and the search is on,” said Om Prakash.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/no-injuries-on-body-80-90-of-lungs-damaged-say-police/articleshow/82643924.cms||---
---||Bhopal||MP: Murder case against fake Remedesivir sellers likely||BHOPAL: Ninety per cent of the Covid-19 patients who were administered fake Remdesivir injections supplied by a Gujarat-based gang have survived their lung infections, investigation by Madhya Pradesh police reveals. While chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan wants murder cases to be registered against the racketeers arrested in Indore and Jabalpur, holding them accountable for each death, senior police officials are trying to find ways to link mortalities with the duplicate injections without the dead bodies. None of these victims was buried, they say. During investigation, police officers were surprised to compare the survival rates of patients who had taken the fake injections with those who had got the real ones. “We are not medical experts, but doctors should really look into this,” said an officer. The fake injections contained a simple glucose-salt compound, said police. Coronavirus: Live updates“Ten patients in Indore, who were injected fake Remdesivir brought from a Gujarat-based gang, died while more than 100 survived the Covid-19 infection despite being given glucose-salt water. Since their bodies have been cremated, investigating the side effects of the fake drugs is impossible,” said an officer on condition of anonymity. The Centre has told states that Remdesivir may decrease hospitalization time when used in moderate to severe cases, but there is no proven benefit in terms of reduced mortality. The surge in Covid infections, however, has triggered an all-out clamour for Remdesivir. Even quacks and non-medicos in parts of Madhya Pradesh began ‘prescribing’ it, triggering a mad rush for the injection, and shortage. The scramble for Remdesivir was such that the Gwalior collector had to issue an order asking dentists and non-medicos not to prescribe the injection. The Gujarat-based gang cashed in on this, say police. The racket was busted in Gujarat on May 1. During interrogation by the Gujarat crime branch, the accused revealed that they had sold around 1,200 fake injections in MP — 700 in Indore and 500 in Jabalpur. The gang had sourced empty vials from Mumbai, filled them with a glucosesalt compound at a factory in Gujarat’s Vapi region, and simply pasted fake labels. Indore IG Hari Narayan Chari Mishra said strict action is being taken against all those arrested in the case. “They will not be spared. Our investigation will continue till the last person in the racket is arrested,” Mishra said. Jabalpur police have not been able to make any significant headway in the case. They have not been able to trace the patients to whom the fake injections were given since the hospital did not maintain records. A case has been registered at Jabalpur’s Omti police station against three suspects — Jarabjeet Singh, Sapan Jain and Devesh — for attempted culpable homicide, adulteration of drugs, sale of adulterated drugs and cheating.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/mp-murder-case-against-fake-remedesivir-sellers-likely/articleshow/82642139.cms||P Naveen
---||Thane||‘Celeb’ power! Appeal on social media ends up feeding 1,200 a day in Thane||KALYAN: A whiff of fame can help serve humanity. Social media celebrity Sagar Utwal has shown how. In the current lockdown-like curbs, he has been feeding over a thousand underprivileged people around Kalyan twice a day, these days. Utwal has 2.75 lakh followers on Instagram. His videos have around 2.6 crore views. Generally, most of his posts pertain to helping the needy around Ulhasnagar where the 29-year-old lives. The food distribution down the squalid lanes of Ulhasnagar and Ambernath started last month when he stumbled upon a few labourers who had stayed put in the city despite the lockdown-like curbs. “Many of the daily-wagers had no work, and so no food,” says Utwal. Initially, he dug into his pocket to feed a few morsels to labourers he came across, but soon realised that there were far too many hungry folks out there. The town of Ulhasnagar itself has small-scale industries that churn out biscuits, chocolates, furniture. All these had been shut and workers had nowhere to go. That’s when he decided to cash in on his popularity on social media. Utwal was quick to reel out a video which was posted on his Instagram account. He urged his followers to help in in whatever way they could to feed the needy workers. “The appeal to my followers drew in a flood of response,” says Utwal. Parcels of rice, pulses and other dry food items started to pour in. Several others chipped in with cash. And the contributions poured in from beyond Mumbai. “A follower from Varanasi, Dinesh Mishra, sent in Rs 25,000 while Tushar Gupta from Moradabad donated Rs 21,000,” he says recalling just two of the donations. Now, it was time for Utwal and his team of volunteers to step out and feed the hungry. “My friends now buy vegetables and other food items which are prepared by noon,” he says. A three-wheeler is used to scour around the slum pockets of Shanti Nagar, Forwar Line, Vithalwadi, Boat Club in Ulhasnagar and pockets of Ambernath where labourers live. “We feed around 1,200 people twice a day.” Since Friday, the team has also started sending food to people in home quarantine. Videos of food served to people are put up for viewers to see how their money is being spent. Chavvi Sonar, a tempo driver from Sapna Garden locality in Ulhasnagar, is one of the beneficiaries. “I am out of work currently. I’ve been eating meals served to me,” says Sonar, adding that a dozen other families of tempo drivers survive on food that Utwal’s volunteers bring. While Utwalgivescredit to his followers, he admits that this desire to reach out is fuelled by his past. “I grew up in a poor family. I know too well what it is to live in poverty.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/celeb-power-appeal-on-social-media-ends-up-feeding-1200-a-day-in-mumbai/articleshow/82645173.cms||Pradeep Gupta

Speaking on the occasion, DM Bhadauria said, “The hospital will become operational on May 17 and strengthen our fight against the pandemic. Our objective is to ensure better healthcare facilities in the district so that locals are not forced to go to other cities for medical emergencies.” The DM added that 10 among the 40 beds in the facility will have oxygen support as well. “All the necessary medicines and PPE kits have been made available in the hospital. A few additional beds will also be kept in the hospital to treat Covid-19 patients with mild symptoms,” the DM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/40-bed-covid-hosp-inaugurated-in-almora/articleshow/82640389.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Relief for Covid patients from other states as high court stays Telangana circular on ambulances||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Friday stayed a circular issued by the state government restraining entry of ambulances carrying Covid-19 patients from neighboring states into its territory. Terming the circular (issued on May 11) as ‘discriminatory’, one that violates the right to life as guaranteed by the Constitution and one which runs contrary to the provisions of the Epidemics Act and Disaster Management Act, a bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy issued notices to Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Central governments asking them to file counters. Stating that a uniform hospital admission policy is the need of the hour, the judges posted the case to June 17. The judges took up an urgent petition filed by retired IRS officer Garimella Venkata Krishna Rao questioning the action of Telangana police for stopping the ambulances at the borders. Though the bench earlier directed the government not to stop the ambulances, Telangana issued a fresh circular, halting the ambulances at the borders. “The basis for admission into hospitals should be the need and not the residence of the patient,” the judges said. The essence of Telangana’s circular is that people of the neighbouring states have to first obtain a permission from Telangana hospitals and police before driving Covid-19 patients into Hyderabad. The bench stayed this circular and asked the government not to adopt any other circuitous way to achieve the purpose of this circular. “You cannot override the Constitution and violate the National Highways Act,” the bench said. Appearing for the petitioner, senior counsel Dammalapati Srinivas said the action of Telangana was contrary to the recent Supreme Court judgment and the Centre’s circular. “According to them, denying entry into a hospital based on a person’s residence is unlawful,” he said. While the state was free to frame its rules and guidelines, the same should be in tune with the national policy and cannot be diametrically opposite to it, he argued. AP advocate general S Sriram also opposed the stand of Telangana and said the action of officials at AP-Telangana borders blocking ambulances was bad. “Classification of people on the basis of their residence goes against Articles 21 and 14 of the Constitution,” he said and wanted the passage to be free from all barriers. However, Telangana argued that it has powers to protect its people during a pandemic. Its advocate general BS Prasad defended the state’s policy and said the Epidemics Act and the Disaster Management Act provide enough powers to the local authorities to devise ways to contain the spread of the virus. “The lockdown decisions being taken by the Centre and the states too were taken with this objective in view and not to offend the rights of any section of people. States like Maharashtra and Karnataka too have been implementing several restrictions,” he said. He further said, “Our aim behind the circular is to ensure that only those with a valid permission to enter a hospital should venture into the state.” Those who come here and fail to get admission in hospitals here were roaming in Hyderabad in their ambulances which would lead to spread of infection, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/relief-for-covid-patients-from-other-states-as-hc-stays-t-circular-on-ambulances/articleshow/82644005.cms||---

The drive, which is being rigorously implemented during the pandemic, is proving helpful for the cash-strapped civic body. Armed with unique civic task force made up of ex-servicemen, the AMC is filling is its coffers that are empty due to poor recovery towards water and property taxes. The civic body, which had presented a budget of Rs 1,275.2 crore for the current fiscal, could collect only Rs 115 crore towards the property tax last year with dues worth Rs 150 crore still pending. The recovery of water tax is worse due to lack of database. “The civic task force has been asked to keep a check on violations like not wearing of face-mask, spitting in public places, use of banned plastic and open dumping or burning of garbage. The penalty is levied immediately on the spot for committing such offences,” a civic official said. As per official data, the AMC has managed to collect over Rs 1 lakh in a day on two occasions — on May 11 (Rs 1,02,350) and May 12 (Rs 1,17,700). Civic activist Rajendra Datey-Patil said the drive is not only inculcating discipline among public but also making the city clean and safe. “Also, the civic administration should declare the figure collected by the task force on a regular basis and reveal details for what purpose this money was used,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/fines-help-amc-compensate-for-poor-tax-recovery/articleshow/82637945.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Govt aid for kids orphaned by Covid-19||NEW DELHI: The Delhi government will bear the cost and responsibility of raising and educating children who have lost their parents due to Covid-19. It will also extend financial help to families and senior citizens who have lost their earning members due to Covid, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced on Friday. A plan is being worked out for the purpose. “The last few days have gone in despair. Despite several efforts, we could not save our people of Delhi. Some families had to face the deaths of more than one person. I pray to God to provide peace to all these souls. I know of many such kids who have lost both their parents. They have no one left. I want to tell such kids that I can understand their grief but not to worry, you are not orphans, I am there for you. No child will have to leave their education in between. Education will be provided to every child. The government will take the responsibility for their maintenance,” the CM stated in a digital address. Nearly 21,000 people have died due to Covid in Delhi so far. Many of those dead were young people with little children and their deaths have left them orphaned. Several families have also lost earning members to Covid and are now helpless. The CM announced relief for such people too. “Many elderly citizens have lost their earning children. I want to tell all such old people that you have lost your kids and I feel extremely sorry for that. But not to worry, this son of yours is alive. All those families that have lost an earning member will be helped by the government,” Kejriwal stated. The CM announced that the AAP government will provide financial assistance to affected families. “But such children and old people also need love at this point in time. They need empathy. It is my request to all the neighbours and relatives of such families to take care of them. These families are facing great challenges. Give them love. The 2-crore people of Delhi, we are a family. In these times of despair, we need to help each other,” Kejriwal said. Meanwhile, the Covid situation is improving in Delhi with both the number of cases and positivity rate on the decline. Kejriwal, however, appealed to people to continue taking Covid precautions seriously. “If we do not take precautions, then the cases will increase again. There is no guarantee that they will remain low. Delhi may face problems again. Therefore, by no means, we can let our guard down. The lockdown has to be adhered to strictly and we should employ all the ways to ensure protection from the coronavirus,” he stated. “The government is also not leaving any scope in its arrangements. We are creating more oxygen beds, buying thousands of oxygen cylinders and installing new ICU beds, so that in case the cases increase, we are fully prepared to deal with the situation,” Kejriwal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-aid-for-kids-orphaned-by-covid-19/articleshow/82642168.cms||AlokKNMishra

Timely action by the fire personnel deployed at the Covid ICU prevented a fire due to sparks in the electrical circuit. According to a fire official, the incident took place at about 1 pm in the Covid ICU on the 4th floor of the hospital. “The staff in the ICU reported that there was a spark in one of the ventilators. The fire official deployed there reached the spot and cut off the power supply of the ventilator preventing further damage. The patient was immediately shifted to another ventilator,” K K Bisnoi, chief fire officer at Jamnagar told TOI. “The ventilator in which the spark occurred was brought out of ward and sent for investigation,” he added. As a safety measure, a fire official is deployed round-the-clock at Covid ICUs in all government hospitals. The decision to deploy fire officials 24X7 was taken in wake of several incidents of fire in Covid-19 ICU wards reported from different parts of the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/tragedy-averted-at-covid-icu-of-jamnagar-hospital/articleshow/82639985.cms||---

But as a cliched saying goes -necessity is the mother of invention, Bhopalis did manage to enjoy simple joys of life with their family members on Eid-ul-Fitr on Friday. Sameya Farhan, pursuing BA, History, from Institute Of Excellence (IEHE ), Bhopal, who stays near Kamla Park, spent the day with her joint family members; she confessed that it felt great to enjoy bonding time with her most special gang. “Every year, we would go out, meet people and then there were many guests coming at home for an open house. But this year due to strict lockdown, I got to spend some wonderful time with my five cousins, who matter the most. Everything was home made, right from chicken tikka biryani to chole tikiya, sheer khurma, paapdi chaat and karele. We got up early to offer namaz and went straight to our elders for Eidi and gifts.” Online deliveries of clothes and other things were either delayed or cancelled this time, but people still found ways and means to dress up in some beautiful, new clothes. Rakhshan Zahid, an entrepreneur, shared, “Tough part was to plan my mom and daughters’ dresses even though we were at home and there were no visitors due to lockdown. So, I used the fabrics lying at home and recycled some of the old products to create new dresses for all of us. I realised minimum resources can go a long way and help you celebrate a special day. ”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/home-grown-fun-food-were-the-hallmark-of-eid/articleshow/82642161.cms||Vinita Chaturvedi
---||Aurangabad||Outcry over admission against unreserved beds||Aurangabad: Although 80% beds in private hospitals are reserved for Covid-19, several patients are complaining of hospitalization against non-reserved beds which they claim has a huge impact on billing as they are forced to shell out more money. TOI spoke to several patients who said that they were kept in the dark about whether their accommodation was from reserved or unreserved quota and they also failed to get things clear at their end at the time of admission considering urgency of situation. A private professional said that he paid Rs 7 lakh bill for his uncle’s Covid treatment at a private hospital. “When I asked about hefty bills, hospital authorities said that my uncle was admitted against unreserved beds and there is no official capping on treatment costs on such beds. When I asked why my uncle was not allotted reserved beds for Covid-19 and clandestinely admitted against unreserved beds, hospital authorities gave an evasive reply,” said the 35-year-old city resident. Vijay Kannadkar, another resident of Shivaji Nagar, said that there is no clarity either on the part of private hospitals or civic administration on whether a patient is claiming reserved or unreserved bed. “My wife and mother both were Covid positive and I paid Rs 38,000 and Rs 57,000 respectively towards their treatment at a private hospital. I was not aware about reserved/unreserved category of beds until both got discharged,” he said. The municipal limits of Aurangabad alone have 68 Dedicated Covid Health Centres (DCHCs), 13 Dedicated Covid Hospitals (DCHs) and 12 Covid Care Centres (CCCs) currently operational, including state-run and private hospitals. When contacted, the district administration authorities said patients or their relatives should contact auditors appointed to look into billing of private hospitals. “The patients can also lodge their billing-related grievances for unreserved beds at private hospitals. These auditors or help-desk set up at hospitals are expected to guide patients on reserved or unreserved beds,” authorities concerned said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/outcry-over-admission-against-unreserved-beds/articleshow/82637940.cms||---
---||India||Public procurement rules eased to fight Covid surge||NEW DELHI: Faced with a shortage of material to combat the second wave of the pandemic, the government on Friday suspended the mandatory local content requirement norms for public procurement of Covid-19 supplies. the government said that the exemption will be in place until September but did not spell out the details, which will be worked out in the coming days. Although the government had issued the public procurement (preference to Make in India) order on June 15, 2017 to promote domestic production of goods and services and enhance employment, the provisions were made more stringent last year. Since last year, Atmanirbharta or self-reliance has been a buzzword for the Narendra Modi government, especially in the wake of Chinese intrusion in Ladakh. For instance, government procurement of goods from China and involvement of companies from across the border, with significant beneficial ownership of Chinese individuals, was proposed to be stopped. But the pandemic, especially the second wave, seems to have prompted a rethink when the country ran short of oxygen and stocks of medicines were low, especially with raw material being made in China. Even things like oxygen concentrators come from China. Some of the ministries have already relaxed the procurement rules after it emerged that India did not have adequate supplies to deal with the emergency. Although the government had stoutly defended its focus on self-reliance, several economists had questioned the basis for the decision.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/public-procurement-rules-eased-to-fight-covid-surge/articleshow/82648345.cms||---

Environmentalists suspected that some local residents entered the lake premise for fishing with metal-hooks and killed the snakes. A spot visit to the site on Friday revealed a large number of empty liquor bottles and plastic among other waste lying on the north-west periphery of the lake, underlining rampant human presence in the area. The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court had in 2013 banned human activities at Salim Ali Lake. A couple of years ago, the judiciary had expressed a strong objection to illegal fishing at the water body. Honorary wildlife warden for Aurangabad Kishor Pathak accused the civic body of showing utter neglect towards protecting the biodiversity hotspot. “It is highly painful to see snakes, which are important part of the ecology, are being killed and shamelessly hanged in the area. We cannot rule out more killings of such snakes, considering the rampant fishing and other nuisances by a section of the locals,” he said. Pathak said the huge lake was being manned by only one security guard deployed by Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC). “Vigilance has to be stepped up to protect the lake. If the AMC fails to do it, many people will be encouraged to cause more nuisance,” he said. Built during the rule of Malik Ambar around 400 year ago, the Salim Ali Lake features on the list of local heritage sites and also known as a rich biodiversity hotspot. It houses a variety of creatures, including different types of birds. As per studies in the past, the lake was home to over 80 varieties of birds, 16 tree species, 11 shrub types, 8 climbers, 32 terrestrial herbaceous plants, 10 varieties of algae, 12 of aquatic herbs, 16 aquatic insects, molluscs and crustaceans, nine varieties of fish, 15 species of reptiles, seven types of rodents and mammals and 102 types of insects. “Many residents from nearby areas visit the lake in an unauthorised way and resort to illegal activities,” a senior citizen said requesting anonymity. AMC administrator Astik Kumar and garden superintendent Vijay Patil did not respond to phone calls made to them seeking their comment on the issue. Text messages sent to them remained unanswered till the time of going to the press.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/snakes-killed-strung-out-on-trees-at-salim-ali-lake/articleshow/82637957.cms||Prasad Joshi

---||Trichy||All 4 Trichy crematoriums cater to Covid||Trichy: All four gasifier crematoriums in Trichy city have started cremating bodies of Covid-19 patients from Friday in the wake of the rise in number of such bodies. Till Thursday, it was only the crematorium at Oyamari, on the banks of Cauvery, that was exclusively being used to cremate bodies of Covid patients. Out of the four, one each in Srirangam, Oyamari and Konakarai are located away from residential areas. To ease the mounting pressure on the Oyamari facility, bodies were being diverted to the crematorium at Ambedkar Nagar in Srirangam from Friday where only non-Covid-19 patients were cremated so far. While a maximum of 14 bodies can be cremated in the Oyamari crematorium on an average, the number rose to 20 in the last one week. “This has put pressure on the infrastructure despite diverting up to bodies to Konakarai crematorium. Therefore, a decision was taken to cremate bodies of patients affected with Covid-19 in the crematorium located at Ambedkar Nagar on the north of Cauvery river,” said a senior official from the Trichy Corporation. Hospitals in Trichy city are accommodating patients from 10 neighbouring districts and bodies of patients from these districts have been adding to the pressure on the crematoriums in the city. Trichy corporation had avoided cremating bodies of Covid-19 patients in Karumandam crematorium to avoid unnecessary apprehensions from the locals. However, a few bodies had to be sent there also for cremation due to the increasing deaths. The number of non-Covid deaths has come down significantly in the city as there are no accidents because of the lockdown. Therefore, corporation officials feel, there would not be any issues in cremating non-Covid-19 bodies. The crematoriums run by the corporation are equipped to handle 50-60 bodies daily, said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/all-4-trichy-crematoriums-cater-to-covid/articleshow/82642253.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The letter, initiated by Apoorvanand of the department of Hindi, Satish Deshpande of sociology and Abha Dev Habib of Miranda House, has sought the VC’s intervention. “The second wave of the pandemic is causing deaths and distress on a scale we could not have imagined. DU community is feeling the effects every day, as we hear news of deaths of our colleagues. The news of deaths reaches us, but in most cases, we never know how the families are impacted. The worst impact is perhaps on the families of the ad hoc and guest faculty. It is they who have kept our colleges and university going all these years, without getting any security or benefits,” said the letter. The letter, signed by teachers across colleges and departments, also said, “They have been facing immense hardship in the face of reduced teaching and uncertainty of income. On top of this, there have been deaths among ad hoc and guest faculty, and many have been hospitalised with huge medical costs. We appeal to you to immediately establish a Covid-support fund specially for ad hoc and guest faculty. The university should appeal to all teachers to contribute at least a day’s salary (some may wish to contribute more) towards this fund.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/600-du-teachers-write-to-vc-for-welfare-fund/articleshow/82642323.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

They said they had raised the matter with administrative officials, including city magistrate (CTM), Thanesar sub-division magistrate (SDM) and additional deputy commissioner (ADC) but had not been provided with oxygen. The ambulance drivers said, “We are forced to procure oxygen in black whereas the administration should provide the essential gas to us in the time of Covid-19 pandemic. A large number of patients avail our services with oxygen.” The ambulance drivers gathered at Theme Park in Kurukshetra and parked their vehicles in a queue to protest against the administration. Driver Mohan Lal said, “Out of 10 patients, two require oxygen in the ambulance. We raised the demand for oxygen before the CTM, SDM and ADC but no relief was provided. Therefore, we decided to hold a protest.” “We are ready to drive ambulances at Rs 15 per kilometer with oxygen but we have to struggle for the gas and procure the D-type cylinder at Rs 900 and B-type at Rs 500. We are ready to run ambulances at the price fixed by the government but we should be provided with oxygen,” said another ambulance driver, Jasmer Singh.Thanesar SDM Akhil Pilani said, “There was some miscommunication regarding supply of oxygen to private ambulances. We have resolved their issue and given directions to start providing oxygen to ambulance drivers as per their daily requirement. A total of nine oxygen cylinders (seven B-type and two D-type) were demanded by ambulance drivers on Friday, and the same were provided to them. Supply will continue in future as well.” The SDM also said the administration would ensure that ambulance drivers did not overcharge from people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ambulance-drivers-demand-o2-supply/articleshow/82644045.cms||JK Singh

We will take it to the notice of the chief minister for appropriate steps,” said the education minister.A decision on reopening schools will be taken only after the number of Covid-19 positive cases come down significantly in the region. The minister ruled out any possibility of declaring the year gone by as zero academic year as there was hardly any academic activity, especially in government schools. He said many colleges carry out undergraduate admissions based on marks secured by students in class XII. The minister had clarified a few days ago that board examination will be conducted for class XII state board students after consulting experts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/will-regulate-pvt-schools-charging-fees-unfairly-min/articleshow/82642284.cms||---

He, however, made it clear that other restrictions imposed in the state government order will be applicable in the city till June 1. “The civic administration instructed all grocery shop owners that they must ensure that there is no overcrowding and customers should adhere to Covid safety protocols,” Gore said.

The damaged furnace is yet to be repaired and it would take six or seven more days to reopen the crematorium, which had only one incinerator, an official said. The pacemaker, a small device, is placed under the skin in the chest to help control the heartbeat of a patient suffering from arrhythmia or any other disorder in the pumping of the heart muscles. “A pacemaker uses a special sealant on its casing, which when exposed to extreme heat and pressure during cremation, can explode and cause damage to the crematory chamber. So, it has to be removed from a body,” said an engineer, in charge of maintenance of incinerators. TimesViewThere are a few things that we tend to forget in unusual circumstances. This is one of them. All guidelines for safe disposal should be followed to preempt repeats.According to the Rasmoni Burning Ghat authorities, the incident took place on Monday. “ The electric furnace developed a technical snag during the cremation of the body, which was brough from Barrackpore Base hospital. The pacemaker exploded, damaging the crematory chamber. The other bodies had to be sent to others crematoriums,” an operator said. The chief administrator of Barrackpore municipality, Uttam Das,said the family of the deceased should have alerted the doctors about the pacemaker. “If the doctors were informed about the pacemaker, it should have been removed before cremation. We had no information about the pacemaker. Though repairs have started, it would take a week more to reopen the electric facility,” the former civic chairman told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/crematorium-shuts-after-pacemaker-in-cov-body-explodes-damages-furnace/articleshow/82642363.cms||Sanjib Chakraborty

---||Chandigarh||Will examine if prosecution can lead to conviction: HC||Chandigarh: The Punjab and Haryana high court has made it clear that while deciding a case of compromise in a rape case, where the accused has married the victim, the court would not rest its decision merely because there is a mention of such an offence in the FIR. The high court would examine if the prosecution in such cases would lead to framing of charges and conviction, ruled Justice Hari Pal Verma while passing the orders to quash an FIR in a rape case registered in Punjab’s Hoshiarpur district, as the accused and the survivor (complainant), had entered into a compromise and started living as husband and wife. “It would be open to the high court to examine as to whether incorporation of the offence is there for the sake of it or the prosecution agencies have collected sufficient evidence, which if proved, would lead to framing of charge and the conviction, ultimately. In fact, continuation of the proceedings before the trial court in the instant FIR would be total abuse of the process of law,” observed Justice Verma. The judge held that the continuation of such proceedings would not only be a waste of time but would cause an unnecessary burden on the functioning of the trial court. In this case, a Hoshiarpur resident was booked for rape after a girl alleged that she was being raped on the pretext of solemnising marriage. However, later she found that the accused was already married and had not even divorced his wife. After the registration of the FIR, the accused got divorced and married the complainant. The complainant also made a statement before the trial court that she did not want the accused to be prosecuted, as they were married and were staying together. Thereafter, the accused had approached the HC seeking quashing of FIR against him. The state, however, opposed the plea on the ground that the power conferred under Section 482 of the CrPC (inherent powers) to quash the criminal proceedings for non-compoundable offences, is not to be exercised in those prosecutions which involve heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. Such offences are not private in nature and have a serious impact on society, the state had argued. After hearing all the parties and examining the record, the judge held that the chances of conviction of the husband in the case are quite bleak, as the victim is not likely to support the case of prosecution. “HC would not rest its decision merely because there is a mention of such an offence in the FIR,” the court held. “Continuation of the proceedings before the trial court in the instant FIR qua the petitioners would be total abuse of the process of law. The continuation of such proceedings would not only be a waste of time,” the HC observed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/will-examine-if-prosecution-can-lead-to-conviction-hc/articleshow/82644066.cms||Ajay Sura

Fire service personnel said that if the workers involved in the UGD project had placed the soil at a safe distance from the trench, such an incident could have been avoided.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/man-50-falls-into-20ft-ugd-trench-rescued/articleshow/82642306.cms||---
---||Trichy||Efforts on to produce oxygen at BHEL Trichy: Min Nehru||Trichy: Minister for municipal administration, urban development and water supply K N Nehru on Friday pointed out that the limited supply of the anti-viral drug remdesivir called for its optimum use. “There is a shortage of the drug (remdesivir) everywhere. Tamil Nadu itself gets 7,000 vials per day and 300 vials come to Trichy while the demand is for 500 vials every day. Though the government is ready to procure as much as we need, the supply is not in proportion with the demand,” Nehru told reporters after a review meeting in Trichy. On the oxygen supply situation, Nehru said talks were on to check the feasibility of producing medical oxygen at Bharat Heavy Electrical Limited (BHEL) in Trichy. Efforts were on to get the head of the DMK parliamentary committee, T R Baalu, with the concurrence of the chief minister, to secure permission from officials concerned in this regard. “We are making our efforts. Let’s see what will be the outcome,” he said. A committee headed by district revenue officer(DRO) will also look into the issues of shortage of beds, oxygen supply and other aspects affecting the fight against Covid-19, he said. Nehru said that steps have been initiated to increase the number of oxygen concentrators to 1,000 from the existing very few in Trichy district. On the need to rope in more doctors, Nehru said that final year MBBS students of KAP Viswanatham government medical college (KAPVGMC) have been included in the fight.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/efforts-on-to-produce-oxygen-at-bhel-trichy-min-nehru/articleshow/82642334.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Neeri develops technology to control air pollution emanating from cremations||Nagpur: When a human body is burnt, nearly 5kg of dust, along with toxic gases, is released into the atmosphere. To address this major source of air pollution, the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri) has developed a technology to mitigate dangerous emissions from open pyre green crematoria. At a time when crematoriums are flooded with bodies due to the on-going Covid-19 pandemic, the technology can prove useful for addressing concerns related to public health. In a pilot experiment, the technology has been successfully implemented at four pyres at Nigam Bodh ghat in New Delhi, where significant emission reduction has been observed. “Massive piles of firewood are burnt in the open during the cremation process. Apart from particulate matter 10 and 2.5, toxic gases like ozone, Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), oxides of nitrogen, carbon monoxide and other are also released, which are extremely harmful for the human health,” said chief scientist Padma Rao. Explaining the technology, the scientist said the system comprises of fume collection and handling facility, scrubbing and processing, and utilities and waste handling systems. “A especially-designed canopy is built on the open pyres followed by a ducting system through which the emissions get captured and passed into the scrubber system. The scrubber has a liquid which reacts and treats the emissions of smoke, oil or grease, greenhouse gases and particulates. There is a specially designed common hood and Induced Draft (ID) for capture and treatment of toxic emissions produced during cremation of bodies. The clean gas flows out of the chimney for safe release of the treated emissions,” added Rao. The technology also has an effluent treatment plant through which waste liquid can be treated and recycled. Highlighting benefits of the innovation, Rao said, “If implemented on a large scale, it can potentially reduce the burden of huge emissions at more than 50 open pyre crematoria in New Delhi and other cities. This will lead to massive reduction in exposure of toxic pollutants to humans and improving the air quality. The technology also aids in achieving the country’s commitment under Swachh Bharat Mission and sustainable development goals.” Neeri is in talks with some municipal corporations which are willing to adopt this technology. The institute is working towards technology transfer of the innovation. The technology was recently appreciated by Union science and technology minster Dr Harsh Vardhan, who inaugurated the pilot project. The minister stated that the innovation can also be applied to mitigate dispersed air pollution emitted from unorganized and informal industrial sectors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/neeri-develops-technology-to-control-air-pollution-emanating-from-cremations/articleshow/82642360.cms||Manka Behl
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ED probing Rs 2k-cr loan from Piramal Group to Omkar||Mumbai: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is probing a Rs 2,000 crore loan from the Piramal Group to money laundering case accused Omkar developers (Omkar group). At one point, Omkar group was considered Mumbai’s biggest slum redeveloper. ED officials have collected documents pertaining to the loan and summoned the Piramal Group’s Chief Financial Officer (CFO) last month to record his statement. Last week, Rajesh Laddha, executive director and group CFO of Piramal Enterprises, appeared before the ED and submitted the required documents, TOI has learnt. The Piramal Group has disbursed over Rs 2,000 crore loans to Omkar in different instalments. ED officials said after they complete studying the documents, they may summon Laddha again or other executives of the Piramal Group for further clarifications. An industry insider stated that Laddha was called for a routine question-answer session related to the business loan to Omkar group. The insider also added that Piramal Group had recovered around 80% of the loan amount from Omkar. The Piramal official is believed to have told ED that the group is into finance business and granted the loans to Omkar, which was purely a business deal. There are signed agreements between the two. These agreements, along with relevant documents, have been submitted to the ED. Earlier, the Omkar group also told ED officers that it took loans from Piramal Group as well as other financial institutions for their different projects a few years ago. The ED investigated Omkar group when it took a Rs 410 crore loan from Yes Bank to construct buildings for slumdwellers under the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) scheme at Wadala but diverted the money to other group companies. Actor and businessman Sachin Joshi had allegedly helped Omkar for the layering of Rs 87 crore. The loan money was not used for the purpose for which it was taken. In January, the ED had arrested Omkar group promoters Babulal Varma and Kamal Kishor Gupta in the case along with Joshi of JM Joshi Group in the case. Varma and Gupta are at present in jail, whereas the high court released Joshi on temporary bail for two months on health grounds. Recently, ED filed a chargesheet in the Rs 410 crore money laundering case against the arrested accused and 14 firms associated with them. In the chargesheet, ED stated Omkar group is executing 8 projects across the city worth Rs 23,000 crore for which they took Rs 8,000 crore loan from different banks and financial institutions. Omkar took Rs 2,755 crore from Yes Bank for the Worli project worth Rs 8,260 crore. Omkar Group’s three projects’ accounts turned NPA, including the Yes Bank loan on the Worli project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ed-probing-rs-2k-cr-loan-from-piramal-group-to-omkar/articleshow/82645330.cms||Vijay V Singh
---||Kolkata||Russia-India Sputnik match at Kolkata hospital||KOLKATA: Two versions of the Sputnik V vaccine — one the Russian made and the other Indian made — will undergo an equivalent trial at Peerless Hospital. If the Indian made vaccine proves to be equal or close to the efficacy of the original vaccine, this will open the doors for the local company to manufacture the doses. This, health experts believe, will allow more local manufacturers to come into the play by helping the country with more vaccine options at a time when India is facing an acute shortage of vials. “During an equivalent study the two vaccines will be pitted against each other to see how the India version by Hyderabad-based Hetero Healthcare fairs in its efficacy vis-à-vis the original Russian vaccine. We have been chosen as one of the sites for the study,” said Subhrojyoti Bhowmick, director clinical research & academics at Peerless Hospital. Earlier, Peerless was part of the concluded phase III trial of the Russian made vaccine. Dr Reddy’s Laboratories has already started importing Sputnik V after getting the nod from the Drug Control General of India (DCGI), Hetero Healthcare while another Hyderabad based pharma company has tied up with Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) for manufacturing the vaccine locally. Before the roll out of the Indian version of the vaccine its efficacy has to be studied against the original vaccine. The formulation of the two vaccines is the same. “This will be a head on comparison study of the two vaccines. Unlike other vaccine trials that are placebo controlled, in this trial, all will be given the actual vaccine. While half of the participants will be administered the Russian made doses the rest will get a shot of the Indian made vaccine of Sputnik V. We will be enrolling 100 volunteers and if all goes well, the trail should kick off in about two weeks,” added Bhowmick, who will play the role of a principal investigator. The Russian made vials have already arrived in Hyderabad. With the price of the vaccine being fixed as Rs 995 per dose it is expected to be rolled out in about a week. This will be the third vaccine to be introduced in India after Covishield and Covaxin in the inoculation drive against Covid-19. Sputnik V has an efficacy of 92%. Apart from Peerless, some more institutes are also expected to conduct the equivalent study on the two versions of the vaccine. “Such equivalent trials are to analyse how close the local made version of the vaccine is to the original version in terms of efficacy or to assess that the locally made one is not inferior. This happens when the technology is transferred. When the country needs more vaccine to inoculate its population, this will allow more local players to manufacture it,” said senior clinical trial expert, Santanu Tripathi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/russia-india-sputnik-match-at-kol-hosp/articleshow/82642497.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Besides taking legal action, I found it necessary to interact with them,” Mathivanan told ToI today. The traffic police inspector staged his awareness talk among motorists and pedestrians near main guard gate, Anna statue and Karur bypass road in his jurisdiction. The officer expressed displeasure over the way people looked at the lockdown. “Every residential locality has some small grocery and vegetable shops. People can buy their essential there instead of visiting the main areas. Some come to the shops everyday to buy small quantities of vegetables. They can stock up instead,” he said. In his awareness talk, the traffic police inspector explained to the people about the crowded hospitals because of the excessive number of cases, large number of deaths and shortage of medicines. “This can be avoided, if all of us stay indoors and visit shops when it is highly necessary. It is very said that some come by car as a family for buying things,” he said. The inspector also pointed to the long-queue of the attendants of Covid-19 patients to get the remdesivir drug from the special counter at the government physiotherapy college in Trichy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/cop-drives-home-perils-of-violating-lockdown/articleshow/82642354.cms||Gokul Rajendran

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Cops turned away patients with bed assurance too||Hyderabad: Hours before the high court sat in session on Friday, police along with health and revenue officials stopped ambulances from entering Telangana’s borders, some had documents to show they had hospital beds booked in advance. In fact, ambulances were stopped at various interstate check points from last night itself and some frantically sought help from ministers and bureaucrats through social media, without much success. One such ambulance carried 65-year-old N Raghava Reddy, a farmer from Choutapalle village of Kadapa district, with Covid-19 symptoms. He was travelling to TX hospital in Kacheguda, Hyderabad. “My father has asthma and developed Covid-19 symptoms including viral pneumonia. Doctors in Jammalamadugu and Proddutur towns advised us to look for a ventilator bed and we found a bed in TX hospital, Kacheguda. Despite showing the letter from the hospital, police stopped us at Pullur check post at 11 pm on Thursday and after waiting till 8 am, we returned to Kurnool. With the help of our local MLA, we found an oxygen bed in a private hospital of Kurnool,” Raghava Reddy’s son Veera Reddy said. Veera Reddy said that about 30 ambulances, some with documents, turned back after they were stopped at the checkpost and he had paid Rs 70,000 for the ambulance service. “After I sought help on social media, people claiming to be from KTR’s and Revanth Reddy’s office called. They took my details but we were not allowed to travel to Hyderabad,” Reddy said. About 40 ambulances trying to enter the state from Andhra Pradesh at Ramapuram check point in Suryapet district, Pullur toll plaza check point in Jogulamba Gadwal district, Wadapally check point in Nalgonda, Sironcha border check point at Rapanpalle in Mancherial district and at Bidar border check point in Hadnoor of Sangareddy district were stopped by the police along with health and revenue department staff. Police of Alampur said they were only following the instructions of health and revenue department staff. At Suryapet district border in Kodad Rural police station limits, several ambulances had to turn back for not having required permission. “We are stopping the ambulances for health and revenue department staff to check the details of the patient. If it was a Covid-19 patient, the health department staff check with state control room to verify if they have permission and if the patient did not have permission, based on the instructions of health department staff, we sent them back,” Kodad inspector Shivaram Reddy said. At around 9 pm, police stopped intercepting ambulances entering Telangana based on the specific instructions from the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cops-turned-away-patients-with-bed-assurance-too/articleshow/82644095.cms||Mahesh Buddi

The collector issued a note saying since the government has increased the gap between the first and the second dose for Covishield vaccine to 84 days, only those people who have completed the stipulated time frame will now be eligible for the second dose of vaccination till further notice. “The government has widened the gap between two doses of Covishield. The protocol for Covaxin remains unchanged and hence eligible beneficiaries will get the second dose as per schedule,” Mandhare said. Deputy collector and incident commander for vaccination programme Ganesh Misal said, “Till date, second dose of Covishield vaccine was being given at an interval of 42 to 56 days after the first dose. But now it has been increased to 84 days to 112 days. So people who have completed the period will get an SMS for their second dose. Going out of turn at the vaccination centre will not help.” The officer added vaccination for the people who are above 45 years of age is being carried out and those registered can take their first dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/dont-rush-for-2nd-dose-of-covishield/articleshow/82638182.cms||---

He added that the Centre is also procuring higher quantity of paddy and wheat at MSP to boost farmers’ income. Out of the total amount disbursed since the launch of the scheme in February 2019, Modi said around Rs 60,000 crore has been transferred during the Covid-19 pandemic, which is helping farmers in these difficult times. The PM on Friday released the eighth instalment of Rs 20,667 crore to more than 9.5 crore farmers under the PM-Kisan scheme via video-conference. “To West Bengal farmers, the benefit has begun to reach for the first time. Today, lakhs of farmers in West Bengal have got their first instalment. Gradually, when the names of farmers are sent to the Centre, the number of beneficiaries will increase,” the PM said. Under the scheme, which became effective from December 2018, the Centre provides Rs 6,000 per year to eligible farmers in three equal instalments of Rs 2,000. Addressing the event, Modi said farmers have performed their duties even during this Covid-19 pandemic and helped the country achieve a record production of foodgrains and horticulture crops. The PM said around 10 crore farmers have received the 8th instalment. Talking about procurement operations, he said the centre has purchased 10% more wheat so far this year at MSP and added that around Rs 58,000 crore payment has been made to farmers directly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-kisan-benefit-reaches-bengal-farmers-for-1st-time/articleshow/82648447.cms||---

As many as 50 patients are undergoing treatment for the fungal infection in the district. The district authorities have formed a task force headed by civil surgeon Ashok Thorat to deal with cases of black fungus or mucormycosis. As many as 40 patients detected with mucormycosis so far have recovered. However, the exact number of deaths due to the infection is not known. “The data is being compiled. ENT surgeons (ear, nose, throat) across the district have reported they collectively treated 150 cases so far. While many have recovered, some others may have developed neurological or opthalmological problems are not known,” Dr Bapusaheb Nagargoje, chief medical officer, Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) said. The officer pointed out that the ‘black fungus’ is a rare disease and it has been found to have affected the covid patients at an alarming rate – especially the ones who have been cured using steroids and who are comorbid. “There is no definitive study as such whether all covid patients are likely to be infected by the disease but the people need to be very particular about their sugar levels post covid. This could be the vital source of information if the persons is likely to catch the fungus,” Dr Avesh Palod, the nodal officer of Covid, NMC said. The doctors said that the people were limiting their post-Covid health check to parameters of their lungs only. People should watch out for reddishness in their eyes, pain in sinuses, issues like headache. “It is advisable for people to go for a check-up with the family physicians post covid period at regular interval to ensure if the ‘fungus’ has attacked the person. The early intervention will be very fruitful as the delayed intervention could turn fatal,” the officer added. Thorat has appealed to all the hospitals to report about the disease to the Task Force so that the steps could be taken accordingly. “We will soon have a set-up and operation theatre ready for the surgeries and treatment of the people who are suffering from the disease. We have also sought suggestions from the specialists,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/after-covid-cure-50-in-nashik-dist-undergo-mucormycosis-treatment/articleshow/82638213.cms||Abhilash Botekar

The court was hearing a petition filed by Murugan who sought to release his tractor and trailer which were seized by the authorities in Ramanathapuram district.The counsel appearing for the petitioner submitted that the Parthibanur police have registered a case and seized the petitioner’s vehicle for involvement in illegal transportation of sand. A division bench of justices M S Ramesh and B Pugalendhi said that while hearing a batch of cases filed in 2017, a division bench of this court, issued various directions on this aspect. The order of the division bench was challenged by the government before the Supreme Court and the same were disposed of, by directing the petitioners to file review applications before HC.The judges said a division bench of this court in 2019 dismissed the review application and issued a series of directions which included that the designated courts are directed to deal with the question of confiscation or release of the vehicles on receipt of the private complaint or seizure report from the person authorized, notwithstanding the exercise of power of compounding. The judges observed that pursuant to the directions of the division bench in the review applications, the state government also issued a GO dated August 5, 2020, issuing directions to the revenue, forest and police departments on seizure of vehicles and compounding of offences. Dismissing the petition, the judges said that it is open to the petitioner to approach the designated court by filing appropriate application for interim custody of the vehicle pending confiscation proceedings, if any.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/only-designated-courts-can-release-seized-vehicles-hc/articleshow/82642388.cms||---

The court was hearing a petition filed by Ramani, a resident of Kanyakumari district who sought to conduct a re-postmortem on the body of her husband, based on a report issued by the forensic agency in Saudi Arabia.The petitioner stated that her husband George Ponnaiyan went to Saudi Arabia in 2019 for work. In October 2020, Suresh a co-worker of her husband called and informed her that Ponnaiyan died following an assault by one Christopher Raj, in a quarrel over salary.The petitioner had submitted a representation to the ministry of external affairs and in the meanwhile, she received a copy of the postmortem report issued by the forensic medicine specialist in Dammam, stating that the death was due to contusion in the neck and its consequences. However, no criminal action was initiated. Hence, the petitioner filed the present petition.Justice A A Nakkiran observed that in the absence of a thorough postmortem and finding out the cause of the death, the truth will be hidden. If the truth comes in favour of the petitioner, the real culprit cannot escape from the clutches of law.Disposing of the petition, the judge directed the petitioner to make a complaint before the Kollemcode police station and on receipt of the complaint, police shall register a case under Section 174 of CrPC immediately. The judge directed the collector to take necessary steps to bring back the body of the deceased from the Thiruvananthapuram airport to Kanyakumari government hospital to conduct a re-postmortem and the entire process videographed .The judge said that the videograph and re-postmortem report shall be handed over to the concerned investigating officer.

---||Kolkata||Cotton body bags to replace plastic||Kolkata: Move over the black plastic body bags, white cotton body bags will be used to wrap the bodies of deceased Covid-19 patients in Bengal while being taken for cremation. Health officials said the state introducing environment-friendly cotton body bags will reduce pollution and protect electric incinerator. So far, bodies were wrapped in plastic bags to prevent leakage of body fluids and protect the people handling the bodies. But with the plastic bags melting in the electric furnace, there have been complaints about incinerators being damaged. “Furnaces are overworked. On the top, melting plastic bags are damaging the furnaces often,” said the in-charge of a crematorium in the city designated for bodies of Covid-19 victims. Though the state health department is yet to come up with a revised protocol on wrapping Covid-19 bodies with cotton bags, many hospitals on Friday received messages from KMC, saying the bags were ready and they had to be obtained from the Central Medical Stores in Moulali. “Plastic body bags are causing damage to the anti-pollution device at electric furnaces of the crematoriums and are also not biodegradable in case of burials,” the message said. According to sources, there have been several talks between health and KMC officials on the feasibility of replacing plastic bags with cotton ones that will ensure no harm is done to the furnace. Environmentalists, like Subhas Datta, lauded this innovation, but some doctors cautioned that cotton could prove risky for people handling the bodies if the material was not good enough. “Some electric furnaces are emitting black fumes and if the highly toxic plastic material is allowed to burn, it is like adding fuel to the fire, as far as the environment is concerned. We cannot afford to pollute the air further, especially when people are gasping for oxygen. Using eco-friendly material is a welcome move,” said Datta. Covid-19 bodies are cremated at Dhapa, Nimtala, Birjunala in Garden Reach, Garia and Siriti in Behala. “Plastic bags are more scientific as it is impermeable and will not allow leakage of fluid. But if cotton is used, the fabric should be closely knit, something like that used for masks,” said public health specialist Anirban Dalui.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cotton-body-bags-to-replace-plastic/articleshow/82642435.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Eidgah in Dehradun, which sees a turnout of thousands of devotees on Eid, saw only a handful of them this time. Some mosques had a decent turnout, with crowd control measures in place. Doon’s renowned Jama Masjid was all decked up for the festival. “Only people residing in areas in and around the Jama Masjid came here to offer their prayers. The attendance was quite low and social distancing was maintained,” said Dehradun’s shahar qazi Mohammad Ahmed Kasmi. In Dehradun, many mosques preponed the prayer to 6am (they are usually held at 9am) and since the announcement was made last night, not many were informed. The unique measure was adopted to lower footfall at mosques. A resident of Dehradun’s Majra area, who went to a nearby mosque, said, “People, especially those from Muslim-dominated areas, tried to go to a mosque to offer prayers. The festival comes once a year and a lot of people did not want to offer prayers at home for the second year in a row. Due to the pandemic, this Eid was a lacklustre event.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/eid-celebrated-indoors-this-year-too-low-turnout-at-mosques/articleshow/82640554.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Mumbai||Mumbai air passenger traffic in May plunges 68% from January||MUMBAI: The average daily passenger traffic at Mumbai airport has dropped to about 17,600 passengers this month —a 68% decline as compared to the 55,800 it handled daily in January. The second Covid-19 wave has brought along a second despondent May for the airline industry. Last year, airline flights stayed suspended till May 25 and then passenger traffic saw a slow but steady rise till February this year. With the second Covid wave hitting in April, though, passenger traffic has again troughed—once again in May, the most important month in the airline calendar. Conventionally, May is about peak fares, long airport queues and packed aircraft cabins. It was the month schools closed for summer vacations and India travelled while airlines raked in profit to last the lean season that monsoon brought in. Pre-pandemic, the Mumbai airport handled about 1.4 lakh passengers per day (January 2020), said a source. “For the month of January, Mumbai airport had registered a passenger traffic of 17.3 lakh, which crawled up to 17.8 lakh in February, then dropped to 15.8 lakh in March,” according to Directorate General of Civil Aviation data. The number dropped to 10.4 lakh in April, the source added. This May, India’s airports are largely deserted. According to the UK’s aviation data firm OAG, Indian airlines removed 2.4 million seats this month as compared to last. “In South Asia, seats have fallen by 15.1% this month as a result of the significant increase in Covid cases in India,’’ said OAG. According to the source, between January and April this year, about 61 lakh passengers travelled to/from the Mumbai airport, which included about 54 lakh domestic passengers. “The passenger traffic was on a steady rise and in March we moved domestic operations to terminal 1 at Vile Parle in preparation for the coming summer rush. The state government had capped flight movement at the Mumbai airport to 300 flights per day and so back then that seemed to be a concern,” said an official from a low-cost carrier. Today, that is no longer a hurdle. The Mumbai airport used to handle over 980 flights on an average in a day, but currently handles an average of about 200 flights per day, said an air traffic control source. Air fares are generally a sure indicator of the drop in passenger traffic. Since they have been capped by the civil aviation ministry though, the fares have stayed in the median range with a Mumbai-Delhi return ticket for travel next week starting at about Rs 8,800.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-city-air-passenger-traffic-in-may-plunges-68-from-jan/articleshow/82645437.cms||---

For, they are soon approached by volunteers of The Good Deed, an NGO that has been working during the pandemic to not only provide fresh meals and Covid-19-related resources to people around the capital, but also to honour police personnel for their frontline fight against the pandemic. The grateful men in uniform soon take a break to partake of the fresh meals that the NGO people handed them. Kanika Dewan, co-founder of TGD, said the focus has not only been to provide food and upliftment to healthcare workers, but also to assist the underprivileged, elderly and children of Delhi. The NGO has distributed food on the streets, at orphanages, anganwadi centres and JJ clusters across the city. In addition, the group has been helping people find genuine Covid-19 leads on hospital beds, ventilators and oxygen cylinders. “We felt the need to help the police in some way or another as they are the frontline force against Covid, working in the summer heat,” said Dewan. “We decided to provide them fresh meals and any other items they may require. As for our other food activities, we have so far distributed food in three JJ clusters, both dry rations and fresh food. We have also distributed snack boxes to children at two orphanages and at an old age home in Noida.” The organisation, co-founded by Dewan and Karan Kaushish, currently acts as an umbrella to another eight NGOs, gathering and providing ration kits, hygiene kits, fresh meals and medicines for Covid-affected families, with work accelerating during the lockdown when it became clear people were finding it difficult to get food and medicines. To fund these measures, Dewan and Kaushish are spending their own money. “We did receive some ration kits as donations, but we have invested our own cash,” said Dewan. “We are running short now and have begun a fundraiser to boost the coffers.” Dewan says. TGD says people wishing to help their cause can email them at connect@thegd.org or send a message on WhatsApp to 9811127215. TGD has tied up with Masala & Sons restaurant for the preparation of the meals. Sagar Suri, director, Masala & Sons, said, “The ability to give back to society is a gift from God. It is a task we have all been given. We will continue to work through the pandemic to help as many people as we can.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/meals-meds-and-more-backing-frontline-warriors-with-full-force/articleshow/82642487.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

According to a statement, the plant at the Ramco factory was established at a cost of Rs 50lakh. The oxygen produced here would be provided to government hospitals at Virudhunagar, Aruppukottai, Sivakasi, Sattur, Srivilliputhur and Rajapalayam. The plant has a capacity to produce 42 to 48 cylinders every day, each of which can old 45litres of liquid oxygen. At present, nearly 20 to 22 cylinders only could be produced daily due to the non-availability of a booster unit. Once the booster unit is made available, the plant would produce its full capacity. Meanwhile, two empty container trucks were to be airlifted from Madurai airport to Ranchi on Friday night for shipping oxygen from Rourkela or Jamshedpur to the southern districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/o2-production-launched-at-ramco-plant/articleshow/82642423.cms||---

The deceased was identified as a middle-aged man from Nandyal, who passed away inside the ambulance after it was turned back and returning to Nandyal. The ambulance driver said the patient was already in a critical condition and was on oxygen support and the delay at the check-post led to a worsening of his condition. Later in the evening, the ambulances were allowed to enter after the Telangana high court stayed the order issued by the government restricting the movement of ambulances from neighbouring states. Kurnool SP Fakkeerappa Kaginelli, earlier in the day twitted that his team had to quickly arrange oxygen from police hospital for two patients who were turned back from Telangana border. Fakkeerappa put up a message at 9.07 pm saying: “TS police just now started releasing ambulances at the borders. Patients are being moved towards Hyderabad.” Kurnool police said there was a long queue of ambulances at Pullur toll plaza since 8 pm on Thursday night after their Telangana counterparts erected barricades and started halting almost every vehicle. On Friday morning, Kurnool MLA Hafeez Khan reached the toll plaza and requested Telangana police to allow the ambulances to pass through. Till he was there, some ambulances were allowed to enter, but once he left the place, it was back to square one. Jogulamba Gadwal police told reporters that they sent back around 40 ambulances for not having the required permissions and in some cases, the vehicles were sent back despite having permissions. “We were just following the instructions to allow only those vehicles which have entry passes from Telangana police, or health officials. As far as reviewing the bed confirmation and checking the hospital letters are concerned, the health officials were looking into it,” a senior police officer told TOI. Urging the Telangana government to act with ‘humanity’, YSRC general secretary Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy said it is natural for patients to move to cities where medical infrastructure is better. “Beyond rights, it is understandable to see why individual states are trying to protect their resources. We learnt that some oxygen tankers coming to our state from neighbouring ones are being held up by their local police as they seek to cater to their needs first,” Reddy, who is also advisor to the government of AP, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/1-dead-patients-suffer-as-t-police-halt-ap-ambulances/articleshow/82645384.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti
---||Mumbai||Mumbai’s Jogeshwari hospital docs allege deaths due to O2 issues||Mumbai: Low oxygen pressure and a shortage of doctors may have contributed to deaths of several Covid patients at BMC-run HBT Trauma Care Hospital in Jogeshwari, medical officers from the facility have alleged. In a letter to the hospital’s medical superintendent Dr Pramod Nagarkar, they said insufficient supply to oxygen cylinders at the peak of the second wave created “emergency situation at all times” putting doctors under “tremendous stress”. They added that doctors from an outsourced agency tendered to run the ICUs would leave before their shift was over, “neglecting” patients on O2 and ventilator support and putting lives at risk. They also highlighted an “increase in mortality” in mid-April. However, Dr Nagarkar and a top official in BMC said the allegations stemmed from discontent engendered by internal conflicts. Barring a few days in mid-April, when the city faced oxygen shortage, the hospital never ran short and its “mortality rate is comparable to any other Covid hospital,” said Dr Nagarkar. Speaking to TOI, one of the doctors who made the allegation said life-support devices would constantly beep low oxygen alerts after patient load increased in April. “Three weeks ago, there was a night when we had three patients die in a span of hours following low pressure,” the doctor said. The casualties were in the 58-68 years age group. “All were on the Bipap (non-invasive ventilator) needing 70-80% support, but the screen flashed that they were getting only 40%-50%,” the doctor said. Last year, there were similar allegations of deaths in the hospital due to low oxygen pressure following which an oxygen generation plant was installed. The hospital’s original ICU bed capacity of 32 was augmented to nearly 45, but doctors say oxygen support did not rise proportionately, leading to drop in pressure. “Us working in ICUs wearing PPEs is all futile if we can’t save lives because of low oxygen,” one of the doctors said. The doctors claimed there have been over 213 deaths since March, including 145 in April alone. Hospital authorities have said there were 138 deaths since December. BMC does not release data on Covid-related fatalities from individual hospitals in Mumbai. The daily update is a compilation of the city’s overall casualty record. One doctor who worked at Jogeshwari even alleged that he has seen a handful of young patients dying though they did not have any co-morbidities and came with 5-6% lung damage; they deteriorated possibly due to sub-optimal oxygen support. “It’s not just an issue of low O2 pressure but also lack of manpower in the ICUs,” the doctor added. The hospital’s ICU was outsourced to Jeevan Jyot Trust in 2018. The agency is supposed to supply two doctors per shift for which BMC pays them Rs 1,800 per bed. Trauma doctors alleged that the trust has not provided adequate doctors or an intensivist, a charge that the trust’s spokesperson refuted. Superintendent Dr Nagarkar said the hospital did face a crisis from April 17-20 when all peripheral hospitals didn’t get oxygen supply. “Once that was sorted, there was no issue of oxygen crisis. The plant in the hospital generates 1,200 litres of oxygen per minute. In addition, we have 190 jumbo cylinders and 30 dura cylinders,” he said, adding that the complaints are being made by a few doctors who didn’t want to do their share of work. “The mortality rate is comparable to any other Covid hospital. There are some who probably don't want to share the blame and put it on so-called oxygen issues,” he said. A senior civic official said the allegations must be seen in the light of internal conflicts between the hospital’s medical officers and their higher-ups. “We have done a detailed check into these deaths but haven’t found any truth,” the official said. About the three deaths, the official said all had co-morbidities, including diabetes and Parkinsons, and were in a serious condition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbais-jogeshwari-hospital-docs-allege-deaths-due-to-o2-issues/articleshow/82645454.cms||---
---||Nagpur||First Day, Full Show: Drive-in for vax sails smoothly on wheels||Nagpur: Amit Sharma stood behind a car holding his mother, Mayadevi, in a wheel chair inside the under construction Glocal Mall at Sitabuldi. Sixty-six-year old Mayadevi had undergone a spinal surgery in February and could not walk. Amit, who does have a car, pushed her all the way to the centre from his home near Shani Mandir, around a kilometre away from the centre. She was the second to be vaccinated at the drive-in vaccination centre for senior citizens which started off in the city on Friday at 11.30am. At 3:30pm, the second centre opened at Trillium Mall—another shopping complex in the city. Here, Shasikala Moraiya who walked in with her relatives, was not allowed to get registered. The staffers insisted she needs to drive-in, it can be any vehicle, but one cannot walk in for vaccination. One of them rushed to get the car that was parked outside. Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari told newspersons that anybody on any vehicle can come and get vaccinated. It need not be a four-wheeler. Later, an NMC doctor clarified that even two-wheelers and bicycles will do as long as the person coming in is a senior citizen. The two drive-in centres in the city were inaugurated by the two Nitins. Member of Parliament from Nagpur and Union minister for transport and highways Nitin Gadkari inaugurated the centre at Glocal Mall. This was followed by the inauguration of the Trillium Mall near Medical Chowk at 3:30pm. As the centres closed at 5pm, 105 persons in all had been vaccinated. These included 83 and 22 at Glocal and Trillium malls respectively. Though the targets for the day have been met, NMC officials admitted that the more people could have got the shot. Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi told TOI that the number was low because not many were aware on the first day. The second centre was inaugurated after 3pm and shut at 5pm. It is expected that the numbers would increase in the coming days. The first person to get the jab through the drive-in facility was Shehnaz Dawar who reached Glocal Mall followed by wheelchair-bound Mayadevi. Majority of the persons TOI came across had come for the first dose, which was delayed because they had Covid. Fifty-six-year old Rajashri Mandgade, had come with her 87-year-old mother Sumiti Sawarkar. “She had Covid two months ago and had to be hospitable. The oxygen level had gone to 90. This delayed the vaccination. She is fine now,” said Rajashri. Youngsters, who accompanied senior citizens, said they could still not get vaccinated because of the shortage. Ketan Salpekar, who accompanied 74-year-old wing commander (retd) Sudhir Bhagwat, said he himself could not get the jab because there was a shortage. There were others like him who could not get vaccinated, including Amit Sharma, who came with his mother Mayadevi or Cyrus, who accompanied Shenaz Dawar. At Trillium Mall, a woman, who had taken one dose of Covaxin, came down hoping to get the second one. However, only Covishield was available at the centre. Gadkari said patients who have recovered from Covid need to be cautious about mucous mycosis infections which has emerged as a side effect. The symptoms need not be ignored. Raut praised the NMC for its efforts. Both NMC and the district administration should be appreciated as they ensured that the highest number of beds were available in Nagpur in the entire state. “People are also cooperating during the restrictions which will continue till June 1. Even as cases have come down, it’s not the time to be complacent as deaths continue,” said Raut.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/first-day-full-show-drive-in-for-vax-sails-smoothly-on-wheels/articleshow/82642418.cms||Shishir Arya

---||Kolkata||Covishield 2nd dose: Revised norm breather for vaccinators||KOLKATA: Vaccinators and coordinators in the inoculation drive at government Covid vaccination centres (CVCs) that have been functioning without a break since April and have been vaccinating different priority groups since January 15, will finally get a breather from tomorrow with the Centre revising the second dose interval for those who have taken the first jab of Covishield from 42-56 days earlier to 84-112 days now. That will give the government CVCs, including urban primary health centres in Kolkata, Bidhannagar, New Town and Howrah, a clear 28 days’ break to revitalise the team, replenish stocks and streamline the system so that there is no crowding at the jab centres when they resume the vaccination drive from June 7. “On Friday, we administered the second dose of Covishield with the 42-56 days interval for the last time. From Saturday onwards, the second dose will be given only after completion of at least 84 days from the first dose,” a civic health official said. The CVCs though will not be shut. They will continue to give the shots to health workers and frontline workers who have not yet been vaccinated. Also, those who had taken a dose of Covaxin will continue to get the second dose as originally planned between 28-35 days of the first dose. However, the number of people who have received Covaxin jabs is far fewer than Covishield. “We are not shutting shop. The vaccine centres will continue to function. If there are any Covishield recipients who have missed the second shot according to the earlier schedule and their time becomes due within the next 28 days, they too will receive the shot so long as the gap between the first and the second shot is at least 84 days. But we don’t expect many people to walk in with such a request,” a KMC borough health official said. State medical colleges and hospitals said they would wait for an official order from the state health department before announcing the shift to the new interval regime for Covishield. That guideline is expected to be issued either late on Friday or early Saturday. But if such a notification is not out, they will continue to administer the second dose of Covishield as per the old 48-56 days protocol. “I will be calling up the state’s vaccination nodal officer to find out about this if no directive comes by the end of the day. We might have to follow the revised guideline from tomorrow,” said Medical College Hospital Kolkata principal Manju Banerjee. At ID Hospital Beliaghata the vaccination team has already put up a poster about the revised regime that says 12 to 16 weeks’ interval between the two doses. “Even as we are waiting for a directive from the state government we have started counselling people who turned up saying that they can defer their schedule,” said community medicine specialist Sanjib Bandyopadhyay vaccination supervisor at ID Hospital. “We are reassuring our first dose recipients that they have not missed out on the date for the second dose with the Union health ministry’s revised guideline. By the end of the month, we might get some stock,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/covishield-2nd-dose-revised-norm-breather-for-vaccinators/articleshow/82642549.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Dehradun||Facebook group aims to ease Doon’s struggle with the coronavirus||Dehradun: ‘Uttarakhand Corona Help’, a 1,500-member Facebook group initiated by Doon-based Anupma Khanna, has become a go-to site for anyone who is struggling to get help due to the Covid pandemic. The group has managed to help over 600 families in the over two weeks since it was started. The volunteers coordinate with service providers to facilitate free deliveries of essentials. So far, they have delivered 36 oxygen cylinders, around 6,000 medicines as well as around 1,300 food packets. The team also distributes free steamers to low-income families. “Around two weeks ago, I thought of starting a community of volunteers where people could ask for help and those who were able to, could offer help. The community then grew organically and has since become an extended family,” Khanna said. After reports of shortage of drinking water at Doon Hospital and Coronation Hospital, the team also arranged for a regular supply of bottles of drinking water to the facilities. The group also verifies leads, saving a struggling family time and effort. Rajeev Sachar, Doon-based businessman, who is part of the group, said, “We receive unverified forwards of requests many times. So, we first call the person and ensure that it’s a genuine need. Our volunteers then work towards providing help.” The team does not accept cash donations. Instead, it encourages people to donate oxygen cylinders and other resources. It is also playing a vital role in coordinating leads for plasma donation across the state. “The best part is that people are coming forward to volunteer to donate plasma. We encourage everyone we help to donate plasma after they recover. Within three days, we received names of around 25 plasma donors.” Arpit Kathuria, another active volunteer with the group said, “The moment we receive a request in the group, our volunteers start working on contacting any leads they have for arranging the required resources. Besides, I constantly contact pharmacies and hospitals to keep track of current information and constantly update it in the group so that no one loses that crucial time in searching for the resources.” In the future, the team plans to help provide ration to families which were financially hit after being affected by Covid-19. Grocery shops across Uttarakhand are being identified where donors could transfer money directly to the shopkeepers and financially affected households could get ration free of cost.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/facebook-group-aims-to-ease-doons-struggle-with-the-coronavirus/articleshow/82640576.cms||---

The MSS, which literally means ‘organization to serve motherhood’, now owns more than 20 maternity homes across Central India, residential schools for specially-abled children, orphanages, working women hostels, old-age homes, a nursing college, a social work college, a rehabilitation centre for disabled children, a counselling centre for women, and the good will of at least five generations.Many families of old Nagpur share the most remarkable bond with MSS – their children, grandchildren and great grandchildren were all born in MSS’ maternity homes. Nagpur’s MP and Union minister Nitin Gadkari is also an MSS-baby."I was born in Mahal nursing home of the MSS. I have been observing the progress of this dedicated institution since years. Even after 100 years, the spirit of service to motherhood is maintained, as it was expected by their great founders," said Gadkari."You can find children born in MSS maternity homes in every corner of India and even abroad," said Dr Lata Deshmukh, secretary of MSS. "Right from kindergartens to old age homes, we work for every age group. In Covid-19 times, we started a 25-bed Covid care centre and hospital for expecting mothers," she said."From 1921 to date, all executive committees of MSS have been committed to work for the betterment of the society, for patriotism, for national interest, for the service of motherhood," saidDr Aruna Babhulkar, MSS president.Dr Vaishali Bezalwar has written an account of the 100 years journey of MSS in the form of a Marathi book. Her book was released on May 14."Apart from being the first nursing home of Central India run by an all-women staff, MSS was the first hospital where Indian women used to conduct deliveries, serve patients," she said. This not only reduced the maternal mortality rate but also developed a support for institutional deliveries in Nagpurians.MSS founder members had to fight against poverty, superstition and ignorance. Convincing people to go for institutional deliveries was a big challenge. Kamalatai and Venutai used to serve delivering mothers and new born babies personally. They used to stay in the maternity home only. This dedicated service formed a base for Nagpur to develop as Central India’s medical hub in next 100 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/a-glorious-century-of-mother-child-care-and-much-more/articleshow/82640574.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

While a very few tasted success in registering for slots, many found that booking a slot was akin to buying tatkal tickets. Within minutes of vaccination slots being opened for those between 18 to 44 years of age, all the available slots for four days were booked. While tech-savvy users used multiple devices and also relied on bots for notifications about slots, other quick-thinking users were willing to go the extra mile to get vaccinated, opting for rural locations despite residing in the state capital. “400 vaccine slots for 18+ in Goa gone in less than two minutes,” said Shannon. “Is anyone actually able to book an appointment or are these slots just for show? I kept getting a ‘wrong security code’ message until it said that all the slots have been booked for that date.” Goa is all set to launch the third phase of the Covid-19 vaccination drive for people in the age group 18-45 years from May 15. Citizens were urged to register themselves on the CoWin portal starting at 12pm. “I was excited but when I was checking for the slots it kept showing booked. In Margao they were showing booked so I was trying other places in South Goa. When I tried to register it would not allow me to enter the captcha and then it would crash,” said Margao resident Vinda Kare. Frustrated with her experience, Kare asked her friend to try for a slot. “He booked a slot for me in Ponda but I could not even see the slots in Ponda on my computer,” Kare, who got a slot for Sunday, said. Many who tried to book vaccination slots at a private hospital at Dona Paula have faced similar problems with slots getting taken within five minutes. Where Kare succeeded many others were left desperately searching. “It was... a rollercoaster,” a 33-year-old told TOI when asked about his meticulous search to find a slot on the portal. “I tried for one and a half hours. It showed unavailable and then immediately booked. No middle ground.” Commander (rtd) Abhilash Tomy, who circumnavigated the earth non-stop, had his own disappointment. “Vaccine slots for 18+ opened today for Goa. For two minute,” said Tomy in a tweet. “Five days slots gone in two minutes. fastest fingers, fast internet didn’t work. Happy to say I got nine OTPs.” Some residents of Margao, Mapusa and Panaji searched for rural vaccination locations such as Aldona, Corlim, Cuncolim, Mandur and others on the assumption that the urban centres would be in high demand. The tech savvy relied on platforms and automated bots which send alerts whenever a vaccine slot becomes available using the public API.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fastest-fingers-first-as-vaccine-slots-for-18-fill-up-in-minutes-on-friday/articleshow/82644162.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Shirishkumar Salunkhe, a Kamothe resident, got his first dose at the primary health centre in Kalamboli, where he was given a certificate which stated he had received a jab of Covishield. The goof-up came to light when Salunkhe’s son, Vijay, approached Kamothe health centre for his father’s second dose. The Kamothe centre staff told him that the batch number mentioned in the first dose was that of Covaxin and asked him to go back to the Kalamboli centre. The Kalamboli centre staff admitted the mistake and the retired Army havildar was eventually administered the second dose of Covaxin at the NMMC hospital in Vashi on May 13. “The Kalamboli health centre’s staff did not tell me the name of the vaccine,” said Salunkhe. “The certificate downloaded from the app for the first dose on March 18 at Kalamboli centre mentions Covishield. I had to stand in the queue for eight hours at the Kamothe centre on May 6 only to be told that I needed to take Covaxin. After Kalamboli staff checked the batch numbers and confirmed, they updated it on the app,” said Vijay. “When Salunkhe was administered the first dose, Covaxin stock had just arrived for the first time so, there was confusion. No one consulted me about the app updates,” said Dr Ravi Kumar, who was at Kalamboli health centre during the mix-up.—Umesh K Parida||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-59-year-old-dodges-2nd-jab-of-wrong-vaccine/articleshow/82644156.cms||Umesh K Parida

In a letter to the President on behalf of 89 organisations and 326 individual activists, Henri Tiphagne, the national working secretary of the network, stated that the post of the chairperson has been vacant for five months since the retirement of Justice (retired) H L Dattu in December 2020. The lone judicial member is vacant since the retirement of Justice (retired) D Murugesan from September 2018 and that of one of the two non-judicial members has been vacant since it was created through an amendment in July 2019. NHRC member Justice (retired) P C Pant was appointed as the acting chairperson of the body on April 25, 2021, as per Section 7 of the PHRA. “Impact of these long vacancies has been pointed out by Justice Pant and it is clear that with a monthly workload of near 10,000 complaints these vacancies have severely impacted the responsiveness of the institution and its image in the general public eye. It also allows for violations to continue and impunity to reign,” Henri said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/plea-to-fill-up-posts-in-nhrc-transparently/articleshow/82642483.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata students come together to serve Covid patients, pay bills for those in dire straits||KOLKATA: If you think all board students are traumatized these days and worried over their future, you may be wrong. Some of these students are working round the clock, in between tuitions and revising their Plus II syllabi, to help Covid patients. Several students of various city schools are part of an initiative to resource oxygen, medicines, delivering food and essentials and organising blood and plasma donations for Covid patients. They are also raising money to pay hospital bills of those who are in dire straits. Teenagers Anumit Lahiri, Arth Agarwal, due to appear for their Plus II board exams this year, and 21-year-old Arjama Bakshi of Jadavpur University, have set up the Calcutta Anti-Covid Belt Initiative. “It’s a crucial year for us, but I find it difficult to turn a blind eye and a deaf ear to the catastrophe around us and it is my humble plea to all that they do the same,” said Lahiri, due to appear for Class 12 finals from DPS New Town. As coronavirus cases continue to rise in the city, these students have linked themselves to around 500 volunteers, who are housebound like them, to network and collaborate with like-minded NGOs. “The volunteers call up people and network to help Covid patients and their families,” said Bakshi. In their list of beneficiaries was an Ola driver, whose hospital bills have been taken care of. Recently, they helped a student of Jogesh Chandra Chowdhury College, Arundhati Mukherjee, whose father was admitted to a nursing home with Covid and couldn’t pay his bills amounting to Rs 5 lakh. “We circulated a video message by Mukherjee and managed to raise Rs 2.1lakh,” said Bakshi. “The pandemic has been an eye-opener in more ways than one,” said technology professional, Amit Sahai, who contributed to this crowdfunding. “Between online classes, preparing for our board exams and networking for our Covid help group, sometimes we barely sleep for more than five hours a day,” Agarwal said, adding, “Since school is off at the moment, we have been scheduling shifts around our tuition classes.” They tried to split members into teams, based on the type of help there were entrusted with, for the Covid patients. “But this is such an unusual situation that it is not possible to be as organized as one would like to be,” said Bakshi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-students-come-together-to-serve-cov-patients-pay-bills-for-those-in-dire-straits/articleshow/82642580.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

The full-fledged commercial rollout of the vaccine is expected only by mid-June, said top officials of Dr Reddy’s, the Indian partner of Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which has developed the vaccine. The Rs 995 price includes 5% GST. For those keen on taking the jab, the imported doses will cost Rs 263 per dose higher as compared to the $10 (approx. Rs 732) per dose uniform global pricing. This is because of the import, logistics and distribution costs, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories’ CEO of branded markets (India & emerging markets) MV Ramana said. “The prices may come down once we start locally manufacturing the product,” he said, adding that the company expects to vaccinate around 125 million people in India over the next 8 to 12 months. At this pricing, for state governments, Sputnik V will cost over three times more than Covishield, which is priced at Rs 300 per dose and more than double the Rs 400 per dose price tag of Covaxin. However, in the private market, Sputnik will be cheaper than Covaxin (Rs 1,200 per dose) but one and a half times more expensive than Covishield. The first to get their hands on the Sputnik V will be residents of metros and tier-1 cities due to the storage temperature requirements of -18 degrees C of the vaccine. The plan is to initially roll out in 35 cities after which availability for the rest of the country will be scaled up later even as Dr Reddy’s is already working on generating additional stability data on the 2 to 8 degrees C range for the vaccine. Dr Reddy’s, which has a contract for distributing 125 million people equivalent doses (250 million doses of both the vectors of the vaccine) in India, expects only about 15-20% (around 36 million doses) of Sputnik doses to be imported from Russia with the rest being locally manufactured from July. “We have received the first 1.5 lakh doses on May 1 and we will steadily start ramping up (imports) over May and June. The initial lot was for us to test the supply chain across the private and government channel (states),” Ramana said. He said while Sputnik V will be an integral part of the government’s vaccination programmes, it will also serve the private channel by tying up with private hospitals as well as corporates. RDIF has tied up with five Indian manufacturers for churning out 852 million doses, which is enough to vaccinate 426 million people, while Dr Reddy’s has tied up with Bengaluru-based Shilpa Medicare for another 100 million-odd people equivalent doses. Deepak Sapra, CEO of API & services at Dr Reddy’s Labs, who was the first in India to receive the jab on Friday, said the company is also working with Indian regulators to figure out a path for bringing to India the single-dose Sputnik Light, which has a 79% efficacy after 28 days of taking the shot. The single-dose shot comprises just the first adenoviral vector component of the two-dose vaccine – Ad26. In Sputnik V the second vector Ad5 is administered 21 days after the first vector. Apart from India, Dr Reddy’s is also working with RDIF for launching Sputnik in few other markets where the company has a presence. However, officials did not divulge any further details.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/at-rs-995-a-shot-sputnik-v-vaccine-rolls-out-in-india/articleshow/82645453.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

A total of 46 vials were seized from the pharmacy they were running at a commercial complex on Thursday night. The accused have been identified as Shanmugam and his brother Ganesan of Gandhi Nagar in Kovilpatti. The 46 vials were seized in the raid that lasted close to 90 minutes. While the government is selling a set of six vials for Rs 1,565 per vial the miscreants involved in the racket bought it for Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000 per vial from pharmacies in Tirunelveli and Madurai. The duo sold it for Rs 20,000 per vial to private hospitals that were desperately in need of the drug. “By the time it reached the patient it goes up to Rs 50,000 per vial,”superintendent of police (SP) for Tuticorin S Jayakumar told TOI. Based on information provided by the duo, the Tuticorin district police are working along with Tirunelveli and Madurai city police to arrest those in the network. “The arrest of the two brothers was made based on a tip from an accused involved in the racket who was arrested at Chennai,” Jayakumar said. The duo ran a wholesale and retail pharmacy in a private complex on the Mettukaliamman Street near Kathiresan temple road in Kovilpatti. The place was searched by a team of police and health department officials led by Kovilpatti DSP P Kalaikathiravan and deputy director of health services for Kovilpatti health unit district on Thursday night. Police are in the process of preparing the list of doctors and hospitals that purchased or placed orders from the duo. Based on the alert by the Tuticorin police, the Tirunelveli city police detained a pharmacist for quizzing and seized remdesivir vials from him.  Since the pharmacy in Madurai that was named by the accused was closed, police were on the lookout for the culprits. Shanmugam and Ganesan were booked under sections for cheating and putting the life of a person under threat of the IPC and the Disaster Management Act. Police have warned that those engaged in stacking and selling the drug in the grey market will be booked under the Goondas Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/two-try-to-sell-remdesivir-vials-for-rs-20k-each-held/articleshow/82642545.cms||---

He was 56. Balamurugan was suffering from cancer. He had been under treatment in Thiruvananthapuram a couple of months ago. Balamurugan had undergone surgery in the food pipe and had difficulty in eating over the last two days. He tested positive for Covid-19 last month but later recovered after treatment at home and tested negative. Balamurugan is survived by his wife and a daughter who is studying in Class X. Panneerselvam, who was in Chennai, is flying to Madurai and will head to Periyakulam by road to take part in the final rites. Chief minister M K Stalin expressed condolences to Panneerselvam. Balamurugan was in news in 2018 when Panneerselvam got a special approval from the defence ministry and also paid Rs 14.91 lakh to the Indian Air Force (IAF) for airlifting him in an AN-32 from Madurai to Chennai on July 13 that year for an emergency medical treatment. Balamurugan, a farmer and dairy maintained a low profile and was not active in politics but for accompanying his brother occasionally. He is the second of the three younger brothers of Panneerselvam. DMK Theni north district secretary Thanga Tamil Selvan and DMK MLAs N Ramakrishnan, A Maharajan and K S Saravanakumar paid tributes to Balamurugan.

The 35-page report offered recommendations to the government based on its findings, including withdrawal of the 235 cases against nearly 400 people.  This was said to be the commission’s key recommendation as most people were finding it difficult to get a job due to their inability to get no-objection certificate from the police. The commission also made a few other recommendations including providing government jobs based on qualification to the kin of the victims. Sources said the interim report was prepared by the commission at least a year ago and it was mentioned before the division bench of the high court. Though the commission wrote to the public secretary to submit the report to the then government, there was no response from the AIADMK government. On Thursday, the CM’s office sought a status report on the probe, following which the interim report was submitted. In the 27 sittings conducted till April, the commission summoned 1,052 people and examined 719 of them and marked 1,126 documents. The 28th sitting was to be held from May 17 to 21 but was postponed due to the lockdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/tuticorin-firing-panel-files-interim-report/articleshow/82642571.cms||---

The Maratha Kranti Morcha demanded the state also file a review plea. The SC recently struck down the Maratha quota, terming it ‘unconstitutional’. Maratha Kranti Morcha convenor Virendra Pawar demanded the state set up a commission to prove backwardness of the community again and submit the report to the SC. Ashok Chavan, PWD minister and chairperson of the cabinet sub-committee for Maratha quota, said the Centre filed the review petition only after CM Uddhav Thackeray met the Governor. Former CM and opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis also reiterated the demand for the state to file a review plea. “MVA government is passing the buck.

---||Delhi||CPWD refuses to relax bidding norms for construction of first 3 Central Secretariat buildings along Rajpath||NEW DELHI: Citing that the first three Common Central Secretariat (CCS) buildings along Rajpath at a cost of over Rs 3,200 crore have to be constructed “within a short time-frame” of 24 months, the Central Public Works Department has turned down the request of half a dozen major construction companies to relax the bidding norms for greater competition. According to the minutes of the pre-bid meeting held for the CCS building project held on April 30, some of the potential bidders had also sought review of the timeline and a “realistic” target for completing the project, citing the “quantum and huge scope of work and current pandemic situation” and had said that the 24-months time-frame is very less. These construction firms had asked CPWD to consider a 24-month timeline for the first building, 30-month for the second and 36-month for the third one. But CPWD has also turned down this request, saying the project in its entirety has to be completed in 24 months. This first set of three CCS buildings is the third component of the Central Vista Redevelopment Project which will be bid out by the government. So far, the works for New Parliament Building and revamp of Rajpath costing around Rs 1,300 crore have been awarded. CPWD has also invited bids for hiring bleachers, a tiered seating arrangement for Republic Day, Independence Day and Beating the Retreat ceremonies costing Rs 282 crore. In response to relaxing the pre-qualification criteria, CPWD has said, “The pre-qualification criteria have been finalised considering the requirement for magnitude of work to be executed within short time-frame i.e. estimated cost of work at Rs 3,269 crore for construction to be completed in 24 months and to ensure that bidders have required experience in similar work, financial strength and adequate bidding capacity so that competitive offers from capable bidders is received.” The government has prepared a Master Plan with timelines for the Central Vista project and plans to take up construction of a new PM residence, Vice President’s Enclave, an Executive Enclave for SPG and 11 buildings including a huge conference centre in phases. As per the official timeline, revamp of Rajpath will be the first project to be completed by this year and the conference centre will be the last one, which will be completed by December 2026.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cpwd-refuses-to-relax-bidding-norms-for-construction-of-first-3-central-secretariat-buildings-along-rajpath/articleshow/82642590.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||Delhi||Nobel laureate Satyarthi’s NGO to the rescue of orphaned kids||New Delhi: Two children, aged 2 and 10 years, in Delhi’s Uttam Nagar recently lost their father while their homemaker mother has no source of income. A neighbour then made a call to Nobel laureate Kailash Satyarthi’s NGO, Bachpan Bachao Andolan. The child helpline number, 18001027222, which was shared on social media on April 29, has received 416 calls till May 12 from across the country. Of these, 65 calls were from Delhi. Most of the calls were related to help for children who had lost one or both parents, financial aid or dry rations. The helpline number has been functional since 2018. According to NGO, the highest number of calls during Covid-19 came from Uttar Pradesh (68), followed by Delhi. In the past fortnight, 11 calls in Delhi were requests for support of a child staying with a single parent and five for children who had lost both parents, while 15 were for information on Covid, adoption and financial assistance. A few calls were made for dry ration and medical care. “After a complaint is made, we first verify it and take it up with the child welfare committee. In cases related to a child with a single parent, we work on long-term sustainable projects and link them to pension and other schemes,” said an NGO official. In Uttam Nagar’s case, they are now verifying the facts. Dhananjay Tingal, its executive director, said, “We link the complaints to government agencies, including child welfare committees. The child should be at a safe place where food, shelter and medical care needs are taken care of.” After a spike in Covid-related deaths, many posts were circulated on social media seeking help for adoption of orphaned children. However, experts said the children could be adopted through the intervention of government agencies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/nobel-laureate-satyarthis-ngo-to-the-rescue-of-orphaned-kids/articleshow/82642633.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

The woman, identified as Boddu Naga Lakshmi, a YouTuber from Varikuntapadu village, donated Rs 15,000 to the Sood Foundation. “Donated Rs 15,000 to Sood Foundation & that’s her pension for 5 months. For me she’s the richest Indian. You don’t need eyesight to see someone’s pain. A True Hero. (sic)” the actor tweeted in recognition of her gesture. Naga Lakshmi was quick to post a video on YouTube to express her happiness at being mentioned in the actor’s tweet. “The fact that such a small village like Varikuntapadu gets a national mention makes me feel the happiest. I should thank my brother Adi Reddy and my sister-in-law Kavitha for bringing me out of despair and prove that even I could help people,” she said. Sood, who has helped thousands during the pandemic, holds a special connection with the Telugu community as he had started his career in Telugu film industry back in 2000. In 2020, after a video of a farmer’s daughters ploughing their land in Mahalrajuvari Palle village in Chittoor district went viral, Sood gifted the family a tractor.

---||Hyderabad||Spike in Covid deaths in Telangana started after April 2nd week||HYDERABAD: On April 10 this year, Telangana had reported just six Covid-19 deaths, while the cumulative death toll stood at 1,752. Within a span of one month (till May 10), 1,115 more people lost their lives to novel coronavirus. After the surge of positive cases began in the second wave, it was observed that more number of daily deaths occurred from the second week of April. It took six months to reach 1,000 deaths mark (September 17 in 2020) in the state after the first case was reported on March 2 last year. The initial 500 deaths occurred over 150 days or five months from March to July 31, 2020. However, health authorities argue that the death rate in Hyderabad as well as in the state is much better compared to other states. Apart from the second wave, the recent spike in Covid-19 deaths in Hyderabad is attributed to many critical patients coming from neighbouring states, especially Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, for treatment. “More than 100 vehicles carrying patients from AP are entering Hyderabad every day. Many beds in the private hospitals are occupied by patients not only from AP but other states also. This has added to the spike in the death toll in the city,” a senior health official said. On Thursday, director of public health Dr G Srinivasa Rao said 40%-45% of patients admitted in various hospitals in Hyderabad belong to other states. While detailed data on Covid-19 deaths is not available in the state, it is said that Hyderabad has a case fatality rate (CFR) of 1.02% at present. At a videoconference with officials of eight states on Wednesday, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan said Telangana’s overall CFR was at 0.55%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/spike-in-covid-deaths-in-state-started-after-april-2nd-week/articleshow/82644177.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Mumbai||Mumbai’s Jogeshwari hospital docs allege deaths due to O2 issues||Mumbai: Low oxygen pressure and a shortage of doctors may have contributed to deaths of several Covid patients at BMC-run HBT Trauma Care Hospital in Jogeshwari, medical officers from the facility have alleged. In a letter to the hospital’s medical superintendent Dr Pramod Nagarkar, they said insufficient supply to oxygen cylinders at the peak of the second wave created “emergency situation at all times” putting doctors under “tremendous stress”, reports Sumitra Deb Roy. They added that doctors from an outsourced agency tendered to run the ICUs would leave before their shift was over, “neglecting” patients on O2 and ventilator support and putting lives at risk. They also highlighted an “increase in mortality” in mid-April. However, Dr Nagarkar and a top official in BMC said the allegations stemmed from discontent engendered by internal conflicts. Barring a few days in mid-April, when the city faced oxygen shortage, the hospital never ran short and its “mortality rate is comparable to any other Covid hospital,” said Dr Nagarkar. Speaking to TOI, one of the doctors who made the allegation said life-support devices would constantly beep low oxygen alerts after patient load increased in April. “Three weeks ago, there was a night when we had three patients die in a span of hours following low pressure,” the doctor said. The casualties were in the 58-68 years age group. “All were on the Bipap (non-invasive ventilator) needing 70-80% support, but the screen flashed that they were getting only 40%-50%,” the doctor said. Last year, there were similar allegations of deaths in the hospital due to low oxygen pressure following which an oxygen generation plant was installed. The hospital’s original ICU bed capacity of 32 was augmented to nearly 45, but doctors say oxygen support did not rise proportionately, leading to drop in pressure. “Us working in ICUs wearing PPEs is all futile if we can’t save lives because of low oxygen,” one of the doctors said. The doctors claimed there have been over 213 deaths since March, including 145 in April alone. Hospital authorities have said there were 138 deaths since December. BMC does not release data on Covid-related fatalities from individual hospitals in Mumbai. The daily update is a compilation of the city’s overall casualty record. One doctor who worked at Jogeshwari even alleged that he has seen a handful of young patients dying though they did not have any co-morbidities and came with 5-6% lung damage; they deteriorated possibly due to sub-optimal oxygen support. “It’s not just an issue of low O2 pressure but also lack of manpower in the ICUs,” the doctor added. The hospital’s ICU was outsourced to Jeevan Jyot Trust in 2018. The agency is supposed to supply two doctors per shift for which BMC pays them Rs 1,800 per bed. Trauma doctors alleged that the trust has not provided adequate doctors or an intensivist, a charge that the trust’s spokesperson refuted. Superintendent Dr Nagarkar said the hospital did face a crisis from April 17-20 when all peripheral hospitals didn’t get oxygen supply. “Once that was sorted, there was no issue of oxygen crisis. The plant in the hospital generates 1,200 litres of oxygen per minute. In addition, we have 190 jumbo cylinders and 30 dura cylinders,” he said, adding that the complaints are being made by a few doctors who didn’t want to do their share of work. “The mortality rate is comparable to any other Covid hospital. There are some who probably don't want to share the blame and put it on so-called oxygen issues,” he said. A senior civic official said the allegations must be seen in the light of internal conflicts between the hospital’s medical officers and their higher-ups. “We have done a detailed check into these deaths but haven’t found any truth,” the official said. About the three deaths, the official said all had co-morbidities, including diabetes and Parkinsons, and were in a serious condition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbais-jogeshwari-hospital-docs-allege-deaths-due-to-o2-issues/articleshow/82645505.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Andhra Pradesh: YSRC rebel K Raghurama Krishnam Raju, Narsapuram MP held on sedition charges||VIJAYAWADA: Narsapuram MP from Andhra Pradesh and YSRC rebel K Raghurama Krishnam Raju was on Friday arrested by Andhra Pradesh CID on charges of sedition. CID officials said Raju had been ‘indulging in hate speeches against certain communities and promoting disaffection against the government’. Raju, who has openly rebelled against chief minister Jagan Mohan Reddy, was picked up on his 60th birthday from his house in Hyderabad’s gated community at Gachibowli amid high drama after around 20 CID sleuths reached his doorstep. A video showing heated arguments between the MP’s associates and CID sleuths went viral. CRPF personnel who are part of his Y category security surrounded him for protection. The MP has been booked under IPC sections 124A (sedition), 153A (promoting enmity between different groups), 505 (incite, any class or community of persons to commit any offence) read with 120B (criminal conspiracy). He was taken to the CID headquarters in Mangalagiri from Hyderabad. From alleging attacks on Hindu temples in Andhra Pradesh, to opposing introduction of English medium in government schools, to the alleged mismanagement of the current Covid crisis, Raju has been vociferous in his criticism of Jagan and the party for several months now. The arrest comes just weeks after he asked a special CBI special court in Hyderabad to cancel the bail granted to Jagan in a corruption case, also known as the ‘quid pro quo’ case. The case relates to allegations that Jagan’s father YS Rajasekhara Reddy, as chief minister of united Andhra Pradesh between 2004 and 2009, had done special favours to some companies. In return, the companies had invested in Jagan’s firms. The CID, however, said Raju was spreading disaffection. “A preliminary enquiry ordered by ADG CID PV Sunil Kumar found that through his speeches on regular basis Raju was indulging in systematic, schematic effort to cause tensions among the communities and by attacking various government dignitaries in a way which will cause loss of faith in the government which they represent,” the CID statement said. Raju’s son Bharat said CID officials didn’t even tell them the reason behind the arrest and took away the elected representative without issuing a warrant. “My father underwent a bypass surgery around four months ago. It was his birthday today. How can they just pick up an MP from a neighbouring state without even issuing a warrant?” Bharat asked. The CBI has also registered two cases against the Narsapuram MP on charges of defrauding banks and a loan default case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ysrc-rebel-mp-held-on-sedition-charges/articleshow/82645536.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti
---||Delhi||Help is just a call away: When men in khaki turn angels for Sr citizens||NEW DELHI: Last week a call from California, USA, kept sub-inspector Neeraj Kumar on his toes. A woman had phoned the station house officer of Prashant Vihar police station to say that her 82-year-old father, a resident of Rohini Sector 15, was in danger as his oxygen saturation level was continuously dropping. Without wasting time, Kumar rushed to arrange an oxygen cylinder for the senior citizen. When the old man’s condition worsened, Kumar arranged for an ambulance to ferry him to hospital, not forgetting to reserve a hospital bed in advance. Over the next few days, the police officer not only took care of the octogenarian but also kept his daughter informed over phone about the situation. Delhi Police, in its initiative to help senior citizens during the pandemic, has almost religiously interacted with such people, in many cases providing them with protective equipment such as face masks, hand sanitisers, gloves, etc. In some cases, some elderly citizens have also been given assistance in arranging for oxygen cylinders, in withdrawing cash from ATMs, provision of transport means to visit hospitals or vaccination centres and in securing admissions in hospitals. In another similar incident, the Bharat Nagar police station received information on April 20 around 3pm that Usha Rani, a 71-year-old woman who had tested positive for Covid and lived alone, needed to be admitted to a hospital. The SHO promptly sent some people to help her. Constable Harkesh arranged a vehicle for the woman and took her to Deep Chand Bandhu Hospital in the neighbourhood. “She was admitted to the hospital and her son who lives in Singapore was also informed,” said a senior police officer. The very next day, the personnel on duty at Alipur police station got engaged in a similar act of assistance. Constable Babu Lal helped 75-year-old Ratan Lal, a resident of Alipur, by taking him to a vaccination centre because the old man lived by himself. The constable not only arranged for a vehicle, but even accompanied Lal to Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute in Rohini, where the elderly man was administered the vaccine. The constable then accompanied the septuagenarian home. Senior police officers said that during the pandemic, the northern range has put in the best possible efforts among the police ranges in contacting senior citizens telephonically or through virtual meetings to address their grievances and make sure their needs are met. According to Delhi Police data, in the northern range alone, where as many as 6,885 senior citizens live, at least 9,000 phone calls have been made to the elderly population to enquire about their well-being and to redress any grievances they might have.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/help-is-just-a-call-away-when-men-in-khaki-turn-angels-for-sr-citizens/articleshow/82642834.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Hyderabad||Share Covid resources with us, Telangana tells neighbours||HYDERABAD: Director of public health (DPH) Dr G Srinivasa Rao on Friday said chief secretary Somesh Kumar has already written to the neighbouring states on permission granted to ambulances carrying Covid-19 patients with prior reservation of beds in Telangana. Assuring that patients who booked the beds will be treated without any hassles, the DPH said it would be better if the neighbouring states also share resources like Covid-19 injections and medicines with Telangana since the Centre is allocating them judiciously. The DPH said Telangana caters to patients of AP, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka and Maharashtra. “Adilabad RIMS has 50% of its Covid-19 patients from Maharashtra. The state-run Gandhi Hospital has several patients from AP undergoing treatment,” he said. Addressing a press conference here, Dr Rao said the Centre allocates medicines and injections on the basis of population and number of positive cases. “We had allocation of just 490 remdesivir injections and now it has been increased to 6,600. In the second wave, patients are needing prolonged treatment. Also, the state gets only 450 tonnes of oxygen from the Centre,” he said. Refuting criticism that Telangana is stopping ambulances, he said patients from other states can find out the bed position in various hospitals by observing the dashboard. “Once they secure a bed here, no one will stop them. Once they get an authorisation from the hospital, we are issuing medical e-pass which they can download digitally and show it to cops while entering Telangana,” he said. He said patients from other states are heading to Telangana without verifying the beds’ position here and making rounds to hospitals which could prove fatal. “We are trying to help them by offering an organised framework to book the beds,” he said. “On Friday, five patients from AP were permitted to enter hospitals here. Eighty per cent of oxygen and ICU beds are already filled in the state and among them, 40% of the patients are from other states,” he said. He said Maharashtra’s lockdown guidelines are stringent and prohibit entry of people from other states without a Covid-19 negative report.  “Similarly, Delhi imposed restrictions on people from AP and Telangana,” he added. The DPH said that 23 teams with members of health, police and other departments have been deputed in the border districts of Telangana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/share-covid-resources-with-us-telangana-tells-neighbours/articleshow/82644187.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The stations that will remain closed are Ambaturai, Madurai West Entry, Alwarthirunagari, Kachanavilai, Kallidaikurichi, Kurumbur, Metur, Kizhapuliyur, Pamban, Palayamkottai, Pettai, Ravanasamudram and Thathankulam. An official said that the decision has been taken due to the impact of the pandemic that has resulted in poor patronage at those stations and to ensure the safety of public and staff. He also hinted that a few more stations with less than 10 ticket applications in a day could be added to the list and that the deadline could also get extended based on the state government’s new restrictions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/number-of-daily-trains-to-south-comes-down-to-8/articleshow/82642699.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: RPF personnel arrested for smashing up 3 govt vehicles||Mumbai: A Railway Protection Force (RPF) head constable was arrested after he allegedly smashed up three government vehicles parked at Grant Road in a fit of rage in the early hours of Thursday. Vikram Sajjansingh, 39, claimed that he was furious after his leave application was cancelled at the last moment, but RPF officials said that he was, in fact, on leave when the incident occurred. A medical test showed Sajjansingh was not inebriated. “The reason for the act is not clear. A departmental inquiry will be instituted against him,” said senior divisional security commissioner, WR (RPF), Vineet Kharb. Sajjansingh has been suspended from duty. The incident occurred at the RPF barracks at Grant Road where Sajjansingh lived. According to Sajjansingh, he left early on Thursday for Bandra Terminus to board a long-distance train to his hometown in Madhya Pradesh. “He claims that he learnt about his leave application being cancelled last minute. Around 4am, he kicked on the Mahalaxmi stationmaster’s office door several times. He then returned to the barracks furious. Around 6am, he picked up a stick and smashed up the windows, beacons, headlights and taillights of an Eicher, Innova and Etios parked in the compound,” said senior inspector Pradeep Salunke, Churchgate GRP. Staffers rushed outside to see what the commotion was. An FIR was registered against Sajjansingh for damaging government property, intimidation and using abusive language. On Friday, he was produced before a holiday court which granted him bail. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rpf-personnel-arrested-for-smashing-up-3-govt-vehicles/articleshow/82645597.cms||---

Fatalities, at 695, were 20% down from the 850 deaths on Thursday. For the second day in a row, cases in Mumbai stayed below 2,000. Friday’s 1,660 tally was the lowest in 63 days. The last time the city saw fewer cases was on March 12 (1,647). Deaths though remained high at 62 for the city. The state’s case tally rose to 53 lakh and the total fatalities touched 79,552, inching towards the 80,000 mark. Mumbai’s tally is 6.8 lakh and the overall death count 14,102. In a major lapse, as many as 141 Covid deaths that occurred in April in Beed district were officially added to the central database after a month. Beed district health officer Radhakrishna Pawar on Friday said: “The data in question was not submitted to ICMR in time. We have pulled up the staff concerned for the major lapse. There was no intention of hiding the deaths.” A considerable number of these deaths have been reported from the state-run hospital at Ambajogai that was in the news recently over the deaths of Covid patients allegedly due to poor supply of oxygen. With the latest addition, the total number of Covid casualties has reached 1,337 in Beed district. Even Solapur district reported 72 deaths on Friday, which officials said were old deaths and were added to Friday’s tally. In Mumbai, hospitals said regular and even oxygen beds are freeing up but the demand for ICU beds remains high. Dr Balkrishna Adsul, dean of SevenHills Hospital, said admissions have halved compared to April, when there would be 200-220 admissions daily. “But the out and inflow of ICU patients is the same. Most are referrals from private hospitals who come here after exhausting their funds. One worrying sign has been deaths in young people. We are seeing deaths in them after staying in hospital for 2-3 weeks,” he added. On a positive note, state authorities said the positivity rate is on a steady decline. On Friday, the state conducted 2.5 lakh tests in the last 24 hours taking the positivity rate to 15.9%, down from 22% last week. In Mumbai, the daily positivity rate has been between 7-8%. The state has also been discharging more people than daily detections, leading to a dip in active cases. The state discharged 53,249 patients, taking the total discharges to 47 lakh. The active cases in the state have dipped to 5.1 lakh, of which 35,843 are in Mumbai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-citys-1660-cases-lowest-in-63-days-state-tally-under-40k-deaths-still-high/articleshow/82644190.cms||Bhavika Jain

---||India||National panel to track impact of vaccination to be set up soon||NEW DELHI: A national tracking platform will be established soon to determine the impact of the jabs against Covid-19 and the breakthrough infections that are likely to occur among those with complete and partial immunisation, official sources said. The recommendation of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) to establish such a platform has been accepted by the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 and the Union health ministry, they said. The vaccine tracker will be particularly important to monitor the impact of increasing the dosing schedule of Covishield, he said, as the government on Thursday accepted the working group’s recommendation to extend the gap between the two doses of the Covishield vaccine from six-eight weeks to 12-16 weeks. The current data harmonisation work of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and other agencies can be leveraged to set up this facility for review of ground realities on real-time basis, the NTAGI has recommended. The government panel has also recommended that pregnant women may be offered the choice to take any of the vaccines and that lactating women can be inoculated any time after delivery. The NTAGI has also stated that those having laboratory test proven SARS-CoV-2 illness should defer Covid-19 vaccination for six months after recovery, the sources said. The NTAGI recommended that all pregnant women visiting for antenatal care may be informed about risks and benefits of Covishield and Covaxin. In case of individuals who have received the first dose and before completion of the dosing schedule if they test positive, they should wait for four-eight weeks after clinical recovery from the illness.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/national-panel-to-track-impact-of-vaccination-to-be-set-up-soon/articleshow/82648554.cms||---

But his acts of kindness now show he has a heart of gold too. The 27-year-old Hyderabadi had batted through the pain barrier to draw the Sydney Test against Australia in the recently concluded series. Now, he is making good use of his social media reach to help those fighting Covid-19. The Andhra Ranji captain, who is currently in England, has created a team of 100 volunteers, comprising friends and followers from Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka. Together, they reach out to people in need of plasma, oxygen cylinders, food and hospital beds. Vihari’s Twitter account has been abuzz with Covid-19 patients and their kin seeking help at all hours. The team responds quickly. “Thank you Hanu Vihari garu.. Golden heart.. responded in midnight too..” said one grateful beneficiary. From helping a Covid-hit priest’s family pay hospital bills to reaching out to a quarantined family get food, Vihari’s initiative has grown manifold. So also his resolve. “I don't want to glorify myself. I am doing it with the intention of helping people at the ground level, who actually need every help possible in these difficult times. It is just the start,” Vihari told PTI on Friday. He is shocked by the magnitude of the crisis and the struggle for hospital beds. “With the second wave being so strong, getting a bed has become difficult. So, I decided to use my followers as my volunteers and help as many people as I can,” said Vihari who has 1,10,000 followers on Twitter. “My goal is to mainly reach out to people who are not able to afford or arrange for plasma, beds and essential medicine. I would like to do more service in the future,” added Vihari. Andhra medium-pacer Prithvi Raj Yerra is a part of Vihari’s team of volunteers and is all praise for his captain. “Being an international cricketer, Vihari is using his network of friends and supporters in extending support to Covid-19 patients,” Prithvi told TOI from Visakhapatnam on Friday. “The WhatsApp group he created with 100 members includes members from the medical fraternity. Despite being in England, Vihari is on the job 24x7 as he gets calls from various parts of the country — New Delhi, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. We are doing our bit to help,” Prithvi, who represented Kolkata Knight Riders and Sunrisers Hyderabad in IPL, added. Vihari will join the Indian team when they arrive in England on June 3 for the World Test Championship final against New Zealand beginning June 18. That, though, is far from Vihari’s mind as he puts his heart and soul into saving lives.

According to the annual statement released on Friday, the port’s operating surplus was Rs 322.6 crore against Rs 328.7 crore in 2019-20. The net surplus after tax was Rs 113.7 crore against Rs 135.2 crore in the previous financial year. Cargo traffic handled by the port dropped to 31.8 million tonnes against 36.1 million tonnes the previous year, registering an 11.9% decrease.

---||Mumbai||Fuel prices in Mumbai touch record highs, diesel crosses Rs 90-mark||MUMBAI: Fuel prices are at an all-time high in Mumbai, with diesel breaching the Rs 90-mark. With several hikes totalling Rs 24 in the past 13 months, diesel was retailed at Rs 90.11 a litre and petrol at Rs 98.65 in the city. Petrol and diesel prices were hiked by 29 paise and 36 paise per litre, respectively In neighbouring Thane and Navi Mumbai too, petrol and diesel prices reached a record high of Rs 98.77 and Rs 90.23 a litre. Five districts across Maharashtra have petrol prices over Rs 100 per litre even as political parties, including Shiv Sena and NCP, are opposing the fuel hikes by the Centre. Amravati has the highest diesel rate in the state at Rs 91.57, while Parbhani has the highest petrol rate at Rs 101.02 a litre. The rise in diesel rate could push up freight costs and directly impact prices of essential commodities, like vegetables and fruits. It could also increase the rates of all FMCGs, white goods, cement and steel, said transporters. Transporters said businesses have become unviable due to the increase in operational costs and small-time transporters are hit the hardest. “We are petitioning the central and state governments to intervene and reduce VAT and taxes on fuel,” said a transporter, adding that if prices were not controlled, it would prove to be a death knell for the road transport sector and the 20 crore people associated with the trade. Petrol Dealers’ Association secretary Chetan Modi said diesel had broken all records this year—it was at an all-time high in January-February before prices dipped and now it has crossed the Rs 90-mark. “Though many diesel-run vehicles are still off roads, including school buses and tourist vehicles, we still see a significant number of transport vehicles refuelling at our pumps daily,” he said. Transport experts said that increase in diesel prices could deter people from buying polluting cars and SUVs. “Citizens should be encouraged to opt for electric or CNG vehicles,” said Ajit Shenoy of Mumbai Mobility Forum.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-fuel-prices-in-city-touch-record-highs-diesel-crosses-rs-90-mark/articleshow/82645669.cms||Somit Sen

Sources close to the development said that the number of patients has doubled in five days, prompting the authorities to add another ward to accommodate new patients. “As on Friday evening, we have 298 patients admitted for mucormycosis. Due to increase in cases, we have dedicated six wards on fourth floor of the 1,200-bed Covid hospital for the fungal infection,” said Dr J P Modi, medical superintendent of Civil Hospital. “We have patients from across Gujarat and even from states such as Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh.” Officials said that about 20% of the patients admitted are from Ahmedabad city. Civil Hospital officials said that the primary reason for the rush is scarce medical supply. “Patients are hoping to get uninterrupted supply of medication which is now getting scarce by the day. The treatment is long and expensive. It could also be the reason for many patients from across the state and beyond to come to the hospital,” said a senior official. “The patients need six shots of injection daily for 21 days. Majority of the patients who have come from other cities and towns were operated elsewhere and got admitted here to address long-term implications.” Sources close to development said that the hospital is running operation theatres for patients round the clock. “We are performing about 20-22 operations daily for mucormycosis patients – which averages about one operation every hour. One surgery however doesn’t solve the problem as patients need multiple procedures,” said ENT surgeon,||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/mucormycosis-patients-make-beeline-for-civil-hospital/articleshow/82642801.cms||Parth Shastri

Reacting to the opposition’s attacks against the government for going ahead with the two projects, sources said the parties, mainly Congress, were spreading false propaganda about Central Vista of which the under-construction projects were small parts, being developed at a cost of barely Rs 1,300 crore. “MLAs bungalows in Mumbai are being constructed for Rs 900 crore whereas the new Parliament building and the Central Vista avenue together will cost Rs 1,300 crore,” an official said. Besides, tenders for the two projects were awarded in pre-Covid times, the official said. The remaining projects under Central Vista redevelopment will be taken up later as the entire project has to be completed over an extended period. Sources said over 400 workers were deployed at the two project sites where Covid-19 protocol is being complied with strictly. A senior functionary said the opposition was demanding to stop the Central Vista project, which in reality had not even started. Congress’s criticism was premised on the party’s think-tank AICC Research Department, which had made hypothetical observations about the project, the official said. He added that the actual cost of the project would be clear only after tenders were awarded but initial assessment was that the whole Central Vista, comprising 13 buildings including a centralised secretariat, bungalows for the prime minister and the vice president, would cost approximately Rs 17,000 crore. The project, which is estimated to be completed by 2026, is being executed by the housing and urban affairs ministry. Several opposition parties recently wrote a letter to PM Narendra Modi asking him to start free vaccination for all and stop the Central Vista project. Urban development minister Hardeep Singh Puri has defended the project. “Congress’s discourse on Central Vista is bizarre. Cost of Central Vista is about Rs 20,000 crore, over several years. GoI has allocated nearly twice that amount for vaccination. India’s healthcare budget for just this year was over Rs 3 lakh crore. We know our priorities,” he had tweeted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/winter-session-next-year-will-be-in-new-parliament-building-say-govt-officials/articleshow/82642864.cms||Akhilesh Kumar Singh

The doctor has prescribed 150 vials to be given over a period of two weeks. Patel’s attempts to procure medicine for his cousin haven’t been successful. “We tried everywhere, from government hospitals to pharmacies. We have been told that this medicine is not available,” said Patel. His cousin was last month treated for Covid-19 where he was administered remdesivir injections as part of treatment.There are scores of people who are struggling to get drugs for treatment of mucormycosis, the mortality rate of which is very high. Patel says he lost a close friend, a filmmaker, recently after he was diagnosed with mucormycosis. A senior executive working for a leading real estate company said he faced a similar challenge two days ago when a friend required liposomal amphotericin. “We tried everywhere, including the collector’s office, but were told the medicine is not available. We had to return empty-handed,” the executive said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amdavadis-struggle-due-to-drug-shortage/articleshow/82642863.cms||---
---||Pune||Covishield interval increase to help 45+ group get 1st shot||PUNE: The increase in the interval between two Covishield doses to 12-16 weeks is likely to work to the advantage of beneficiaries aged 45 years and above currently scrambling to get their first shots, state public health authorities told TOI on Friday. Since the citizens, whose Covishield inoculation began from March, will now be due for the second shot only around May last week or later, the (Covishield) first doses would be more readily available for the 45+ category till then, officials said. The state has been giving preference to those due for second doses following the shortage of vaccines. But as the number of beneficiaries who were earlier due for Covishield second doses has now decreased because of the change in guidelines, this would automatically mean that the first-time beneficiaries could access more Covishield doses that are at the state’s disposal, an official said. This only applies to Covishield, as there is no change in the interval of Covaxin vaccine doses. The officials also said it would now not be possible for citizens (who had received the Covishield first shot) to avail of online appointments or onsite walk-ins before they complete 84 days (12 weeks) after their first dose. However, those who have already booked appointments for the second doses will be given the shots even if the Covishield two-dose interval is less than 84 days. “Suitable changes on Co-WIN are being made,” an official said. “Vaccination for citizens above the age of 45 years (60+ and 45+ with comorbidities) was started from March 1. They would be due for the second doses from May last week as per the revised guidelines. Healthcare and frontline workers who were inoculated during the earlier phases of the drive will primarily be eligible to receive the second Covishield shots during the ongoing period, provided they have completed 84 days (12 weeks) after the first dose,” said Dr Archana Patil, director (family welfare), directorate of health services. She added that this effectively meant that once the healthcare and frontline workers, and those with confirmed appointments till now, got their second shots, the remaining quota would be used for those who want first doses among the 45+ age group. “This naturally means that those seeking first doses will now have more vaccine availability,” said Dr Patil. Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said, “Till Friday, confirmed appointments and walk-ins of Covishield beneficiaries seeking second shots (as per the earlier due date) were being honoured. But this system will stop from Saturday, when only those who have completed 12 weeks or more can get the Covishield second shots. This will automatically lead to exclusion of 3/4th of beneficiaries from the ongoing vaccination drive, as their due date has shifted to May last week or beyond.” Suitable changes were being made on Co-WIN reflecting the increase in the minimum period between first and second dose of Covishield from the earlier 42 days to 84 days. These changes were made effective from midnight of May 14.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/covishield-interval-increase-to-help-45-group-get-1st-shot/articleshow/82642817.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Pune||‘State will ensure no one misses out on jabs’||Pune: The state government would ensure that no one misses out on vaccination, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said on Friday. Speaking to TOI, he admitted that vaccine shortage was an issue, but said that once doses become available, the state government would ensure that no one was left out. He was responding to a question on door-to-door vaccination during an interaction with media persons. He stressed that the state government would make all efforts to ensure that all beneficiaries were vaccinated. “Whether it is to start more vaccination centres or to make any arrangement to reach out to the people, we will ensure that all efforts are made to ensure that no one is left out,” the deputy chief minister said following a review meeting of Pune district. Asked when the vaccine doses would arrive in the state, he said that they were in touch with the Centre constantly for the supply. “There is a meeting of collectors and commissioners with the Prime Minister next week along with state ministers and we will again place the demand for speeding up the supply for 45 plus age group,” he said. Pawar said the civic body does not need permission from the state government to float tenders to procure vaccines. Ganesh Bidkar, leader of the house in PMC, had approached him for permission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/state-will-ensure-no-one-misses-out-on-jabs/articleshow/82642856.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Goa||Citizens irked over refusal to dispose off Covid bodies||Margao: Refusal to allow cremation/burial of bodies of Covid-19 victims by the management committees of some crematoriums and burial grounds has irked conscientious citizens. Dr Anthony Rodrigues, who had petitioned the Goa Human Rights Commission in 2012 over a similar issue, said such instances were in violation of the commission’s ruling delivered in November 2017. “Disposal of bodies is the responsibility of the state. The Goa Municipalities Act and the Goa Panchayat Raj Act mandates that local bodies take responsibility of disposal of the bodies. Moreover, there should be no discrimination over their faith,” Rodrigues said. Referring to the GHRC’s order, in a recent letter, the department of urban development has directed all municipalities “to take appropriate steps” to provide burial grounds and crematoriums in all municipal areas. The department’s additional director, Clen Madeira, in the same letter, has ordered municiplaities “to take urgent steps to ensure that burial grounds are made available to all persons in your respective municipal areas.” “We recommend that the director of municipal administration and the director of panchayats shall take urgent steps to ensure that crematorium grounds and burial grounds are made available to all persons in the respective municipal areas and village panchayat areas so that the basic human rights of all persons are protected,” the GHRC had said while disposing the petition. The Margao Municipal Council (MMC) had then told the GHRC of how its plans of providing burial space for persons professing different faiths were scuttled owing to the delay in the proposed kabrastan at Sonsoddo. The MMC had pointed out that “within this land that was supposed to be developed for the purpose of kabrastan, a part of it was reserved as a burial ground for such persons who were from different faiths.” “(The) Council has all good intentions to comply with the directions of the GHRC and the moment the work of kabrastan is taken up, adequate care would be taken to ensure that a decent burial ground, having an area of 1,000 sqm is also developed by us,” the action taken report of MMC filed before GHRC had stated. The situation has since remained unchanged. The MMC acquired 31,000 sqm of land at Sonsoddo for a kabrastan in May 2011. Though the work of construction of the kabrastan was sanctioned by the state government in November 2011 at an estimated cost of Rs 2 crore, for various reasons the work never took off. Nevertheless, the Mathagramasth Hindu Sabha, Margao, which manages the Hindu crematorium at Pajifond, Margao, has come to the aid of the authorities by making available several pyres for cremating bodies of Covid victims, which take place between 5pm and 6 pm. Cremation of unclaimed bodies, which is undertaken by the Margao municipality, also takes place at the Pajifond crematorium.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/citizens-irked-over-refusal-to-dispose-off-covid-bodies/articleshow/82644243.cms||---

The Centre has to ensure that there is enough vaccines for the committed group and for the state to carry out the vaccination for 18-44 years, state officials said.Hospitals refusing fire audit to face actionDeputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said there are reports of hospitals not allowing officials from the administration to conduct the fire audit.

Later, he got admitted at SL Raheja Hospital in Mahim, where he will be undergoing surgery on Saturday. His condition is stable. Around 3.30am, constable Shankar Magar (35) was on nakabandi duty on the Western Express Highway when he signalled the speeding biker to halt. Though Sahil Shaikh (18) applied the brake, he was unable to control his bike and dashed into Magar. Other policemen rushed Magar to a private hospital nearby, but they refused admission saying he did not have a negative RT-PCR test. He was then taken to S L Raheja Hospital. Kherwadi senior police inspector Sanjay Nikumbe said that they are verifying if Shaikh owns the bike and has a driving licence. Shaikh has booked under IPC sections 279 (rash driving), 337 (endangering life) and under the Motor Vehicle Act.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Rotary Club and Sainik Farm RWA tie up to donate plasma||NEW DELHI: Convalescent plasma therapy, in which antibody-strong plasma from a Covid-recovered donor is injected into a patient, is being widely used in Delhi to treat critical individuals. But plasma hasn’t been easy to collect and use. The residents’ welfare association at Sainik Farms, despairing about being unable to arrange plasma for those at the local Covid care facility despite those who recovered there having frequently donated plasma, have now tied up with Rotary Club Blood Bank in Tughlakabad. Hardeep Singh, president, Western Avenue RWA at Sainik Farms, explained, “Rotary Club will take two units of plasma from a donor recommended by us and determined fit to be donor. In return, the bank will keep half the collected units to help patients associated with our Covid care facility or others suggested by us.” The Covid care centre at Sainik Farms is among the first started in the city last year. It began operations in June 2020 with the approval of the local administration. The area councillors also helped arrange space at an SDMC primary school in Pushp Vihar III. It started as a 50-bedded facility, and today 100 beds with adequate arrangements like oxygen cylinders and oxygen concentrators. Mindful of the plasma scarcity in the city, the RWA members had, with foresight, started making a list of people recovering at the Covid centre last year and later approaching them to donate plasma voluntarily. “But we realised that when we needed plasma for our residents or patients, it wasn’t easy,” claimed Ratan Kohli, treasurer of RWA. To resolve the issue, RWA decided to tie up with the Rotary Club. The donating and allied processes there can be completed in an hour and a half. “In hospitals, it was taking our members/donors four to five hours to complete the process. There were also instances when hospitals would ask them to come on another day to finish the process,” said Rajiv Bhasin, who recently donated plasma. “This motivated many residents of area also to come forward and donate plasma to the Rotary Club.” This year, the RWA has recommended 12 donors to Rotary Club and three to private hospitals. Besides, five members of the RWA who had earlier tested positive have registered themselves to donate plasma. The RWA is also running a campaign in the area and on social media for recovered patients to donate leftover medicines so a medicines bank can be created to assist needy people. “We have been updating the list after checking the condition/expiry date of the medicines collected,” revealed Tanya Singh Bhalla. “We have been getting numerous requests for medicines from people living in nearby areas.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rotary-club-and-sainik-farm-rwa-tie-up-to-donate-plasma/articleshow/82642873.cms||Vibha Sharma

An advice has been issued to focus on administering the first dose to the 45-plus age group and healthcare and frontline workers due for the second dose,” Deshmukh said. Deshmukh said the increased gap would help them speed up vaccination of the remaining 2.3 lakh senior citizens of the estimated 10 lakh in the district. “The vaccine availability will improve only after the third week of May, when we are hoping for streamlined supply of doses. Until then, we will now focus on the first dose to 45-plus age group,” he said. On the vaccination of the 18-44-year age group, he said it would not be considered until the vaccine supply was streamlined.The Pune Municipal Corporation stated only 15 vaccination sites would function on Saturdayand Covaxin would be administered for the 45-plus age group. “Those beneficiaries from 45-plus age group, who have taken the first dose before April 16, will be eligible for the second shot,” said a statement from the PMC.The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation stated that eight of its vaccination centres would offer the first and second doses of Covishield to the 45-plus age group on Saturday. For the second dose, the beneficiary should have completed at least 12 weeks, after their first dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/over-4-lakh-senior-citizens-have-time-till-july-for-2nd-jab-due-to-tweak-in-dose-gap/articleshow/82642869.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Pune||Political leaders demand scrapping of token system at vaccination sites||Pune: Leaders from all political parties have demanded that undue interference of local leaders at vaccination centres should be curtailed.A delegation of all political party leaders raised the issue at a meeting with deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Friday. They demanded that no parallel system should be set up to give priority to people favoured by local leaders. The token system in the vaccination drive, introduced by political leaders, should be scrapped.There have been numerous complaints from citizens that local political leaders gave tokens to people, so they could get vaccinated ahead of common citizens, who have booked appointment slots through the CoWIN app. In some cases, citizens with prior appointments had to return empty-handed because of the token system, thus rendering a CoWIN registration useless.“After meeting the delegation, I have given instructions to district and civic authorities to look into the matter. They will take necessary steps for better coordination at vaccination centres,” said Pawar. He added that some leaders have started a token system in rural areas to ensure that vaccines are available to villagers.Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) data states nearly 120 vaccination sites are operating across its areas, while 60 sites are on under Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC). Rural areas have nearly 80 vaccination centres.Congress leader in PMC Aba Bagul said that manpower available with local leaders should be used properly. “Political or social workers can help tide over the manpower crunch and help beneficiaries get the vaccine. At the same time, the platform should not be used to gain political mileage,” he said.BJP leader Sandeep Khardekar claimed there was minimal political interference at vaccination centres and it was not hampering the overall drive. “Steps like introducing separate vaccination centres for beneficiaries will help. Dedicated centres should be set up for senior citizens and to avail the second shot,” he said.(With inputs from Piyush Bhusari)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/political-leaders-demand-scrapping-of-token-system-at-vaccination-sites/articleshow/82642876.cms||---

---||Delhi||Gang that sold Covid drugs in black busted||New Delhi: Delhi Police’s Crime Branch has made multiple arrests, including that of a Mewat-based gang’s kingpin and employees of a pharmaceutical firm in Dwarka, in connection with blackmarketing of Covid-19 related materials and duping people. The accused from Mewat has been identified as Imran who had been duping people on the pretext of providing them oxygen concentrators, oxygen cylinders, etc. According to joint commissioner (crime) Shibesh Singh, the accused was arrested from Bharatpur in Rajasthan. Five mobile phones used in crimes were seized from him. “The accused has cheated over 100 people till date and six recent cases registered in Delhi have been linked to him so far,” Singh added. Imran and his associate used to cheat people on the pretext of selling cars or motorcycles on websites like Olx and others. During the pandemic, they started targeting those in need of medical equipment and drugs. They had recently cheated a Moti Bagh resident of Rs 36,500 and a Rajouri Garden family of 73,000 promising to deliver oxygen cylinders. The latter’s entire family was positive and in serious condition. Five members of a racket indulging in blackmarketing of Remdesivir have also been arrested. The arrested men have been identified as Kaushal Mishra, Ankit Jatan, Kanksh Choudhary, Abhishek Rai and Utkarsh. “Five 100 mg Remdesivir injections, two cars and five mobile phones used in the crime have been seized. The accused persons were illegally selling Remdesivir injections for Rs 50,000 in open market and have sold more than 100 injections so far in Delhi, Haryana, Chandigarh and Rajasthan after procuring the same from their source in Chandigarh,” joint CP Singh said. The kingpin, Ashok Tiwari, is absconding. Tiwari, cops said, was running a pharmaceutical company from Avison Tower in Kakrola area and had an office at Krishna Tower, sector-12, Dwarka. Meanwhile, a man named Dheeraj Jangid has been arrested for duping people by using online Covid SOS messages. “The accused was nabbed from Rajasthan. He had cheated a woman of Rs 13,000 on the pretext of selling an oxygen cylinder for her mother,” said DCP (southeast district) RP Meena.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: No vax yet, but MBBS interns put on Covid duty||Mumbai: MBBS interns in many colleges who have been put on Covid duty after the Centre announced the same have been working with patients without being vaccinated. Private and deemed universities said letters to the state government for vaccines met with no response. On Thursday, a senior private sector officer tagged the CM’s office, environment minister and health minister about a “human tragedy” waiting to happen as MBBS interns of Vikhe Patil Medical College were working in the hospital but not vaccinated. A representative of parents of medical students, Sudha Shenoy told TOI, “Many students were preparing and then taking their exam and thought they’d take the vaccine later, but could not.” College dean confirmed that students are yet to be vaccinated but have been assigned non-Covid duty. “We’ve deposited money for the vaccines for students with the Ahmednagar collector. Also, cases in Ahmednagar are declining and we have enough staff for Covid duty. We do not need interns for that,” said dean Dr Sunil Mhaske. Similar concerns were raised by students of MIMER, Pune. “Vaccinating interns should have been the first thing on the mind.... Why won’t health care systems collapse with such attitude of the government,” said a parent Ruiee Kapoor. A senior staff member of MIMER said internship began two weeks ago and letters were written to the state government to get vaccines. “We haven’t yet got vaccines. When we do, our priority is to immunise interns and students” he said. At Topiwala National Medical College, dean Dr Ramesh Bharmal said most interns who opted for vaccination were administered it and others too would be covered gradually.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-vax-yet-but-mbbs-interns-put-on-covid-duty/articleshow/82645768.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Shutdown steals jewellery business worth Rs 500 crore||AHMEDABAD: Restrictions on the retail trade imposed to curb the Covid spread have cast a shadow on gold sales on Akshaya Tritiya. Estimates of India Bullion and Jewellers’ Association (IBJA) suggest that gold and jewellery business worth at least Rs 500 crore was wiped out in Gujarat as the retail business is under a shutdown through the Akshaya Tritiya week. Such days are considered auspicious for gold purchases and also for weddings and therefore, gold sale usually remains buoyant on those occasions. “Weddings are getting cancelled due to the second wave of Covid. That has hit the fresh demand for jewellery,” said Haresh Acharya, director, IBJA. “Festive muhurats often boost gold and jewellery sales but the shutdown on such days has wiped out the business entirely.” Acharya said that minimum of 1 tonne of gold is traded across the state through the Akshaya Tritiya week, driven by wedding and muhurat purchases. “The second lockdown in various parts of the country has hit the wealth and income of people drastically,” Acharya said. “This will lead to a very slow revival in the demand.” Gold trading is shut in Ahmedabad and several parts of Gujarat due to the ongoing curbs. Gold price (computed based on import costs) stood at Rs 49,500 per 10 gram on Friday, according to bullion traders. “The only saving grace for the jewellery business is that those who had placed orders in advance have not cancelled,” said Manoj Soni, an Ahmedabad jeweller. “Even though they have deferred weddings, they would invest in jewellery at some point and most have retained the orders.” Little or no sale on festive muhurats has impacted the employment and revenues in the gems and jewellery sector. Chinubhai Choksi, president, Shree Manek Chowk Choksi Mahajan, said: “Gold artisans are in a miserable state as job work has reduced drastically.” Choksi added: “With this shutdown and no fresh orders, artisans are left without work. We have paid them for April and May but this won’t sustain for long if fresh orders don’t pour in.” Some jewellers however, did receive orders over call from their regular clients but the volumes were low. “We got orders mainly for coins for muhurat purchases from some of our clients,” said Jigar Soni, president, Jewellers’ Association of Ahmedabad. “We have promised delivery and will take payments only at a later stage. This is nowhere close to the volume of business we do during Akshaya Tritiya.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/shutdown-steals-jewellery-biz-worth-rs-500-crore/articleshow/82642884.cms||Niyati Parikh

A couple of photographs went viral in which the mayor was seen standing without mask with a couple of other people who also had donned no mask. The officials said the photographs had been taken at the inauguration of a medical shop in Naroda. AMC officials claimed that the mayor had slipped off the mask to pose for the photographs. When contacted, the mayor said, “I have always been a strong follower of the rules. I removed the mask only while the photographs were taken. I did it on the request of the shop owner. Check the footage of Jaganath temple where I performed pooja in the morning and then a party meeting that I attended in Khanpur. I always had my mask on.” However, some officials in the AMC and even some of the councillors questioned if AMC solid waste department would fine the mayor for not wearing the mask. In the past, the department had fined former standing committee chairman Amul Bhatt, AMC and AUDA officials for not wearing masks even though the officials were inside their vehicles. Former mayor Bijal Patel too had come in for criticism for not wearing masks on a couple of occasions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/why-are-you-not-wearing-a-mask-mr-mayor/articleshow/82642907.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Rush at clinics as people make a dash for 2nd shot||KOLKATA: Serpentine queues were seen in front of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation-run vaccination centres across the city on Friday as people queued up to get the second jab of Covishield before these centres shut their doors to the recipients of second doses to adhere to a Union health ministry guideline issued on Thursday. Subodh Ghosh, a consultant chemist and a resident of Garia, was seen happily coming out of a KMC-run vaccination centre at Atabagan in Garia. “I stood in a queue in front of the vaccination centre at 5am. There was a ray of hope as a civic staff informed us that they will administer a second dose of Covishield till stocks last. I was finally given the jab at 1pm. It was a matter of great satisfaction as I would have narrowly missed the second dose had the KMC decided to defer the same to follow a guideline from the Centre,” Dasgupta said. Rajesh Purohit, a resident of Girish Park and a septuagenarian, however, was not as lucky as Ghosh. Purohit had reached a KMC-run vaccination centre near his home in the early morning and stood in a long queue hoping that he would be accommodated. However, as the day progressed, a civic staff announced closure of the centre. Gupta was just behind seven others. “Now I need to wait for another month to get my second dose,” Purohit said. While those who could reach these centres in time were administered the second Covishield dose, others, who were late, were denied. According to a KMC medical officer posted at a vaccination centre at Tollygunge, majority of the centres in and around Tollygunge had little stock of Covishield for the second dose recipients. “We decided to go ahead with our second dose Covishield vaccination programme before it gets suspended for another 28 days. However, we didn’t have the requisite stock to meet the demand of a large number of recipients,” he told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rush-at-clinics-as-people-make-a-dash-for-2nd-shot/articleshow/82642953.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Delhi||Renowned gynaecologist S K Bhandari passes away||New Delhi: Dr S K Bhandari played an instrumental role in setting up the obstetrics and gynaecology department at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. The 86-year-old doctor, who served the hospital for 58 years, passed away on Thursday. She had heart problems and had tested positive for Covid-19 after having received both doses of the Covid vaccine. In Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, Dr U C Biswal, 70, a retired professor who earlier headed the surgery department, also succumbed to Covid. He too had taken both doses of the vaccine. Dr D S Rana, medical director and chairperson of Sir Ganga Ram, told TOI, “Dr Bhandari joined the hospital in 1962. Even in her 80s, she was the most sought-after gynaecologist. In 1989, she was the chairperson of the hospital’s managing board.” Rana said that Bhandari had heart issues last year but had continued working. In recent months, her heart had been a cause of concern. Rana said that when she was hospitalised for her heart ailment two weeks ago, she tested positive for Covid. “Her husband, J S Bhandari, 97, a retired IAS officer, is also undergoing treatment for Covid-induced pneumonia,” said Rana. “The couple has a daughter, Ritika Bhandari, also a well-known doctor. Dr Bhandari’s death is a great loss for society and the medical fraternity.” Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi expressed her grief on Twitter, saying, “Dr S K Bhandari, emeritus consultant, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, who delivered my brother, me, my son and my daughter, passed away today. Even in her late seventies, she would drive early morning to the hospital herself. A leader to the end, she upheld every noble trait of humanity. A woman I will always respect and admire, a friend I will always miss.” Covid also claimed Dr Biswal early on May 13. RML director and medical superintendent Rana A K Singh, who worked with Biswal for around 16 years, testified, “He was a gifted surgeon and one of the best laparoscopic surgeons around. He was a thorough professional who treated junior doctors as kin and his students as his own children. Even after retiring, Dr Biswal was working as a professor at North Delhi Municipal Corporation’s medical college till February.” Singh disclosed that during the 2005 terrorist bomb blasts in the capital, Biswal was present in the hospital day and night. “None of the victims who were directly brought to the hospital died,” Singh claimed. “He made sure everyone was on the job and saved so many lives. I remember two patients referred to our hospital from another facility late at night were the only people to lose their lives. Dr Biswal monitored all patients all night and then returned again in the morning to check on them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/renowned-gynaecologist-s-k-bhandari-passes-away/articleshow/82642916.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Madurai||MP urges Centre to grant approval to import drug||Virudhunagar: Virudhunagar Congress MP, B Manickam Tagore has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging the central government to grant approval to the states for direct import of remdesivir medicine from Bangladesh by waiving the GST for import. In a letter, Tagore stated that the country is struggling with the increase of cases during the second wave of Covid-19 and hospitals are reeling with the shortage of medical oxygen and beds. Once the patients are admitted, doctors are prescribing remdesivir to combat the intensiveness of the infection. This has led to abnormalities in the purchase of this medicine. The non-availability of this important medicine is the reason for patients going into serious conditions and an increase in the number of deaths everyday in the country. Tagore stated that despite the production of remdesivir by seven Indian companies, there is a shortage across the country.

The minister participated in a review meeting with the officials at the Madurai collectorate on Friday to discuss Covid-19 containment measures in the district. Addressing mediapersons, Subramanian said that government and private hospitals have requested the government to provide additional beds, oxygen and medicine supply. He said that at present, Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) is equipped with 1,681 beds of which 1,176 beds have oxygen support. Since people from the surrounding districts are coming to GRH, a zero delay ward has been set up with additional 150 beds and oxygen support. This ward would pave the way to provide immediate medical attention to the patients. This apart, steps are being taken to set up 500 beds with oxygen support at the government hospital for thoracic medicine campus at Thoppur, and the facility would be put to use within a week. He said that remdesivir is being sold in five districts including Madurai for the past few days. Due to the increase in demand, chief minister M K Stalin had urged the central government to provide 20,000 medicines to Tamil Nadu. He warned of legal action against those selling remdesivir in the black market. Subramanian inaugurated the zero delay ward at GRH. The minister also inspected the Covid care centres and containment zones in Madurai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-will-get-more-remdesivir-minister/articleshow/82642921.cms||---

The letter has sparked an outrage among the medical fraternity and the civil society. The letter by the society’s chairman has pointed out that doctors and nurses treating Covid patients were residing in the flats without giving any intimation to the society, “thereby violating the society’s bylaws”. The letter has pointed out that society members have raised objections to these doctors and nurses residing in the building fearing spread of infection to other residents, and requested they be stopped from staying in the complex during the pandemic time. The copy of the letter has also been marked to the South Goa collector, health authorities and police. The medical fraternity has taken serious note of the objections raised by the housing society. South Goa collector Ruchika Katyal said that attempts would be made to make the society members see reason. “We shall counsel them and get the matter resolved. If need be, we shall initiate action as per law,” Katyal told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/housing-society-objects-to-covid-doctors-nurses-in-building/articleshow/82644341.cms||---

An ACB release stated that the former deputy director of land records amassed movable and immovable assets worth Rs88.85lakh, which was disproportionate to his known source of income calculated for his service tenure between 1989-90 and March 2019. This include properties acquired in his and in the names of his relatives in Pune, Mumbai, Akola and Amravati, the release added. An ACB officer said, “The former deputy director’s total income from known sources, including his salary, ancestral properties etc. is worth Rs2.15 crore. However, during the inquiry we found assets worth Rs88.85 lakh in excess of this known source of income. Some of the properties are in the name of his wife. Hence, she has been named in the FIR relating to DA case.” ACB has invoked charges under section 13 (1) (b) (accept any gratification) and 13 (2) (public servant criminal misconduct) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, and 109 of the IPC.

The FIR lodged by an executive engineer on January 15, 2021, said around 5.50am, officers of CRPF and the airport informed him Dinesh Gawande, a sub-engineer, was demanding Rs 4,000 from each passenger to allow them home quarantine instead of institutional quarantine. He got Rs 4,000 each from four passengers. The security officials recovered Rs 1.4 lakh along with 200 notes of Saudi riyals, rubber stamps of two doctors and Tata Memorial Hospital letterhead. Justice Surendra Tavade accepted that there is “crucial material” against Gawande and prima facie his involvement is established from the chargesheet. But he allowed bail, noting the probe is over, chargesheet has been filed, and since Gawande was operated on his leg before his arrest, he needs medical care, and “as there is no possibility of early hearing in near future”.

All tehsil health officers, medical superintendents and heads of primary health care centres (PHCs) have been given instructions to this effect during a video conference on Thursday.”Citizens at multiple locations, particularly in remote areas of Velhe, Bhor, Ambegaon, Khed and Junnar tehsils, are unable to book their vaccination slots due to poor mobile/telecom network. Further, some citizens are not familiar with the process to register for the vaccination. They must stand in queues for a long time to get vaccinated themselves, explained a ZP official.Dr BB Gadve, tehsil health officer at Khed, said, “Currently, we are administering the second vaccine dose to beneficiaries aged above 45 years on priority.

This is the second time in the last few days that the doctors have called off their strike after holding a dialogue with the state government. Gujarat Medical Teachers Association and GMERS Faculty Association who had called the protests, announced that most of their 11 pending demands have been fulfilled and that the government has given them positive assurance for the remaining ones in their latest round of talks with them. According to sources the medical faculty members had to come down half way to shake hands with the government after they were told of facing dire consequences for going on strike at a time when the state was badly hit by Covid-19 pandemic. “The members of GTMA and GMERS Faculty Association had to arrive at a compromising state where the government agreed to fulfil most, if not all, their demands,” said an official aware of the development. The meeting was held between faculty members and Pradeepsinh Jadeja, minister of state for home along with senior officials of the health and education department. Deputy chief minister Nitin Patel who also holds the health portfolio was conspicuous by his absence. GMERS Nurses Association has also agreed to withdraw its protest their meeting with the state government on Friday, according to a media statement by the government.

---||Nashik||Drug to treat black fungus in short supply in Nashik||.Nashik: Doctors treating rising cases of black fungus or mucormycosis in Nashik are grappling with a shortage of an essential anti-fungal drug to treat the infection. Several patients who have recovered from Covid have caught the infection, which which can prove fatal if not treated in time. The availability of anti-fungal drug Liposomal Amphotericin B to treat patients with mucormycosis has been scarce. The state government has announced free treatment of patients with mucormycosis in hospitals empanelled under its insurance scheme. It has also decided to purchase the drug and make it available to hospitals. Nashik guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal told TOI that availability of the drug has become an issue not only in Nashik but in the entire country. Nashik will get fresh supply of the drug within the next few days. “I had raised the issue during the last cabinet meeting. The feedback we got is that the Centre has started controlling the distribution of the drug. Maharashtra government has written to the Centre to provide adequate quota of the drug so that it can be distributed among various districts, including Nashik,” he said. On Bhujbal’s instructions, the district administration has formed a task force headed by district civil surgeon Ashok Thorat to look into all issues related to mucormycosis. “I have directed the task force to immediately establish seven special operating theatres for Covid patients affected by mucormycosis,” Bhujbal added. Nashik city chemist and druggist association president Rajendra Dhamane said the demand for the drug has suddenly spiked in the city. “This antifungal injection was never in demand in Nashik, not even during the first Covid wave. Hence, drug stores never bought it in large numbers. However, from the last month or so, the demand has been gradually rising but pharma firms are unable to supply the drug,” said pharmacist Dhaval Dinani, adding that the situation is similar to the remdesivir shortage. A member of the district task force on mucormycosis and leading ENT surgeon of Nashik, Dr Pushkar Lele, admitted there was a shortage of the drug. “I estimate Nashik would require at least 1,200 vials a day in the near future as an increasing number of mucormycosis cases are being detected in the district. The treatment protocol entails that one patient has to be administered around 50 to 100 injections over a period of 15 days depending on the severity of the infection,” he said. Lele said mucormycosis is emerging as a bigger problem after Covid-19. “It’s a notorious infection and can be fatal. Symptoms include swelling over eyelids, pain in the cheeks and nasal blockage. In the last one month, I have performed 3-4 surgeries a day on patients with this infection,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/drug-to-treat-black-fungus-in-short-supply-in-nashik/articleshow/82638918.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

---||Amritsar||Bathinda: Look at prices, PM kisan scheme of Rs 6,000 a year miniscule, says Farmers||BATHINDA: Farmers protesting for over seven months to demand the repeal of agriculture marketing laws have asked farmers from across the country to compare the miniscule monetary benefit of Rs 6,000 a year under PM Kisan Nidhi Yojana to the rising prices of diesel, fertilisers and pesticides in the recent past. Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, which is spearheading the protest, described the Centre’s much-touted scheme as one that did not dignify farmers, whatever spin the government might want to give to it and its name. “What farmers need is a legal guarantee to a remunerative MSP for all commodities that they produce. That will give them dignity for their efforts,” stated SKM in reply to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speech at the time of disbursing direct benefit transfer on Friday. Protesters also termed the move to highlight the scheme by the government as just an effort to deflect attention from real issues, mainly the sustained struggle. They have stated if PM Narendra Modi government was so concerned for the welfare of farmers, why had it not agreed to repeal farm laws. They said the increase in minimum support price (MSP) for paddy had been recommended at Rs 72 per quintal Under PM Kisan, Rs 6,000 per annum os directly transferred into the bank accounts of farmers in three instalments of Rs 2,000 each. Nearly 10 crore farmers benefit from the scheme. The eigthth instalment was credited to the accounts of beneficiary farmers on Friday. “See where the prices of diesel, fertilisers and pesticides are heading and the benefit under PM Kisan will be seen standing nowhere to provide any solace. Even the increase in minimum support price (MSP) for paddy has been recommended by only Rs 72 per quintal, which again pushes the farmers of getting no benefit in reality,” said farm organisation BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokri Kalan. “The increase in the input cost of crops has severely affected the earning of small and marginal farmers. Under such circumstances, the meagre amount of Rs 500 a month failed to provide any relief. Farmers will be happier if prices of farm-related items are kept under check or cash assistance to farmers is considerably enhanced, only then farmers could reap the benefits. Otherwise, the scheme under prevailing circumstances does not have much relevance,” said farm organisation BKU (Ekta Dakaunda) vice-president Manjit Singh Dhaner. SKM added: “It is very ironical to see the PM have a scripted and orchestrated conversation with some farmers while shying away from re-initiating a dialogue with the large farmers’ movement. The last round of talks was held nearly 4 months ago on January 22. The PM did not have the courage to even allude to the current protests in his show today.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/farmers-say-look-at-the-prices-pm-kisan-scheme-of-rs-6k-a-year-miniscule/articleshow/82652339.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Pune||Rural police bust bogus call centre in Lonavla, 15 held||Pune: The ,Pune rural police on Thursday raided a bungalow in Lonavla and busted a gang of 15 persons found operating an illegal call centre facility targetting US citizens by issuing threats of tax evasion punishment. The police also found ‘ganja’ plants on the premises of the bungalow. “The suspects were operating from a rented bungalow in Waksai in Lonavla from July last year. They would accept money from the US citizens in dollars. They would purchase bitcoins and then used to convert it to Indian currency,” inspector of the local crime branch Padmakar Ghanwat told TOI. The police have recovered six laptops, five desktops, 15 smartphones, two cars and a scooter, all collectively worth Rs15.8 lakh from the 15 suspects. Ghanwat told TOI that all the 15 suspects were from Mumbai, Thane and Badlapur. All their education qualifications were 12th-pass. After watching a web series based on cyber criminals, they decided to earn money by conning people.  “In July last year, the supsects had taken a bungalow at Indrayani Society in Waksai on rent for Rs40,000 per month. They would stay there between Monday and Friday and target US citizens,” Ghanwat said. Ghanwat added that the suspects had practised and recorded an audio clip, which they would play after contacting their target.  “They never conversed with their targets,” Ghanwat said. He said that the suspects had used the names of American agencies extensively while issuing the threats to the US citizens. “They forced US citizens to pay amounts ranging from $500 to $1,000 by threatening them with severe punishment if caught for evading taxes,” Ghanwat said. He said that every day at least one or two US citizens would fall prey to them and send the money. “We are yet to find out the number of US citizens duped by the gang. The suspects have deleted their data. We are in the process of recovering it,” Ghanwat said. During the raid, the police also found ‘ganja’ plants on the premises of the bungalow. “The value of the plants was worth Rs6,000,” Ghanwat said. The suspects have been arrested under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), Information Technology (IT) Act and the NDPS Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rural-police-bust-bogus-call-centre-in-lonavla-15-held/articleshow/82642936.cms||---

---||Pune||RTO’s online option brings cheer this Akshay Tritiya||Pune: The Pune regional transport office’s online registration option made available a few days ago ensured 257 vehicle (70 two-wheelers and 187 cars) registrations during the week leading to Akshay Tritiya. Last year, not a single registration was recorded on the auspicious day due to the nationwide lockdown. Officials in the Pimpri Chinchwad RTO office said they were still compiling the numbers. “Last year, there were no registrations on the Akshay Tritiya due to the lockdown. This time too, the situation is almost similar and no fresh registrations are happening. However, on Wednesday, the transport department provided permission for an online registration option for private vehicles. The vehicles vehicles that were registered were booked earlier by people but couldn’t be registered due to the restrictions. The online registration of commercial vehicles has been on for some time now,” a Pune RTO official told TOI. The official said it could have been a complete washout, just like last year, had the RTO didn’t open the online facility on time for private vehicles. Even with showrooms closed, the trend of online bookings of private vehicles has picked up. “People are booking their vehicles online by visiting the websites of the manufacturers. Though a number cannot be given out right now, people are choosing to book vehicles of their choice so that they can pay and take delivery once the showrooms open for business,” another RTO official said. A Kondhwa resident, who did not wish to be named, said he had recently registered his vehicle online. “I went to the website of a two-wheeler company and chose a bike after registering myself. I received a call from their representative the next day who took down my details and connected me to the nearest showroom. I have booked the vehicle and will pay the amount once the showroom reopens,” he said. An RTO official said the online registration involved dealers sharing the vehicle’s chassis number, picture of the vehicle with other documents via e-mail with the RTO office. “The vehicle is then registered by the RTO without physical verification. This system is expected to remain in place till the restrictions are on,” the official said. A Dhayari resident said it was the best option to book vehicles now as there is uncertainty on when the showrooms will open. “Though the cases have come down, the administration is taking cautious steps and is unlikely to open the markets as yet,” the resident said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rtos-online-option-brings-cheer-this-akshay-tritiya/articleshow/82642932.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Chennai||Overcrowded Puzhal prison sparks fears of a Covid-19 cluster||Chennai: The death of a Puzhal prison inmate of post Covid complications on Thursday has sparked fears of a possible cluster as the city jail remains overcrowded. While the block for remand prisoners is crammed with 2,000 inmates against a capacity of 1,250, that for convicts too is overflowing. More than a week since the Supreme Court advised states to decongest jails by sending inmates on pandemic-time parole, Tamil Nadu is yet to consider the suggestion. In Chennai alone, 50-60 prisoners are escorted to courts daily for trial or remand extension. On Tuesday, law minister S Raghupathi visited the Puzhal prison and reviewed the arrangements director (prisons) director Sunil Kumar Singh and inspector general of police (in charge) Murugesan. The minister examined the kitchen, fuel refilling station and the superintendent’s office.Sunil Kumar Singh said no one is admitted directly to the prison. “They are sent to sub-jails after taking swabs for a Covid-19 test. Those testing positive are sent to the government hospital.”On an average, 250-275 prisoners from sub-jails in Saidapet, Tiruvallur, Madurantakam, Ponneri, Kancheepuram and Poonamallee are admitted to the remand wing at Puzhal every Saturday. But, activists say there are no checks for the 500 police personnel who act as escorts – for every prisoner.An official said at least five prisoners including Sri Lankan national Madhukula Suryah were admitted to the Government Stanley Medical College and Hospital. While Suryah died after recovery, two prisoners remain at the hospital and the others have returned to Puzhal. The prison official said 250-300 prisoners were being taken to the various courts every day before the lockdown came into effect on May 10. While this has come down to an average of 50-60 prisoners a day, S Karthikeyan, a lawyer practising at the Madras high court, said prison officials should bring in a mechanism to check police personnel escorting the prisoners. The remand wing, which comprises a quarantine block, two high-security blocks, a prison hospital and one for ‘A’ class prisoners, can house 1,250 people but now has about 2,000 prisoners.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/overcrowded-puzhal-prison-sparks-fears-of-a-covid-19-cluster/articleshow/82648591.cms||---
---||Chennai||Hotels open doors to asymptomatic patients||Chennai: Days after the Greater Chennai Corporation made an announcement allowing hospitals and hotels to start private Covid-19 care centres (CCCs), the Tamil Nadu Clinical Establishments Act (TNCEA), and the directorate of medical and rural health services (DMS) gave a go-ahead to private medical practitioners to do the same. Several doctors and hospitals have since joined hands with well-known hotel chains in the state to accommodate asymptomatic patients or those with milder symptoms.The move comes as an attempt to ease the strain on the demand for ICU beds and oxygen that hospitals across the state are buckling under, with many patients stationed inside ambulances.Earlier this week, Dr Thineshchandar Andiappan, orthopaedic surgeon, Dr Lavanya Rajaraman, paediatrician and Dr Roshan Santosham, pulmonologist, signed an MoU with a hotel in T Nagar to start a CCC with 35 beds, and basic facilities for supportive and palliative care for Covid patients. The meals will be provided by the hotel’s F&B staff, they said.“A large number of patients admitted with Covid-19 don’t need hospitalisation. Those under the age of 65, with oxygen saturation levels above 90 and temperature below 102, can be treated with basic drugs like steroids, antibiotics, antiviral drugs and a backup for oxygen support – if needed. This is the category of people we are taking in,” says Dr Thineshchandar. “The idea of the CCC is to offer a quarantine facility outside of home,” he says.Dr S G Balamurugan, chairperson of Guru Multispecialty Hospital in Madurai, recently joined hands with Poppys Hotel, to open a CCC with 65 beds. “We have 103 beds inside the hospital for Covid care, but with an exploding caseload, we decided to open a CCC at Poppys to treat patients with milder symptoms,” he says. “Doctors and nurses are available 24x7 at the centre, and if a patient's health deteriorates, they can be moved to the hospital easily.” As per guidelines, CCCs can be established inside hostels and private buildings, with adherence to government protocol, for up to 60 days without registration, to treat moderately ill patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/hotels-open-doors-to-asymptomatic-patients/articleshow/82648597.cms||---
---||Delhi||Covid-Crisis: Delhi Cabinet nod to Rs 5k aid for autorickshaw, taxi drivers||New Delhi: The Delhi cabinet on Friday approved a financial assistance of Rs 5,000 to drivers of auto rickshaws, taxi, e-rickshaw and other paratransit vehicles. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had announced on May 4 that the Delhi government will provide a one-time financial assistance the way it did during the national lockdown last year. The government said in a statement that total Rs 78 crore was given as financial assistance to more than 1.5 lakh auto rickshaw and taxi drivers in 2020. These beneficiaries not need reapply. They will get Rs 5,000 directly transferred to their Aadhar-linked bank accounts. All individuals holding Public Service Badge (Drivers) of paratransit vehicles and permit holders of paratransit public service vehicles are eligible for the assistance being provided in the wake of the current Covid crisis. Transport minister Kailash Gahlot said that the government was doing everything it could to ensure the impact of the lockdown, especially on the daily wage labourers, auto rickshaw and taxi drivers, was kept to a minimum. “Transport modes, especially autos, are the lifeline of Delhi, and I request everyone, who is eligible, to avail of this assistance. Everyone who knows an eligible paratransit driver should help them apply and reach out to us for any assistance,” he said. Apart from taxi, auto rickshaw and e-rickshaw drivers, total 2.8 lakh PSV Badge holders and 1.9 lakh permit holders of phatphat sewa, eco-friendly sewa, gramin sewa, maxi cabs, etc are also eligible for the scheme. Those beneficiaries, who did not get financial assistance last year because of any reason, will have to apply again. The link to apply will become functional within a few days on the Delhi transport department’s website. The benefit will not be extended to companies owning fleets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-crisis-delhi-cabinet-nod-to-rs-5k-aid-for-autorickshaw-taxi-drivers/articleshow/82642952.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Chandigarh||Battle lines are drawn in Congress, but chief minister’s baiters remain divided||JALANDHAR: Though battle lines are drawn between chief minister Amarinder Singh and MLA Navjot Singh Sidhu and discontentment is brewing within Punjab Congress, the biggest relief for the chief minister is that his opponents are not yet united. Though many Congress leaders have expressed dissatisfaction with the way things have happened in sacrilege and police firing cases — and a known CM baiter and Rajya Sabha member Shamsher Singh Dullo has expressed even more bitterness — yet, they have also maintained distance from one another. The only exception is a meeting with Sidhu at Panchkula a few days ago in which two minsters — Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and Charanjit Singh Channi — and around half dozen MLAs also participated but things have not moved forward beyond that. In the last over two weeks, seven ministers and nearly half dozen MLAs have come out openly in support of the CM and have attacked Sidhu. CM’s camp even managed a string of statements from four ministers. It is learnt that most of the MLAs are ambivalent in their stand and are obviously ‘waiting and watching’. Sources in the Congress have revealed that these are not just issues of competitiveness among a few leaders, but also of trust deficit. “The episode of 2019, when MLAs tried to group themselves to put pressure on chief minster to deliver on sacrilege and police firing cases in last week of August and first week of September 2019, which was diffused by the CM by appointing six of them as his advisors, caused a lot of trust deficit among the MLAs. They are much apprehensive about the electoral prospects. It is now this element of apprehension that can force them to sink their differences,” said a Congress MLA. “High command is remaining silent and Sidhu is not yet opening his mind or even accessibility though he has been mounting his attack on the CM consistently with no signs of relenting.

---||Ludhiana||Battle lines are drawn in Congress, but chief minister’s baiters remain divided||JALANDHAR: Though battle lines are drawn between chief minister Amarinder Singh and MLA Navjot Singh Sidhu and discontentment is brewing within Punjab Congress, the biggest relief for the chief minister is that his opponents are not yet united. Though many Congress leaders have expressed dissatisfaction with the way things have happened in sacrilege and police firing cases — and a known CM baiter and Rajya Sabha member Shamsher Singh Dullo has expressed even more bitterness — yet, they have also maintained distance from one another. The only exception is a meeting with Sidhu at Panchkula a few days ago in which two minsters — Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and Charanjit Singh Channi — and around half dozen MLAs also participated but things have not moved forward beyond that. In the last over two weeks, seven ministers and nearly half dozen MLAs have come out openly in support of the CM and have attacked Sidhu. CM’s camp even managed a string of statements from four ministers. It is learnt that most of the MLAs are ambivalent in their stand and are obviously ‘waiting and watching’. Sources in the Congress have revealed that these are not just issues of competitiveness among a few leaders, but also of trust deficit. “The episode of 2019, when MLAs tried to group themselves to put pressure on chief minster to deliver on sacrilege and police firing cases in last week of August and first week of September 2019, which was diffused by the CM by appointing six of them as his advisors, caused a lot of trust deficit among the MLAs. They are much apprehensive about the electoral prospects. It is now this element of apprehension that can force them to sink their differences,” said a Congress MLA. “High command is remaining silent and Sidhu is not yet opening his mind or even accessibility though he has been mounting his attack on the CM consistently with no signs of relenting. These are the other factors that are keeping MLAs from taking any sides,” said another MLA, himself is a fence sitter. Sources in Congress revealed that MLAs are keeping their options open and are waiting for high command intervention.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/battle-lines-are-drawn-in-cong-but-cms-baiters-remain-divided/articleshow/82652488.cms||IP Singh

The numbers have reduced primarily because of the restrictions imposed by the AMC and the state government.” The letter says that the AHNA’s stand is not to provide any relaxations till the new cases are reduced drastically and reach the mid-February levels when the daily tally hovered around 250-270 cases. “Any relaxation in these measures will mean an increase in the number of cases, leading to a huge burden on the healthcare infrastructure. Even today, the availability of ICU beds with ventilators is a major challenge,” said an AHNA official. The official added that the need of the hour is to ensure measures that can impact business minimally but inculcate Covid-appropriate behaviour among citizens.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/relaxations-in-curfew-curbs-not-advisable-ahna-to-cm/articleshow/82642943.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: ‘Government should take over private hospitals’||PANAJI: With Goa Medical College (GMC) being overburdened with Covid patients, the BJP core committee on Friday urged chief minister Pramod Sawant to take over private hospitals to increase bed capacity. A senior core committee member said that the decision to take over private hospitals for Covid patients is left up to the government. The BJP core committee had a nearly two-hour-long discussion on Covid management. Sawant said that he has briefed the core committee about the steps taken by the state government over Covid management. The senior member said that it has come to the notice of BJP that private hospitals treat Covid patients in the initial stage and shift them to GMC when they turn critical, which places an additional load on the hospital’s infrastructure. Another senior core committee member said that as per government information, GMC is a 250-bed hospital, but has more than 600 Covid patients admitted. Another senior member said that if, in Mumbai, a single order by the municipal commissioner allowed the state to take over all private hospitals to treat Covid patients, why then could the Goa government not do the same. “They will get an additional around 400 beds,” the member said. The state government can pay the doctors as per the fees prescribed by the Centre for treating Covid patients, the member added. The core committee also requested the CM to speed up the vaccination drive in the state. Core committee also requested the chief minister to speed testing and results. As of now at least three days are required to get the covid test report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-should-take-over-pvt-hospitals/articleshow/82644504.cms||---

---||Chennai||Adyar zone volunteers collect patient database||Chennai: The volunteers at the Greater Chennai corporation's Adyar zone, which reports about 700 fresh covid cases every day, are a busy lot as they are not just following up on patients but are maintaining an entire database of the information collected. The tele-counselling centre that was started on Thursday is working meticulously collecting all the information and filling it up in the dashboard. The dashboard consists of information such the symptoms that the patients reported, whether they were supplied with medical kits, yellow bags for garbage disposal, whether the focus volunteers are visiting them and helping them, whether family members are isolated and are well and so on. Brainchild of S Rajagopal, regional deputy commissioner, south, this tele-counselling centre model will be replicated in all the zonens, said Gagandeep Singh Bedi, Greater Chennai Corporation commissioner. There are 14 wards in the Adyar zone and a volunteer team of 24 that works in two shifts makes these calls every day. Rajagopal said that they will increase the number of calls made to 1,000 in the coming days. “We were asked to open zonal level tele-counselling centre where we follow up on patients in home isolation. But I wanted to do it in a professional manner so that we are able to get proper feedback on the measures implemented on the ground. For instance, on Thursday alone about 225 calls were made and out of them at least 85% of them said the focus volunteers had visited them and about 80% said they received the medicine kits. Some of the major complaints of the people is that yellow bags for waste collection has not been provided. About 65% said they didn't get any yellow bags. This information helped us improve the service and we ensured they got the bags,” he said.“This call centre will also help people find a bed, give medical assistance. We have framed a set of questions that include whether volunteers visit them regularly, are they buying essentials and groceries for them, whether their houses are being disinfected daily,” Rajagopal said. This model is very impressive and I have asked all the zonal officials to replicate it in their zones, said Gagandeep Singh Bedi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/adyar-zone-volunteers-collect-patient-database/articleshow/82648600.cms||---

Denying that the farmers’ protest turned into a super spreader, they said they were taking adequate precautions to prevent such a scenario and asked the government to identify the real causes for the spread of Covid. They also advised the government to maximise treatment capabilities. Of late, the farmers’ protest is being seen as one of the factors behind the spread of Covid-19. After Haryana home Minister Anil Vij asked farmers to vacate protest sites to curb the spread, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar also said that the protest was aggravating the situation in Haryana’s rural areas. Addressing farmers on Friday while providing the eighth instalment of PM Kisan Samman Nidhi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi advised people in the hinterland to be vigilant against Covid. However, he did not directly mention the farmers’ protest. Farm leader Balbir Singh Rajewal said farmers were “unnecessarily being blamed” for the spread of Covid, which they were not responsible for. “The government must look for real reasons for the spread and stop blaming farmers for its failure to provide remedial measures like beds, oxygen, ventilators, vaccines,” he said. He added that farmers would not vacate protest sites but voiced his apprehension of the government using force to get them to evict. Farm leader Gurnam Singh Charuni also denied that the farm protest was responsible for the surge in Covid cases and said that BJP was blaming farmers for its failure. “Can the farmers be held responsible for spreading Covid in hotspots of the country in Maharashtra, Gujrat, UP and so on?” he asked.

---||India||Monsoon to hit Kerala a day early on May 31||NEW DELHI: The onset of southwest monsoon over Kerala is likely to be on May 31, a day earlier than its normal date, with a model error of ± 4 days, the India Meteorological Department said on Friday. The normal onset date falls on June 1 with standard deviation of seven days. The IMD has been issuing operational forecasts for the date of monsoon onset Kerala from 2005 onwards. It claimed that the operational forecasts of the date of monsoon onset over Kerala during the past 16 years (2005-2020) were proved to be correct except in 2015. In the Indian monsoon region, initial rains are experienced over south Andaman Sea and the monsoon winds then advance north-westwards across the Bay of Bengal. According to the new normal dates of monsoon onset/progress, the southwest monsoon advances over Andaman Sea around May 22. This year, the monsoon advance over Andaman and Nicobar is likely around May 21.“Past data suggest that there is no association of the date of monsoon advance over the Andaman sea either with the date of monsoon onset over Kerala or with seasonal monsoon rainfall over India,” the IMD said. The IMD had last month predicted overall ‘normal’ monsoon rainfall in the country during the June-September period. It had said the monsoon seasonal rainfall was likely to be 98% of the Long Period Average (LPA) with a model error of +/- 5%. The LPA of the season rainfall over the country as a whole for the period 1961-2010 is 88 cm. The rainfall to an extent of 96-104% of the LPA is considered ‘normal’. The IMD will come out with the monsoon probabilistic forecast for June in the last week of this month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/monsoon-to-hit-kerala-a-day-early-on-may-31/articleshow/82648602.cms||---

However, now with them asking us to take appointments, it is getting very difficult to find a slot. We have several jobs already assigned to us,” she said. Shiv Sena former corporator Abhishek Ghosalkar said it was wrong to not allow frontline workers to come in directly and take the vaccine. “They have been working tirelessly in this fight against Covid and should be given priority,” he said. Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer said around 10,000 to 15,000 frontliners have not taken the second dose. “Most should have taken second doses by now since we started vaccinating frontliners on February 3,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-frontliners-too-facing-hard-time-getting-second-jab/articleshow/82644496.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Many in coastal areas like Chellanam had to leave their homes on Friday due to the severe coastal erosion. The disaster management authority had announced a red alert in the district on Friday and the alert for Saturday is orange. “Water logging was reported from Mullassery Canal Road, Karikkamury, Kaloor substation, Panampally Nagar, etc. High power motor would be used to pump out the water.

Though the fire force evacuated many families to camps, some refused to move to the camps. At the camp at Chellanam, St Mary’s high school, two families, including 3 men, three women and two children, were moved during the day. With the rain intensifying at the Covid-hit district, an emergency meeting, presided over by the district medical officer, was held on Friday. Following the meeting, hospitals were directed to stay alert considering the possibility of floods and mudslides in the eastern regions of the district. The meeting directed the authorities to ensure that all relief camps are organized as per Covid protocols. The meeting also directed officials to test inmates of camps showing symptoms of Covid-19 and to make arrangements for them to stay in isolation. Considering the possibility of trees falling onto power lines and disrupting power supply, KSEB executive engineer was given directions in the meeting to ensure power supply to first-line treatment centres and other hospitals where Covid patients are being treated. KSEB control room can be contacted at 9496008865. Muvattupuzha DSP informed the meeting that equipment like earth movers are ready for rescue works in case of possible landslides.

He has donated blood, platelet and plasma for 240 times in the last two decades. Kumar, who owns a colour studio in Jubilee Hills, was infected with Covid-19 in June 2020. Even before he was infected with Covid-19, he was a regular blood and platelet donor for cancer patients. Today, he not only donates plasma but also encourages others to donate by offering them free pick up and drop in his ‘plasma ambulance’ from their residence to the donation center. “At the age of 21, I read a news article about a person dying in Gandhi Hospital due to lack of one unit of blood. I felt extremely bad for that person following which I decided to donate blood regularly,” said Kumar, who has so far made 84 blood donations, 133 platelet donations and 23 plasma donations. He was also felicitated by Telangana former health minister Eatela Rajender for his service to the society. Today, Kumar, who is also associated with the Cyberabad police as a volunteer, receives almost 10 calls everyday for plasma donations. “One of my friends required plasma. While I was browsing through social media, I came across Sampath Kumar and sought help from him. He willingly came forward and donated plasma for my friend,” said A Suresh, a video editor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/man-who-donated-plasma-23-times-offers-pick-up-to-donors/articleshow/82644476.cms||Preeti Biswas
---||Chennai||Medicos to monitor home isolation patients||Chennai: From tomorrow, Covid-19 patients in home isolation in the city will receive calls from final year MBBS students who will monitor their health and also help them in case of any worsening symptoms. Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) has hired around 135 such students at a monthly pay of Rs 40,000 for three months to sit in a zonal control room where they will be assigned patients to monitor through phone calls. At a introductory meeting on Friday, these doctors were also told that their help would be needed in field work, if necessary. GCC is expected to hire around 300 such doctors.GCC commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi said though patients have been given medicines, many would have doubts on when to take their medicines and would also be worried if their condition worsened. “It is necessary that these patients are in touch with a doctor,” he said. Around 60% of the city’s 44,313 patients are in home quarantine. Also there were other issues pertaining to a home isolation patient such as the availability of yellow bags given by GCC to collect waste from Covid-19 patients and whether volunteers were helping out withprocurement of essentials. As per a protocol sheet prepared by GCC, these doctors will be calling patients at least once a day and take details about their oxygen saturation, symptoms and adherence to home isolation norms. In case their oxygen levels are below 94 and they show breathlessness or other symptoms, they would co-ordinate with the zonal health officer and send the patient to a covid care centre (CCC), triage centre or a hospital. It would also involve co-ordinating with the state war room (104) for an ambulance. GCC has already started a service where triaging services for patients less than 60 years of age is done at home, Bedi said. “In some cases, the family might be living in just one room and hence the non-infected family also carries the risk of contracting it. So we advise them to stay in a CCC. We have around 3,500 beds available in CCCs and we can augment it to 10,000,” Bedi said. Oxygen beds in the city were also being increased and 50 more were added in the Injambakkam Urban Community Health Centre (UCHC), but it was not functional yet as a generator has to be set up, Bedi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/medicos-to-monitor-home-isolation-patients/articleshow/82648619.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Apart from drawing, music, dance and other activities, some of them have gone a step ahead and are even offering adventure camps or outdoor activities in the virtual mode. “Make your child’s summer exciting. Fun meets learning with our exciting virtual summer programmes. What could be better for your child than a summer camp experience packed to the brim with fun, learning and adventure,” read a message from an international school, which is running a virtual summer camp from May 3 to May 22. The school has divided students into two batches based on age group and is collecting Rs 15,000 for students of class 1 to class 4 and Rs 20, 000 for students of class 5 to class 9. Likewise, an education trust has launched Gitopadesh program, a summer camp that introduces children to ancient wisdom, for students from the age group of 5 to 15 years. The camp will start on May 9 and will teach the students 120 shlokas mapped to 20 relatable themes from 18 chapters of the Bhagwad Gita. Some even conducted physical summer camps for children aged between 8 and 17 in the city outskirts. “We are successfully running outdoor adventure camping for children aged 9-15. The idea behind the camp is to develop self reliance, independence, courage, spirit of adventure in the participants,” read a message from a firm that provides an outbound training program. The firm conducted a residential camp for five days between May 5 and May 9 in the city. While parents said that some of these camps are useful, others are just trying to make money by introducing some fancy courses. “It’s good that schools are trying to engage students. But, asking for thousands of rupees for a couple of hours each day for about a month or so doesn’t make any sense,” said M Raghava, whose children are studying in class 6 and class 9.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/summer-camps-switch-to-online-mode/articleshow/82642968.cms||Nirupa Vatyam
---||Pune||Pune citizens say online bookings futile, vax centres favouring walk-ins||PUNE: Citizens have started questioning the point of getting online appointments for shots after many vaccination centres were found to be honouring only walk-ins. Several people complained to TOI that despite a confirmed CoWIN appointment for a particular day, getting a token was the only option to get the second jab. Baner resident Amardeep Nagarkar, who booked a slot on May 13 for his parents aged above 70, said, “As soon as I learnt of slot availability, I booked online on CoWIN and got the 12:30-1 pm slot. My brother immediately took my parents to the vaccination centre but they were told the doses were over by then. Why was the slot available if the doses were not? These centres have a fixed number of doses for those with appointments and for walk-ins. The vaccine for my parents was most likely given to a walk-in.” A senior citizen who did not wish to be quoted said, “Even after a confirmed appointment, people are being denied the vaccine. I had a similar experience at a centre, which probably was being managed by a political party. I was denied the shot and told to come early morning to get a token despite having an online appointment on CoWIN. This system of preferring jabs for walk-ins or on first-come-first-served basis is rendering appointments redundant. A senior citizen cannot be expected to take the risk of standing in queues amidst the Covid spread.” A city-based Twitter user said, “My parents in the 45+ age category were refused doses upfront at a centre. The authorities there said the CoWIN slot booking has no validity. They were told to come in the morning, queue up and take the vaccine.” City-based Anita Shinde had booked an appointment for her husband’s second jab at a hospital in Bibvewadi recently. “But when he went there at the allotted slot timing (10am-noon), he was told there were no vaccines. Several others with confirmed online appointments were also told the same thing. Taking online appointments does not matter; hospitals finish their vaccination quota with walk-ins,” she said. A district health department official told TOI, “If beneficiaries have an appointment for a particular day, it means they will have to be given the shot on that day. At times, centres take a call according to the local conditions. For instance, if a centre has just 200 doses and there are more walk-ins than that, with people creating a rush at the site, how is all of this to be managed?

So, he converted two of his vehicles — one into an ambulance and the other into a shanti rath (a hearse) — and offered the service free to anyone who needed. “I was taken aback when I learnt from a woman how private vehicles ferrying Covid deceased were extorting money from the relatives. The woman was not from a well-to-do family. She had been waiting since 5 pm to cremate her husband who had died of corona. The ambulance charged her heavily even for the wait at the crematorium. It was 1 am. This incident moved me, and my friends and we decided to do something about it.” Parmar said he converted one of his SUVs into an ambulance to take patients to hospital and another to ferry dead bodies. He also deployed a third vehicle, which is a sedan, to take patients to hospitals or to laboratories for test. Parmar said the three vehicles are used for anyone living in a 20km radius. In just seven days of starting the service, he has reportedly received hundreds of calls. “We are now planning to get more vehicles to transport people to hospitals and even for check-ups. For patients who want to go for CT scan or even to visit a doctor, they find it difficult to get transportation. Hence, our vehicles will come in handy for such people.” Parmar’s family has been helping the community for the past 22 years. They have been giving materials needed for last rites to the family who cannot afford it for free. “In the late 1990s, when my grandfather died, my family did not have Rs 12.50 to buy material to carry his body to the crematorium. Once our financial condition improved, my father Chatrasinh decided to give these materials for free to people who could not afford it,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/naroda-man-turns-suvs-into-ambulance-hearse/articleshow/82642964.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

---||Mumbai||TMC plans 3 mega oxygen generators for its Covid centres||Thane: TMC is working on becoming self-reliant in ensuring adequate oxygen supply at its Covid facilities in the coming months by setting up generation plants and increasing storage capacity. Dr Vipin Sharma, municipal commissioner, TMC, said they plan to install three gigantic oxygen generators with an individual generation capacity of 5.3 metric tonne at Global Hospital, Parking Plaza and Voltas field hospitals in the coming days. The systems, when fully operational, will collectively generate nearly 16MT oxygen daily using the pressure swing adsorption technique. A cursory calculation by the administration reveals if each of these roughly 5MT capacity facilities are made operational by June-end, they can easily be used to operate 350 oxygen beds or 125 ICU beds or 60 ventilators daily at each of the facilities. Around 3.2MT is already being generated using this technique since May 1, said Dr Sharma. Currently, the city civic facilities get 37MT daily of liquid oxygen. Considering the projected requirement of 62MT, the rest could possibly be generated within the hospitals using this technique. In addition, the corporation is also working on installing huge additional tanks storing liquid oxygen at the three hospitals that will also help the administration remain in a safe position in terms of oxygen requirement, said Dr Sharma while addressing the media recently. “Currently, we have a storage capacity of 44MT for liquid oxygen and we are in the process of installing three more tanks of 12MT capacity each at these facilities taking the capacity to 80MT. When fully operational, we will use the tanks alternatively to ensure optimal usage of the oxygen that is bound to vapourise,” said Dr Sharma. Once fully operational, the corporation is likely to have adequate oxygen content, both in the liquid form and PSA generated one, which can easily cater to any projected emergency, said officials. “The corporation is working towards ensuring continued supply of oxygen through these two systems at the hospitals and they will be able to switch over from one system to another in case of snags,” said officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/tmc-plans-3-mega-oxygen-generators-for-its-covid-centres/articleshow/82641098.cms||Manoj Badgeri

---||Delhi||Sarai Kale Khan funeral facility to get an upgrade||New Delhi: The pandemic may change the face of city crematoria. South Delhi Municipal Corporation is planning to develop the Sarai Kale Khan crematorium as the central modern cremation facility of the national capital with the largest number of funeral pyre platforms. A corporation official said that due to the increase in the number of deaths in the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, the funeral capacity of crematora is being expanded. Currently, the one at Nigambodh Ghat has the maximum capacity in the city. Earlier, the Sarai Kale Khan one was mostly used for unclaimed bodies. The Sarai Kale Khan ground is spread over 3,000 sqm and temporary pyres have been set up in a 1,000 sqm space behind the building. “We will combine the two sites and develop a modern crematorium with 150 funeral pyres for traditional wood-based cremations and 10 CNG furnaces,” a SDMC official said. There are around 40 crematoria under SDMC. “There are hardly six or seven sites in city with funeral capacity of over 50,” the officer said. “Nigambodh crematorium is the largest facility in the city where 120 traditional platforms and six CNG finances are currently operational. Punjabi Bagh is the 2nd largest with 71 traditional pyre platforms and 4 CNG furnaces. In East Delhi, Seemapuri crematorium has the most capacity. However, after the revamp, the Sarai Kale Khan one will surpass all the other ones.” Nigambodh Ghat is spread over 4,000 sqm, while the Pujabi Bagh site is spread over 2,000 sq m area. An official said that they are already communicating with DDA to execute the expansion plan. “An approach road from Sarai Kale Khan Shamshan Ghat to the main road will be developed. The site is hardly 1-2 kms away from the Yamuna,” official added. Meanwhile, social activists have highlighted the poor current state of the crematorium, with one of the two electric furnaces on the site currently lying dysfunctional. Sunil Kumar Aledia from Center for Holistic development, who has been helping families with cremations of Covid victims, said that the load on the other CNG furnace has increases, leading to long queues and waiting time. “Immediate repair should be carried out and the Bela road facility should also be operationalised,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sarai-kale-khan-funeral-facility-to-get-an-upgrade/articleshow/82642997.cms||Paras Singh

There is a shortage of doctors in many villages, due to which quacks have become active and are claiming to treat Covid patients. On getting such information, Barmer and Jaisalmer district administrations and health department have directed to take action against such fake doctors. The SDM has seized such illegal clinics at Bheekhodai village in Bhaniyana sub-division in Jaisalmer. Apart from this, action has been taken against fake doctors in Nachna area in the district. Similarly, in Barmer’s Sedwa sub-division, FIR has been lodged against two such doctors ‘treating’ patients at two clinics. Teams have been formed on a large scale to take necessary action against such quacks. The teams, issuing notice to such quacks treating people in an unauthorised manner, are binding them. Jaisalmer CMHO Dr Kamlesh Choudhary said that in the Nachna area, the health department has ensured action against quacks who were treating patients by running clinics without registration. He said that in-charge medical officer Nachna was directed to form a team and take action against quacks, under which the team serves notice to people running clinics in unauthorised manner. Dr Choudhary said that the in-charge medical officer Nachna was asked that no fake doctors would treat patients and was asked to ensure this, and that all patients coming to CHC should be treated, given medicines and given proper consultation. He said that the working doctors and department personnel at CHC Nachna are ensuring effective measures to prevent infection in the area and corona-positive patients are being benefited by the necessary treatment.Similarly, in Bhaniyana sub-division, on getting complaint about an illegal clinic at Bhikhodai village, SDM Bhaniyana Duda Ram reached the spot and saw that patients were being treated there. On this, he sealed the clinic. Apart from this, there is a network of quacks in many villages and hamlets and action is being taken after getting the complaints. On the other hand, action is being taken against quacks in Barmer district. Two fake clinics were sealed at Sedwa and a case was lodged against the ones running them. Chauhatan BCMO Dr Ramjeevan Vishnoi at Sedwa police station lodged two cases. In the report, it was told that he had gone to Sanjeevani Hospital where many patients were admitted and the doctor treating patients there did not have any documents of being a doctor. Similarly in another case, he had gone to Astha Clinic where there were 2-3 fake patients and a person named Dinesh Kumar was treating them. He also did not have any documents of being a doctor. Case was lodged against both under Sections 419, 420, 269, 270 and 15/3.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/action-against-quacks-treating-covid-patients-in-border-districts/articleshow/82642976.cms||---

Chief minister Pramod Sawant must own the responsibility and immediately announce substantial compensation to the families of those patients who were murdered by government apathy and blunder,” he said. Questioning the government’s failure in fixing responsibility for 74 deaths in GMC in last four days due to oxygen shortage, Kamat said he was exploring legal options for demanding judicial Inquiry into the Covid deaths. “A judicial inquiry is a must to probe the entire handling of the Covid pandemic by the government. People want to know what is the actual reason for a sudden rise in Covid deaths in Goa. Prepare a audit report from a team of experts adopting scientific methodology,” Kamat said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/compensate-kin-of-covid-victims-kamat/articleshow/82644518.cms||---

With some doctors also telling Covid patients to take the vaccine three months after recovery, it has led to confusion among people, particularly those who have not even received a single dose. Speaking to TOI, National Institute of Bio-Medical Genomics-Kalyani associate professor Sreedhar Chinnaswamy said antibodies developed after a person has had symptomatic Covid is always superior than a vaccine induced antibody and that it should last for a life like measles or mumps unless the virus mutates enough to render the antibody ineffective. “No vaccine can induce antibodies as strong as a real infection. But that is not the case for asymptomatic cases. They will still remain vulnerable to the virus and should get vaccinated if they want induced antibodies,” he said. Resham Guha, 28, a financial executive, who is currently recovering from the virus, said the doctor she was consulting had told her to be ready for the vaccine a month after recovery. “My company is arranging for the vaccine next month. With such a crisis to get vaccinated, I really did not wish to miss this opportunity,” she said, adding that she was also worried if her antibodies would last. According to a scientist at Indian Institute of Science Education & Research, Kolkata, there is no problem with the antibodies from a natural infection lasting for years unless the virus mutated enough to deceive them (antibodies). “We need to study a person who has recovered for at least a year before we can determine that mutated viruses are not being countered by the naturally-developed antibodies,” he said. The World Health Organization (WHO), too, had reported that it was alright to delay vaccination for six months after a natural infection, as natural antibodies are likely to persist in the body until then.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/jab-confusion-for-covid-recovered-as-they-wait-for-their-turn-to-get-vaccinated/articleshow/82642983.cms||Subhro Niyogi

Even Sputnik has not received approvals for domestic distribution and supply. So, if the BMC doesn’t get any response for its global EoI, then the central government will be responsible for it,” Shewale said. He urged the Centre to issue draft tenders and guidelines for all states to float global tenders for vaccines. Shewale said that some imported vaccines required new cold storage facilities, since they can’t be stored in the facilities created for Covishield and Covaxin. “The Centre must create this new cold storage infrastructure so that states can buy imported vaccines too. The Indian Council of Medical Research and Drugs Controller General of India, which are controlled by the Centre, must ease the hurdles in vaccine procurement,” he said. The BMC’s EoI said that the manufacturers will have to set up their own cooling infrastructure, if the vaccines require storage below 2-8 degrees Celsius. Officials said Covishield, Covaxin, Moderna, Sputnik V, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines can be kept between 2 and 8 degrees C for 30 days, while Pfizer vaccines can be kept only up to five days. “I will write to PM Modi requesting him to set up a one-window clearance and fast-track the system for all vaccine-related approvals,” said Shewale. “The Centre must also fix a common rate for all vaccines and waive off all taxes so that states can buy them at affordable rates. The common draft tenders and guidelines must mention all this.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/centre-to-blame-if-no-bidders-for-bmcs-global-eoi-for-vax-in-mumbai-sena-mp/articleshow/82644534.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Proper records or registers are not being maintained. Open data experts said that each crematorium or burial ground should have computerised data entry and it should be connected to a centralised database. The data should have particulars of persons who died and cause of death. K Rajeshwar Rao of Satya Harischandra Foundation, which performs last rites of unknown bodies, said, “There are around 900 graveyards in Greater Hyderabad. We have asked the government to issue a circular for common database and records in all graveyards.” Some of the graveyards are maintaining manual records. Raj Kumar Vigg, working president of Amberpet graveyard, said, “We are maintaining manual register with particulars of dead persons including the address, date of death and place of death. We are making three receipts. One for the relatives of the victim, one for the graveyard and one for GHMC.” Data security researcher Srinivas Kodali said, “Death classification is done in other states where a committee decides Covid-19 deaths. Telangana government has to be more transparent. In hospital deaths, cause of death is mentioned. When death happens outside hospital, as most of them are denied beds, deaths in home isolation go unreported. Only deaths inside hospitals are recorded due to which official figures look suspicious. Government should ask people to report Covid deaths proactively.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/lack-of-database-on-covid-19-deaths-leads-to-confusion/articleshow/82644513.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

The compounder who posed as a doctor charged Rs 10,000 for home visits. The trio had taken Rs 1.5 lakh for treatment of a Covid patient before his condition began deteriorating, and he was taken to Civil Hospital. A complaint was registered on Thursday by Megha Vilash Sirsat, 43, of Khokhra. The complainant claimed that her husband Vilash tested positive on April 27 in HRCT scan. She claimed that she wanted to keep it a secret that Vilash had tested positive and sought help from her neighbour Vendan who was calling a doctor at his residence for the treatment of his mother. Vendan gave her the number of Narendra Pandya and said that he was the doctor who was treating his mother. Megha called up Narendra who agreed to come and treat the patient and asked for Rs 10,000 per visit. Megha agreed and on April 29, Narendra came to her place and said that he was a Covid specialist doctor and daily a nurse would come in the morning and would give some injections. This continued for 15 days and suddenly the complainant realised that Vilash’s condition was deteriorating and hence she decided to inform her relatives who then came to her residence and at the same time Narendra along with one Sohil Shaikh also came there. When the relatives questioned Narendra they realized that he was not a doctor. Later the neighbours called 108 and Vilash was shifted to Civil Hospital and the trio, Narendra, Sohil and the nurse Reena were taken to police station where a complaint was lodged against the three.

He directed the officers to increase containment zones, testing and tracing of Covid positive cases aggressively. The chief minister was holding a review meeting on Friday. He said that in the last three weeks the number of Covid cases increased from 18,000 to 51,000. This means the positivity rate in the state capital is about 30%, a matter of grave concern. He said this calls for new strategy to tackle the infection rate. Gehlot asked the experts to suggest new treatment protocol in incidents of black fungus cases reported among some Covid patients. He said this protocol had to be communicated to the doctors in the district hospitals and at CHC level. He added such cases had to be identified at the beginning and be treated to mitigate the effects. He also directed officers to ensure sufficient medicines for the treatment of the disease. The chief minister said considering the virus making its way to the villages there is a need to further strengthen the health infrastructure in the rural areas. He asked the officials to ensure sufficient man power in the rural areas. He said door-to-door survey and medicine kit distribution in an effective way could result in identifying the cases and providing initial treatment to the patients and saving lives. Medical and health minister Raghu Sharma stressed the need to adopt different strategies for urban and rural areas. He said there is a need for large-scale antigen testing in rural areas for early detection of positive cases and isolation. He said seven districts including Jaipur account for 1.25 lakh cases. Chief secretary Niranjan Arya informed everyone that the Centre has agreed to release an additional 20 MT of oxygen from Hazira.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/infection-rate-of-30-in-jaipur-a-matter-of-grave-concern-cm/articleshow/82642987.cms||---

This capacity includes 50,000 concentrators it is currently in the process of buying.The total oxygen production capacity will further increase as private hospitals, having 60 beds or above are now required to have their own plants. The medical and health department on Tuesday had directed the private hospitals to set up their oxygen plants within two months.Siddharth Mahajan, secretary, medical health & family welfare, said, “Currently, we are trying to deploy all the arsenal at our disposal to contain and bring down the cases. At the same time, we are preparing ourselves to be on the top of the situation even if there is a third wave. Ramping up oxygen production to become self-sufficient is a key part of that strategy.”State government funds available in medical health departments and local bodies, contributions from private companies and central assistance are being mobilized to significantly increase production.“We expect much of the planned projects will come on stream by July 15. This will put us on a much stronger footing to ably deal with a crisis like this,” added Mahajan.The local bodies which are planning to create new capacity of 11,725 cylinders per day have started issuing works orders for the plants.The government has already started importing oxygen concentrators from Russia and it is also tapping the Chinese markets for the same purpose. By the end of this month, it will purchase more than 28,000 units.In the past few days, 3,500 oxygen concentrators have reached the state, including 750 from Russia. The medical health department has floated global tenders to procure more.“We have got very good response to our global tenders for concentrators. The priority is quick delivery of the machines. We will deploy them in all district hospitals,” Mahajan said.The virus is spreading fast in rural areas and the hospitals there don’t have enough oxygen beds. The concentrators are easy to deploy and works better for medium-level critical patients.GFXOxygen Ramp Up Plan (In no. of cylinders per day)State’s existing oxygen capacity: 3,173Firmed up additional capacity:1.

Singh appealed to the minister to think of his suggestion and not to put additional burden on hospitals by stopping their services. The MLA from Sangod in Kota said corona is spreading like wildfire in villages and the challenge is huge as resources are very limited. He pointed out that there are about 40,000 villages in the state and doctors could not reach everywhere. Where there is no access to doctors, quacks are main stay. Even now, a large section of the people believes in them. On falling sick, people approach these ‘village doctors’ and get their treatment. The government from time to time had launched campaign against them and tried to stop them. He said the government may be right, but in our country ‘Jugaad' has got its own relevance. He had also given his argument in favour of why people prefer quacks. They are easily accessible and the village folks have strong faith in them. They provide home services to patients. They have contact with the doctors in the cities and in time of need they help patients get medical help in cities as villagers are not aware of the doctors in the cities. Dr Raman Sharma, senior professor at SMS hospital, said, “They could help the patient by way of measuring oxygen level and a patient with fever with a paracetamol, but Covid treatment should be done only by a trained doctor. Otherwise it will be detrimental to the health of the patient.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cong-mla-bats-for-quacks-in-villages-during-pandemic/articleshow/82642999.cms||---

Discussions on portfolios to be allocated to CPI, the second biggest constituent in LDF, are not over. It is learnt that CPI was reluctant to give up key portfolios it held in the first DLF government. Sources say KC(M) has asked revenue or agriculture portfolios that were earlier handled by CPI. But, CPI will continue to hold the deputy speaker post. CPM had refused KC(M)’s two-cabinet berth demand and promised one ministerial berth and another with cabinet rank, most probably the chief whip’s post. CPM is unlikely to give up key portfolios such as finance, education, health, industries and local self-government institutions. Hence, CPM may offer KC(M) PWD or power portfolio. Meanwhile, KC(B) leader K B Ganesh Kumar is likely to be a part of the new cabinet. The fate of Janadhipathya Kerala Congress MLA Antony Raju hangs in the balance and discussions in CPM favour Alappuzha MLA PP Chitharanjan as the representative of Latin Catholic community in the cabinet. But, discussions are on the possibility of Janadhipathya Kerala Congress and INL sharing a cabinet berth. Congress(S) leader Kadannappally Ramachandran is unlikely to be included in the cabinet. Meanwhile, CPM is looking at the probability of clubbing together general and higher education portfolios. The possibility of KT Jaleel securing a seat in the second Pinarayi cabinet is remote. If that be the case, Shoranur MLA P Mammikutty or former LSGI minister AC Moideen may be considered by the CPM. LDF is scheduled to meet on Monday and CPM secretariat on Tuesday. As per current plans, the swearing-in ceremony of the new government will be held on May 20 at Central stadium, subject to Covid restrictions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/new-govt-cpi-likely-to-retain-4-cabinet-berths/articleshow/82641216.cms||---

India’s preparations for the remaining three games in the World Cup qualifiers have been hampered due to the Covid-19 crisis in the country. Rising cases during the second wave has meant the team has been unable to start training anywhere in the country. Plans to travel early this month to Qatar and start training were also hit due to the country’s restrictions and SOPs. However, after prolonged talks between All India Football Federation (AIFF) and the Qatar FA, Stimac’s boys could start training later this week. “The Qatar FA has verbally assured us that there will not be the 10-day hard quarantine, mandatory for all travellers from India. That period will be waived,” a senior AIFF official told TOI on Saturday. The AIFF is now waiting for the written permission from Qatar’s health ministry. The AIFF didn’t want to lose more time so it asked all 28 probables to arrive in Delhi in the next 24 hours. While 16 players have already arrived, the remaining are expected to land in the Capital on Sunday. “Our plan is to get the team ready and fly no sooner all permissions are secured. All players who arrive in Delhi will have to get a RTPCR negative test result before they land here. “Once the player arrives here, he will be quarantined. We expect to conduct another test on Tuesday (May 18) and the plan is to fly to Qatar either on May 19 or latest by May 20. We want all players to be ready for this tough assignment,” said the official. India will take on the might of Qatar in their first game on June 3, before facing Bangladesh (June 7) and Afghanistan (June 15). India are currently fourth in Group E with three points from their first five matches. Qatar top the table with 13 points while Oman are close behind with 12 points. India are aiming for a third-place finish in the group which will provide them with a direct spot in the third round of the Asian Cup 2023 qualifiers. India’s best performance came against the top-ranked teams in the group. While they started with a narrow 1-2 loss against Oman at home after conceding towards the closing stages of the match, they played their best against Qatar, holding the Asian champions goalless in Doha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/stimac-may-get-two-weeks-to-prepare-as-qatar-waives-hard-quarantine/articleshow/82667821.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

Naik criticised the BJP government for passing the buck to each other’s departments. “In reality there are no medicines, no vaccinations and no discipline among BJP leaders,” she said. “I want to ask BJP government if they intend to print Modi’s picture on the death certificate of persons who died due to Covid-19,” she said. Naik said that it is “disheartening” to hear that between 2am to 6am there have been 62 deaths in three days. Congress also said that it is shameful that the state can provide hundreds of trucks with drivers to supply coal to the neighbouring Karnataka but cannot manage to supply few trolleys and drivers to supply oxygen cylinders to hospitals in the state. “Is it because you are not going to get any revenue through the supply of oxygen that you have neglected it? It’s ridiculous and a total failure and mismanagement of the government,” said Naik. Naik said that Goans are getting ready to defeat not just Covid-19 but the BJP too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/stop-feud-resolve-oxygen-issue-cong/articleshow/82644569.cms||---

The ministry of health is likely to accept this suggestion and come up with an announcement next week.TOI Nagpur was the first to write on this issue on April 30 as soon as Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecologists’ Societies (FOGSI) had cleared its stand. Senior FOGSI member and president of Association of Medical Women Nagpur (AMWN) Dr Laxmi Shrikhande said 52 million women will be benefited by Covid vaccination now.“Not just FOGSI, but all national institutions dedicated to women’s health had raised the issue of offering vaccine to pregnant and lactating mothers. It’s completely safe and already being administered in many countries,” she said adding FOGSI’s initiative was appreciated by all national and international organizations and authorities.At present, inoculation of pregnant women in India is not allowed because we don’t have empirical data. This is because the vaccine was not tried on pregnant women during the trial phases. But, data from basic science and animal studies has not shown any teratogenic or adverse fetal or neonatal effects of the vaccine. So, FOGSI had insisted government to allow pregnant women to decide whether they want vaccine or not.Dr Alka Mukherjee, president of Nagpur Obstetric and Gynaecologists Society (NOGS) said there will be many benefits of the vaccination. “Protective antibodies will be isolated in umbilical cord blood and breast milk which imply protection to the fetus and newborn,” she said.In pregnancy, there could be concerns regarding transmission of infection to the fetus if a woman is vaccinated during pregnancy with a live attenuated vaccine. “There are no live attenuated vaccines in the market in India or globally. Therefore, there is no possibility of such an event,” said Dr Mukherjee.The other concerns are regarding the occurrence of adverse pregnancy outcomes such as miscarriage, low birth weight, preterm births, stillbirths and congenital anomalies. The data from American V-Safe registry is reassuring in this regard. “There is no increase in maternal side effects with vaccine administration in pregnancy as compared to non-pregnant women. Women who have delivered after receiving the vaccine in pregnancy do not show any increased risk of the above-mentioned events,” states FOGSI statement.NTAGI recommendations- Pregnant women may be offered a choice to take any Covid-19 vaccine- Lactating women could be inoculated at any time after delivery- People testing positive for Covid-19 should defer vaccination for 6 months after recoveryFOGSI suggestions- Obstetricians and gynaecologists should be allowed to administer Covid vaccines- These doctors will be ready with preparations to manage adverse events- Even after vaccination, women should follow Covid-appropriate behaviour||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/pregnant-lactating-moms-may-get-covid-jabs-soon/articleshow/82641303.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

He, along with around 300 members of his jhuggi cluster, has been frantically calling three local ration shops, but to no avail. The shops have largely remained shut, leaving residents with no option but to depend on distribution of free cooked food to survive the lockdown. An NGO, Housing Land Rights Network, which works with JJ clusters and slums in Delhi, says temporary e-coupons were distributed during the last lockdown to buy ration, but not this time. Dev Pal, a researcher with the NGO, said not only were ration shops shut, but the government was also running fewer community kitchens this year. On Thursday, the Supreme Court directed Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana to provide dry ration and adequate transport, and set up community kitchens for migrant labourers who can’t procure food. Pal said, “We have found families who have run out of food and are begging for meals. People in each colony knew where to go for fresh food last year. We are hopeful the new directives would bring relief in terms of ration.” Subodh, who runs a temporary shop on a footpath, says with the household income being impacted, most households now don’t have a single grain. “The ration which we had initially got has ran out and we thought shops would open soon. But that has not happened,” said Subodh, adding that following the order, his local ration shop has asked people to come on Saturday. Suneeta Chauhan, a resident of Trilokpuri, says she had to resort to begging after running out of food. “I and my husband have no work during the lockdown and we have run out of food and money. I went to Mayur Vihar and was asking vegetable vendors for any money they could spare, when some people approached me and offered to help me with 15 days’ ration. People in my area are now enquiring how they too can get ration,” said Chauhan. Lallan Kumar, a daily-wage labourer from Seelampuri, says his family was being economical with meals. “We had a lot of rice, but soon ran out of it. Ration shops are either shut and if any opens, the stock runs out quickly. We have been getting meals from langars to survive,” said Kumar. A source said problems were temporary with officials waiting for more clarity on implementing the free ration scheme since the recent shift of power to the lieutenant governor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pandemic-forces-citys-poor-to-truncate-meals/articleshow/82643069.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok
---||Hyderabad||Students’ model predicts bed requirement||Hyderabad: Students of Great Learning have developed a model to predict the requirement of isolation beds, oxygen beds, and ICU beds in the government and private hospitals in Telangana, which in turn can help the state in the optimal utilisation of existing medical facilities. Their model predicted that the number of active cases is doubling every week and if it keeps going at the same pace, Telangana will need a total of 40, 000 to 50, 000 beds in the coming two weeks. “Using the data released by the state government, we found out that on average 22% of active cases are hospitalised. Out of these hospitalised cases, 27% and 20%, who needed oxygen beds, were admitted in private and government hospitals respectively,” said Sateesh Kumar Talupuri, one of the students, who is part of the five-member team that conducted this study. Students said that based on the number of active cases, they could determine how many needed hospitalisation and predict how the situation is going to be in the coming weeks, well in advance so that the state can get the infrastructure ready. “Right now, we are predicting for two to four weeks as the situation keeps changing frequently. If the number of active cases is constant for a period of time, the same model can be used to predict the requirements for months in advance,” said Mahita GM, a student, adding that this model can be applied to the data available in the other states and prediction can be made for the hospitalised cases and various categories of beds required, which will be useful for resource management The system/model has been developed by Hyderabad-based students doing their postgraduate programme in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at Great Learning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/students-model-predicts-bed-requirement/articleshow/82643028.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Abhaya murder case: CBI seeks info on parole to convicts||Thiruvananthapuram: The central bureau of investigation (CBI) has sought specific details regarding the parole sanctioned to Abhaya murder case convicts Father Thomas Kottoor and Sister Sephy from the state government. According to reliable agency sources, the CBI special crimes branch in the capital, that had probed the case, has shot a letter to the state government asking for the details of the proceedings and the order approving parole for both the murder case convicts. Both the convicts have been granted parole as part of the prison decongestion process citing that they are above 60 and 50 years, respectively. Agency sources said that it would have been proper to inform the investigating agency about such matters in advance, especially when the case was investigated and fought by the agency to ensure that the culprits are brought to book. Interestingly, the CBI’s move comes in the wake of a Mumbai court order denying bail for an accused in a case being probed by the same agency in which the accused had sought bail under last year’s Supreme Court ruling for decongesting the prisons in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic. A CBI court in Mumbai had on July 15, 2020, denied the bail application of accused Indrani Mukerjea who is facing trial in the Sheena Bora murder case. CBI special court judge Jayendra C Jagdale had denied Mukherjea’s bail application, citing that since she has been charged with section 302 of IPC which is not among such charges that can be overlooked to grant bail under the guidelines for granting bail to existing prisoners. Father Thomas Kottoor and sister Sephy, were convicted by the CBI court on December 23 last year, for the murder of Sister Abhaya. They have been charged under section 302 and section 449 of the IPC, and are serving life imprisonment at the central prison and the women’s prison, in the capital. A high court division bench had denied bail to both the accused multiple times in the last four months. It is at this juncture that the government decided to grant parole of 90 days to both of accused on the recommendations of a high-powered committee consisting of high court judge C T Ravikumar, additional chief secretary (home and vigilance) T K Jose and DGP (prisons and correctional services) Rishiraj Singh. The high-powered committee had decided to grant parole to male prisoners above 60 years and female prisoners above 50 years who have not been convicted for treason or drug cases. Both the convicts have been released on parole. Only those prisoners not involved in grave crimes are eligible for a parole of 90 days. Currently, 1,500 convicted prisoners and 350 remand prisoners are the beneficiaries of the government’s parole policy in the wake of Covid-19 spread in prisons in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/abhaya-murder-case-cbi-seeks-info-on-parole-to-convicts/articleshow/82641273.cms||KP Saikiran
---||Ahmedabad||Tauktae likely to intensify into very severe cyclonic storm: IMD||AHMEDABAD: The depression in the south Arabian Sea near Lakshadweep transformed into a deep depression on Friday, and is now moving north-northeastwards at a speed of 19kmph, stated the national bulletin issued by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Friday afternoon. The IMD forecast says the deep depression will transform into a cyclone and a very severe cyclone as it gains momentum in the next three days. IMD officials said the cyclone is likely to approach the Gujarat coast on the morning of May 18. At that time, it will have wind speeds of 150-160kmph gusting up to 175 kmph. ‘It is very likely to intensify into a cyclonic storm during the next 12 hours and is very likely to intensify further in the subsequent 24 hours,’ the IMD forecast said. The cyclone will bring moderate to very heavy rain across the western coast of India — from Kerala to Gujarat — as it progresses over the next four days. ‘Light to moderate rainfall at many places with heavy falls at isolated places very likely over coastal districts of Saurashtra on May 16, at most places with heavy to very heavy falls at a few places on the 17th and with heavy to very heavy falls at a few places extremely heavy falls at isolated places over Saurashtra and Kutch on May 18,’ the IMD forecast stated. The IMD has alerted coastal areas and the local administration has started evacuation and issuing warnings to fishermen not to venture out to sea. The name ‘Tauktae’ has been given by Myanmar and means ‘gecko’. This is going to be the first cyclonic storm of this year along the Indian coast. On Friday, Pradipsinh Jadeja, MoS (home), told mediapersons that the state government is fully prepared to tackle the possible challenges arising from the cyclone. “According to information received from the IMD department, the cyclone may approach the Gujarat coast on May 17. The CM is regularly monitoring the situation. He had a video conference with officials of 14 coastal districts. All fishermen have been informed to return to the coast immediately,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/tauktae-likely-to-intensify-into-very-severe-cyclonic-storm-imd/articleshow/82644573.cms||---

The detection of crime branch (DCB) on Friday arrested Pradeep Kahar, a resident of Dandia Bazaar, for posting an edited video of Rupani’s speeches on his social media accounts. The police said that Kahar used portions of Rupani’s speeches and made a video that ‘defamed’ the CM. Rupani had mistakenly called French Fries by some other name in his speech while addressing a public meeting in Banaskantha. Kahar, who is a DJ by profession, made a humorous video by using Rupani’s speech with background music. He posted the edited video on his Instagram and FB account DJ Adee following which the cops acted against him. “He has been arrested for defaming the CM. Investigations showed that he alone made the video,” said Jaydeepsinh Jadeja, DCP (crime). He is accused of making and circulating a fake electronic document using some portion of the CM's original speech with an intention to harm the reputation and position of the CM, said police. Since it is an act of defamation, the Vadodara city crime branch, upon learning about Kahar’s act from social media, detained him, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/dj-posts-spoof-video-of-gujarat-cm-online-held/articleshow/82639718.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Panel for Class X mass promotion move||AHMEDABAD: Gujarat government has decided to form a committee to look into the challenges and issues arising from mass promotion to Class X students and find solutions. “The decision to cancel board exams will pose a challenge to the education department for enrolling students who plan to pursue diploma engineering or ITI studies after Class X,” said a state government official. The committee will look into this and other issues and submit their findings to the state government in a few days, he added. It will include DEOs, retired DEOs, officials of Gujarat Secondary and Higher Education Board and representatives from the Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE), among others. Another challenge for schools and students is making a choice between science or general stream in Class XI. As all students will get mass promotion, it will be difficult to determine whether a student is eligible for Science or Commerce. “This is another area where the committee will have to come up with a solution,” said sources. Earlier, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) had announced mass promotions for Class X students. The results of Class X for CBSE students will be prepared on the basis of an objective criterion to be developed by the Board, it announced. Any candidate who is not satisfied with the marks given to him/her on this basis will be given an opportunity to sit in an exam as and when the conditions are conducive to hold the exams, CBSE said in a May 5 notification. CBSE has in its circular asked all the affiliated schools to form a result committee, consisting of principal and seven teachers. Students will be assessed out of 100 marks for each subject. According to the policy of CBSE, 80 marks are from year-end board examination and 20 are from internal exams. “Due to cancellation of board exams, the assessment of 80 marks will be done by the school,” it said. This will be based on the marks scored by the candidates in different tests/exams conducted by the school during the year and the marks should be in consonance with the past performance of the school in Class X board exams, the circular stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/panel-for-class-x-mass-promotion-move/articleshow/82643040.cms||---

It gave directions to make special arrangements for vaccination of persons with disabilities (PwDs) in the state. The commission directed the government to act in the matter and asked them to send a report within a week. There are about 21 lakh specially abled persons in Rajasthan.“Based on the petition filed by me, the human rights commission has issued a notice to the principal secretary, medical and health and given directions to resolve the problem faced by specially abled persons regarding vaccination. The commission has also asked the department to submit a report within a week after resolving the issue. The next hearing is on May 20,” said Hemant Bhai Goyal, national vice-president, Divyang Adhikar Mahasangh.“We had written to the commission that it was a risky task to take specially abled persons to the vaccination centres. There are 21 categories of specially abled persons in the state including intellectual disability, severe disability, blind and others with mental disease. Also, they are dependent on others for any kind of work. Hence, there is a risk of the infection spreading among them,” said Goyal.“Therefore, I have suggested to the government that special vaccination camps should be organised in special schools, Anganwadi centres and rehabilitation centres for them. They cannot go to the crowded general centres as they are already immunocompromised. Hence, they should be protected,” he added.In another issue, Goyal has written to the directorate of specially abled persons and human rights commission urging them to give priority to PwD advocates in utilisation of the Rs 10 crore fund transferred to the Bar Council of Rajasthan by the law department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/human-rights-body-directs-health-dept-to-resolve-issue-of-pwds-vaccination/articleshow/82643034.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Class XII boards may be pushed to July||AHMEDABAD: The board exams for Class 12 students of schools affiliated to the Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB) are likely to be put off till July, said sources in the education department. Last month, the state government had announced that it will postpone the board exams and give mass promotion to others for the academic year 2020-21 without conducting the yearend examinations. Recently, the government said it has decided to cancel the exams for Class X students looking at the surge in the Covid-19 cases over the past two months. The government had earlier said that it will announce fresh dates for Class 12 board exams after reviewing the Covid-19 situation in the state on May 15. “Given the surge in Covid-19 cases and infrastructural challenges in the healthcare sector, it is unlikely that the exams can be held in the month of June,” said a source in the state government. “Also, there is a challenge in vaccination which is now opened up for the 18 to 44 age group as well. Some students of Class XI may qualify for vaccination but the shortage in supply is not something that can be overcome soon.” About 1.35 lakh students in Class 12 science stream and 5.5 lakh candidates in Class 12 general stream are expected to take the board exams this year. The Gujarat Common Entrance Test (GUJCET) will be held after the Class 12 board exams, said sources. The state-level exam is held annually for science students seeking admissions in degree engineering and pharmacy courses in government, grant-in-aid, and self-financed engineering colleges in Gujarat. A merit list for college admissions is drawn up by giving 40% weightage to the percentile in GUJCET and 60% weightage to percentile in Class XII (science) board exams.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/class-xii-boards-may-be-pushed-to-july/articleshow/82643060.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Transport bump jacks up egg price||Kolkata: Doctors are advising to increase protein intake to battle against the pandemic. However, the price of eggs, the cheapest source of animal protein, is getting costlier, thanks to soaring diesel prices and the demand-supply gap. Diesel on Friday got costlier by 35 paise to reach a record Rs 85.85 a litre to pinch the supply line of essentials harder. The common variety, poultry egg, has suddenly become costlier by Rs 1.5 in just seven days. In the last seven days, the wholesale prices of poultry eggs rose by Rs 1.2 to Rs 1.3 per piece and the retail rose by Rs 1.5. Poultry egg, which was being retailed at Rs 4.5 a piece, is now selling at Rs 6. “It is mainly due to higher transportation costs that pushed the price of eggs as in cases of other essential items,” said Sujit Ghosh, a retailer of eggs at Behala Old Market. There is a demand-supply gap, admitted a wholesaler at Sealdah. Egg consumption in the Kolkata metropolitan area has increased from 80 lakh a day to 1.1 crore a day because of the pandemic. There is a slump in supply from Andhra Pradesh. So the gap between the demand and supply has widened. Besides, chicken feed now costs higher than before. All these factors together pushed the prices up, said West Bengal Poultry Federation general secretary Madan Maity Odisha is not allowing inter-state trucks passing through this state. Many wholesalers are refusing to share the higher cost of transportation. The number of goods vehicles carrying eggs to Kolkata from Andhra Pradesh has declined from 40 per day to 10 per day. Significantly, nearly 80 lakh to 1 crore eggs are supplied to Bengal from Andhra Pradesh per day. Bengal produces 2 crore to 2.5 crore eggs per day against its daily demand of 3.5 crore eggs a day. The wholesale egg price rose from Rs 800 a carton of 270 eggs to Rs 1,100 a carton. If the poultry egg costs Rs 6 a piece, the deshi variety demands a higher price of Rs 9 a piece. Even a couple of days ago, it used to retail at Rs 7 a piece. Calcutta Egg Merchants’ Association secretary Ramen Saha also held the vagaries of climate responsible for the fluctuating production. Once the temperature stabilises, production will increase. Chittaranjan Mondal, an egg retailer at Gariahat market, added: “The demand is high because of the pandemic. But costlier diesel has made supply highly erratic. I think it will take a few more weeks for the market to stabilize.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/transport-bump-jacks-up-egg-price/articleshow/82641301.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

While the drive at Bidhannagar SDH was closed on Friday on the occasion of Eid, at Matri Sadan Hospital in EE Block, it could not be conducted due to shortage of vaccines, officials said. BMC officials said that due to shortage of vaccines, they could only run a few of their vaccination centres in Salt Lake and Rajarhat. There are several primary health centres in Bidhannagar from where vaccines are being given but most of the days those are remaining shut. “From about 170 to 180 vials, which we were receiving earlier, the number has come down to about 35 to 40 vials twice or thrice a week for vaccination.

Banks have been working curtailed hours since April 20. The decision has was taken due to the increasing number of cases of Covid-19 in the state. During this period, branches as well as head offices of banks shall remain open for essential services such as cash deposit, cash withdrawals, RTGS and remittances including clearance, with special priority for senior citizens. With this, staff strength shall also remain restricted at 50%.

High tension lines tripped at Colvale, Amona, Tivim and Xeldem. All the lines were restored except the Ambevadi-Xeldem line, superintending engineer for North Goa Stephen Fernandes said. “This 220 line is prone to faults and runs through a dense forest. This is where we are trying to bring the Goa-Tamnar line. We tried to charge it once but we cannot take another chance and need to patrol the line first,” Fernandes said. Power was yet to be restored to several local areas and remote villages in Pernem, Valpoi and other areas. The department tried to reduce the power outage to Covid hospitals and oxygen plants, he said. “Covid hospitals and oxygen plants were our priority. Power supply was restored to GMC and Scoop Oxygen first. Before the line would trip we sent our men to the station as we knew the cyclone was here. That’s why we could restore power quickly. Our junior engineers and assistant engineers are in touch with hospitals and oxygen plants to see that no power failures take place,” he said. Although GMC has a power backup, sources said there was an interruption. While those on ventilators did not suffer any problems as they have a battery backup, the oxygen concentrators, however, were affected. Fernandes said there could have been some delay in GMC’s change-over time to the diesel generator. “Our people are alert and we have asked them to reduce the restoration lines which are bound to trip during lightning and rains with heavy winds as these are all overhead lines,” he said. While the department was able to charge all the high tension lines except Ambevadi-Xeldem line, it was also in the process of restoring power and resolving power issues at the local-level where low tension lines tripped. “The next two days are very important due to cyclonic winds. We have put additional staff and our engineers will be at stations to ensure that power is immediately restored,” he said. The department recently arranged for diesel generators for oxygen plants which didn’t have their own.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/covid-hospitals-get-power-priority-as-goa-suffers-outages/articleshow/82644630.cms||Lisa Monteiro

The loss is estimated to be Rs 1.26 lakh. The theft occurred at a spot a kilometre from the Navrangpura police station. Sheelan Shah, 30, who works as a senior executive at a private firm which provides CCTV camera surveillance to the AMC control room, said in his FIR that a power box, cables, and other CCTV vitals were stolen by unknown persons. According to police, the theft of the power box became known when one of the cameras installed at Navrangpura Crossroads was found non-functional. Later, when the company officials checked the cameras, they found that the power box, the stabilizer, and even cables had been stolen. Cops said that the theft occurred between May 1 and May 9. Later, the company officials approached police. However, since the cameras were not working because of the theft, no footage of the crime is available. The first incidence of theft may have occurred before 7am on May 1 which suggested that the thieves struck during the curfew hours when police were present in the area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cctv-power-box-stolen-so-no-trace-left-behind-of-crime/articleshow/82643139.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||2nd wave: Production at new ceramic plants in Morbi hit||AHMEDABAD: The ferocious second wave of Covid-19 cases has derailed Morbi-based ceramic tile makers’ plans to start production at their new plants. Commercial operations at several new plants in India’s largest cluster of the ceramic industry have been delayed by one to three months. Issues pertaining to procurement, delivery and installation of machinery, availability of construction material such as steel, shortage of workers and Covid-19-related restrictions have delayed the start of production at new plants in Morbi, said industry players. “The operationalization of our two new plants have been pushed back by around 45 days,” said Bhavesh Varmora, chairman, Varmora Group, which had last year started building two plants in Morbi for manufacturing vitrified tiles. The plants were expected to start commercial operations in April this year. “One plant is expected to go on stream next month and the other will start production a month after that,” added Varmora. Anticipating robust growth in demand, especially from overseas markets, ceramic tile makers in Morbi had taken up construction of about 80 new plants in 2020. Many of them were expected to go into production in May and June 2021. “Procurement of machinery is hampered due to the shortage of import containers, and workers are also not easily available for construction due to the pandemic. Commercial production at many new plants will be delayed by two or three months,” said Mukesh Ughreja, president of the vitrified tiles division of Morbi Ceramic Association (MCA). “All activities pertaining to construction and commissioning of new plants have slowed down due to the second wave of the pandemic. Various services providers are facing problems of manpower as they currently operate with fewer workers,” said K G Kundariya, the owner of Wintel Ceramics Private Limited. “The new plants are facing delays in commercial production of up to four months. Those who targeted to begin production in twelve months will now take 16 months to start production,” added Kundariya, who planned to operationalize his new plant for making wooden planks by June this year but now expects to commission it in October. Meanwhile, existing plants are also operating at low capacity as tile demand from the domestic market has been affected due to the restrictions and lockdowns in several states to battle Covid-19. Exports to the international markets have also been affected due to the issues regarding availability of containers to ship tiles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/2nd-wave-production-at-new-ceramic-plants-in-morbi-hit/articleshow/82644627.cms||Kalpesh Damor
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Buyers wary of fish from Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh rivers||KOLKATA: Fish traders as well as customers have become wary of riverine fishes that arrive from Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh after Covid bodies were found floating in rivers in these two states. Scientists, too, don’t dismiss the wariness as unfounded and say immediate steps are required to ensure such incidents don’t recur. Around 3.5 tonne-4 tonne of fishes from these two states daily arrive in Kolkata on board vendor compartments in trains. Rohu, katla, tyangra, boal and aar are among the varieties of fish that are imported from these states. In addition, fishes arrive in Bengal from Gujarat, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. “We get around 2 tonne-2.5 tonne of fishes at the Howrah wholesale market from Allahabad and other places in UP. There are not many sweet water fish caught in Bengal. Most of them that are found here are cultured in ponds,” said Syed Anwar Maqsood, secretary of the Fish Importers’ Association. Though he hasn’t witnessed a decline in the arrival of fishes from these states, fish retailers have become wary as have a section of customers after watching the news of Covid bodies floating in the river. Take the case of Aniruddha Mukherjee, a retired government officer and a resident of Lake Avenue. Mukherjee household is fond of riverine fishes that arrive in the city from outside Bengal. “I have been a regular at Lake Market for buying fish. We can’t even think of our daily meal without fish. We enjoy varieties of riverine fishes like katla, boal, aar and chital. However, after watching scenes of bodies float in the river on TV, we have now decided to do without fish for some days till normalcy returns,” Mukherjee said. Ranjan Kumar Manna, principal scientist at the Central Inland Fisheries Research Institute (Barrackpore), felt the scare among a section of fish buyers can’t be wiped out easily since the scare has gone deep into their minds after watching news on dead bodies floating in the river. Manna expressed hope that the UP government would act on it for the safety of fishes and other aquatic animals. “Some varieties of fishes like aar, boal and chital nibble into dead animals that are thrown into rivers. They don’t differentiate between an animal carcass and a human corpse. There lies the danger,” the CIFRI principal scientist said. That the scare looms large is evident from a decline in sales in city’s fish markets. “Sea fish supply has dropped drastically for over a fortnight with trawlers now not sailing out due to the Covid situation. Now, many customers are avoiding fish altogether,” said Ramesh Das, a fish vendor at Gariahat market. Prabir Mitra, a physician and a resident of Maniktala, isn’t giving up his fish that easily. “I haven’t stopped going to Maniktala market to buy different varieties of fish. We all love fish in the family and can’t do without it,” Mitra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/buyers-wary-of-fish-from-up-mp-rivers/articleshow/82641308.cms||Subhro Niyogi

The moves will benefit about 17,78,632 households covering 72,77,995 public distribution system (PDS) beneficiaries, including 68,732 Antodya Anna Yojna (AAY) households having 2,81,006 beneficiaries. Delhi government is also providing free food at night shelters and some schools for migrant workers and planning more relief measures for them. To provide relief to the NFSA beneficiaries amid the lockdown imposed to contain the second Covid wave, Delhi government has asked the fair price shopowners to distribute foodgrains for free from Friday. The distribution will start from Saturday as Friday was a holiday due to Eid. Food and civil supplies minister Imran Hussain, who reviewed the distribution of free ration under both programmes for May and June, said the Delhi cabinet had decided to provide free ration in larger public interest during the lockdown. Officials have been asked to ensure a smooth, convenient and transparent distribution and adoption of the Covid-appropriate behaviour at the shops. In Delhi, the PDS beneficiaries are provided with 5kg foodgrain every month under regular entitlement — 4kg wheat and 1kg rice — while those under AAY category are given 25kg wheat, 10kg rice and 1kg sugar per household. Under normal circumstances, they are charged Rs 2 per kg for wheat, Rs 3 per kg for rice and Rs 13.50 per kg for sugar, but all items will be free for May and June. Hussain said fair price shops would be open on all seven days from 9am to 1pm and from 3pm to 7pm. In case beneficiaries face any problem in receiving the ration, they may complain on helpline 1967 and other grievance redressal portals, including PGMS, and contact food department officials. Local MLAs will also inspect fair price shops from time to time to motivate the staff and ensure smooth ration distribution. The distribution will be done manually except for in the Seemapuri circle where it will be made through e-PoS devices on biometric authentication. In an order issued by the food department, senior officials have been asked to carry out random inspections to ensure proper distribution of the specified foodgrains. Delhi Sarkari Ration Dealers Sangh’s secretary, Saurabh Gupta, demanded that the distribution under both programmes should start at the same time to limit exposure and the dealers should be considered frontline workers. “The beneficiaries will have to travel to the ration shops twice, which will expose them to Covid. Over 15 fair price shop dealers have died in Covid so far,” said Shailendra Kumar, president of Public Distribution System Welfare Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-19-relief-free-ration-for-cardholders-for-may-and-june/articleshow/82643106.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Ahmedabad||Halls being surveyed to prepare for 3rd wave: AMC||AHMEDABAD: In anticipation of a third wave of Covid case that may be more demanding than the second one, the AMC has begun a survey of private and community halls to estimate how many beds can be accommodated in these. According to officials, the biggest challenge will be providing manpower at these halls as the state and city are already facing a shortage of manpower at government and AMC-run hospitals. A senior AMC official said in the recent wave of Covid cases, the administration was caught on the back foot with long queues at hospitals and even crematoriums. Officials said the supply of oxygen and manpower will be major issues for these new facilities. AMC officials said that at a meeting of senior officials on Thursday, the health and estate departments were told to find out how many beds can be set up and if it is possible to gave oxygen facilities in these halls. The AMC has been asked that private halls with adequate facilities to be examined and the possibility of converting them into isolation centres or centres with oxygen facilities be explored. Officials said that they are expecting the number of cases in a third wave to be much higher then the second wave and daily cases may touch the five-figure mark. Officials said it was also suggested that the night curfew continue till things settle down and RT-PCR tests be compulsory for those coming from other states, especially where Covid case numbers are high. An officer said oxygen may not be an issue in the coming days as the AMC has set up its own facilities and has a system in place for distribution to hospitals in distress. However, the supply of medicines will be a major task as this issue was seen during the second wave. The official said more micro-level planning will be taken up and it is possible that the AMC procures more medicines and keeps a stockpile. The availability of funds will be a major constraint for the AMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/halls-being-surveyed-to-prepare-for-3rd-wave-amc/articleshow/82643101.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

It took six hours for Bhowanipore police and the local councillor to trace his residence to Kankurgachhi and reunite the child with his mother. The engineer, the child’s father who had fled home with him, was suffering from jaundice and is Covid positive. He was depressed after diagnosis, which turned acute due to his isolation. Police said he had left home on Thursday leading to a missing complaint being registered at Phoolbagan police station. But he returned at night only to leave with the six-month-old child in the morning. By Friday evening, he was admitted to a Mukundapur hospital, where he will be treated and counselled. The engineer and his wife both work for an IT major. “Ever since he came to know he was Covid positive, he became demoralized,” said an officer. “We do not know how he reached 6, Elgin Road. The local former councillor of ward 70, Ashim Basu, started an FB live to trace the child’s home. Phoolbagan police alerted us about the man’s identity. We kept the child with Basu’s wife and informed Childline. We then took the engineer to SSKM and Institute of Psychiatry. The family contacted us and we handed over the child to the mother. A relative suggested the man be admitted to a private hospital,” an officer said. “I am happy the crisis was resolved due to the united effort,” said Basu.

The system that has formed in the area adjoining Lakshadweep was expected to further intensify into a deep depression on Friday night. By Saturday morning, it will develop into a cyclonic storm while moving northeastwards along western coast. Meteorologists at India meteorological department (IMD), Panaji have cautioned in a special bulletin, about the impact of very heavy rainfall and gusty cyclonic winds on human life and property. “Though landfall is not likely over Goa, strong winds and very heavy rainfall will have impact on Saturday and Sunday,” Rahul, M scientist at IMD, Panaji said. Localised mudslides and rock falls, damage to crops like, paddy, vegetables and uprooting of trees likely due to very heavy rainfall. The possible impacts of cyclonic on Saturday and Sunday may pose threat to kutcha and weak structures, roofing sheets, disruption of means of transport and power disruptions, the IMD bulletin stated. The surge of waves due to choppy seas along the coast may damage boats and vessels. While the extreme weather system will intensify into severe cyclonic storm between Saturday and Sunday while crossing into the Arabian Sea parallel to Goa, it will be turning away from the coast from Friday evening. Towards late Sunday evening, it will form into a very severy cyclonic storm and reach Gujarat coast by Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cyclonic-storm-building-up-imd-cautions-about-impact-of-heavy-rain/articleshow/82644722.cms||---

The patient was rushed to Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar international airport from Kingsway Hospital through a green corridor with four doctors and technicians in the ambulance.A four-member team, comprising doctors and technicians, had flown in from Chennai a day ago for taking the patient back with them. The team had learnt to have put the patient on ECMO machine to improve his deteriorating oxygen saturation before shifting him. The family had to deposit Rs15 lakh for getting admission at the hospital after waiting for three days and another Rs19.5 lakh for air-ambulance.City police ensured the ambulance reached hospital within 10 minutes with a cautious driving protocol for the patient.The businessman, father of two, was admitted to a Khamla hospital for around 17 days before being shifted to Kingsway Hospital as his oxygen saturation level was not improving. It’s learnt that the patient was requiring almost 100% oxygen saturation even with non-invasive ventilation (NIV). The doctors at the Kingsway Hospital had intubated the patient, but still his oxygen requirement had remained the same as it was in the past. With intubation, FiO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen is the concentration of oxygen in the gas mixture) was 100% too.Dr Harshwardhan Bora, internal medicine and critical care specialist at Kingsway Hospital, who was treating the patient, said apart from high oxygen requirement there had been an alarming rise and retention level of carbon dioxide in the patient’s body. “Carbon dioxide level was hovering at around 70-80%, which clearly meant lungs were not able to pump out or expel it,” said Dr Bora. He added the condition of the patient may not be due to poor clinical assessment and treatment in his early days, but it could be more of a Covid-induced damage.Dr Bora said the patient, at the time of being airlifted, was stable on ECMO machine. “Doctors at Chennai will try to see whether the patient’s condition is stabilized on ECMO and remains so for a few days. They will try to first avoid transplant surgery if the patient responds well with ECMO,” said Dr Bora.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/green-corridor-city-bizman-flown-to-chennai-for-lung-op/articleshow/82641378.cms||Soumitra Bose

Highly diabetic and well into the 35th week of pregnancy, the 30-year-old developed complications and was treated in the hospital’s critical care unit (CCU) for five days before being shifted to the maternity ward. She gave birth to Ameya at 2.55pm on Thursday. According to her husband Soumyajit, who, along with the rest of the family, tested Covid positive, it was a harrowing time finding a bed in Howrah and Kolkata. Around 8pm on April 29, Arpita’s family tried in vain to get her admitted to a private hospital in Howrah. The authorities refused admission after attending to her for an hour in the emergency department. Arpita’s condition continued to deteriorate, but no CCU bed was available anywhere and an ambulance demanded Rs 7,000 to transport the patient. A group of youths finally provided a lead about an available bed at Medical College. Local NGO Abhijit Mitra Memorial Charitable Society then volunteered to have her ferried in an ambulance fitted with oxygen for just Rs 800 and around midnight, Arpita was admitted to the Covid ward. “Doctors led by Partha Mukhopadhyay, head of department of obstetrics and gynaecology, took care of Arpita and the baby,” said family friend Aparajito Sen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cov-woman-gives-birth-after-struggling-for-bed/articleshow/82641409.cms||---

On May 12, the state made it mandatory for drivers and cleaners to carry the negative reports done 48 hours prior to start of their journey.“If a truck is loaded in Delhi for Mumbai with agricultural goods, it takes 5 days for transit. Halfway through the journey, the RT-PCR report will become invalid and when the truck will reach Maharashtra, the driver will have to again get tested to enter the state,” said Kuku Marwah, president of Nagpur Truckers Unity (NTU). Marwah added, “The truckers already follow social distancing as only 2-3 persons travel in the cabin. We agree steps are needed to control the pandemic for which we suggest the Centre and states should set up rapid antigen test (RAT) camps at borders. The governments should also set up isolation centres near the state borders.”NTU leaders on Friday asked highways and transport minister Nitin Gadkari to intervene and get the condition scrapped. “Many drivers and conductors will need to conduct multiple tests to get the goods transported to their destinations. This will create problems at all the state borders and will have adverse impacts on the economy and trade that are already feeling the pinch,” said NTU vice-president Gurdayal Singh Padda.Padda said, “Perishable commodities will rot leading to non-payment of transportation charges by the respective parties. The transport sector is in crisis owing to the pandemic. Low business, rising fuel prices, non-availability of staff, and other costs are taking a toll of transport business.” “At present, almost all the states have imposed lockdowns and trucks are at a standstill. Freight rates are reaching new lows. Maharashtra decision will mean a further setback. Since the beginning of the pandemic in the country, commercial vehicles have been freely allowed to transport goods in the country and no major restrictions were imposed on the transport sector,” said Rajinder Singh Saini, general secretary. This will also increase burden on the labs and will also raise transportation costs causing inflation. “Our medical services are under immense pressure to deal with the situation. RT-PCR and HR-CT scan results are getting delayed due to increasing tests. Even the ICMR recently issued guidelines relaxing norms,” said Marwah.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/truckers-protest-mandatory-rt-pcr-tests-for-drivers/articleshow/82641414.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Only a handful of priests and officials were present at the opening as the yatra has been suspended for pilgrims due to the pandemic’s second wave. The first puja was offered on behalf of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as priests wished him success in the fight against Covid-19. Rajswaroop Uniyal, vice-president of Yamunotri Temple Committee, said, “This is the second year in a row that the Char Dham Yatra started on a dull note due to Covid-19. We hope goddess Yamuna will shower her blessings on all and end this pandemic soon.” Earlier in the day, the ‘dev doli’ (ceremonial palanquin) of goddess Yamuna, accompanied by that of her brother lord Shani —’Someshwar devta’ — left their winter abode in Kharsali village.

Justice P Gopinath issued a stay after considering a petition by the MP of Thiruvananthapuram through advocate BS Suraj Krishna. The case was registered on the basis of a complaint filed before a court in Thiruvananthapuram by Sandhya Sreekumar. She had alleged that a sentence in the book made unwarranted imputation against the chastity of Nair women. Tharoor had contended before the high court that a complete reading of the part in which the sentences appeared clearly show that the sentences were not used in a derogatory sense or with a malicious intent to malign Nair women as alleged. The book was published in 1982 and the lower court should not have taken cognizance as it is not allowed after 10 years, the petition said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-stays-case-against-tharoor/articleshow/82641435.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||‘Personal info’ biggest reason for RTI rejections||AHMEDABAD: In 2019-20, the biggest reason for state government departments to reject applications filed under the Right to Information Act, 2005, (RTI), was that the information sought related to the personal life of a person, and had no connection to the larger public interest. As many as 458 RTI applications were rejected by government departments for this reason. This was followed by the rejection of 303 applications on the grounds that information sought could adversely affect the sovereignty of the country and could instigate an offence. Third on the list of reasons why RTI applications were rejected in 2019-20 is that the information sought could impede the process of investigation or prosecution of offenders. During the year 2019-20, state government departments and public authorities received a total of 1,51,159 RTI applications. Of these 3,658 applications (2.42%) were rejected. While the average rejection percentage was 2.42%, some departments such as the finance department (12.64%), GAD (11.86%), legal department (10.63%), Gujarat legislative secretariat (5.56%), tribal development department (5.31%) and health and family welfare department (5.9%) had higher rejection rates. Those who have been using RTI as a tool to get information from government departments, say the rejection percentage ought to be zero, but departments routinely reject application, citing various sections of the RTI Act. Some RTI activists allege that often, the information commission supports departments in not providing information to applicants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/personal-info-biggest-reason-for-rti-rejections/articleshow/82643283.cms||Meghdoot Sharon
---||Delhi||Breather: Covid-19 cases down, more beds available in Delhi||NEW DELHI: With Delhi witnessing a steady dip in the number of Covid-19 cases and positivity rate, the occupancy rate at hospitals has also come down, giving the capital’s stretched health infrastructure some much-needed respite. At 9pm on Friday, the number of vacant Covid-19 beds was 7,368, including 5,803 oxygen ones, out of the total 24,902 beds, as per Delhi government’s online Corona dashboard. The number of vacant ICU beds — till recently hard to find — was 284, out of the 6,076 beds. While the number of new admissions is now slightly lower than the number of patients discharged, the increase in the availability of beds is also the result of addition of nearly 4,000 ward beds and almost 1,000 ICU beds by the government in the last fortnight. On April 30, the total beds were 20,938, of which 1,199 were available. The total ICU beds were 5,154, of which only 44 were vacant. By May 2, only 20 ICU beds were vacant, most in a children’s hospital. The highest number of beds on Friday were available at Delhi government’s LNJP (637), followed by GTB (286), Ambedkar Nagar (200), Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty (187), and Burari hospitals (180). The partially opened Indira Gandhi Hospital in Dwarka has added 250 oxygenated beds and Burari’s Sant Nirankari and Gurdwara Rakabganj Covid care centres 1,300 beds. New treatment facilities created next to GTB and LNJP hospitals will also add ICU beds. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday visited the facility at Ramlila Maidan, annexed to LNJP. Kejriwal said 250 ICU beds were starting from Friday and another 250 in a day or two. “Our doctors, paramedic staff, engineers and workers worked day and night on war footing and mission mode to construct this facility” in just 15 days. “I visited GTB Hospital day before yesterday, where another 500 ICU beds have been set up,” he said, adding that with 200 ICU beds being set up at Chhatarpur’s Radha Soami Covid facility, 1,200 ICU beds would be added. The situation, Kejriwal said, is improving, but ICU beds are still full, which means the system still has serious patients. “I am sure these 1,200 ICU beds will provide relief to the people of Delhi.” “I want to request everyone, this is not the time to do politics. We are losing lives due to Covid, people are sad and in pain, because they are losing their loved ones,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/breather-cases-down-more-beds-available/articleshow/82643336.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Sahebganj SHO Anup Kumar said the injured person was identified as Harendra Manjhi, 40. “As per our information, he is presently undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Patna. Doctors have managed to reattach his chopped private part but his condition is still reported to be serious,” he said. He said that the incident took place on May 8 and the accused woman, Pavitri Devi (32), was arrested and sent to jail the next day after an FIR was lodged by Manjhi’s wife Paspati Devi against her and one Pappu Bhagat. “She has alleged that Pavitri allured her husband and conspired with Bhagat to chop off his private part,” he said. Kumar said police came to know in the course of investigation that Pavitri is a married woman but her husband has severed relationship due to her relations with several persons. “Pappu is one of those with whom she had extramarital relation,” he said and added that Bhagat was evading arrest. “Villagers told the police that Manjhi had spotted the woman and Bhagat in an objectionable position in the fields after which she lured him too and chopped off his private part with a sharp-edged object used for cutting grass,” he said. The SHO said Pavitri has also lodged an FIR alleging that Manjhi tried to rape her, but no concrete evidence has surfaced to substantiate her allegations. Kumar said things would be clear once Bhagat gets arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/woman-chops-off-muz-mans-private-part/articleshow/82641463.cms||Debashish Karmakar

---||Nagpur||Why can’t MAPL unit be used for producing Remdesivir: HC to HAL||Nagpur: The Nagpur bench of Bombay high court has orally asked Hindustan Antibiotics Limited (HAL), a Government of India undertaking, why Maharashtra Antibiotics and Pharmaceuticals Limited (MAPL) unit here can’t be used for producing the Remdesivir and lifesaving drugs for the Covid-19 patients.While hearing an intervention application of Suresh Gotmare through counsel Arun Agrawal, a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Arun Agrawal said since the MAPL’s factory at Hingna is lying idle, it can be used for restarting production of essential medicines to tackle the pandemic.“The intervenor’s counsel had already consulted with the representatives of the factory’s labour unions and they assured that whenever there is a demand of skilled labour, they would provide it. New machines can be brought in for restarting the unit, since the building, conforming to standard norms, is available. You just need to take the decision by placing the proposal before your board of directors,” the judges said.Senior counsel Ray Chaudhari, pleading for the MAPL, contended that since no machinery is available at the Hingna plant, it wouldn’t be possible to produce Remdesivir or any other drug there. He said the company would also face problems of skilled manpower required for the pharmaceutical unit. Agrawal pointed out that the factory is in ready condition and conforms to good manufacturing practice (GMP) norms. He said the water and electricity are available in abundance for installation of new machinery for production of Remdesivir or any other lifesaving drug.Chaudhari then informed that MAPL is also going to start a facility for Remdesivir at its Pune factory and made a request to the court to issue necessary directives in this regard.“We are of the view that for this purpose, MAPL may approach the principal bench at Mumbai, which is already seized of similar or cognate issue relating to production of Remdesivir and other drugs,” the bench said.Agrawal told TOI that there’s huge employment potential, both direct and indirect, if the plant restarts. “It wouldn’t take more than three months, if the government decides to restart it. Everything is ready there, right from the land to water to power substation. It will generate employment for hundreds and indirectly for over a thousand. There’s also a potential to start an oxygen producing plant there in such a big area, which would lead to more jobs,” he said. According to Gotmare, who was MAPL union’s general secretary, the Hingna plant is having World Health Organisation (WHO) compliant facility that can manufacture 2,580 lakh tablets, 656 lakh capsules, 302 lakh dry injectable (vials) and 71 lakh liquid injectable per annum.Box Inform on O2 cylinders collection from industry, fabrication unitsThe high court bench directed collector Ravindra Thakare and municipal commissioner B Radhakrishnan to inform on the number of oxygen cylinders collected from local industry, fabrication units and welders for Covid-19 patients till date.The directives came after Vidarbha Hospitals’ Association (VHA) convenor Dr Anup Marar pointed out shortage of empty cylinders for refilling even though oxygen supply is sufficient. He informed that since there is less number of cylinders available, refilling stations are unable to cater to the hospitals’ demand for oxygen.“In fact, this issue was considered on the earlier occasion on April 23. That time, we had noted the information given by Arun Agrawal that there were 4,300 cylinders available with fabrication units. Therefore, we had expressed an opinion that these must be requisitioned by the authorities. But, thereafter nothing has been heard in this regard from the authorities,” the judges said.They directed the collector and NMC chief to place on record the details about steps taken by them for requisitioning cylinders in private circulation for industrial purposes. “If they haven’t taken any steps, we would direct them to act forthwith so that on the next date, many cylinders would have been requisitioned for the purpose of Covid -19 management,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/why-cant-mapl-unit-be-used-for-producing-remdesivir-hc-to-hal/articleshow/82641438.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said the jumbo centres have been asked to be prepared to shift patients. “We have also asked other hospitals to begin preparations to receive patients from the jumbo centres. We don’t want last minute confusion over beds, oxygen devices, etc,” he said. Dr Balkrishna Adsul, dean of Sevenhills Hospital, said they are preparing to receive 285 patients from jumbo hospitals such as BKC and Dahisar. “We have started making arrangements for ICU, HDU and oxygen beds. A final call on how many patients will be shifted will be taken on Saturday,” he said. Hospitals have also been asked to keep generators and other alternative systems operational in view of the possibility of a power outage due to strong winds and rains. “Compared to last year when Cyclone Nisarga came close to the city, there are more Covid field hospitals now. Last year, only the BKC facility was operational. It has also been recommended that emergency vehicles have adequate fuel so that movement of patients is not affected if such a need arises,” said a BMC official. Meanwhile, temporary shelters in civic wards have been opened and disaster control rooms activated in all 24 wards. BMC officials said 384 trees around the jumbo Covid centres at BKC, Dahisar, Richardson and Crudas in Byculla and Mulund and NSCI in Worli have been pruned.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Covid funerals more than halve from two weeks ago||NEW DELHI: The number of Covid-protocol funerals has more than halved in the past two weeks, while there has been a 57% drop in the official count of such funerals in Delhi, showed data from the three municipal corporations.  The civic bodies are currently operating 28 Covid-designated cremation and burial grounds. At 717, the Covid funerals had peaked on April 29. On Thursday, 309 Covid funerals were conducted till 7pm, of which North Delhi Municipal Corporation carried out 128, the south Delhi facilities carried out 141 and East Delhi Municipal Corporation sites oversaw 40 such funerals. “There were 298 Covid cremations and 11 burials during the day with Nigambodh Ghat recording 44 —the maximum — cremations followed by Punjabi Bagh crematorium, which saw 39 cremations,” an official said. A public health official said the consistent drop clearly indicated that the number of deaths occurring in the healthcare facilities had dropped significantly. However, the official count might not consider deaths that occurred at home and the relatives decided to carry out the last rites according to the non-Covid procedure. The Covid-protocol funeral count, which includes both suspected and confirmed cases, has been much above the official tally, but the gap was now narrowing. If the trend continued, scaling down of pyre platforms reserved for Covid patients would have to be carried out in the coming days. The daily reserved Covid funeral capacity currently is 1,184 bodies per day, while 1/4th of this capacity was currently being utilised. Delhi’s official Covid funeral count remained above 700-mark between 28 and 30 April, while between May 1 and 2, the count was between 600-699 per day. Similarly, the daily count remained between 500 and 599 from May 3 and 6, following which it remained between 400 and 499 between May 7 and May 10. The reports showed that 447 funerals took place on May 8, 431 on May 9, 437 on May 10, 379 on May 11 and 373 on May 12. From the peak on April 29, the dip till last count is around 56.9% A senior official said the Covid-protocol cremations were carried out with a series of precautions, including use of body bags, PPE kits and disinfection. “In cases where the test results are awaited or tests could not be carried out, but patient shows all the symptoms and lung deterioration associated with Covid, the hospitals send the bodies with Covid suspect tag. Such bodies are also laid to rest with the same procedure,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-funerals-more-than-halve-from-two-weeks-ago/articleshow/82643473.cms||Paras Singh

They said that while it costs anywhere between Rs 4 lakh to Rs 20 lakh for Covid-19 treatment in private or corporate hospitals, the state is reimbursing only one lakh rupees. Families are losing their loved ones and are falling into a deep financial crisis, the teachers added. “Either the state should ensure that private and corporate hospitals don’t charge exorbitant bills or increase the reimbursement limit,” said Chava Ravi, secretary, TS UTF adding that they have submitted are presentation to the chief minister and chief secretary of the state on the issue. He said that in the last one month, on average, at least five teachers died every single day.  “Teachers attended schools physically until April 26.

The arrested suspect, Yogesh Suresh Giri (37) of Narhe, is a criminal on police records and has 17 cases including thefts, robberies and extracting money by picking up brawls with car owners, registered against him with different police stations in Pune. Giri was taken into custody on a tip-off received by constable Ashish Botke of the Pimpri Chinchwad crime branch. “We have recovered the SUV and Rs6,500 from Giri,” inspector Shriram Paul of the crime branch said. Sohoni too identified the suspect as well as the SUV from the CCTV camera footage, which the police had obtained from an ATM in Somatne and toll plaza on the Pune-Mumbai expressway. Sohoni, a resident of Mumbai, was on his way to Pune in his car for an emergency purpose, when the suspect, who was driving an SUV, intercepted him. The suspect picked up an argument with Sohoni, claiming the latter had caused an accident and injured a person. He demanded Rs1.25 lakh for not approaching the police and forced Sohoni to accompany him to the ATM, from where he collected Rs50,000 from him. Sohoni said, “Pimpri Chinchwad police did commendable work by arresting the culprit. My appeal to people is that while traveling on the Pune-Mumbai expressway, they should be more cautious so that such incidents do not happen.” Modus of the suspect An officer said that Giri travels in a four-wheeler, which has dents. He also carries pieces of broken windscreen. After noticing a person driving alone, he starts following the vehicle and intercepts it. He picks up a brawl with the driver by claiming the latter’s car caused an accident. “In Sohoni’s case, Giri claimed that following the accident caused by Sohoni, Giri knocked a boy and asked for money,” the officer said. Giri then forces the driver to pay him the money. Patrolling on expressway An officer from highway safety patrol (HSP) said, “The HSP and the local police including the Pune rural police and Pimpri Chinchwad police patrol the expressway.” He said, “During the night our teams continuously carry out patrolling. We do not allow vehicles to halt on the expressway as it may cause accidents and there could be chances of robbery.” A senior Pimpri Chinchwad inspector said they will intensifry patrolling at the night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/driver-who-robbed-actor-of-rs-50k-on-expressway-held/articleshow/82643416.cms||Mihir Tanksale

This is the sixth time that the state extended the submission of bids of the project, estimated to cost over Rs 800 crore. Senior government officials said that this time they are hoping to close the bids. “We are hoping that Covid situation comes under control and we can close the bids,” a senior officer said On January 14, the public private partnership (PPP) cell of the state government held a virtual pre-bid meeting with companies and answered their queries related to the project. The government had received an overwhelming response from companies at this meeting, with 15 firms evincing interest in the project. Over five years after outlining plans to construct the 5,000-seating capacity convention centre, the state government last December finally went ahead and floated a tender inviting firms to set up the facility. In the first phase, along with the convention centre, a multiplex and five starred hotel has been proposed in an area of around 97,000 sqm. Earlier, the project was proposed over 2.9 lakh sqm land, which was earmarked for setting up the Rajiv Gandhi IT Habitat. A senior officer said that the first phase of the project will cost around Rs 800 crore, and depending on further expansion plans, the cost will increase, which will be borne by the bidder. Recently, the state cabinet approved the re-engagement of Knight Frank (India) Private Limited as project consultant. Initially conceptualised in 2015, the project went through a lengthy bureaucratic process and was shunted between departments before landing with the PPP cell. In 2018, when the Economic Development Corporation (EDC) was responsible for the project, 25 firms had shown interest. These included ITC, Inorbit, Strong Australia, Dempo Group, HKS-US, Essel, Hiranandani Group, Chowrangee Group, L&T, Amanora, Zee and Feedback Infra. EDC’s proposal, estimated at Rs 1,400 crore, had also included an indoor film shooting shed, the Entertainment Society of Goa office, the Iffi office, and the Smart City Centre of Excellence. The land for the project is already in possession of the government.

For instance, the number of oxygen beds was 9,213 in September last year. Their numbers have swollen up to 20,739 in May. An analysis of data provided by the minister reveals that 7,334 beds were added in government healthcare infra, whereas 28,209 beds were cushioned in private hospitals in the period. The Telangana government has added 73 hospitals in a period of nine months whereas in private sector 1,006 hospitals were included in Covid-19 treatment in the same period. Regular, oxygen and ICU beds were added in significant numbers in private sector and government hospitals, officials said. Around 16,007 regular beds, 11,526 oxygen beds and 8,010 ICU beds were added in the past nine months. Director of medical education Dr K Ramesh Reddy said that in Gandhi Hospital alone out of 1,000 beds, 600 are ventilator beds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/boost-for-infra-as-pvt-hosps-bed-numbers-go-up-by-4-times/articleshow/82643433.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Nagpur||MVA govt must file a review petition in SC, says Fadnavis||Nagpur: The war of words between the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government and the opposition BJP continues over Maratha reservation. Leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis on Friday told media that the Maharashtra government must file a review petition in the Supreme Court that quashed and set aside its ‘Maharashtra State Reservation for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act, 2018’, granting 12% reservation in education and 13% in jobs to the Maratha community. On PWD minister Ashok Chavan saying that the Centre should also file a review plea in the apex court against striking of the SEBC Act, Fadnavis said the former must study the law before commenting.  “Since the Act was enacted by the state, how can the Centre file for a review? I must appreciate the Centre’s stand of filing a review on SC’s decision that declaring a particular community backward shouldn’t be in the hands of the state as per the 102nd amendment in the Constitution. The Centre very clearly wants that this right should remain with the state. You can’t put everything on the Centre’s head and sit idle,” said Fadnavis. Terming MVA as a ‘Nautanki government’, the former CM said their leaders met with governor BS Koshyari while fully being aware of the fact that he didn’t have any powers in this regard. “The apex court verdict is very clear and hence the state has to reconstitute the backward commission. It would need to find out new reasons for declaring the Maratha community as backward as the earlier ones mentioned in the Gaikwad commission’s report were struck down. The new panel’s report then needs to be passed through the cabinet and sent to the Central Backward Commission,” said Fadnavis. He added that the MVA government under CM Uddhav Thackeray wasn’t taking any stand on the issue and was doing sheer time pass, something which the citizens were also realising.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mva-govt-must-file-a-review-petition-in-sc-says-fadnavis/articleshow/82641531.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

They also assaulted him and took away Rs50,000, gold ring, watch from him before letting him off on May 12,” senior inspector Rajkumar Wakchaure of the Chatushrungi police told TOI.Wakchaure said, “The victim later approached the police to lodge an FIR. Main suspect Mohit Vedpathak (32) of Kharadi and the victim knew each other. The former decided to commit the crime after learning that the victim got some huge money in a land deal recently.”Wakchaure said, “On May 10, Vedpathak and his aides, Akshay Girigosavi (27) of Yerawada, Maruti Pawar (34) and Narhari Bhavekar (31) of Mulshi, forced the complainant to come along with them. They travelled in the complainant’s car so no one suspected the kidnapping.” He said Vedpathak is a trekker too and has contacts in Mulshi. “He had told his accomplices from in Mulshi to put up a tent there. The suspects then kept the complainant there for two days. They thrashed him and also robbed him of his gold ring and watch. By using his debit card, they also withdrew Rs 50,000,” Wakchaure said, adding, “ The suspects dropped the complainant in Sus after he agreed to give them Rs15 lakh.”Wakchaure said, “After the arrest, Vedpathak revealed that he had hatched the plot of extortion as he was in need of money.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/four-held-for-bid-to-extort-rs-15-lakh-from-stock-broker/articleshow/82643454.cms||---
---||Kolhapur||Maharashtra targets 3,000 tonnes of daily oxygen supply||PUNE: Maharashtra has set a target of ensuring daily supply of 3,000 tonnes of oxygen amid talks of a possible third wave of Covid-19 infections in the state, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said on Friday. Pawar said Mahaharshtra at present has the capacity to generate 1,250 tonnes of oxygen and the limit would have to increased. “The production capacity in the state is currently over 1,200 tonnes. It will soon be increased to 1,800 tonnes to ensure that there is no shortage of oxygen in the coming days,” Pawar told the media following the weekly Covid review meeting held in the city. He said while most districts in the state have already planned for oxygen generation plants with central and even district planning and development funds, the process had to be put on the fast track ahead of any third wave as warned by several health experts. Pawar, who is also the guardian minister of Pune, said 44 oxygen generation plants have been approved for Pune. He emphasised on improving the healthcare infrastructure, considering experts’ views that children might be vulnerable during the possible third wave of Covid. Pawar said a task force was in place to prepare guidelines to ensure proper protection for the children. “In Pune, private hospitals should reserve beds for children as and when required,” he said. Pawar added that the ongoing restrictions in Pune have helped the administration bring down the case positivity rate and improve the discharge rate. “I am told that the Centre has made a mention regarding our (Pune’s) containment measures. We are aware of several demands of easing out restrictions. But if we do it right now, we will not be able to restrict the spread of the virus,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/maha-targets-3000-tonnes-of-daily-oxygen-supply/articleshow/82651316.cms||Nisha Nambiar

---||Pune||Decide on 12,000 interim bail pleas by May 20, says panel||PUNE: The Supreme Court-mandated high power committee (HPC), headed by a Bombay high court judge, has told subordinate courts across the state to decide on pending interim bail pleas of 12,751 jail inmates by May 20 as part of the measures to decongest jails and avert Covid-19 infection. Justice A A Sayed chaired the meeting while home department’s additional chief secretary (appeals and security) Anand Limaye and additional director general of prisons Sunil Ramanand attended. The HPC considered the rise in Covid19 cases because of the second wave, overcrowding of inmates in state jails and police arresting large number of criminals in contravention of the guidelines framed by the Supreme Court in the case of Arnesh Kumar v/s the state of Bihar, while framing guidelines for decongesting jails. Ramanand said, “The interim bail pleas have not been pending for a long time. After the first two HPC meetings were held last year, large number of under trial prisoners (UTPs) had applied for interim bail pleas before the courts. Most UTPs were not given bail. And there was a lull in filing bail pleas.” He told TOI, “Many states had recalled inmates released on interim bail and emergency parole in November-December last year. But Maharashtra is one of the rare states which decided not to recall the inmates. This is because the Epidemic Disease Act is in force and unless the notification issued under the Act allowing release of inmates on bail and parole is not withdrawn, we cannot recall the inmates.” The prisons chief said after the second wave started, he instructed all jail superintendents to write to principal district and session judges in all districts to hold UTPs review committee meeting. Instructions were also issued to UTPs to apply for interim bail through the jail authorities. This exercise started on April 24 and till date they have received 12,751 bail pleas of UTPs involved in offences having punishment of more than 10 years. They have also received 4,000 bail pleas from UTPs involved in criminal cases with punishment up to seven years. The 16,751 pleas have been forwarded to the review committee for taking decision. “All 60 jails including nine central jails like Yerawada and Arthur road are extremely overcrowded, there is space vacant for housing 230 and 900 inmates in Jalna and Nashik jails respectively. I have appointed deputy inspector general of prisons Yogesh Desai to look into the issue of shifting inmates from crowded to lesser crowded jails in the days to come,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/decide-on-12k-interim-bail-pleas-by-may-20-says-panel/articleshow/82643524.cms||Asseem Shaikh

---||Hyderabad||Covid treatment too costly: Uttam||Hyderabad: Expressing anguish over the hefty medical bills collected by the private hospitals, TPCC chief N Uttam Kumar Reddy on Friday said he himself coughed up Rs 3 lakh on his Covid-19 treatment recently. He wondered how could ordinary people afford such huge costs on Covid-19 treatment. Addressing a press conference, he said both state and central governments have failed to help people during this pandemic. “In private hospitals, about Rs 50,000 to Rs 1 lakh a day is being charged for general bed and oxygen bed,” he charged. He sought to know why chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao was not granting more funds to the health department at a time when Covid-19 was wreaking havoc in the state. Alleging that the CM was more interested in making money than saving lives of the people, he said Covid-19 treatment should be brought under Aarogyasri scheme. Meanwhile, several TPCC leaders, including Malkajgiri MP A Revanth Reddy, criticised the state government’s decision to allow Covid-19 ambulances from other states only if they have prior reservation of beds in hospitals. “Both the chief ministers should look at this issue urgently and resolve the stalemate,” Revanth said. Congress MLA T Jagga Reddy urged KCR not to stop ambulances on the borders. Flaying the remarks of director of public health Dr G Srinivasa Rao, TPCC spokesperson G Niranjan said that cabinet ministers should speak on sensitive matters and not the DPH.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-treatment-too-costly-uttam/articleshow/82643481.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Top UP don Muqeem Kala among 3 killed in UP jail shootout||Lucknow/Meerut: Muqeem Kala, a dreaded gangster from western UP and the man held responsible for the much publicised "Kairana exodus", a phrased popularised by former BJP MP Hukum Singh, was shot dead in a shootout inside Ragauli district jail in Chitrakoot district on Friday morning. Another criminal Merajuddin, who was an aide of don-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari, also died in the firing. According to police, it was Anshu Dixit, also a history sheeter, who shot dead Kala and Merajuddin. He, too, was killed in retaliatory firing from police. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has sought a report on the incident from director general (prisons) Anand Kumar and formed a three-member probe team comprising the divisional commissioner, IG (range) of Chitrakoot Dham and DIG prisons. Chitrakoot SP Ankit Mittal told TOI that Dixit opened fire around 9.30am. “Anshu shot dead Muqeem Kala and Merajuddin with a pistol. He also held five inmates at gunpoint and threatened to kill them. Jail officials asked him to surrender but he opened fire. He was killed in retaliatory firing by police,” said the SP. Asked how Dixit got hold of a pistol, DG (prisons) Kumar said that aspect was being investigated. Sources in the jail department said about 10 rounds were fired inside the jail premises, including shots fired by cops. Kala, a native of Shamli, had 65 cases against him and was moved from Saharanpur jail to Chitrakoot jail on May 7 this year. Merajuddin had 14 cases in his name. He was brought from Varanasi jail on March 20, 2021. Dixit, a native of Sitapur and a contract killer, was lodged in the Chitrakoot jail since December 2019 and was named as accused in 10 heinous cases. Police said Kala ran extortion rackets mostly in western UP, Panipat and Dehradun. He was also involved in the killing of a number of policemen. On the directions of his father Mustakeem, an arms dealer, Kala became a member of Mustafa gang, then active in Saharanpur and Muzaffarnagar. Kala along with members of the Mustafa gang killed a constable in July 2011 in Shamli. Three months later, he opened fire at a constable and home guard in Saharanpur. Constable Balbir later succumbed to his injuries. Following the death of Mustafa, a trigger-happy Muqeem took the reins of the gang. A dossier on him prepared by STF says that when a CO and his gunner approached a car with Kala on board on June 5, 2013, he opened indiscriminate fire. Yet another cop was killed and his carbine looted. The incident turned Kala into one of the most wanted criminals in UP. By the time he was arrested in 2015, he had nearly 65 cases of murder, extortion, carjacking and loot to his name. Dixit, meanwhile, had hit headlines after his name figured in the double murder of Lucknow University general secretary Vinod Tirpathi and Gaurav Singh in December 2007. He was also named in the murder of Lucknow CMO Dr Vinod Arya but was given a clean chit. Merajuddin ran extortion rackets in eastern UP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/top-up-don-muqeem-kala-among-3-killed-in-up-jail-shootout/articleshow/82639680.cms||---
---||Pune||A big push to cleaning of nullahs, storm water lines||Pune: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has expedited cleaning of storm water drains and nullahs with the aim of completing the work before the monsoon starts. Over 40% storm water lines, chambers and nullahs have been cleaned so far, civic official said. PMC has identified 105 critical spots at the nullahs, of which 45 have been cleaned and strengthened. The civic body has appointed separate agencies for cleaning nullahs and storm water drains to ensure timely completion of the work. “We have issued 22 tenders for nullah cleaning in 15 civic wards, while 15 tenders were floated for the cleaning of storm water channels. All the agencies, who were allotted the work, have started the cleaning activities. We have told the agencies to expedite the work,” said Jagdish Khanore, PMC’s superintending engineer. There are over 30,000 storm water chambers and around 150km long storm water channels that were identified for the cleaning ahead of the monsoon. The cleaning of chambers has progressed by up to 40%, while cleaning of channels has reached up to 25% so far. The critical spots at nullahs have been identified on the basis of a survey by a PMC-appointed agency. A PMC official said the work at critical spots include clearing of debris, widening and deepening of water channel, building protection wall and cleaning of culverts. The administration had carried out the cleaning works at some spots in March. These spots are being revisited, he said. The administration is also constructing a protection wall at 10 spots along the Ambil Odha, which witnessed flooding in the last two years. The work at six locations has been started and is expected to begin at four more locations in the next few days. The official said the works were planned as per local requirements. The civic administration had reduced the water level of Katraj lake by two metres last year to prevent flooding in case of excess rains. PMC will continue the practice this year too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/a-big-push-to-cleaning-of-nullahs-storm-water-lines/articleshow/82643537.cms||Sarang Dastane

The deputy chief minister said that the Bombay Muncipal Corporation had already floated global tenders for vaccines. However, he said unless foreign vaccines were approved by the Centre, it cannot be used in the state. While states have freedom to float global tenders for acquiring Covid-19 vaccines from any drug manufacturer, they cannot inoculate citizens with vaccines which have not been approved by the Centre.

---||Kolkata||Bizmen, NGOs help cops battle Covid crisis||Kolkata: Businessmen, NGOs have come forward to help Kolkata police stations battle the Covid crisis. Vinod Mishra, a businessman from Ballygunge, had made it a habit to help out the underprivileged through CSIR activities. When Covid’s second wave broke out, he desperately wanted to be of some help. “I was looking for an opportunity to serve. I was reading a lot about the oxygen shortage and how a few ambulance drivers were fleecing people. It was then that I came and met OC Soumo Thakur at Parnasree police station. I shared my plans and he readily agreed to help,” said Mishra. An ambulance now kept at the Parnasree police station for the past three days ferries Covid patients to various hospitals for free within the police station area. In addition, two oxygen cylinders have been kept ready to be given to patient who is in home isolation. This service too is free. Mishra says his plans include feeding entire families who are infected by Covid for free. “We are taking one step at a time. Just call us at 62922-58703 or 62894-45195 and we will try our best to help on behalf of Kolkata police and the Parnasree police,” said OC Thakur. With the local cops starting to receive the maximum distress calls all through the day, various other police stations have made preparations of their own. Beniapukur has started a 10-bed oxygen parlour at Beniapukur library. “Those having SPO2 between 85-92 can come and receive oxygen here. If the level dips below 85, the medical staff here will try and arrange a bed in the hospital. Two NGOs have provided the necessary technical help. The OC, Aloke Kumar Sarkar, had himself been in ventilation for weeks while recovering from Covid. He played a very helpful role here,” recalled his divisional senior. The Kasba police have so far been arranging for oxygen for its residents.  “There has been a dearth of oxygen cylinders. We have mapped the stores providing oxygen and keeping a tab on the requirements. We have already supplied oxygen to at least 12 families in the past three days,” said an officer. The Entally police, on the other hand, is trying to arrange beds for people after tying up with a few local nursing homes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bizmen-ngos-help-cops-battle-covid-crisis/articleshow/82641600.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Lawmakers unable to use funds for Covid-19 patients||HYDERABAD: At a time when government hospitals are woefully short of healthcare infrastructure and struggling to ensure oxygen and medicine supplies, MLAs and MPs have not been able to allocate any money from their assembly constituency development fund (CDF) to shore up infrastructure following a clause. It says the funds need to be utilised only under the head of capital expenditure and permanent facilities. Also, the elected representatives complain that there are no guidelines issued for utilising the funds. As a result of this, ministers and MLAs have been chipping in through their trusts or spending from their own money. Some of the TRS party’s elected representatives are negotiating with private hospitals and diagnostic centres to reduce the prices of CT scan and other tests to cut down the burden on Covid-19 patients. Ever since chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and TRS working president KT Rama Rao had asked the ministers and MLAs to take stock of facilities in the hospitals in their respective districts and constituencies and do their bit, some of them have started providing oxygen concentrators. Finance minister T Harish Rao asked diagnostic centres and hospitals in Siddipet and Sangareddy to charge only Rs 2,000 without a film and Rs 2,500 with film for a CT scan for suspected Covid-19 patients as otherwise they have to cough up Rs 4,000 to Rs 5,000 on each CT scan. Similarly, in Sircilla and Karimnagar, the diagnostic centres are charging reduced rates. Vemulawada MLA Ramesh Chennamaneni donated 15 oxygen concentrators to Vemulawada hospital which was built with Rs 20 crore. The MLA handed over the concentrators to the district collector on Thursday. Minister Puvvada Ajay Kumar spoke to ITC Bhadrachalam plant management to see that at least five tonnes of oxygen reaches Khammam general hospital daily. Opposition legislators like Sangareddy Congress MLA T Jagga Reddy are providing oxygen cylinders, while some leaders are procuring remdesivir directly from the manufacturing companies and arranging them to the needy in hospitals in their constituencies. “I tried to procure some medicines such as remdesivir through my CDF. But, I was told by the authorities that ‘consumables’ cannot be recommended under the CDF. The government has also not issued any guidelines on the CDF,” a TRS MLA told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/lawmakers-unable-to-use-funds-for-covid-19-patients/articleshow/82643552.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Delhi||No Covaxin left for 18-44 years: Delhi health minister||NEW DELHI: Health minister Satyendar Jain on Friday said that the capital was facing an acute shortage of Covid-19 vaccine doses. While the stock of Covaxin for the 18-44 age group has finished, Covishield is available only for some more days, he stated in a press briefing. Jain said that the government was compelled to temporarily shut down centres administering the vaccine. Senior AAP functionary and MLA Atishi made a humble appeal to the central government to supply sufficient vaccines for those in the 18-44 age group and those above 45 as well while presenting the vaccination bulletin on Friday. Atishi said that for those above 45 years of age, healthcare workers and frontline workers, Covaxin’s stock was left for three days and Covishield’s stock only for two days. While stock of Covaxin for those in the 18-44 age bracket has ended, Covishield’s stock is available for eight days. Nearly 44 lakh people have been vaccinated in Delhi so far, including 10 lakh who have received both the doses. “We are hoping that the Centre will supply a sufficient stock of vaccines at the earliest. The deputy CM had informed yesterday that Bharat Biotech has refused to supply any new doses of Covaxin to us unless the Centre approves the supply,” she said, adding those who need the second shot of Covaxin cannot get inoculated due to unavailability of vaccines. “The Centre has exported nearly 6.5 crore vaccines to various countries. Now, they are asking us to purchase them from international markets, which is quite strange and uncanny,” Jain said, reiterating that instead of different state governments floating separate global tenders for vaccines, there should be central procurement. The Delhi government’s vaccination programme in government schools has been successful and it has been decided to open these centres for walk-in vaccinations of those above the age of 45 years too, said the minister. “People are hesitant to take the vaccine in hospitals and dispensaries. So, when we started the vaccination drive in schools for the 18-44 age group, we received a thunderous response,” he said, adding that the schools are spacious and airy with multiple rooms, where it is easier to follow social distancing and other protocols. When asked about a report by Petroleum & Explosives Safety Organisation, which states that Delhi has been seeking to get alternative storage space in nearby states and excess liquid medical oxygen available with the capital is hampering smooth supply from manufacturers, Jain said, “We are not hoarding for storage. It is about consumption rate. The 700 metric tonnes we demanded was about what the private, state, and central government hospitals used.

In each of the 11 districts of the capital, one such bank with 200 oxygen concentrators will be set up and the concentrators will be delivered to the needy patients within two hours. The facility will also be available for people requiring oxygen post-recovery. Patients who are not enrolled under the home isolation protocol of the government may call 1031 and avail of the oxygen concentrator facility. Over 42,000 Covid patients are currently under home isolation in the capital while nearly 17,000 are admitted in Covid hospitals. The CM called it an important service. “It has been often observed that many persons infected with coronavirus report drop in oxygen levels. If they are given oxygen immediately, their health can be prevented from further deterioration. If they do not get timely oxygen, things may worsen. Therefore, it is imperative that Covid patients get timely oxygen. For such patients, we have set up banks with 200 oxygen concentrators each in every district of Delhi,” Kejriwal announced at a digital press conference. “If patients under home isolation require oxygen, our team will ensure the concentrator reaches their home within two hours. A technician will also accompany the team who will explain to the family members how to use it. Apart from this, several people in recovery are advised to take oxygen at home for a few days. For such people too, oxygen concentrators will be provided from the banks,” the CM stated. Delhi government doctors will stay in touch with all those who are being given oxygen concentrators. “If the need arises to send them to a hospital, it will be taken care of and when they recover, the oxygen concentrators will be taken back from them, sanitised and given to another patient for use,” said Kejriwal. OLA Foundation and Give India are helping the government deliver oxygen concentrators to every house. The concentrator will be issued after physical verification of patient’s address and submission of address proof, discharge slip prescribing short term oxygen therapy. Voter identity cards will serve as address proof. It will be given for maximum two months. District nodal officers will supervise the installation and maintenance of the concentrators.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/concentrator-banks-to-send-o2-to-patients-at-home-in-2-hours/articleshow/82666495.cms||AlokKNMishra

They both died on the spot. Just a few days before the incident, dreaded gangster Muqeem Kala had made an extortion call for Rs 10 lakh. The targeted family had approached the police but with little relief. On learning about Kala’s murder in Chitrakoot jail on Friday, Agarwal breathed a sigh of relief and said, “You reap what you sow.” Ajai Jain, another trader in Kairana, said, “It is a big relief for traders in Kairana.” After Kala’s reign of terror for traders in Shamli and around, the then BJP MP from Kairana Hukum Singh had claimed “exodus of 250 families” from Kairana alleging deteriorating law and order situation in 2016. In 2017 UP assembly elections, Kairana had become the BJP’s main poll plank and the party mentioned the town in its manifesto with a promise to eliminate Kala’s terror network in the region. After BJP came to power in the state, UP Police went all out to dismantle Kala’s network and held almost a dozen encounters either maiming or killing his kin and associates. “The network of Kala was so deep-rooted it took some time for us to destroy his organised gang and rid the west UP of his evil influence,” said UP ADG (law and order) Prashant Kumar who was ADG (Meerut zone) from 2017 to 2020. “I have lived in Kairana. Until a decade ago, extortion and terror was a way of life there. Now, things are completely different after the BJP government went after these gangsters followed by my father Hukum Singh raising the issue before the 2017 polls,” said Mriganka Singh, the daughter of former BJP MP Hukum Singh. Hukum Singh died of protracted illness in February 2018.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/you-reap-what-you-sow-say-victims-of-muqeem-kalas-terror/articleshow/82639697.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Pune||Over 2 lakh army officers, soldiers vaccinated in Southern Command||PUNE: Over 2 lakh serving officers and soldiers posted at various military stations under the army’s Southern Command, covering 11 states and five Union territories, have been vaccinated since January 16, a senior officer from the Army Medical Corps (AMC) said. “The army has executed the vaccination programme in a very systematic manner across all units, including forward areas of Rajasthan and strategic locations or posts in deep southern sector. We have achieved full vaccination of almost all officers, junior commissioned officers (JCOs) and other ranks (ORs),” the officer told TOI on Friday. The command has about 30 military hospitals under its area of responsibility (AOR). In a recent letter to army veterans, Southern Army Commander Lt Gen J S Nain said that the vaccination is being diligently pursued. “Some cases have reported positive even after both the doses, but the symptoms have been generally mild,” he stated. “For the age group of 18 and above, we are dependent on the respective state governments to their provisioning. We are constantly engaging with them for its early realisation,” he added. The army commander said that the command will continue to augment its health infrastructure to fulfil its commitment that no veteran or their dependent is denied admission at hospitals across its area of responsitbility. “During the second wave, it was experienced that the majority of people admitted in hospitals required to be administered oxygen. Team Southern star has been relentless in its efforts to increase capacities, infrastructure and overcome hurdles, particularly in terms of availability of oxygen,” he stated. The oxygen-supported beds have been added in phases as per the requirement and now there are over 1,300 such beds functional across about 30 hospitals. “They are exclusively treating armed forces veterans, their dependents and serving personnel in different military stations,” said an AMC officer. From a medical perspective, mild / moderate patients are being advised home isolation. “This is to preclude vulnerability to secondary infection in hospitals,” the letter stated. The commander has advised the veterans’ fraternity to avail ‘home isolation package’ under which they get medical aid at home itself. It has been introduced by the Directorate of Ex-servicemen Contributory Health Scheme (ECHS) recently. “The veterans can also use ‘Sehat’ online doctors’ consultation if they have mild symptoms. Veterans and their dependents who directly go to military hospitals also receive necessary Covid treatment across the command,” added the officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/over-2-lakh-army-officers-soldiers-vaccinated-in-southern-command/articleshow/82643557.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Dehradun||Covid cases double and deaths surge across Uttarakhand||DEHRADUN/NAINITAL: The number of Covid-19 cases in the nine hill districts of Uttarakhand is constantly spiralling, registering an almost double spike in the past 40 days. Equally worrying is that the number of deaths has also shot up significantly, with almost thrice the number of deaths registered in the hills as compared to last year. Pauri, the worst-affected hill district in Uttarakhand, recorded 5,215 Covid-19 cases between March 2020 and March 2021. In the period between April 1 and May 13 though, the district’s tally shot up to 12,970, registering a 48.7% rise in 43 days. Till March 31 this year, Pauri had 60 Covid-19 deaths. The number went up to 200 in the period between April 1 and May 13 (140 additional deaths in 43 days). Another significant spike has been in Almora where total cases went up from 3,303 between March 2020 and March 31, 2021 to 7,899 between April 1 and May 13 this year, an increase of 4,596 cases. The number of deaths also went up from 26 to 89 in the corresponding period. The situation in Uttarkashi, another prominent hill district, is no different. The district reported 3,828 cases between March 2020 and March 2021. In the period between April 1 and May 13, 2021, 5,492 fresh cases were recorded here. There was a sharp spike in the number of deaths too — from 17 in the period between March 2020 and March 2021 to 43 in the period between April 1 and May 13 this year. The situation is almost the same across the other hill districts, too, as a result of which, Uttarakhandfeatures among the eight states red-flagged by the central government where Covid cases are increasing rapidly in rural areas. According to health department officials, returnees, weddings and funerals are primarily fuelling this spread in the hills. For instance, three weddings took place in a village cluster in Pauri in the last week of April. Soon after the weddings, people in these villages started showing Covid-like symptoms. Out of the 42 people who were tested, 30 were found to be infected. Similarly, in Kishanpur village in Uttarkhashi’sBhatwari block, many in the village got high fever along with cough and cold a few days ago. RT-PCRtests conducted by the health department here found that fifty-seven out of the 80 villagers wereCovid-positive. “We believe that migrant workers who have returned have primarily caused this rise in Covid cases in hills. There were many who also visited Kumbh mela and tested positive after returning from there,” said additional chief medical officer, Bhatwari, Dr Bipul Biswas. Similar instances of mass infections were also reported in Kumaon’s Champawat district which has seen a three-fold rise in cases as well as Covid deaths. Here, a cluster of villages that is at least eightkilometers from any motorable road reported three deaths of people who showed Covid-likesymptoms. They could not be tested since medical teams could not reach the area. “All of us have isolated ourselves in our homes ever since the deaths as we don't know the extent of the spread of the contagion,” said village head Mahendra Singh Rawat. Anoop Nautiyal of Doon-based Social Development for Communities Foundation, an organisation closely tracking the Covid-19 pandemic in the Himalayan state, said that it was a matter of great concern that the share of the nine hill districts in Covid deaths in Uttarakhand is increasing so rapidly. “From May 1 to 13, there have been 301 deaths in hill districts which is 18.6% of all deaths in the state. In comparison, in the last one year — between March 15, 2020 and March 31, 2021, the hill districts had 312 deaths, which was 11.9% of all deaths in the state. This is a big jump.” He added that immediate measures were required to improve testing in the hills, provide medicines and improve healthcare facilities. Secretary (health), Amit Negi when queried, said that Uttarakhand is already testing the maximum people per lakh population compared to other states in the country. “The second wave has gripped the entire nation equally. We are increasing the tests and healthcare facilities and trying to reach patients in remote areas as much as we can,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/covid-cases-double-in-hill-dists-of-ukhand-in-40-days-deaths-thrice-that-of-last-yr/articleshow/82639692.cms||Ishita Mishra

He met with state medical education minister Amit Deshmukh and requested him to set up a child hospital at Indira Gandhi Government Medical Colleges and Hospital (IGGMCH).The winner from the graduates’ constituency then had a meeting with relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar and requested him to grant Rs 30 crore for setting up irrigation facilities at the Lower Wardha project to help thousands of farmers from towns like Arvi, Hinganghat and Deoli.Wanjari also interacted with agriculture minister Dadaji Bhuse with a request to set up an orange processing plant at Katol, Warud and Morshi for the benefit of farmers. Deshmukh is believed to have responded positively to the children’s hospital proposal and directed his department to prepare a file. “The demand was old and it was decided to build Asia’s biggest all-inclusive hospital by seeking Rs 100 crore from both the Centre as well as the state. Even though Daga Hospital for Women and Children is operating at Gandhibagh, it can’t cater to a large number of patients at the same time,” said Wanjari.Regarding the demand for irrigation facilities, the MLC said it would benefit 22 villages in Wardha and nine in Amravati districts. “Funds are needed for development works, like in Wardha district. The minister has assured us of all the help possible,” he said.On orange processing plants, Wanjari said, the belt produced the fruit in large quantity and it was also exported in a big way, but farmers failed to prosper in the absence of processing units like the ones in Western Maharashtra. “The farming community would benefit if their fruits are processed,” he added.(With inputs from Eshika Bhargava)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/wanjari-seeks-govt-help-for-projects/articleshow/82641599.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Pune||Pune: Drainage conduits in core areas replaced after 45 years||PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) is replacing 40 to 45-year-old drainage lines on Bajirao Road, Laxmi Road and Shivaji Road, taking advantage of the lockdown-like restrictions, which have ensured there are fewer vehicles on these roads. The new pipelines are bigger and have higher sewage carrying capacity, which would cater to the population in the next 25 years. The pipelines of 10km stretch are being replaced and the work is expected to be completed by the first week of June. “The existing pipelines were of 300mm diameter and had not been replaced for many years. With the increase in population there was a need to augment the drainage network. The work has started for the last few days and is expected to be completed before the monsoon. We are replacing all these lines with those having 900mm to 450mm diameter depending on the requirements. The work is divided in three parts with total expenditure of Rs9 crore,” a civic official said. The work has started from the downstream near the Mutha river and is extended up to Tilak Road and Swargate. In addition to laying pipelines, the administration is also replacing old chambers. Officials said that it was difficult to carry out maintenance of the chambers because they were very old, but now it would be easy. Superintending engineer Jagdish Khanore said that the work had been expedited on all three roads. “We have planned them in phases to minimize the incovenince to road users. The lesser traffic on these roads, which otherwise witness heavy rush, has helped expedite the work”. The administration has mobilized the required machinery and material at all the sites.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/drainage-conduits-in-core-areas-replaced-after-45-yrs/articleshow/82643560.cms||Sarang Dastane

District administration officials who reached the village insisted only 15 had died, and "none due to Covid-19". Dass Mahendra Singh, 54, husband of former village pradhan Kusumlata, told TOI that he had the list, with names and addresses, of all the 27 dead. Among the deceased, he said, was Sukhbir Singh, 53, a pradhan candidate, who died on April 21. When TOI contacted Sukhbir Singh's son Vinod Kumar, the latter said, "My father fell ill on April 12-13. His oxygen dipped and condition deteriorated on April 21. I took him to various hospitals, but none admitted him. He died without treatment." Villagers said it was only recently that officials began taking samples of symptomatic patients. "They have now started testing after reports of deaths surfaced in the media. Some samples have been taken and people are being provided with Covid kits," one of them said. The state panchayat elections, dubbed by many as a "super spreader" event, has left many villages reporting a sudden surge in both deaths and Covid cases. Scores of villages have now been turned into containment zones. TOI had earlier reported how the spread of Covid-19 in UP coincided with panchayat polls, with the number of cases soaring 120% within a month. According to official data, between January 30, 2020 and April 4, 2021 -- in 15 months -- UP recorded 6.3lakh Covid-91 cases. But in the next 30 days starting April 4, over eight lakh fresh cases took the caseload to 14lakh. The period was marked by rural polls. About the Gagol village deaths, Amit Kumar, block development officer, said, "Fifteen people have died due to natural causes and existing illnesses. Samples of 24 people with symptoms have been collected. They have tested negative after the antigen test, their RT-PCR report is awaited."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/27-dead-in-up-village-in-40-days-say-locals/articleshow/82639771.cms||Piyush.Rai

Kolkata Police said the measures, for which the tenders for the sale are already out, will allow us additional space to seize more vehicles. Police indicated a stepping up of drive against errant two-wheelers.  Police said they are witnessing a spike in two-wheelers thefts on city roads. Bikes have also led to fatal accidents, as many as five of the eight fatal accidents in the city since May 2, have involved two-wheelers. All 25 traffic guards have been asked to be vigilant against rogue bikers, the instructions saying that the licences and bikes are to be seized from the rider. Police said the biking complaints coming in, especially from the added areas and north Kolkata during the partial lockdown include reports of rash driving at night and the general tendency to undermine basic motor rules. “The prime focus for us were the two-wheelers. Ever since social distancing became the new normal in the city, there has been an explosion of two-wheelers on the roads making it a challenge for the police. There were reports that several of the new users are not conversant with the laws. It was also reported from certain pockets that rogue bikers were racing on the deserted roads. Hence the need for sustained crackdown to surprise the rule breakers. We had been doing these raids but had slowed down during the elections. This will be our priority again,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kolkata-police-to-auction-seized-vehicles/articleshow/82641663.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

It generates 23.71 tons per day (TPD) followed by Gujarat (21.98). Uttar Pradesh comes sixth when it comes to the generation of Covid-19 biomedical waste. The CPCB had developed a waste tracking application, ‘COVID19BWM’, in May 2020 for keeping a tab on the Covid-19 biomedical waste. Every Covid-19 biomedical waste generator is required to report data daily on the said app. According to the information submitted by State Pollution Control Boards/Pollution Control Committees as well as daily data received from ‘COVID19BWM’ tracking App, in May 2021, the average quantity of Covid-19 related biomedical waste generation nationally has been about 203 TPD and is continuously rising. For instance, in February 2021, it was 53 TPD nationally, which rose to 75 TPD in March followed by 139 in April and 203 TPD in May (until May 10). The CPCB has prepared guidelines for “handling, treatment and disposal of waste generated during treatment, diagnosis and quarantine of Covid-19 patient” to facilitate safe collection, transport and disposal of Covid waste. As reported by State Boards, about 198 common biomedical waste treatment and disposal facilities (CBWTFs) are involved in treatment and disposal of biomedical waste countrywide. At present, Maharashtra has the maximum number of CBWTFs at 29 followed by Karnataka with 26. Uttar Pradesh has 18 CBWTFs while Delhi, which produces 18.79 TPD of biomedical waste, has just two CBWTFs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/kerala-generating-most-covid-19-biomedical-waste-gujarat-2nd-up-6th-cpcb/articleshow/82639744.cms||Sandeep Rai

It took 15 days for the family to recover. In that time, Ahmad's perspective on life had changed. Now Ahmad, a manager with Indian Bank, and three of his childhood friends -- Raghav Sharan Goel, a realtor; Nazim, a Jal Nigam contractor, and Bhupender Sharma, a journalist -- have got together, pooling their resources, to set up a 20-bed Covid care centre in Bijnor’s Dhampur town. “It was tough," Ahmad, in his mid-30s like his friends, said. "My entire family and I were down. I resolved to fight back. I also vowed that after I am fine, I will help others do the same. Once on my feet, my friends joined me. I began contacting authorities. I immediately got positive responses from people when I spoke about setting up the facility.” The stay and treatment is free at the centre. It was a small beginning but a much-needed one in a town with no government hospital for Covid-19 patients. With a population of about 40 lakh, Bijnor district has one 160-bed Covid facility. There are two hospitals in Najibabad with 30 beds each. There is a lone district hospital, but it isn't fully dedicated to Covid patients.  What Ahmad and his friends did was turn a small private school into a Covid hospital with 15 oxygen-equipped beds and five without. They also arranged for two qualified MBBS doctors and nursing staff to look after the patients. “We started this in the first week of May after taking permission from the district administration," said Raghav Goel. "It is nice to see the relief on people's faces when they get admission in the hospital."  Apart from their own money, various social organisations and individuals have come forward to help the small hospital. Ramakant Pandey, Bijnor district magistrate, said, “This centre is primarily for those who do not have the means for home isolation or need oxygen. This is a good initiative. The place needed it."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/no-govt-facility-4-pals-roll-up-sleeves-to-build-20-bed-covid-centre-in-up-town/articleshow/82639733.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Dehradun||Black fungus case reported in Doon, patient’s eye removed||Dehradun: A case of post-Covid black fungus infection was reported from Dehradun’s Max Hospital, following which the doctors removed an eye of the patient. The patient had recovered from Covid in late April. According to the hospital authorities, they had received similar cases of post-Covid black fungus infection, or mucormycosis, in January and February as well, and in both the cases patients were treated and discharged. Talking to TOI, Dr Rahul Prashad, chief medical superintendent at Max said that mucormycosis is a deadly infection which is found in patients who are highly immunocompromised and it reduces their ability to fight environmental pathogens. Symptoms of mucormycosis include pain or redness around the eyes and nose, shortness of breath, swelling, bloody vomits, fever and headaches. “Of the recent three cases of mucormycosis we have received, the first one was in January of a 75-year-old. The second case was received in February and the last one, of a 60-year-old, was admitted earlier this week in our hospital. In the two cases treated earlier this year, the infection was in post-Covid recovery phase and both underwent extensive operations and were discharged in stable condition,” added Dr Prashad. A recent release issued by the Press Information Bureau (PIB), stated that one should control diabetes to check black fungus. The instructions also advised the doctors to use steroids judiciously and have asked patients not to self-medicate. “Controlling diabetes is one of the foremost preventive methods suggested by the ICMR to control mucormycosis. Hence, Covid-19 patients who are diabetic need to take utmost care. Self-medication and over-dosage of steroids can result in fatal events and hence doctor’s prescription should be strictly followed,” said the PIB release. “According to an advisory issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research, the following conditions in Covid-19 patients increase the risk of mucormycosis infection -- uncontrolled diabetes, weakening of immune system due to use of steroids, prolonged ICU/hospital stay, co-morbidities/post-organ transplant/cancer and voriconazole therapy (used to treat serious fungal infections),” said Dr Sushil Ojha, associate professor of ophthalmology at Government Doon Medical College (GDMC). Ojha added that there’s no need to panic but to be cautious, and even non-diabetics should monitor their sugar levels when on continuous use of steroids. “In case your blood sugar is above 200 when you are on steroids, consult your doctor. This fungus is already present in our bodies but only gathers strength to become fatal when the body’s immunity is compromised,” added Ojha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/black-fungus-case-reported-in-doon-patients-eye-removed/articleshow/82639766.cms||Ishita Mishra

In these states, less than 80 patients were recovering from the infection on an average as on Friday, lower than the national average of 83.4%. Delhi has the highest recovery ratio of 92.8% among all states and Union territories, except Andaman & Nicobar Islands where it is 95.4% (with a much lower population and caseload). Arunachal Pradesh, Ladakh and Tripura, with vastly lower caseloads, have a better recovery ratio as do Telangana, Maharashtra, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu — states with more cases. These states, along with UP and Assam, have a recovery ratio of more than 86%. Uttarakhand has the lowest recovery ratio of 67.8%, followed by Sikkim (68.5%), Karnataka (70.6%), Himachal (72%), Goa (73.2%), Rajasthan (73.4%) and Kerala (78.3%). Mizoram, Lakshadweep, Nagaland, J&K and Puducherry are others which have less than 75% recovery ratio. In other states and UTs like Meghalaya, Punjab, Gujarat, Odisha, Jharkhand, Chandigarh, Haryana, Manipur, MP, Bihar and Andhra Pradesh, the recovery ratio ranges between 80% and 85%. Lower recovery ratio doesn’t necessarily mean a higher fatality rate (deaths per 100 cases). For instance, Punjab with a recovery ratio of 80.8% has the highest fatality rate of 2.4% among all states and UTs. It is followed by Sikkim and Uttarakhand with 1.8% and 1.6%, respectively. Delhi and Maharashtra, with 1.5% fatality rate each, are among the top five states with highest fatalities. These two are also among the worst affected, with Maharashtra having 52.7 lakh confirmed cases so far and Delhi with 13.7 lakh. While Maharashtra still has the highest active cases of 5.3 lakh, Delhi had 78,000 active cases as on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/at-92-8-delhi-tops-in-covid-recoveries-maharashtra-fares-well/articleshow/82648673.cms||---

When an autorickshaw union started a similar initiative earlier this week, Ghadge decided to join them too. “I am suffering like most autorickshaw drivers in the city. From Rs500-600 per day, my earnings have now dropped to Rs100 on most days now. But many others in the city are suffering more and they don’t have any resources. Since the pandemic hit, I found many people wanted to go to hospitals for treatment but had little or no money. I decided to give them free rides to hospitals and clinics. It feels good to know that I am helping someone in need. Since earlier this week, city-based Maharashtra Rickshaw Panchayat started a similar initiative and I joined them immediately,” Ghadge, who lives in Vadgaonsheri, told TOI. Ghadge said he looked for underprivileged people who couldn’t pay. “Many approach me requesting to be dropped at a hospital or a clinic and I cannot stop myself from helping them,” he said. Shafiq Patel, the working president of the Maharashtra Rickshaw Panchayat, said they convinced 93 autorickshaw drivers for the initiative. “Also, if anyone is running from one place to another in search of medicines or oxygen, we are there to help. Two cellphone numbers (7841000598, 9850494189) have been displayed on a small banner in these autorickshaws so people in need can call for help. We have been able to help around 20-25 people in the past couple of days,” Patel said. Ghadge, who has two children, said he believed that good was bound to come his way if he helped others. “My son is in class X and my daughter is in class IX. It is extremely difficult to take care of a family in these circumstances. I am just doing my bit and hoping that the blessings of these people will help my family,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/auto-driver-offers-free-ride-to-the-needy/articleshow/82643563.cms||Joy Sengupta

The test positivity rate stood at 27.83%.The day also saw the recovery rate dropping to 82.4%, even as 1,171 patients were discharged from various treatment centres. As per the official data, 90,106 of the 1,09,233 people who had tested positive till date have recovered from the virus attack in the district so far. The Covid-19 toll surged to 837, with the health bulletin listing another 13 fatalities that occurred in the district. Among the deceased were a 41-year-old man without any comorbidities who died two weeks after testing positive for the virus, a 44-year-old man, also without comorbidities, who died two days after hospitalization, and a 50-year-old hypertensive man who died of pneumonia 11 days after hospitalization.The number of hospitals being allowed to treat Covid-19 in the district has increased to 64 from 41. As a result, 65 beds with oxygen facility and 11 beds with ventilator facility were available in the district on paper. However, none of the hospitals with vacant beds had enough oxygen to admit the patients.Meanwhile, a video of dead bodies of Covid victims that were piled up in the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH) went viral on social media. Shot by a journalist, the video showed 20 dead bodies packed in black body bags lying on the floor at a room entrance. People who saw the room said there were more than 30 bodies.The video not only created a furore but also raised doubts whether the authorities were supressing the number of Covid-19 deaths in the district. The highest single-day toll that was recorded in the bulletin so far was 19. “If the number of deaths is so high in CMCH alone, we can’t imagine how many would have died in the ESI Hospital, the Pollachi government hospital and in private hospitals,” commented R Raveendran, an IT professional, on social media.CMCH dean Dr A Nirmala later posted and circulated pictures of dead bodies neatly kept in a room. “This is how we store dead bodies in CMCH,” she clarified. Meanwhile, Chennai-based NGO All the Children and its philanthropists sponsored medical equipment worth Rs 10 lakh to the government hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/district-logs-3197-fresh-covid-cases-highest-till-date/articleshow/82643561.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan got 1,900 ventilators from Centre, only 500 installed: Health Minister Raghu Sharma||JAIPUR: Rajasthan health minister Raghu Sharma on Friday expressed apprehension that none of the 1,900 ventilators provided by the Centre through the PM Cares would be any use in the treatment of Covid patients. The minister sounded the caution after the 500 ventilators that have been installed so far developed snags like sudden failure of oxygen sensors, poor level of PiO2, sudden drop is oxygen pressure and shut downs. Doctors have expressed “complete lack of faith” in the machines. On Thursday, CM Ashok Gehlot had raised concern about the “malfunctioning” and “poor quality” of the ventilators and demanded the pruchase process be thoroughly investigated by the Centre. Sharma told TOI, “We had received 1,500 ventilators from one company and 400 from another. Initially, 500 of them were installed but the company which was supposed to take care of their post-installation care and maintenance has shown ‘zero response’ to our calls.” “These ventilators shut down abruptly, which was a major cause of concern raised by doctors. If the Union government has given responsibility to Company X or Y to give ventilators to the state governments, they should have also arranged for maintenance engineers too,” Sharma said. Sharma added that the state health department has been constantly raising the issue with the Centre and the Union health ministry, but they have not yet provided any concrete solution. “Even on Wednesday, I had spoken to Union health minister Harshvardhan on the issue. He only jotted down the problems we are facing in terms of ventilators. So, I will suggest BJP MPs and MLAs not to blow things out of proportion. If they are concerned, they too should speak to the Union government on the issue,” he added. Secretary (medical education) Vaibhav Galaria said, “We have spoken with the engineers of the maintenance company and found that they are not qualified enough to clear the technical snags. Also, we were told that for Rajasthan the company had given 11 engineers, but we found only 5-6 on the field. This has been a long pending issue that needs to be resolved soon so that these ventilators can be properly utilised.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-got-1900-ventilators-from-centre-only-500-installed-min/articleshow/82643572.cms||Ashish Mehta
---||Mumbai||City air passenger traffic in May plunges 68% from Jan||Mumbai: The average daily passenger traffic at Mumbai airport has dropped to about 17,600 passengers this month —a 68% decline as compared to the 55,800 handled by the airport daily in January. The second Covid-19 wave has brought along a second despondent May for the airline industry. Last year, airline flights stayed suspended till May 25 and then passenger traffic saw a slow but steady rise till February this year. With the second Covid wave hitting in April, though, passenger traffic has again troughed—once again in May, the most important month in the airline calendar. Conventionally, May is about peak fares, long airport queues and packed aircraft cabins. It was the month schools closed for summer vacations and India travelled while airlines raked in profit to last the lean season that monsoon brought in. Pre-pandemic, the Mumbai airport handled about 1.4 lakh passengers per day (January 2020), said a source. “For the month of January, Mumbai airport had registered a passenger traffic of 17.3 lakh, which crawled up to 17.8 lakh in February, then dropped to 15.8 lakh in March,” according to Directorate General of Civil Aviation data. The number dropped to 10.4 lakh in April, the source added. This May, India’s airports are largely deserted. According to the UK’s aviation data firm OAG, Indian airlines removed 2.4 million seats this month as compared to last. “In South Asia seats have fallen by 15.1% this month as a result of the significant increase in Covid cases in India,’’ said OAG. According to the source, between January and April this year, about 61 lakh passengers travelled to/from the Mumbai airport, which included about 54 lakh domestic passengers. “The passenger traffic was on a steady rise and in March we moved domestic operations to terminal 1 at Vile Parle in preparation for the coming summer rush. The state government had capped flight movement at the Mumbai airport to 300 flights per day and so back then that seemed to be a concern,” said an official from a low-cost carrier. Today, that is no longer a hurdle. The Mumbai airport used to handle over 980 flights on an average in a day, but currently handles an average of about 200 flights per day, said an air traffic control source. Air fares are generally a sure indicator of the drop in passenger traffic. Since they have been capped by the civil aviation ministry though, the fares have stayed in the median range with a Mumbai-Delhi return ticket for travel next week starting at about Rs 8,800.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/city-air-passenger-traffic-in-may-plunges-68-from-jan/articleshow/82639854.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Crackdown on inessential travel intensified in dist||Coimbatore: Police have tightened grip on the people venturing out onto the streets unnecessarily to enforce the total lockdown strictly and curb the spike in Covid-19 cases at a time when patients are struggling to find beds in hospitals and dying without oxygen support. On Friday, both the city and rural police had intensified the vehicle check and fined the violators, as a deterrent.According to a police source, more than 5,700 cases - 3,200 in the city limits and 2,500 in the rural limits - were registered on the day for violating the motor vehicles act and Covid-19 guidelines, especially face mask etiquette and social distancing. Police have blocked the entry to flyovers, including the second-level flyover at Gandhipuram and the one at Town Hall, and several major roads, including Mettupalayam Road to NSR Road at Saibaba Colony, to control the movement of the public. City deputy police commissioner (law and order) Stalin said, “We have deployed close to 1,000 police personnel and set up 39 check posts in addition to the 11 regular ones in the city limits to curtail the movement of people on the roads. With the Covid-19 cases continuing to surge and the city limits alone accounting for 70% of the caseload, we have intensified the vehicle check.”While the people who had stepped out of their house for genuine reasons were let go, others were penalized, he said. “They were fined Rs 200 to Rs 500, depending upon their violations.”Pointing out that norms were followed at most of the commercial places, the officer said they, along with the civic body, were taking steps to ensure 100% compliance to the guidelines at public places. “We are also advising the people to follow the government guidelines and seeking their 100% cooperation to control the virus spread.”District superintendent of police S Selvanagarathinam said another 1,000 police personnel and 350 home guards were deployed in the rural limits to beef up the vehicle check and ensure people were not venturing out onto the streets unnecessarily. “We have fined 1,000 people for not wearing face masks, 250 for not maintaining social distancing and another 1,250 for violating the motor vehicles act.”He said around 50 shops in the rural limits were fined for not following the government guidelines. “They allowed in customers without face masks and didn’t ensure social distancing. Some shops were functioning, despite the order to remain closed. If the penalized shops violate the norms again, we will seal them.” In neighbouring Tirupur too, police are strictly enforcing the lockdown norms. In that district, large crowds were seen on the streets in the past couple of days in violation of the lockdown guidelines. Now, police have intensified vehicle check and started penalizing the people roaming around without any purposes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/crackdown-on-inessential-travel-intensified-in-dist/articleshow/82643573.cms||Nivedha Selvam

Staff crunch due to quarantine and positive cases have compelled the hospitals to cancel the leaves. Last year as well, the break was cancelled. “Most of the residents have contracted the virus. They have to be quarantined. There is no other option,” said a faculty member. The OPDs and elective surgeries have also been deferred to utilise the available sources to tackle the second wave of Covid-19. “There are more than 500 faculty members in PGI who cannot be spared during the pandemic for vacations. Also, the OPDs are only through teleconsultation and if need be, patients are called physically,” said an official in the PGI’s administration. These hospitals have summer break for 15 days in rotation where a selected group of faculty goes on vacation and after they return, the next lot leaves. “Due to the present situation, vacations are not possible. So, we have cancelled them,” said Prof Jaswinder Kaur, director-principal, GMCH.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hospitals-cancel-summer-vacations/articleshow/82639863.cms||---

Only 30% of businesses, including foundries and exporters that are exempted from the lockdown, are functioning in the district, said Codissia president M V Ramesh Babu. “They are also struggling. In this situation, it would be of great help if the government could provide us additional loan up to 20% under emergency credit line guarantee scheme for half the interest rate at 6%,” he said.“We request the government to extend working capital of industries by another 20% in the pandemic situation. Interest should be waived for all loans, including cash credit facilities, for another one year,” Babu said. He also sought relaxation of non-performing assets (NPA) norms and extension till next March, reduction of income tax rate to 20%, full exemption for donations paid for Covid under Section 80(G), release of pending GST and IT refunds to industries and to bring fuel and petroleum products under the purview of GST.“It would become very difficult for industries, especially MSMEs, to survive the critical situation without government assistance. We urge the government to conduct special camps to provide Covid vaccines to workers,” Babu said.“As workers have started moving to their native places in large numbers, businesses, which were reviving, have been affected. This time, the impact of the pandemic on industries will be worse than the previous year,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/pandemic-hit-industries-seek-succour-from-govt/articleshow/82643570.cms||Nivedha Selvam

The biomedical waste generated by 920-bed Covid facility of Rajkot’s PDU hospital jumped to 31.5 metric tonne (Mt) in April as compared to January’s 11.97Mt. Cancer Hospital, the other Covid facility in Rajkot, generated 2.841Mt of biomedical waste in April. Biomedical waste includes items and equipment like PPE kits, masks, syringes and IV sets that are used while treating Covid-19 patients. Biomedical waste is like a ticking bomb that needs to be disposed-off properly to avoid mishaps. It is disposed-off as per the guidelines of Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB). According to hospital administration the Covid waste is discarded in double bags as a precaution. The PDU is one of the three civil hospitals of Gujarat that disinfects the disposable plastic waste material before sending it for final disposal, a process that involves the items being incinerated at the common facility centre near Kuvadva. At PDU, the waste material is disinfected in an industrial oven. PDU got this oven under a central government project. “This is a full proof system. Even if this waste doesn’t get incinerated it won’t be risky for the people because it has been disinfected in a microwave oven,” Hitendra Jakhariya, head of biomedical department of PDU hospital, said. The biomedical waste is segregated and is packed in bags with different colour codes because the disposal process for each waste is different. All kinds of disposable plastic materials are packed in red bags, needles and sharpeners in white bags, dress materials which can be burned are packed in yellow bags and injection vials, glass bottles are packed in blue bags before sending it to a common disposal facility. The waste has to be sent to the disposal facility within 48 hours of generation. Though the biomedical waste of PDU’s Covid facility has seen a big increase, its general waste has gone down. The general biomedical waste of PDU was 13.191 Mt in January which reduced to 10.774Mt in April.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/three-fold-rise-in-biomedical-waste-of-pdu-covid-facility-in-april/articleshow/82640077.cms||---

---||Ranchi||Eid celebrations low-key in state for second year in a row||RANCHI: Eid-ul-Fitr, the festival of joy, remained a low-key affair all through the state for the second year in succession. Owing to the pandemic, associated pain and grief in the society, apprehensions and restrictions by the administration on mass gathering, there were no mass prayers at Idgah, though people in small numbers offered prayers at mosques, while observing social distancing rules at the designated timing. Chief minister Hemant Soren extended greetings to the people of the state and prayed for the well-being of all and quick recovery from the pandemic. In his message, he also appealed to people to remain indoors and offer prayers at home to stop the spread of the virus. People mostly remained indoors and offered prayers at home abiding by the directive to avoid mass congregations at religious places. A scientist at Birsa Agriculture University, Dr Abdul Wadood, said that there was a marked difference in Eid celebrations than last year, even though the pandemic had started by then. “This year, coronavirus has been wreaking havoc and many people have passed away, fear is widespread in the society so mostly people avoided going for the mass prayer,” he said. He said that at least friends and relatives visited each other last year, though there was no mass prayers even in 2020. Muslims offered prayers in some mosques with proper social distancing. At Ramzan colony mosque, proper demarcations were made and people in batches of 30-40 offered namaz in three rounds, beginning at 5.45am. The general secretary of All India Muslim Majlis Mushavarat, Khurshid Hassan Rumi, said that though Eid comes as a gift to those who observe fast during the holy month of Ramzan, this year many people who were down with Covid could not fast religiously. “The sick and old are anyway exempted from fasting but Eid is like a gift from the Almighty and we expect things to improve now,” he said. However, even though a partial lockdown has been imposed in the state, the essentials related to Eid were available in the market and people bought new clothes, sevai and atar. Faiz Khan, a shopkeeper near Main Road, said that though the usual crowd was missing, people did some shopping within the stipulated hours. “Chand raat, the night of moon sighting, is usually huge business for the shopkeepers but this year, everything was closed. We can hope for better times as thousands of people offered prayers and sought everyone’s well-being,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/eid-celebrations-low-key-in-state-for-2nd-year-in-a-row/articleshow/82642043.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

The association’s general secretary, Ravi Bhatt, said delivery boys are distributing gas cylinders to homes of customers and come in close contact with persons who might be infected by Covid-19. He said many of them could be infected but keep on working as they are asymptomatic. Bhatt said, “Our delivery boys should have been vaccinated from the very beginning of the drive.” Reiterating the demand, a gas agency owner in Namkum, Amit Kumar, said his employees are forced to enter the homes of customers on many occasions. He said, “Many customers insist that the cylinders be brought till their kitchens. This raises the chances of close physical contact. Under these circumstances, the customers and delivery boys must understand each other’s compulsions.” Kumar further said two of his employees were infected while distributing gas cylinders and disrupted the office functioning. He said one of them was even ready to work, saying he was feeling fine but the risk was not taken. A large section of the delivery boys are young and have not been vaccinated.

Chanchal Kumari, the district child protection officer (DCPO), has urged citizens to report to the administration about such children through the state government’s toll-free numbers — 1098 and 181. “Besides the toll-free numbers, such matters can be reported over phone and through Whatsapp to 9304431077 and 7979725293,” Kumari added. Till Friday evening, however, no such cases were reported through the numbers, Kumari said. Pushpa Tirkey, the chairperson of District Child Welfare Committee (DCWC), said that children who lost their parents are being looked after by their guardians within the family. “That might be the reason we did not get such calls for help so far,” Tirkey added. Tirkey said children who need care and rehabilitation will be put up at the child care institutions in Patamda and Ghaghidih, where they will also be counseled. “Children, whose parents have died or are fighting Covid-19 and there’s none to cook food or take care of them at home, must be under mental stress,” Tirkey said. CWC officials said that unless people are made aware of the rehabilitation scheme, the response to it would not be encouraging.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/e-singhbhum-admin-to-rehabilitate-kids-of-cov-victims-sets-up-helpline-numbers/articleshow/82642543.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Of the total of 1.57 crore beneficiaries eligible in this phase, 37,682 people were vaccinated at 585 sites on the inaugural day. Another 40,900 beneficiaries booked their slots to take the jabs on Friday. Among those vaccinated, 856 people took their shots in Ranchi. Soren inaugurated the drive from the vaccination session site set up for the phase at Shri Krishna Institute of Public Administration (SKIPA) on Meur’s Road and he oversaw the vaccination of the first two beneficiaries. Health minister Banna Gupta and health department secretary Arun Kumar Singh were also present on the occasion. Talking to reporters after the inauguration, Soren said, “After much delay, we have begun the vaccination drive for the people aged between 18 and 44 years. We will provide free vaccines to everyone in the state.” Though Soren promised free vaccines for all in the state, the health department is yet to chalk out its strategy for initiating the drive in private hospitals of the state. As of Friday, Jharkhand had 1,483 session sites, of which 37 are private. Sources in the department said the vaccine will be administered at sites run by the government until further consignments of Covishield and Covaxin arrive in the state. Currently, Jharkhand has procured a little over four lakh doses for the drive. The beneficiaries seemed upbeat with the start of the drive amid the surge in Covid cases in the state. In Palamu, Chaibasa and Bokaro, long queues were seen at the session sites two hours before the scheduled opening at 10 am. After getting the jab at the Ranchi Women’s College on Circular Road, 20-year-old college-goer Samir Kumar said, “Vaccination is the only way to protect ourselves and our family members. Hence, I did not waste time and registered myself to get the shot.” Later in the day, Soren virtually inaugurated a new PSA oxygen plant which has been set up at the Sahibganj sadar hospital and inaugurated an RT-PCR testing facility. Speaking at the event, Soren directed the officials to ensure that village mukhiyas, ward councillors and zila parishad members among others are vaccinated on priority. “Stopping the spread of the Covid-19 virus in rural areas is our topmost priority,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cm-launches-free-vax-drive-for-18-44-yrs-38k-inoculated/articleshow/82642308.cms||---
---||Ranchi||‘Those in home isolation don’t need -ve report post recovery’||RANCHI: In a major change of standard operating procedures (SOP) for asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic Covid-19 patients in home isolation, the government on Thursday said such patients will not require a negative test report to step out of their homes once they complete their isolation period. Moreover, people testing negative before the mandatory 14-day period will be considered as recovered but they have to stay in isolation for seven days. In the revised SOP issued to all deputy commissioners of 24 districts, state department of health, medical education and family welfare secretary Arun Kumar Singh said, “Patients in home isolation will stand discharged and end isolation after 14 days from the onset of symptoms (or from the date of sampling as asymptomatic cases) and no fever for three days even without having a negative test report.” The new advisory also deems a person recovered if he or she has tested negative even before the completion of the mandatory 14 day isolation period. “However, the person should remain in quarantine for seven days as per the prevailing protocol,” the advisory read. Sources in the state health department said the move was aimed to reduce the load on government and private laboratories which are overwhelmed with samples for testing. Notably, suspected Covid-19 patients in Ranchi, urban areas and rural areas of the state have been complaining of inordinate delays in getting their reports. The issue of delayed reports was also raised with chief minister Hemant Soren by Ranchi MLA C P Singh and Bagodar MLA Vinod Kumar Singh at separate meetings and urged his government to ensure timely reports. Meanwhile, the health department also lifted the existing quarantine policy for doctors, nurses and health workers. According to an order in this regard, the department said medics and paramedical staff who had taken both doses of the Covid vaccine need not be in quarantine. Earlier, they had to stay in mandatory seven days quarantine after a stint of 15 days on duty.  “However, they should be tested after completion of that period (of their duty roster),” another letter by Singh to the DCs said. The move is aimed at maintaining the strength of doctors and paramedics at the hospitals, the department sources added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/those-in-home-isolation-dont-need-ve-report-post-recovery/articleshow/82642398.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Ranchi||Take action against pvt hosps for ‘fleecing’ Covid patients: Health dept to DCs of 5 dists||Ranchi: Following several complaints regarding over-charging by private hospitals for treating the Covid-19 patients from five districts, the state health department on Friday directed the DCs of the districts concerned to initiate action against such hospitals. A letter in this regard was issued by state nodal officer (home isolation) of the health department, Bhuvnesh Pratap Singh, directing the DCs to start an investigation into the matter with immediate effect. According to the letter, the health department has received six complaints of overcharging by private hospitals in the last 48 hours on their 104 helpline, which was set up to receive such complaints. Out of the six complaints, four were reported on Wednesday and the rest on Thursday. The complaints are against six hospitals, including two in Ranchi and one each in Bokaro, Dhanbad, Hazaribag and West Singhbhum. As per the contents of the letter, in Ranchi, the Kanke-based Ayushman Hospital has been accused of charging Rs 50,000 for two days of admission and another Rs 35,000 for administering medicines to the patient who was on oxygen support. While the Ormanjhi-based Jairam Hospital has reportedly charged a patient Rs 11,000 per day for providing an oxygen-equipped bed. In West Singhbhum, a hospital named Triple One Save Life has a patient Rs 35,000 per day for providing ventilator support. As per government rules, the maximum amount for providing ventilator-supported beds in the district is capped at Rs10,500. The Dhanbad-based Sunrise Nursing Home has charged Rs 15,000 per day for an oxygen-supported bed while Royal Hospital in Bokaro charged Rs 18,000 for the same. In Hazaribag, Keshav Hospital has been accused of charging Rs 20,000 per day for an oxygen supported bed and Rs 15,000 for a single dose of Remdesivir. According to the letter issued by the state health department, an asymptomatic patient will have to pay Rs 5,500 if they are getting admitted to non-NABH (National Accreditation Board for Hospitals & Healthcare Providers) hospitals and Rs 6,000 if they are in NABH-accredited hospitals in category A cities. For patients with mild symptoms under the same category, they will have to pay Rs 8,000 or Rs 12,000, depending on the hospital. Patients with severe symptoms but without ventilator support will have to pay Rs 13,000 or Rs 15,000, whereas, critical patients requiring ventilator support will have to pay Rs 15,000 (for non NABH) and Rs 18, 000 (for NABH-accredited hospitals). Under category B cities, the price at non-NABH and NABH facilities will be Rs 5,000 and Rs 5,500 for asymptomatic patients, Rs 6,400 and Rs 8,000 for patients with moderate symptoms, Rs 10,400 and Rs 12,000 for patients with severe symptoms but without ventilator support and Rs 12,000 and Rs 14,400 for critical patients with requiring ventilators.

Singh and all of his family members followed the Covid-19 guidelines and remained in home isolation. Although a heart patient for 20 years, Singh consumed the medicines provided by the district health department. “I did not lose hope and followed all the guidelines and protocols. The people at the district Covid-19 control room called me regularly and checked on my health. I tested negative on May 3 and so did my family members. It is a myth that people above 60 can’t beat Covid-19, and I am the proof of it,” Singh told TOI. Singh is not alone as several Covid-19 patients, who are above 60 years or with co-morbid conditions, defeated the deadly virus. It was anxious times for the family members of Jitan Shaw (55), a resident of Tilaiya. Shaw, who was in home isolation, was admitted to Domchanch Covid centre after his oxygen saturation level dipped to 57%. “I had given up hope. But due to the doctors and the nursing staff, I am alive today,” Shaw said. Poonam Mishra and Arun Mishra were admitted to the Domchanch Covid centre on April 1. “My husband’s condition worsened and oxygen saturation level started dipping. I got nervous, but the doctors and nurses at the hospital kept me motivated and my spirits high. I cant thank them enough,” Poonam, who was discharged on April 16, said. Singh, Shaw and Mishra are all praises for the efforts of the doctors and the district administration for helping them in times of need. For a district with frail health infrastructure, these are feats to savour. Deputy commissioner Ramesh Gholap said: “As on Thursday, we had 11,347 active cases. The recovery rate in our district is 89%, which is very encouraging. We initially had seven-oxygen supported beds, but now the number has risen to 160. If need be, we will add more. Our committed doctors and nursing staff are working tirelessly to manage the pandemic and ensure treatment to the patients,” Gholap said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/elderly-patients-beat-covid-19-inspire-others-not-to-lose-hope/articleshow/82642057.cms||---
---||India||Andhra patient dies as T’gana cops halt ambulance at border||VIJAYAWADA: A Covid-19 patient from Andhra Pradesh died on Friday on the state’s border with Telangana, inside the ambulance he was being carried in when it was stopped by Telangana police, reportedly for not having an entry pass. The ambulance was stopped at the Panchalingala check-post on NH-44 in Kurnool district. Even as the tragedy struck, Telangana high court on Friday stayed a circular issued by the state government restraining entry of ambulances carrying Covid patients from neighbouring states into its territory. Terming the May 11 circular by the state as ‘discriminatory’ and saying it “violates the right to life as guaranteed by the Constitution and runs contrary to the provisions of the Epidemics Act and Disaster Management Act,” a bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy issued notices to Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and central governments, asking them to file counters. Police said the victim was in a critical condition and the delay at the checkpost is believed to have worsened his condition. Despite criticism from the high court, police continued to stop ambulances from border areas. Another person had to be admitted at Nandyal Covid hospital when the ambulance’s oxygen reserves reached its lowest level. Kurnool police said there was a long queue of ambulances at Pullur toll plaza since Thursday after Telangana police started halting vehicles. “We are just following the instructions to allow only vehicles which have passes from Telangana police, or health officials,” a senior police officer told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/andhra-patient-dies-as-tgana-cops-halt-ambulance-at-border/articleshow/82648716.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti
---||Lucknow||UP deploys cops, CCTVs to stop dumping of bodies in rivers||NEW DELHI: Days after the Union Jal Shakti ministry and the National Mission for Clean Ganga expressed regret over bodies being dumped in the Ganga amid Covid-19 surge, Uttar Pradesh has rushed to deploy police teams asking people to refrain from conducting water burials on loudspeakers. It is monitoring activities on CCTV and video cameras. There is apprehension that the bodies were of Covid patients. UP police has now pressed into service 34 teams across Ghazipur and Ballia, including 18 ghats there, to keep vigil. The cops can be seen travelling on boats and telling people on public address systems to not immerse dead bodies in the river. State Disaster Relief Force (SDRF) and flood units of PAC are aiding the effort. UP additional director general of police, law and order, Prashant Kumar, said, "We have also deployed one team of SDRF each in seven districts -- Gorakhpur, Hamirpur, Varanasi, Ghazipur, Unnao, Kanpur and Hamirpur. In addition, flood companies of Pradeshik Armed Constabulary (PAC) have been pushed into action in 22 districts including Barabanki, Kaushambi, Raebareli, Deoria and Kushinagar where we believe such attempts to bury the dead will be made." A single six-km long stretch between Ghazipur and Saidpur has more than 200 policemen keeping watch on attempts to immerse bodies. Sixteen bodies were picked up from Ghazipur ghats in a span of two days this week with the help of 'Dom rajas'. These bodies were re-cremated but there were no claimants. UP police said these bodies could be from Prayagraj, Chandauli, Kanpur and Unnao. Ghazipur senior superintendent of police, Dr Om Prakash Singh, said that in some of the regions locals still practiced the ritual of ‘jal pravah’ (water burial). “We have told them to do bhumi samadhi (cremation), and offered to provide Rs 5,000 to bereaved families who can’t afford wood, rubber, sandalwood, etc, for the funeral," said Singh. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath directed gram pradhans and village development officers in rural areas and corporators in urban areas to form committees to reach out to people residing close to rivers and sensitize them on the issue. “Those who are losing lives deserve dignity in death and the government has allocated funds for their last rites. Bodies of those who die unattended or are not given a decent cremation should not be dumped in rivers. Their last rites must be performed according to their religious beliefs,” Yogi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-deploys-cops-cctvs-to-stop-dumping-of-bodies-in-rivers/articleshow/82648726.cms||Rohan Dua

The repatriation flights facilitated by the Australian government for its stranded citizens in India resumed from Friday following a two week ban. “Many passengers on the first flight on Friday were grounded due to Covid-19 positive test results,” Australian high commissioner to India Barry O’Farrell was quoted as saying by ABC News. About half of the 150 seats on the flight set to leave Delhi on Friday night will be left empty after over 40 people tested positive, meaning they and their close contacts — a total of about 70 people — cannot fly, the report said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/70-australians-to-remain-stranded-after-special-flight/articleshow/82648756.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: SEB steps up border vigil as smugglers try to bring in liquor from Telangana||VIJAYAWADA: Just as lockdown was announced in Telangana, local tipplers queued up to stock liquor, and so did smugglers who move liquor between the two Telugu states. Ever since the Andhra Pradesh government announced its new policy to prohibit liquor in a phased manner, smuggling in of liquor from Telangana has become a menace. The state government has increased liquor prices to discourage drinking and retail outlets are now being managed by the government. At such a time, smuggling of liquor from neighbouring states has become a lucrative business. Though the state government has established a dedicated special enforcement bureau (SEB) to stop liquor from flowing into the state, some organised rackets continue to operate. As the Telangana government imposed a lockdown to contain Covid-19 spread, wine shops witnessed unprecedented rush. Liquor smugglers from Andhra Pradesh made massive last-minute purchases. But now, they are finding it difficult to bring the liquor into the state. Anticipating movement among smugglers, SEB has stepped up vigilance at border check-posts and other vulnerable routes. The seizure of a truck load of liquor bottles at Pondugula under Dachepalli mandal in Guntur district shows the desperation of liquor smugglers. Cops unearthed 13,000 liquor bottles concealed under rice husk. Additional SP of SEB Md Arif said that the smugglers are trying to bring large quantities of liquor bottles immediately after the announcement of lockdown in Telangana. “We anticipated that the smugglers may resort to these kinds of activities and stepped up vigilance,” he said. Cops in Krishna district also seized large quantities of liquor of Telangana origin at Penuganchiprolu, Nuzividu and Tiruvuru areas after the lockdown was announced in Telangana. SEB officials are now focusing on interior village routes having connection with Telangana and liquor smugglers are now taking interior roads instead of highways to evade the police radar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/seb-steps-up-border-vigil-as-smugglers-try-to-bring-in-liquor-from-telangana/articleshow/82640453.cms||Srikanth Aluri

Speaking to the media, Singhal said that an oxygen express train is on its way from Durgapur in West Bengal with two tankers carrying 40MT oxygen. “It should reach Krishnapatnam port by tomorrow afternoon. Six tankers, carrying 100MT oxygen, will start from Jamnagar (Gujarat) this evening and reach Guntur day after tomorrow (Sunday),” he said. Similarly, four tankers with 80MT of oxygen would be dispatched from Jamshedpur, Jharkhand. This additional 230MT oxygen will give some cushion to the state in terms of oxygen management as around 10MT oxygen can be stored in every district, said the principal secretary. Singhal further said that the health department wants to streamline oxygen supply by transporting the tankers, empty and full, on trains in opposite directions. He added that another round of fever survey will start from Saturday and field level ANMs and ASHAs have been explained the survey methodology.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/ap-to-get-one-time-allotment-of-230mt-oxygen-over-and-above-its-daily-quota/articleshow/82640476.cms||---
---||India||Mumbai hospital doctors allege deaths due to oxygen crisis||MUMBAI: Low oxygen pressure and a shortage of doctors may have contributed to deaths of several Covid patients at BMC-run HBT Trauma Care Hospital in Jogeshwari, medical officers from the facility have alleged. In a letter to the hospital’s medical superintendent Dr Pramod Nagarkar, they said insufficient supply to oxygen cylinders at the peak of the second wave created “emergency situation at all times” putting doctors under “tremendous stress”. They added that doctors from an outsourced agency tendered to run the ICUs would leave before their shift was over, “neglecting” patients on O2 and ventilator support and putting lives at risk. They also highlighted an “increase in mortality” in mid-April. However, Dr Nagarkar and a top official in BMC said the allegations stemmed from discontent engendered by internal conflicts. Barring a few days in mid-April, when the city faced oxygen shortage, the hospital never ran short and its “mortality rate is comparable to any other Covid hospital,” said Dr Nagarkar. Speaking to TOI, one of the doctors who made the allegation said life-support devices would constantly beep low oxygen alerts after patient load increased in April. “Three weeks ago, there was a night when we had three patients die in a span of hours following low pressure,” the doctor said. The casualties were in the 58-68 years age group. “All were on the Bipap (non-invasive ventilator) needing 70-80% support, but the screen flashed that they were getting only 40%-50%,” the doctor said. Last year, there were similar allegations of deaths in the hospital due to low oxygen pressure following which an oxygen generation plant was installed.  The hospital’s original ICU bed capacity of 32 was augmented to nearly 45, but doctors say oxygen support did not rise proportionately, leading to drop in pressure. “Us working in ICUs wearing PPEs is all futile if we can’t save lives because of low oxygen,” one of the doctors said. The doctors claimed there have been over 213 deaths since March, including 145 in April alone. Hospital authorities have said there were 138 deaths since December. BMC does not release data on Covid-related fatalities from individual hospitals in Mumbai. The daily update is a compilation of the city’s overall casualty record.  One doctor who worked at Jogeshwari even alleged that he has seen a handful of young patients dying though they did not have any co-morbidities and came with 5-6% lung damage; they deteriorated possibly due to sub-optimal oxygen support. “It’s not just an issue of low O2 pressure but also lack of manpower in the ICUs,” the doctor added.  The hospital’s ICU was outsourced to Jeevan Jyot Trust in 2018. The agency is supposed to supply two doctors per shift for which BMC pays them Rs 1,800 per bed. Trauma doctors alleged that the trust has not provided adequate doctors or an intensivist, a charge that the trust’s spokesperson refuted. Superintendent Dr Nagarkar said the hospital did face a crisis from April 17-20 when all peripheral hospitals didn’t get oxygen supply. “Once that was sorted, there was no issue of oxygen crisis. The plant in the hospital generates 1,200 litres of oxygen per minute. In addition, we have 190 jumbo cylinders and 30 dura cylinders,” he said, adding that the complaints are being made by a few doctors who didn’t want to do their share of work. “The mortality rate is comparable to any other Covid hospital. There are some who probably don't want to share the blame and put it on so-called oxygen issues,” he said.  There have also been complaints about the hospital not providing health updates to relatives of patients who are admitted for COVID. A 36-year-old Jogeshwari resident said that his father was referred to another facility without informing them. “We were informed after three days. I would wait outside the hospital daily hoping to get some updates and suddenly one day they told me he was in another hospital,” he said. Local political representatives said they are flooded with calls from kin of patients to get health updates as the hosptal was unresponsive. The hospital was provided 7-8 cell phones by an NGO so that patients could call there. “But, none of the numbers appear to be working. There is no accountability on who is using those phone,” said the office bearer of a political leader.  A senior civic official said the allegations made by doctors must be seen in the light of internal conflicts between the hospital’s medical officers and their higherups. “We have done a detailed check into these deaths but haven’t found any truth,” the official said. About the three deaths, the official said all had comorbidities, including diabetes and Parkinsons, and were in a serious condition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mumbai-hospital-doctors-allege-deaths-due-to-oxygen-crisis/articleshow/82648793.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: Uninterrupted power to oxygen plants||VISAKHAPATNAM: Power utilities of Andhra Pradesh are laying special focus on providing uninterrupted power to oxygen plants in the state. There are 22 oxygen generating plants under the purview of three power distribution companies (discoms) with an energy demand of 2,49,196 KVA (kilo volt ampere). In course of the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Union power ministry took steps to ensure 24x7 power supply to 73 oxygen plants in the country. Correspondingly, the AP energy department has taken proactive measures including nomination of nodal officers for each oxygen plant and alternate power supply arrangements. The discoms are supplying 17.2 million units of electricity per annum to hospitals and Covid care centres. State energy secretary Srikant Nagulapalli, at a review meet on power supply to hospitals, requested power utilities to exert all efforts and asked officials to focus on uninterrupted supply to hospitals and 1.56 crore domestic consumers. Speaking on the financial health of the power sector, the energy secretary said that Covid-19 has caused an irrecoverable loss to the power sector financially and sales of discoms have dropped by 15 per cent and revenues have dropped at a similar rate. Talking about the impact of the pandemic on health of power sector workers, Srikant Nagulapalli said that Covid-19 has affected the health of more than 1,500 power staff. “We have taken steps to safeguard employees of the power sector and nominated nodal officers in every district to assist, coordinate with affected employees. The district nodal officer shall arrange credit cards, facilitate hospital beds, injections, oxygen cylinders and timely payments to hospitals,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/uninterrupted-power-to-oxygen-plants/articleshow/82640489.cms||---

Speaking on the occasion, Srinivas, who is also the minister for health, said that this Covid care centre is a role model for all other such centres in the state because it has oxygen support facility for all 300 beds. At the centre, two big oxygen tanks with 3,750 cubic metre capacity each have been arranged. Oxygen will be supplied to all 300 beds with pipelines. In case there is a problem with the oxygen supply, 200 oxygen cylinders of 60 litres capacity each have been kept by every bed. If that fails, every bed will also have 47-litre cylinders attached. In addition, 250 oxygen concentrators have been set up to ensure uninterrupted oxygen supply. “A few unfortunate incidents have taken place in the state due to oxygen (issues). If all Covid hospitals maintained the kind of facilities here, we could have saved lives. Earlier, the demand for oxygen in Covid hospitals was only 40MT, but now even 600MT is proving insufficient,” the health minister said. Rajya Sabha MP V Vijayasai Reddy, who is the main trustee of Pragati Bharati Charitable Trust, said of the Covid care centre: “The centre has 30 doctors, 60 nurses and eight technicians. Medicines and food will be supplied to patients free of cost. Patients’ family members will be able to see them through CCTV footage. No patient should die for lack of oxygen.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/new-covid-care-centre-comes-up-in-vizag-with-300-beds-oxygen-support/articleshow/82640553.cms||Siva G

---||Chandigarh||Malerkotla to be 23rd district of Punjab, says Punjab CM Amarinder Singh||CHANDIGARH: Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Friday declared Malerkotla as the 23rd district of the state and announced projects for the development of the historic city. He made the announcement during the state-level celebration of Eidul Fitr held virtually in view of the pandemic situation. Recalling the rich history of Malerkotla, Amarinder said its conversion into a district, which was a long-standing demand of the locals, would ease their hardships and enable them to resolve their administrative problems more seamlessly. Initially, said Amarinder, the sub-divisions of Malerkotla and Ahmedgarh, as well as the sub-tehsil of Amargarh, would be included in the newly-created district. The process of bringing villages under the jurisdiction of Malerkotla district would begin later, after the conclusion of the census operations, he added. The CM directed the deputy commissioner of Sangrur to find a suitable building to immediately start the functioning of the district administration office. The deputy commissioner for the newly-carved district would be appointed soon, he said. On the occasion, Amarinder underscored India’s secular character, which he said was manifested in the defeat of communal forces in the recent assembly elections in Tamil Nadu and West Bengal. Announcing development projects for the Malerkotla, the chief minister said that a government medical college, in the name of Nawab Sher Mohammed Khan would soon be set up at a cost of Rs 500 crore, and the state government had already allotted 25 acres of land on Raikot Road to enable the local boys and girls to pursue medical education. The first installment of Rs 50 crore for this purpose had already been sanctioned, he added. He also announced the establishment of a government college for girls as local students have to travel long distances. A new bus stand will also be constructed at a cost of Rs 10 crore, he said, adding that Malerkotla will also get a ‘Mahila Thana,’ to be exclusively managed by women. To ensure holistic urban development of Malerkotla, he also announced a sum of Rs 6 crore under the Urban Environment Improvement Program (UEIP). History of MalerkotlaTracing the city’s history, Amarinder pointed out that it was established in 1454 by Sheikh Sadruddin-i-Jahan from Afghanistan, and subsequently the State of Malerkotla was established in 1657 by Bayazid Khan. Malerkotla later merged with other nearby princely states to create the Patiala and East Punjab States Union (PEPSU). During the reorganisation of states in 1956, the territory of the erstwhile State of Malerkotla became part of the State of Punjab. He recalled his own cordial ties with the then Nawab of Malerkotla, whom he fondly called ‘Chachaji’ and who lovingly addressed him ‘Bhateej’ (nephew) during his early childhood visits to the city. Pointing to the city’s significance in Sikh history, Amarinder said people across the globe, especially Sikhs, revered Sher Mohammed Khan, former Nawab of Malerkotla, who raised his voice of protest against the inhuman act of torture and bricking alive of the younger Sahibzadas Baba Zorawar Singh and Baba Fateh Singh by the governor of Sirhind Wazir Khan. He added that thereafter, Guru Gobind Singh had blessed Nawab Sher Mohammed Khan and people of Malerkotla.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/malerkotla-to-be-23rd-district-of-punjab-says-punjab-cm-amarinder-singh/articleshow/82648827.cms||---

India recorded 3,26,332 new cases and 3,883 fatalities on Friday, as per TOI’s Covid data collated from state government figures. Daily cases have crossed the 3.5 lakh mark just on one day this week — Wednesday, when over 3.62 lakh infections were detected. In sharp contrast, the count last week was above 3.5 lakh on all days and had crossed 4 lakh on four days. On Friday, there were signs that the death count was beginning to drop slightly as well. The seven-day rolling average of daily deaths dropped below 4,000 after four days. The average dipped to 3,995 from the peak of 4,039. However, the case fatality rate (CFR, the percentage of deaths out of total people infected) continued to climb as fresh cases were falling at a faster rate than fatalities. India recorded a CFR of 1.12% in the past seven days, the highest during the second wave so far. Fresh cases continued to dip in several major states on Friday. Maharashtra reported less than 40,000 new infections for only the second time since March 31. The state reported 39,923 cases on Friday. Kerala too saw new cases dip to 34,694 while Delhi reported less than 10,000 daily cases, at 8,506, for the first time since April 10. Uttar Pradesh reported its lowest daily tally of 15,747 since April 12. Other states that continued to witness a sharp drop in cases include Chhattisgarh (7,594), Telangana (4,305), Haryana (10,608), Gujarat (9,995), Bihar (7,494) and MP (8,087). On the other hand, Tamil Nadu was among five states where daily cases were the highest till date. Tamil Nadu reported 31,892 fresh cases. Other states that saw a record count of cases were Bengal (20,846), Odisha (12,390), Manipur (726) and Meghalaya (627).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cases-dip-to-3-2-lakh-toll-remains-high-at-3883/articleshow/82648828.cms||---

One of the councillors of Yavatmal Municipal Council Nitin Giri, who is the ex-chairman of the health committee, has written to district collector Amol Yedge to act immediately to curb the outbreak of epidemic diseases and its spread in the city. “Garbage is not being cleared from the city since the last 3-4 months. Heaps of garbage are seen everywhere. Foul smell emitting from the uncleaned drainage causes health hazards,” said Giri. “ The city has also become a breeding ground for mosquitoes and neither the Municipal Council nor the district administration is taking any cognizance,” he added. A couple of councillors are deploying their own men and machinery to get the garbage cleared and are paying from their own pockets. In his letter, Giri also drew the collector’s attention towards vehicles worth Rs 5 crore purchased for collecting garbage which are gathering dust. “With Covid spreading, no effort is being made to sanitize the city. Citizens are paying taxes, but the funds are being utilized for non productive purposes,” alleged Giri. Meanwhile, residents of Muslim-dominated localities have threatened of dumping the garbage in front of the residence of the collector if he doesn’t solve the problem.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/yavatmal-becoming-a-garbage-dumping-ground/articleshow/82662110.cms||---

The death toll in the second week of May was more than double that of the first week: in all, more than 5,000 deaths have been reported in this month, 2,700 of these in Bengaluru alone. In comparison, during the peak of the first wave in terms of casualties, seen in August 2020, the state had recorded 3,388 deaths.

While speaking to the media afterThe daily death average for the state so far in May has been around 400; the number is 211 for Bengaluru. Never in the past 14 months has the daily average been so high for deaths. Between May 7 and 13, the state reported 3,500 deaths, a 107% increase from the 1,689 deaths between May 1 and 6. The toll was 1,448 between April 24 and 30. Bengaluru saw 157% rise in deaths this weekThe unprecedented spike in the past month or so is different. The system has been stretched to its limits. "Last year, you heard of families not finding ambulances or beds only in the beginning when protocols were being put in place and there was stigma. This time, there’s a genuine problem,” an official said. Experts said most of these deaths were of patients from last two weeks of April and that deaths from the surge in cases seen in May would become apparent in the last two weeks of the month, and possibly spill over to June. While more than 2.6 lakh cases were reported in the first six days of this month, it jumped to more than 2.9 lakh cases between May 7 and 13.

Thoriyali, a village located around some 52kms away from Rajkot city having population of around 4500, has been badly hit by Covid-19.“In last one month as many as 35 people have died in our village. We suspect all these deaths were due to Covid-19 infections. Still, neither health officials nor any other government team had visited our village,” Govind Pethaliya, sarpanch, Thoriyali village, told TOI. On Friday, kin of deceased who reportedly succumbed to coronavirus infections, held a protest in Thoriyali village. Holding the photographs of the deceased, they demanded that government should provide basic health facility and increase testing for Covid-19 to detect cases early.“Hardly any Covid-19 testing was being done at our village. Half of those who died in the past one month were not tested for Covid-19 and that’s how the infection spread in the village. On Friday, when we lodged a protest about the lack of health facilities, a government team arrived and carried out testing which resulted in 10 positive cases being detected,” Pethaliya added.“As on Friday, around 30 villagers are Covid-19 positive and many of them are in home isolation. Those who can afford treatment go to Padadhari town or Rajkot city,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/villagers-fume-over-35-covid-fatalities-in-a-month/articleshow/82640153.cms||---

In NCH 57 patients are under treatment while in SMIMER, 26 patients are under treatment. Seven patients’ surgeries were done for mucormycosis, while six were operated in SMIMER. In both the hospitals, separate wards have been created for MM patients.  At NCH, separate wards for men and women with 40 beds each have been set up with oxygen support and ventilators on standby. NCH has requested the government to supply 2,000 amphotericin-B injections while SMC has also placed request for this drug which is the only treatment for the fungus. “Due to heavy use of steroids in the treatment of Covid-19 patients, especially those with diabetes, many are developing MM. SMC is trying to ensure that these patients get proper treatment at government hospitals,” said a senior SMC official.  Apart from government hospitals, nearly 150 are admitted in different private hospitals at present. With the rising number of patients, the biggest challenge for their families is shortage of the amphotericin-B.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/mucormycosis-spreading-in-surat/articleshow/82640295.cms||---
---||Vadodara||Vadodara: Good karma returns decade later with a lifeline||VADODARA: Your actions shape your fate. What you do will come back — good or bad. That’s karma — believe it or not. Nor did this brother duo in Vadodara who were fighting Covid together in a hospital and good deed done once returned with a life saving gift for one of the brothers. Shekhar Shah and his brother Rajesh (names changed) were infected with Covid and Rajesh’s condition turned a shade worse needing remdesivir urgently to save his life, while the hospital ran out of stock. Interestingly, a good samaritan donated three unused vials of the life-saving injection to the hospital at the same time which was enough to save Rajesh, who is now stable and recovering. The physician who is treating the duo, however, saw a deeper karmic effect in the connection. “While he was lucky to have got the doses in the nick of time, I feel that the brothers’ good karma is what saved Rajesh’s life,” Dr Bhavesh Patel, a city-based physician who has a clinic in Nizampura, told TOI. “A physiotherapist I was treating had donated three remdesivir injections on the same day that the brothers were admitted. She had arranged for the injections for her father-in-law but he passed away during treatment. While she and her father too had recovered from the killer virus recently, the woman wanted to donate the vials to save more lives. She asked me to administer the vials to some needy patient. I too gave them to Rajesh for free,” Dr Patel said. He further stated that the Shahs stay in Atladara while their father too was under his treatment for tuberculosis. Around 12 years ago, the old man passed away from age-related ailments. Shekhar had then met Dr Patel and handed him Rs 5,000. “He said that he didn’t want to spend the money on the rituals and instead asked me to use the amount to treat or buy medicine for any poor patient,” Dr Patel recalled, adding that the gesture touched him looking at the fact that Shekhar and Rajesh worked in a factory and their financial condition wasn’t very stable. “Over a decade later, this benevolent act by the physiotherapist, who too comes from a middle-class family, saved Rajesh’s life. Good deeds never go to waste,” Dr Patel added wistfully.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/good-karma-returns-decade-later-with-a-lifeline/articleshow/82639806.cms||Tushar Tere

In Thalisain block of Pauri Garhwal, hundreds of people in around 30 villages have come down with fever and cough, according to local sources. Suresh Chandra, head of Patuli village, confirmed that dozens in just his village are suffering. “But no one has been tested yet. There is panic all around and many are in self-isolation. It has been over a week since people started falling sick,” Chandra said. Kuldeep Rawat from Pajyana village said that he has spoken to several people from nearby villages and estimates that close to a thousand people are showing Covid-like symptoms but no one has come for testing yet. The nearest testing centre from Pajyana is 25km away and locals said that the ongoing lockdown has made it difficult for them to travel. “If any of us show severe symptoms, we will have to either travel to Srinagar Medical College, which is 90 km away or to Dehradun, which is close to 250 km from here,” said Rawat.

---||Goa||No complaints of drop in O2 pressure at GMC: Govt to HC in status report||Panaji: In a status report filed before the high court of Bombay at Goa on Friday, the state government said that no complaints about drop in oxygen pressure were received by it on the intervening night of Thursday and Friday at Goa Medical College. “The undersigned and Dr Tariq Thomas, secretary (UD) were personally present from 10pm till 5.45am to monitor the situation at the new manifold site, and no complaints were received by us during this period about drop in pressure,” the status report filed by health secretary Ravi Dhawan stated. The court had directed the government to file a status report by Friday evening regarding the action taken by it on oxygen supply to patients. Referring to the supply of oxygen trolleys and cylinders, the government informed that from 8am of May 13 to 8am of May 14, a total of 62 oxygen trolleys were supplied at the GMC. In addition, a total of 600 jumbo cylinders and 47 small cylinders were also supplied. Regarding logistical issues with respect to the oxygen supply, the report stated that it has arranged for eight trained and experienced tractor drivers from Kolhapur and two high-powered tractors to ferry oxygen trolleys to GMC. The court had pulled up the government on Thursday after it explained that 15 deaths at GMC may have taken place at night due to logistical issues involved in manoeuvring the tractor that carries the oxygen trolleys and in connecting the cylinders to the manifold. During this process there was some interruption, which resulted in fall of pressure in the supply lines to patients, the government had stated. The report stated that five drivers arrived in the afternoon and have been deployed. The remaining three will arrive by late Friday evening. On the progress on the installation of the liquid medical oxygen tank (LMO) at GMC, the report stated, “The erection work of the tank is underway and the civil works required for the installation of the tank will be completed by May 14. Piping and welding of the gas pipelines will be completed by May 15 and purging and other safety checks of the installation would be carried out on May 16. The LMO tank is expected to be operationalised by May 17.” Regarding Dura cylinders, the government said that two were obtained from M/s Scoop Oxygen Pvt Ltd and were commissioned at the new Covid manifold site around 6pm on Thursday. “After their commissioning and observation of their performance over a 12-hour period of high demand in the night, it may be concluded that while Dura cylinders were useful in helping prolong the duration of oxygen supply from a given trolley, they do not act as an alternative. Despite this limitation, by helping prolong the duration of supply from the trolley, they help reduce the change over time and thus are useful,” the report noted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-complaints-of-drop-in-o2-pressure-at-gmc-govt-to-hc-in-status-report/articleshow/82644326.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||4 IAS officers work through the night to iron out glitches||Panaji: Four IAS officers laboured through the intervening night of Thursday and Friday to avert fluctuations in the central oxygen line of Goa Medical College (GMC) as tractors loaded with 48 oxygen cylinders each throttled in reverse through the narrow alley winding into the basement of the state’s biggest hospital, at an interval of every half-hour. Secretaries Kunal, Ravi Dhawan (health), Tariq Thomas, and Shashank Tripathi stood guard till early morning ensuring that the trolleys safely entered the basement. For the fresher drivers, some of whom have been pulled from “field duty” in the state’s agriculture department, it is a daunting task to get a tractor in the basement without any mishap and to refill the main tank. “It is difficult as I’m used to driving a tractor in the fields. At times there is nobody to guide our descent to the basement,” said a 30-something driver from the agriculture department. He has been put on GMC duty of driving tractors carrying oxygen cylinders from Scoop Industries Pvt Ltd’s plant. The hospital’s oxygen consumption has increased manifold since the state’s case positivity rate rose over 40%. Unable to work out any other express system as yet to maintain the supply of oxygen, the administration has been forced to rely on tractors to bring in cylinders. Much depends on how efficiently the drivers bring in the loaded trolleys. “I pray that I’m able to carry out the task without an accident and those pugs don’t come under the tires,” one driver said. Whoever helps him negotiate through the slender passage, has to keep a tab on the three dogs. “They (pugs) have been here for the last eight days and sometimes run in the middle of the lane,” said Prasad Tangekar, 24, employed with the GMC on a contract basis to keep a count of the incoming trolleys and vehicles carrying cylinders. At times he helps the tractor drivers. “Sometimes the cops on duty help,” said Tangekar. Besides tractors, a couple of tempos carrying loose oxygen cylinders make trips throughout the night, which are taken by young men in their twenties into the wards. All work for a monthly salary of Rs 12,000 without any night allowance. “I don’t get any allowance apart from my salary,” said the young man in such a hurry that he did not have time to push up the mask that had fallen below his nose as he pushed the filled steel cylinders unloaded from a tempo. The high court of Bombay at Goa is monitoring the Covid management of the state’s premier hospital, after deaths were reported during the dark hours. The court warned that it would not like to see a repeat of the previous two nights when 41 people died, which is now blamed on dips in the central oxygen supply line. As night fell the officers continued to watch the situation and reportedly there were no fluctuations. Ashley Delaney, who has a relative admitted in ward 147 and had red-flagged the deaths happening in the night coinciding with disruptions in oxygen supply on May 3 through social media, told TOI, “I rushed to the hospital as I was alerted that there was a problem. I checked, but it has been taken care of.” Since the time he has been accompanying his relative from April 23, he said for the first time — on the intervening night of Thursday and Friday — he did not come across any issues related to oxygen supply. It was 3am and he prepared to rest on a chair outside ward 147 with the hope that the oxygen supply will be smooth.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/4-ias-officers-work-through-the-night-to-iron-out-glitches/articleshow/82644382.cms||Bindiya Chari

He also announced a triple lockdown, with more restrictions, in four districts — Thiruvananthapuram, Thrissur, Ernakulam and Malappuram — from May 16-23. "The test positivity rate is increasing across districts. We also need to bring the districts with a steep rise in Covid patients under strict restrictions," he told a news conference. The state had gone for a 9-day total shutdown from May 8 to contain the rising Covid spread. On Friday, the state reported 34,694 cases and 93 deaths. The number of active cases is 4,42,194 while the test positivity rate is 26.41%. Vijayan said the impact of lockdown measures would be evident only after some more days. "Experts have said the month of May is very crucial for Kerala. Lockdown measures have helped the north Indian states to contain the second wave of Covid. That is a good sign. We will be able to control Covid casualties if we could show maximum care during May," he said. The chief minister said the free distribution of foodkits for 85 lakh families would continue in June also. The original scheme would have ended in May. In view of the extended lockdown, the disbursement of social security pensions for May to the tune of Rs 833.23 crore will be completed at the earliest. Also, special financial support of Rs 1,000 will be given to members of various welfare boards. Those BPL families not included in the welfare board scheme will get Rs 1,000 each as one-time assistance through Kudumbasree units,” the chief minister said. As many as 19,500 Kudumbashree area development societies will be granted Rs 1 lakh each as revolving grant. The interest subsidy, part of the CM's Sahaya Hastam scheme through Kudumbasree (Rs 93 crore), will be given in advance. The interest subsidy for Kudubasree's Resurgent Kerala Loan scheme (Rs 76 crore) will also be released in advance, he said. “The state government will ask the Centre to ensure a six-month moratorium on repayment of loans given to Kudumbasree units. The moratorium will be made applicable to loans given by cooperative banks to Kudumbasree units,” he said, adding that the deadlines for payment of property, tourism taxes and licence renewals will be extended. On the heavy rain forecast, the chief minister said the state had taken all possible precautions. The ban on fishing will continue until further announcement. “The emergency operations centre (EOC) of the State Disaster Management Authority is closely following the low depression and its effects. The emergency control rooms are functioning round the clock in all districts. The EOC can be contacted over toll free number 1077,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/lockdown-extended-in-kerala-till-may-23/articleshow/82648918.cms||---
---||Kochi||Lockdown extended in Kerala till May 23||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The total lockdown enforced in the state till May 16 has been extended till May 23 in view of the rising Covid-19 test positivity rate, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said here on Friday. He also announced a triple lockdown, with more restrictions, in four districts — Thiruvananthapuram, Thrissur, Ernakulam and Malappuram — from May 16-23. "The test positivity rate is increasing across districts. We also need to bring the districts with a steep rise in Covid patients under strict restrictions," he told a news conference. The state had gone for a 9-day total shutdown from May 8 to contain the rising Covid spread. On Friday, the state reported 34,694 cases and 93 deaths. The number of active cases is 4,42,194 while the test positivity rate is 26.41%. Vijayan said the impact of lockdown measures would be evident only after some more days. "Experts have said the month of May is very crucial for Kerala. Lockdown measures have helped the north Indian states to contain the second wave of Covid. That is a good sign. We will be able to control Covid casualties if we could show maximum care during May," he said. The chief minister said the free distribution of foodkits for 85 lakh families would continue in June also. The original scheme would have ended in May. In view of the extended lockdown, the disbursement of social security pensions for May to the tune of Rs 833.23 crore will be completed at the earliest. Also, special financial support of Rs 1,000 will be given to members of various welfare boards. Those BPL families not included in the welfare board scheme will get Rs 1,000 each as one-time assistance through Kudumbasree units,” the chief minister said. As many as 19,500 Kudumbashree area development societies will be granted Rs 1 lakh each as revolving grant.

The decision was taken after several Covid patients lost their lives at the state-run premier hospital due interrupted oxygen supply. Deputy superintendent of police Edwin Colaco told TOI that Goa police has created a green corridor so that there is no obstruction while transporting oxygen to GMC. He said that even the oxygen trolley tractor is being escorted by a police control room (PCR) van to facilitate faster movement. “Every 20 minutes one tractor trolley is being escorted from the manufacturing unit to GMC,” he said. Further, to speed up the dispatch of the oxygen trolley and the change of cylinders at GMC, police personnel have been deployed at both the hospital and manufacturing plant, Colaco said. “One PI, one PSI and 10 police personnel have been deployed round the clock at the oxygen plant and one PI, two PSI and 10 police personnel have been deployed at the GMC,” he said. Once the oxygen trolley nears GMC, police clear the way and help it reach the changing point quickly, Colaco added. On Wednesday the HC had heard a slew of PILs on Covid mismanagement, including oxygen shortages, and had directed the state government to ensure there were no more deaths due to interruption in oxygen supply at GMC. Health secretary Ravi Dhawan had told the court on Thursday that the state government has created a “green corridor” for every trolley to and from the hospital with PCR pilots so that not a minute is wasted on the road. The HC, while reminding the Goa government about the duty cast on it by Article 21 of the Constitution to ensure that “life is not extinguished” due to inability to supply oxygen to Covid-19 patients, had directed the administration to take steps to ensure that there are no casualties due to deficit in oxygen supply at GMC. While stating that the situation about the supply of oxygen at GMC is “quite grim”, the court ordered the government to make efforts to provide oxygen in the required amount.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/police-create-green-corridor-for-quick-movement-of-o2/articleshow/82644436.cms||---
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Small hospitals struggle as Covid-19 cases increase||CHENNAI: Hospitals scrambled for supplies of lifesaving oxygen on Friday as Tamil Nadu reported a spike in Covid-19 cases and deaths, straining the state’s resources, overwhelming the healthcare system and leaving doctors and nurses exhausted. In Chennai, there were tense moments overnight at the VHS hospital, which has more than 50 oxygen-dependent patients, 30 of them in the ICU, as oxygen supplies fell to dangerously low levels — just enough for 20 minutes — a little before midnight. The oxygen truck arrived in the nick of time and supplied 1,000 litres of liquid medical oxygen. Ten hours later, tension mounted again. Nurses and technicians dragged out 44 mobile cylinders to the patients’ bedside. Hospital authorities were sitting at the edge of their seats because the supply truck was getting delayed again. The tank lasts for about 10 hours. “I had 50 lives at stake. Each of these cylinders last between 5-7 minutes depending on how much oxygen a patient requires,” said secretary Dr S Suresh. The hospital management briefed patients’ relatives about the situation, called other hospitals asking if they would take in critical patients, and made a desperate call to the state’s unified control room. The government sent a dozen additional cylinders within a few minutes. “There is no other buffer. We used them till the oxygen truck came,” Dr Suresh said. The staff were waiting for more than six hours to refill empty cylinders from an industrial plant in Gummidipoondi. Many hospitals across the city reported a similar crisis in the past three days. Over the past 48 hours, 24 of the 70 beds in VHS are vacant. Several other hospitals – including some major institutions such as MIOT Hospitals – have stopped admitting patients and some of them refer patients admitted under them to GHs if their condition deteriorates. Over the past few days, the daily requirement for oxygen has crossed 419 tonnes in Tamil Nadu. The state has diverted industrial oxygen and called for manufacturers to ramp up production. On Friday, the state received 80 tonnes of oxygen by train from Odisha. The train left Container Corporation of India Depot at Tondiarpet again at 10am on Friday and is expected to return on Monday with oxygen from Kalinganagar in Odissa. “We have been allotted so much by the Centre. We are requesting them to give us more,” said health minister M Subramanian. While he reiterated that the state will initiate action against private hospitals referring patients to the GH, doctors said they were left with no option. IMA state secretary A K Ravikumar said, “Doctors across hospitals, particularly small ones, tell us stories of how they wait with bated breath for refills. If patients volunteer to get oxygen concentrators we encourage them.” Several hospitals in the city too asked patients to bring oxygen concentrators if they require just 5 litres of oxygen a minute.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-small-hospitals-struggle-as-covid-19-cases-increase/articleshow/82648907.cms||Pushpa Narayan

This is the lowest daily tally in 27 days. On April 17, the state had recorded 9,541 cases. Gujarat recorded104 deaths on Friday compared to 97 on April17. While it may be too early to cheer, state officials said it was definitely a reason to get relieved as the figures suggest that the state may have tided over the peak of the second wave after all. The analysis of Covid cases however presented a contrasting picture for the cities and rest of Gujarat – the eight municipal corporation areas in the past 10 days recorded 61,346 positive cases, which were 31.5% down from 89,543 cases recorded in its previous 10 days (April 25-May 4). During the same period, the rest of Gujarat reported a rise of 8.8% in cases – from 49,192 to 53,530 cases. For Ahmedabad city, it was 29-day lowest daily tally at 2,764, whereas for Surat, it was 37-day lowest. Mortality however has remained constant for the cities and state at large in the past 10 days. At 1.17 lakh active cases, it was an 18-day low for the state. Dr Kirit Gadhvi, president of Ahmedabad Medical Association (AMA), said that there is definite dip in the calls the citybased doctors are receiving for the beds, oxygen and medicines. “But there’s still scarcity of the ICU and ventilator beds across the city. It is time to build on the resources. We cannot afford any laxity,” he said. Dr Bharat Gadhvi, president of Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (AHNA), said that the association has written to the Gujarat CM not to extend any relaxations in the current restrictions. “With great efforts we have come out of one of the worst phases of the pandemic. It would sound like the death knell of the healthcare system if the state is again faced with the same burden of daily cases,” he said. Dr Dhiren Mehta, a citybased physician, said that the daily OPDs at various clinics for the fever and other Covid-19 symptoms have gone down. “However, every fever case should be investigated and treated. We must not let our guards down. Identifying cases quickly and isolating them has remained a sure-shot method to prevent the spread,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-19-gujarat-records-less-than-10000-daily-cases-1st-time-in-27-days/articleshow/82648856.cms||---

Mayor Rohit Monseratte also announced that the civic body would not charge any amount for the hearse van to transport bodies within the jurisdiction of Panaji, but that an amount of Rs 500 would be charged to transport the corpse from Goa Medical College to the crematorium. “Considering the current Covid crisis prevailing in the state, CCP has decided to waive the additional amount of Rs 1,000 which was charged for those bodies other than that of Panaji residents. The rates will be Rs 100,” Monserrate said. He warned citizens about unscrupulous agents fleecing people for cremations. Residents have been informed that the hearse van is available for Panaji till 7pm while cremation for Covid deaths will be permitted between 2pm and 7pm. The CCP charges Rs 100 for issue of NOC and Rs 2,800 is charged towards wood cost, which is payable to the managing committee of the Hindu crematorium, Monserrate said. “Other than the above mentioned amount. No amount should be paid to anyone,” the mayor said. However, CCP workers will not help shift or handle any Covid bodies at the crematorium due to the health risk attached and the need for safety precautions. Relatives will have to carry proper documentation for the cremation, particularly a doctor’s certificate regarding the death slip. Aadhar card or any other government ID card will also be required. CCP will permit just 10 persons to attend the cremation. “If anyone demands any additional money other than mentioned above. I request you to please call and report the same to my OSD John Rodrigues,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ccp-wont-charge-for-cremation-of-non-panaji-victims/articleshow/82644484.cms||---

It took 15 days for the family to recover. In that time, Ahmad’s perspective on life had changed. Now Ahmad, a manager with Indian Bank, and three of his childhood friends — Raghav Sharan Goel, a realtor; Nazim, a Jal Nigam contractor, and Bhupender Sharma, a journalist — have got together, pooling their resources, to set up a 20-bed Covid care centre in Bijnor’s Dhampur town. “It was tough,” Ahmad, in his mid-30s like his friends, said. “My family and I were down. I resolved to fight back. I also vowed that after I am fine, I will help others do the same. Once on my feet, my friends joined me. I began contacting authorities. I immediately got positive responses from people when I spoke about setting up the facility.” The stay and treatment is free at the centre. It was a small beginning but a much-needed one in a town with no government hospital for Covid-19 patients. What Ahmad and his friends did was turn a small school into a Covid-19 hospital with 15 oxygen-equipped beds and five without. They also arranged for two doctors and nursing staff.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-government-facility-4-friends-build-20-bed-covid-centre-in-bijnor/articleshow/82648946.cms||Harveer Dabas

The man, identified as Veer Singh, cremated his mother, who was a former uppradhan of Bhangwar panchayat, and died alone at home on Wednesday. Distressing images of the man from Ranital area of Kangra district walking to the cremation ground on Thursday went viral on social media. In a similar incident in Hamirpur district, a Covid-19 patient died at Bhakredi panchayat and no villager turned up for the last rites. The deceased’s son, a Covid-19 patient himself, contacted local MLA Inderdutt Lakhanpal, who arranged the last rites as per Covid-19 protocol. The CM said that the administration concerned must ensure that the family members of Covid-19 patients get full support and cooperation from the district administration in performing the last rites of their dead.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/villager-carries-mothers-body-alone-as-others-refuse-to-help/articleshow/82648964.cms||---

The number of active cases went up to1.9 lakh, while the Covid case tally crossed15 lakh and cumulative toll was at17,056. On Friday, patients found it difficult to get a bed and hospitals were fighting hard to battle shortage of oxygen, life-saving drugs and disposables. Several hospitals stopped admissions and raised red flags as oxygen supply dipped and queues for medicines such as remdesiver grew longer. “In our new protocol, admission is based on symptoms and treatment is based on scientific evidence. We have blocked admissions for people with oxygen saturation above 94, so that beds can be used for people who really need it,” said director of public health Dr T S Selvavinayagam. “More than anything, we have allowed smaller hospitals, including primary health centres, to offer pre-hospital care for critically ill patients. They can administer oxygen and start them on medication such as steroids before they are allotted beds in tertiary care centres,” he said. The protocol received commendations as it removed controversial drugs such as ivermectin — medication used to treat many types of parasite infestations — and steroids for patients requiring home isolation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/new-protocol-for-covid-19-tn-to-allow-hospital-admissions-based-on-symptoms/articleshow/82648969.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Mother down with coronavirus, grandmother breastfeeds the girl||AHMEDABAD: What all can a mother do for her daughter? At a time when the world is fighting death and disease unleashed by Covid-19 pandemic, a mother in a village in Anand district of Gujarat gave birth to her own girl's child as a surrogate. What's more, when the daughter and her husband fell sick with Covid during the deadly second wave, the nani breastfed the grand-daughter and ensured she was healthy and kicking when the parents returned home from the hospital. There is more to this fascinating tale of motherhood. The grandmother delivered the granddaughter on the same day when she had delivered her daughter. “It was like a sign from God when doctors gave us the delivery date of April 6, which is my birthday too,” says Kavita Patel (name changed on request). Kavita says while Covid-19 pandemic has caused death and hurt all around, her family was blessed with a child which was awaited ever since she got married in 2008. Woman chose surrogacy after six miscarriages After more than half a dozen miscarriages, death of a premature baby and near-death experience, it was a defining moment for the family when her mother promised her that she would become her surrogate. “She retired as a class-1 officer from the Gujarat government and got pregnant with our embryo last year during the Covid pandemic. She is 59 years and is healthy. I am blessed to have a mother like her,” says Kavita. Incidentally, a day after the daughter came home, both parents tested positive for Covid-19 on April 12. "My husband and I got isolated at home but after my husband developed complications, we had to travel to Vadodara to get admitted as there was no hospital bed available in Anand or Ahmedabad," said Kavita. "My daughter, however, was with Nani who breastfed her and did all the housework alone despite having undergone a cesarean section. I cannot ever express gratitude for my mother for what she has done for us," said Kavita. Kavita told TOI she was diagnosed with fibroids at a very young age. Post her marriage when she got pregnant with her first child, she was diagnosed with adenomyosis, a condition in which endometrial tissue exists within and grows into the uterine wall. "In the first pregnancy, the foetus did not develop a heartbeat. In another pregnancy, the child was delivered at 23 weeks which died after 23 days. In all, I had seven miscarriages wherein once I even got a brain stroke. That is when the neuro-surgeon said that I should not get pregnant as it may prove lifethreatening," said Kavita. Kavita says her family believes in the Swaminarayan sect and got blessings from the temple for her mother to become her surrogate. "My sister-in-law too had offered to be my surrogate but she lives abroad and her travel could get disrupted due to lockdowns locally and globally," says Kavita.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-mother-down-with-coronavirus-grandmother-breastfeeds-the-girl/articleshow/82648967.cms||Radha Sharma

It has been decided to begin the vaccination from Monday, said chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan. However, the CM said due to shortage of vaccines a priority list will be issued before Monday. Those who have comorbidities will get the first preference. The CM said as per the Centre’s directive, the second dose could be taken only after 84 days of the first dose from Saturday onwards. He said the experts have pointed out that the vaccination will be more effective if the second dose is taken between 84 and 112 days. New testing strategy: The state has revised the testing strategy. If a patient is tested positive after antigen test, then there will be no RT-PCR test to reconfirm it. It has also been decided not to conduct tests for discharging a positive patient. As per the new norm, if the patient is asymptomatic, then he/she can be discharged and such patients should continue in home quarantine for seven days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kerala-vaccine-registration-of-18-starts-from-today/articleshow/82648974.cms||---

During the hearing on the PIL regarding oxygen shortage in Goa, advocate general Devidas Pangam informed the court that in “genuine cases, arrangements will be made to issue the necessary NOCs so that there is no serious difficulty in having these cylinders filled up”. Pangam said that the process for NGOs, like Red Cross, Rotary Club, and other individuals to refill oxygen cylinders will be streamlined by Thursday evening. “The authorities who are to issue such NOCs will be available to such parties, so that there is no delay in issuance of NOC in genuine and deserving cases. Some system will be put in place so that there are no difficulties on this score,” Pangam said in a statement before the court. The court “accepted as well as appreciated” the state government’s stand. TOI had highlighted on two consecutive days how North Goa collector Ajit Roy had halted refilling of oxygen supplies and had stopped supply of oxygen to private hospitals and primary health centres (PHC) to shore up supply to GMC. Roy has placed police personnel and revenue department officials outside Scoop Industries to ensure that oxygen is supplied only to GMC and that cylinders of private hospitals and other oxygen suppliers are not refilled unless accompanied by his permission. The state government also made it mandatory for medical oxygen suppliers and manufactures to refill oxygen cylinders for citizens and volunteer groups only if accompanied by a prescription issued by a PHC or government doctor at any of the Covid-19 hospitals in the state. “Our entire revenue staff is placed at the supplier’s manufacturing unit and we were monitoring from time to time the outward movement of each trolley,” health secretary Ravi Dhawan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-to-create-system-to-release-o2-to-ngos-pvt-hosps-volunteer-grps/articleshow/82617341.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Covid-19: Positivity rate in 50% of districts tops Maharashtra's average||MUMBAI: Almost 50% of Maharashtra’s 36 districts have a positivity rate that is higher than the state average, underlining that testing is suboptimal in many areas and transmission rates high. Maharashtra’s 7-day average positivity rate was 22.5% in the week ending May 11. Positivity rate in seven districts — Ahmednagar, Beed, Buldhana, Parbhani, Satara, Sindhudurg, and Nashik—was more than 30%. In another 10, including Sangli, Jalna, Hingoli, it was 23-27%. Only Jalgaon had a weekly positivity of less than 10%. Mumbai, with 14.3%, was among six districts with less than 15% positivity. TimesViewPositivity is a function of the quantum of tests and sampling population. Districts with a high rate must broaden their coverage to screen more individuals who may be high risk contacts of patients or vulnerable in other ways. Unless the local administration carries out random testing in public places or containment zones, it is unlikely to widen its base. Spread the net to detect or rule out infections — that should be the motto to successfully chase the virus.A high positivity rate is an indicator of fewer tests being done. A large number of those being tested in such scenarios are likely to be those showing symptoms or admitted to hospitals, while the pre- or asymptomatic go undetected and thus carry the risk of spreading the infection.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); Numbers show the state has been carrying out an average 2.3 lakh tests though there was a dip in second week of May. On May 10, the number dropped to 1.9 lakh. Ahmednagar has state’s highest 7-day positivity rate at 40%Hingoli, Palghar, Buldhana, Nandurbar and Dhule are doing less than one lakh tests per million. Officials attributed the drop to factors such as shortage of antigen kits and redeployment of health workers for the vaccination drive. Epidemiologist Dr Giridhara Babu said states cannot afford to reduce testing at this stage. “A sudden drop in tests can result in lack of clarity on actual number of cases,” he said, adding Karnataka, Assam and Kerala were also seeing a decline in testing. Dr Pradeep Awate, state’s surveillance officer, said a decline in cases may have marginally reduced testing since the number of high risk and low risk contacts have reduced. “In the first wave, we never crossed 1 lakh tests in a day, but in the second wave, we touched almost 3 lakh tests,” he said, adding there was no slowdown in testing. A report presented to the cabinet showed Ahmednagar had the highest weekly positivity rate (40%). Civic surgeon Dr Sunil Pokharna blamed it on a drop in daily testing due to shortage of antigen kits. Read AlsoMumbai: Panel to monitor aid reconstitutedMumbai: The state government on Friday reconstituted its committee to monitor disbursement of one-time aid announced for various categories of people in the wake of the lockdown. The panel had become defunct as members had retired. The government has now appointed 11 new members to the committee“We are getting supplies in the next few days and tests will increase to 20,000,” he said. The district has seen a sharp rise in weekly cases—from 22,950 between April 28 and May 4 to 24,499 the following week. An officer from Buldhana, the district with second highest positivity, said a lot of health staffers may have been deployed in vaccination centres so testing numbers may have marginally dropped. “We are still conducting 5,000 tests daily,” he said. In Satara (positivity rate of 33%), district health officer Dr Athalye said they were doing an average 6,000-7,000 tests. “We are doing more than the target set by government. Our projection is positivity will start declining in the next two weeks,” said Dr Athalye, adding the district was approaching its peak and was adding nearly 2,000 cases every day. Yavatmal collector Dr Amol Yedge said positivity in the district is lower than the state average due to high number of tests. The district has done 5 lakh tests till date, which is rare for any district of similar population, he added. An official from Mumbai said the city’s daily positivity was now down to 7-8%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/covid-19-positivity-rate-in-50-of-districts-tops-maharashtra-average/articleshow/82648975.cms||Sumitra Debroy

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Mamata Banerjee writes to PM Narendra Modi , seeks clarity on oxygen plant supply||KOLKATA: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday to end the indecisiveness on how many pressure swing absorption (PSA) oxygen plants will be supplied to Bengal, questioning the lack of clarity on why from an initial promise of 70 such plants it has now been scaled down to 4. Banerjee said the Centre’s continued lack of clarity was “disturbing” the state’s own plans to set up PSA plants in hospitals by its own agencies and using its own funds. Bengal is trying to ramp up medical oxygen availability by setting up such plants in all state facilities to defuse any potential crisis due to lack of oxygen. Banerjee wrote: “For quite some time, GoI apparently has been contemplating to supply PSA plants to hospitals in states. But the matter is not progressing much. Priorities are being fixed and re-fixed, implementing agencies (DRDO, NHAI) are being settled and unsettled, quota for West Bengal is being downwardly revised and further downwardly revised everyday. We were told that we shall get 70 PSA plants, now we are told that we shall get 4 in the first phase with no clarity on the remaining PSA plants!” She further wrote: “I request you to kindly get the priorities, implementing agencies and quota fixed, justly fairly and quickly. Our own supplementary PSA installation plans by our state agencies and on the strength of our own funds are getting disturbed because of the indecisiveness at Delhi.” The CM iterated that the battle against Covid would be won with “coordinated and collaborative efforts” of all stakeholders in augmenting infrastructure. On May 6, Banerjee had also announced a one-time approval for all private health facilities, both nursing homes and hospitals, to scale up their bed capacity by 40% for Covid patients. This approval was also granted to all 105 Covid facilities in the state – both state-run and private – to set up their own PSA medical oxygen generation plants. Hospitals would need no additional approvals so as to save time. PSA plants, the CM said, would generate medical oxygen from ambient air. “This has been done to cut time. They need not wait for any approval. The Diamond Harbour hospital and Cooch Behar hospital have already made their own plants,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mamata-writes-to-pm-seeks-clarity-on-oxygen-plant-supply/articleshow/82643539.cms||---
---||Kolkata||7 lakh Bengal farmers receive Rs 2,000 Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman cash in bank accounts||Kolkata: The Centre has made a direct transfer of Rs 2,000 to bank accounts of each of 7 lakh Bengal farmers under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi. KOLKATA: Prime Minister Narendra Modi chose the occasion of Akshaya Tritiya and Eid to announce the money transfer on Friday, a week after the Bengal government joined the scheme in early May. Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar had written to chief minister Mamata Banerjee urging her to give the go-ahead to fund transfer to eligible farmers in Bengal who couldn’t avail the benefits so far. The state home department tweeted on its official handle that Bengal had submitted the data to the Centre, and added that the state was not invited to the PM-Kisan fund release programme in which CMs of some other states were among invitees. Bengal officials told TOI that the PM-Kisan nodal officer engaged by the state government gave the letter of authority to State Bank of India to auto-debit the sanctioned amount to each beneficiary account from the scheme fund allotted to the state. Disbursement under PM-Kisan had become an election issue during the recently held Bengal polls. Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah kept blaming the Bengal CM for coming in the way of fund disbursement and thus denying benefits to 7 lakh state farmers. The BJP brass had promised to transfer the PM-Kisan intsalment along with Rs 18,000 arrears for the last three years to each Bengal farmer’s account the day the party assumed office in Bengal. For the moment, Bengal farmers have received Rs 2,000 as the first instalment (May-June) when farmers in other states have got the same amount as eighth instalment. “The Centre, under the PM-Kisan fund, released Rs 20,000 crore for a total 9.5 crore farmers in the country. We have been striving for the last few years to ensure that the PM-Kisan programme has 100% saturation level, with no farmer being left out. Recently, West Bengal has joined the scheme,” Tomar said. Addressing farmers virtually, the PM announced that government procurement of paddy and wheat at MSP rates increased by 10% this year compared to last year. “The government has spent Rs 58,000 crore in procurement of paddy and wheat. Farmers didn’t have to wait for the money. They received it through direct transfer in their bank accounts,” Modi said. The PM also announced that his government released Rs 26,000 crore for sending rations free to poor households during the second wave of Covid (May-June). The Centre has also extended the renewal date of Kisan Credit Card it had issued to farmers to access institutional loans. “We have extended the Kisan Credit Card renewal date to June 30. Farmers who availed loans at 4% interest have to repay the loan by the extended date,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/7l-bengal-farmers-receive-rs-2k-pm-kisan-cash-in-bank-a/cs/articleshow/82643398.cms||---

According to CBI sources, the agency has shot off a letter to the state government, asking for details of the order approving parole for both the convicts. Both Kottoor and Sephy have been released on parole as part of Covid-induced prison decongestion process, citing that they are above 60 and 50 years of age, respectively. The sources said that it would have been proper for the state government to inform CBI about such matters in advance, especially when the case was investigated and fought by the agency to ensure that the culprits are brought to book. Sister Abhaya, a Knanaya Catholic sister, was found dead in a water well in St Pius X Convent in Kottayam on March 27, 1992. Investigation into this death is by far the longest running murder probe in Kerala. Kottoor and Sephy were convicted in the case by a CBI court on December 23 last year.

---||Kolkata||Sitalkuchi probe: CID calls 6 Central Industrial Security Force men over 8 days in Kolkata||Kolkata: The CID has once again summoned six CISF personnel for questioning in connection with the April 10 Sitalkuchi firing, but on different dates unlike last time. “We have summoned one officer/jawan each day between May 25 and June 2,” said DIG (Special) Kalyan Mukherjee. A deputy commandant, an inspector and four constables of the CISF had earlier been summoned by the CID’s Sitalkuchi SIT on May 11, albeit on a day’s notice. None of them could appear in person at the state agency’s Bhawani Bhavan headquarters in Kolkata. Sleuths explained why summoning one CISF man at a time had its merits. First, it will allow them enough time to thoroughly question each person. Second, they will get the required opportunity to study the statement of one before questioning another. “We will begin with the constables and gradually move up the hierarchy,” said an officer. “We have given the CISF sufficient time to send its men to Kolkata. The questioning will span eight days,” he added. CID officers said their questionnaire would revolve around the circumstances under which CISF personnel had to open fire outside a Sitalkuchi booth in Cooch Behar during the fourth phase of assembly polls. An important question will be who gave the firing the go-ahead. “We need to corroborate our findings/evidence acquired from various sources such as eyewitness accounts and autopsy reports. The CISF’s version will help us take the investigations forward,” an officer said. Senior CISF officers in Delhi did not respond to calls from TOI on Friday. The office of DIG (Operations) cited Eid holiday as the reason. Anil Pandey, DIG (Operations) and CPRO of the CISF, had told this newspaper on May 10 that they were ready to cooperate with the probe, but arranging appearance at short notice was a logistical challenge since all personnel had returned to their base stations. The SIT has already quizzed five Bengal police officers, including the Mathabhanga SDPO and IC. The CID brass said they had not yet asked suspended Cooch Behar SP Debasish Dhar to join the investigations. But, a senior officer mentioned that “everyone involved will have to record their statement”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/sitalkuchi-probe-cid-calls-6-cisf-men-over-8-days/articleshow/82643144.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The governor will be discharging his constitutional duty. We have already submitted what we have gathered over all these days. Our party activist Debabrata Maity from Nandigram died in a Kolkata hospital on Friday. Reports of deaths are coming in from Birbhum also,” Adhikari said. BJP MP Nisith Pramanik had accompanied governor Jagdeep Dhankhar to violence-hit areas in Cooch Behar’s Sitalkuchi and also the Ranpagli camp in Assam’s Dhubri district where Assam has set up a camp for Cooch Behar victims who had to leave their homes after poll results were declared on May 2. Adhikari alleged violence was continuing in three Nandigram villages. “Some of them voted for the ruling party. Yet, they were tortured,” he said. Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh alleged that police stations were not taking torture complaints. “Instead, police are slapping cases on the complainants. Crucial identity documents like Aadhaar and voter IDs are being snatched from them. Many people in West Midnapore, East Midnapore and Burdwan’s Katwa have fled their homes,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/suvendu-to-skip-guvs-visit-to-nandigram/articleshow/82643977.cms||---

The varsity has started preparation by conducting test runs to hold the exam in a hassle-free manner. Before the second wave of Covid-19 started, VNSGU conducted a majority of the exams for the previous semester in offline mode. However, with sudden rise in cases, colleges and universities were closed in midst of the ongoing exams. In the current situation the university syndicate has decided to conduct exam through online mode. “All the exams will be conducted for the previous semester and the current semester. Once we finish the pending exam, schedule for the current semester exam will be announced later,” said K N Chavda, vice-chancellor, VNSGU. University has planned to conduct the exam online in multiple choice question format. For the online test, a link will be shared on the university website and mobile application. Students can click on the link and they will be diverted to the separate page. After login the student can access the question paper. For the university the biggest challenge will be to plan a foolproof exam since students appear in hundreds of different subjects and papers. The student will get a limited time to answer each question to prevent them from checking books or asking some person. “Students can appear in exams from their home or any other place. In the first round, exam of around 9,000 PG and UG students will be held,” added Chavda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/vnsgu-to-conduct-online-exams-for-pg-ug-courses/articleshow/82640288.cms||---

The leopard was chased away to the jungle by forest department officials after the attacks on Thursday. According to sources, the incident took place in the Lakhana Gojiya village. The series of attacks began in the morning and continued in the evening on Thursday. The leopard first attacked an elderly woman who had gone near the forest in the area. Forest officials reached the spot after hearing about the incident. The leopard was not seen throughout the day despite several efforts. It was believed that the leopard had returned to the jungle, but on the same day in the evening, the leopard attacked four youths. The youths were standing on the side of a road and talking when the leopard approached them and attacked them. After the attack, the leopard hid on a tree in the area. Forest officials reached there the spot and ensured that the leopard went into the jungle without hurting anyone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/leopard-attacks-five-in-dahod/articleshow/82639515.cms||---
---||Kolkata||‘Uneasy’ choice for doctors as Kolkata hospitals prioritise treatment||KOLKATA: The triaging system now in place in hospitals is forcing doctors to make choices they did not think they would ever have to in their professional life. Triaging refers to the practice of optimising scarce resources during times of emergencies and disasters. It prioritises patients’ treatments by the severity of their condition or chances of recovery without treatment. In the current pandemic, there has been growing global agreement about triage in order to limit resource strain. With Kolkata adding nearly 4,000 Covid-positive patients a day and hospitals running out of beds within hours of adding fresh ones, doctors say they are left with no choice but triage. Hospitals acknowledge the pressure to empty out beds is immense; so, the more critical patients are being taken in for treatment. What this means is that the borderline cases — patients who haven’t recovered completely — are being discharged earlier than they ideally would have. The family of an octogenarian admitted to a Covid facility was told, 48 hours after admission, that the patient was to be discharged. When they checked with doctors, they learnt the patient’s oxygen-saturation level was still hovering between 82% and 84%. This is hardly a one-off case. “We are having to discharge some patients who we would have kept in hospital for two-three days,” said a doctor at a government hospital. “We did not face this during the first wave.” Rahul Jain, internal medicine expert at Belle Vue Clinic, said “the bed crisis would become even more acute” if triaging was not done. It’s necessary to not completely deny treatment to the more critical patients, he explained. In another private hospital, a 39-year-old patient, who was recovering well in HDU, but still requiring oxygen support, was shifted to the general ward so that that HDU bed could be offered to a more serious patient. “This patient should have been ideally monitored in the HDU for at least two more days,” said a doctor. “But we had no choice.” With the state health department issuing a strict discharge protocol and teams from the department visiting Covid hospitals regularly to decongest beds, hospitals say they have to decrease the patient turnover time. The number of daily discharges has gone up massively since the beginning of May. In about a month, the number of fresh cases has risen about five-fold, whereas the daily discharge has increased 14-fold. “The job is very difficult in the emergency triage area, where we are flooded with patients,” said an emergency consultant of a private hospital. “Even as many patients gasp for breath, we have to choose which of them should be given an HDU or ICU bed when one opens up.” Any which way, it’s a tough call. What to do in case of a patient who’s still recuperating and can ordinarily be taken care of at home, but for whom there is no caregiver, as his/her entire family is infected? The question has no easy answers. “If it were not for the bed crisis, we could have given a few more days to those patients who are unsure about going home,” said Raja Dhar, pulmonologist, CMRI Hospital. “We try to counsel such patients by offering them options like staying at satellite centres if they have no caregiver at home.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/uneasy-choice-for-docs-as-city-hospitals-prioritise-treatment/articleshow/82644851.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||4 Black Fungus cases from Bihar and Jharkhand found in Bengal||KOLKATA: Four cases of Mucormycosis or Black Fungus — a rare but serious condition among recovered Covid patients — have been reported in Bengal, days after experts sounded the warning. Two of the patients are undergoing treatment at a hospital in Durgapur. All four cases involve patients from Bihar and Jharkhand, and were reported by eye hospital chain Disha. Three of them are men, aged 35, 40 and 50; the other is a 65-year-old woman. The infection was detected between May 7 and 13. “Three patients — from Nawada, Dumka and another town in Jharkhand — had come down to our hospitals after experiencing facial pain and dimness of vision in one eye,” said Debasish Bhattacharya, CMD, Disha Eye Hospitals. “The fourth, from Bhagalpur, had done online consultation. All of them had recovered from Covid. Since the Black Fungus treatment requires a multi-disciplinary approach, the two patients were sent to Bengal Healthworld in Durgapur. Both are doing fine. We have assured the hospital of our help if need arises,” he added. Caused by a group of fungi known as Mucormycetes, found in the natural environment, it often affects the sinus, lungs and the brain. Early symptoms include sinus pain or nasal blockage on one side of the face, one-sided headache, swelling or numbness, toothache and loosening of teeth. The fungus, found in the environment, affects people who are severely immunocompromised. It could be fatal in some cases. It is important to avoid self-medication with steroids. Good diabetes control is essential,” said Fortis Hospital pulmonologist Susmita Roy Choudhury. Covid treatment in the second wave has seen use of steroids, not always judicious. This has led to some patients’ immune system being compromised. Diabetics who have undergone Covid treatment, needing oxygen support and steroid, are most susceptible, say experts. “While steroids can reduce lung inflammation, it also suppresses the immune system and pushes up sugar levels, making a section of patients, especially diabetics, susceptible. The fungi thrive in moist conditions, like the water used as humidifier during oxygen therapy, if proper clearing is not done,” explained Santanu Tripathi, former head of clinical and experimental pharmacology, School of Tropical Medicine Kolkata. Of the four patients, three had come with a condition called central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO), in which there is blockage of blood to the retina in one eye. This causes sudden loss of vision. “We usually encounter only four-five cases of CRAO in a year. But now, we have got three cases in a week. This is alarming. One patient is losing sight in one eye totally,” Bhattacharya said. Doctors have called for more judicious use of steroids to control diabetes, which usually shoots up during Covid if the patient is on Tocilizumab and ventilation. Intravenous prophylactic antifungal therapy should be considered. The water used in oxygen humidifiers should be distilled or mineral water, and not tap water. Catheters and masks should be changed frequently as well, Bhattacharya added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/4-black-fungus-cases-from-bihar-and-jharkhand-found-in-bengal/articleshow/82644950.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar visits Assam shelter, TMC blames ‘partial’ role||SILIGURI/KOLKATA: Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Friday drew a contrast between Bengal’s and Assam’s administrative response during his visit to violence-hit Sitalkuchi in Cooch Behar and Rangpagli camp in Dhubri. The Assam government had set up the Rangpagli shelter for people who had to flee their homes after the assembly election results were announced on May 2. “While at Coochbehar the DM and the SP remained non-responsive and incommunicado, at Rangpagli the divisional commissioner, special DGP, DM and SP were all present,” the governor tweeted. Dhankhar had to take the road from Cooch Behar to Dhubri and was accompanied by BJP MP Nisith Pramanik. He urged the Mamata Banerjee government to “give up the confrontationist approach” and take the “cooperative and constitutional” stance to restore the rule of law. Trinamool Congress’ Rajya Sabha MP Sukhendu Sekhar Roy accused Dhankhar of being partial for not visiting the homes of Sitalkuchi firing victims or those of TMC workers killed in violence in Cooch Behar. “The governor is trying to instigate unrest when the situation in Bengal has been peaceful since May 9,” Roy said, adding that Dhankhar was unfit for his post. “He should be immediately removed.” Roy further said that it was about time BJP leaders learned to accept the popular mandate, which was in favour of the Trinamool in Bengal. Dhankhar, at a news meet in Siliguri later in the day, said hundreds of people had to leave their homes. “Why did these people take shelter in other places? They did so because they felt the (Bengal) administration couldn’t protect them. If less than 10 people can stop the governor’s car, how can the common man bank on the administration? As a ‘sevak’ of the people, it is a shame on me too,” he said. Sharing the “agony of victim families” at Rangpagli camp, Dinhata and Sitalkuchi, the governor held that the Cooch Behar district administration could have prevented violence through effective area domination. “The rogues took away all belongings of these families. They chopped off the legs of a father of two daughters. It is an open secret who all did it and who were the victims,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/guv-visits-assam-shelter-tmc-blames-partial-role/articleshow/82643266.cms||---

Police and onlookers said the car was speeding and lost control when it hit the tanker. The car was headed towards Burdwan. The deceased have been identified as Pradip Mondal, Santu Dutta and Bikas Singh, all aged around 35. They were taken to the Singur Rural Hospital where they were declared dead on arrival. The lone survivor, who has been admitted to Chinsurah Imambara Hospital, is critical. Police were informed by local shop-owners after the accident happened around 10am. “The deceased were drivers who were headed to Burdwan for some work. We have sent the bodies for post-mortem. Prima facie, it seems that speeding and recklessness are the causes but we need to find out if the driver was drunk,” said OC of Singur police station, Arnab Ganguly. The second wave of the pandemic has reduced the number of vehicles plying on Durgapur Expressway and the road remains empty most of the day. Drivers are often found dangerously speeding along that stretch, locals said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/car-rams-tanker-on-durgapur-expressway-3-killed-on-spot/articleshow/82644068.cms||Falguni Banerjee
---||Rajkot||With no cases till now, Rajkot village shows how to keep corona at bay||RAJKOT: While the rest of Gujarat is reeling under the onslaught of second wave of Covid, a village, located just 40kms from Rajkot, has managed to keep the dreaded virus at bay. Whereas the neighbouring city of Rajkot has 39,000 registered Covid cases, Gundala hasn’t seen a single positive case till date. Ever since the first Covid-19 case was registered in the state in March 2020, the residents of Gundala — numbering around 1,000 — have not let their guard down. Strict adherence to Covid guidelines, no entry to outsiders without a negative Covid report, close monitoring and a society that cares for all its members have combined to make Gundala ‘a model village’ . The District Development Office is encouraging other villages to follow the ‘Gundala model’. “We congratulate Gundala villagers and sarpanch for their efforts to keep away Covid infection. We are promoting this Gundala as a model village and guiding other villages to follow this model,” said A R Ranavasia, district development officer of Rajkot. Jilubhai Gamara, sarpanch of Gundala, informed that all the Covid guidelines are strictly followed by the villagers. “Our village hasn’t reported a single positive case till now. Villagers have been strictly warned against unnecessarily coming out of their homes and crowding at grocery stores or other shops,” Gamara informed. Apart from strict implementation of guidelines, the village also takes care of all its residents. Many among the villagers don’t have farmland and they work as labourers in nearby industries. However, when the industries are closed due to the lockdown the gram panchayat provides them with 50% of their daily wage. The unemployed labourers are also provided with free vegetables and groceries. If anyone falls ill the village sarpanch and the gram panchayat wastes no time in coordinating with nearby hospitals and arranging ambulances. The district health team examines the patients if anybody complains of cold, cough or fever. Though Gundala hasn’t reported a positive case till now, the villagers have set up a basic Covid Care Centre at the local Primary School as a precautionary measure. The health department too has helped in setting up of the Covid Care Centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/with-no-cases-till-now-rajkot-village-shows-how-to-keep-corona-at-bay/articleshow/82640190.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Rs 18,000 was promised, only Rs 2,000 paid, says Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee||KOLKATA: Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, in an open letter to farmers on Friday, criticised the Centre for its dilly-dallying tactics on PM Kisan as it released the first instalment of funds. She wrote that Bengal’s farmers got much less than the promised Rs 18,000. The Centre released Rs 2,000 each to around seven lakh farmers in Bengal. Banerjee wrote that the Bengal government had started the Krishak Bandhu scheme in 2018, which became a role model for the country. She said the decision to extend the benefits of PM Kisan to eligible farmers in Bengal was a result of her government’s constant fight. “You were supposed to get Rs 18,000, but have received a very small amount. Even this sum would not have been transferred if we had not fought for it,” the CM stressed, saying she would continue the fight. The Bengal home department, in a statement on Friday, said: “Due to the demand and actions of CM and GOWB, 7 lakh farmers of West Bengal got their due entitlement, the first instalment of Kisan Samman Nidhi, by direct transfer as per data submitted by State.” “In 2019, the PM Kisan (Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi) was launched. The scheme of Bengal government is much better as it offers more benefits to farmers and it includes all categories of farmers, while PM Kisan excludes categories like sharecroppers and bargadars,” the CM wrote. Banerjee added that the Bengal government planned to add incentives to the Krishak Bandhu scheme in the near future. Under the programme launched in 2019, the central government is providing Rs 6,000 in three instalments to 14 crore farmers annually. The amount is transferred into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries through the direct benefit transfer mode. The CM had repeatedly written to the PM and on the issue and the last letter was sent on May 6. She had said that the PM should instruct the Union agriculture ministry to release funds to farmers of Bengal. “Under the Krishak Bandhu scheme introduced from December 2018, Rs 1,498 crore was disbursed to 57.67 lakh eligible farmers and Rs 242 crore was disbursed till February 2021 to families as death benefits. Bengal gives Rs 2 lakh to families of deceased farmers for deaths within 60 years of age,” Banerjee mentioned in her letter. Trinamool MP Sukhendu Sekhar Roy also criticised the Centre, saying the PM had promised Rs 18,000 during poll campaign and was paying only Rs 2,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rs-18000-was-promised-only-rs-2000-paid-didi/articleshow/82644080.cms||---

IBM, which was supposed to start its vaccination programme this month, has told its employees that it has been pushed back, two people familiar with the matter said. The company has more than 1 lakh employees in the country. “We are in touch with our partners and the hospitals on a regular basis to assess the situation on ground and will open up vaccination for our employees, in line with government regulations and basis the availability of vaccination at the earliest possible date.’’ Chaitanya Sreenivas, HR head, IBM India, told TOI. TCS, with close to 5 lakh employees worldwide, is looking to procure doses via suppliers to ensure its staff and their family are covered. While the company did run some initial camps on a pilot basis, vaccination on the original scale planned is still to commence, a person familiar with the matter said. “We are setting up vaccination centres across the country in our offices and with our primary medical partner. To ensure a smooth experience, a core team will work with hospitals and suppliers for procuring and administering vaccines across cities in India,” TCS said. Wipro said towards the end of April, they held the first vaccination camp for employees above the age of 45 in Bengaluru. A similar camp was held in Chennai. Industry body Nasscom, in a letter to PM Narendra Modi earlier this week, said that while the vaccine regime has been liberalised, availability of it for the private sector continues to be challenging and urged the government to authorise emergency use of WHO-approved vaccines of Pfizer and Moderna. It also requested the government to allow Nasscom members to procure vaccines from Indian stocks. The industry employs 45 lakh people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/vaccine-shortage-stymies-it-cos-inoculation-drive/articleshow/82649165.cms||Avik Das

It is also planning to become a 13-million-tonne cement company in the next few years. Kesoram CEO P Radhakrishnan disclosed this to TOI on Friday after the board meeting of the company which has now become predominantly a cement outfit after demerger of tyre business into a new entity Birla Tyres. The city-based company has come back into the black in the fourth quarter of 2020-21 with a net profit of Rs 52.1 crore from a loss of Rs 453 crore in the same period last year. The revenue of the company has also doubled to Rs 806 crore from Rs 498.8 crore in the year-ago period. The board of Kesoram has also approved equity raising to the tune of Rs 600 crore out of which Rs 200 crore would be raised through a rights offer. “Initially, we shall go for rights issues and later would look for other equity instruments. The fund raised through this will be primarily used to reduce debt,” he added. According to him, Kesoram now has a debt of Rs 1,842 crore. After the rights issue, it was reduced to Rs 1,642 crore and after the remaining equity issue, it would settle at Rs 1,300-1,350 crore. “With the kind of EBITDA we are expecting, we should be able to reduce debt further,” he added. Commenting on cement capacity expansion, he added that it has a capacity of 7.5 million tonne and 60% of this is OPC (ordinary Portland cement). “By making blended cement (PPC, PSC), we can easily raise it to over 8 million tonne and then shall look for capacity expansion further,” he added. In March this year, Kesoram had completed the debt restructuring making itself free from bank debt. Earlier, the company had converted some portion of its debt of lenders to equity. The company had allotted Rs 459 crore of optionally convertible debentures (OCD) and Rs 1,600 crore of non-convertible debentures to Goldman Sachs, Sarvara Investment Fund of Cerberus Capital Management,and Edelweiss group along with others. Main lenders of the company were: SBI, Axis Bank, South Indian Bank, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, WBIDFC along with others. After the conversion of a portion of debt these lenders would have 10-13% in the company while promoters holding has come down from 53% to 45%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/kesoram-eyes-rs-500cr-ebitda-in-fy22-debt-free-tag/articleshow/82642658.cms||---
