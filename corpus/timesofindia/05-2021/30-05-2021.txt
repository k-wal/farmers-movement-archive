In a statement on Friday, the Islamabad-based National Institute of Health (NIH), the country’s top government-run health institute, stated that results of whole-genome sequencing of SARS CoV-2 samples collected during the first three weeks of May confirmed seven cases of B.1.351 (variant seen first in South Africa) and one case of B.1.617.2. "This is the first in-country detection of the latter strain," the statement said. Earlier this month, the B.1.617.2 variant had been detected in travelers from Thailand visiting Pakistan. Health authorities in Thailand later said the country’s first two cases of that variant were a Thai woman and her four-year-old son, both of whom were put in quarantine since arriving from Islamabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/pakistan-reports-first-case-of-covid-variant-found-in-india/articleshow/83073388.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

After handing over the contribution, the civic body officials said that they wanted to contribute the sum towards the relief fund for putting the state back on its feet by overcoming the Covid-19 second wave. State BJP president Sadanand Shet Tanavade had urged the chief minister to extend the curfew by a week.

In just three weeks, the seven-day average of daily cases has fallen to half the number recorded at the peak of infection on May 8. The average fell below 2 lakh on Saturday and stood at 1,95,183, almost exactly 50% of the peak of 3,91,263, as per TOI’s Covid database collated daily from state government figures. The 50% reduction in average daily cases in the second wave has come in half the time as compared with the first wave of the pandemic in the country. In the first wave, average daily cases had peaked at 93,735 on September 17. The number had fallen to half by October 30, six weeks later. Coronavirus in India: Live updatesThe daily death toll hasn't followed the same steep downward slope yet. The seven-day average of daily fatalities has fallen by around 18% from the peak, not counting the over 5,000 deaths from earlier months added to Maharashtra's tally during this period. Read AlsoCovid vaccines or virus, what’s spreading faster in India now?India has undertaken the world's biggest vaccination drive, but is no where close to getting the herd immunity needed to control Covid infectionsThe seven-day average of daily fatalities hit a high of 4,040 on May 16. The count currently stands at 3,324. The actual daily deaths from the pandemic in the country too are yet to drop below the 3,000 mark. On Saturday, India recorded 3,080 fatalities, around the same as the previous day's toll of 3,034, again not counting the old deaths being added to Maharashtra's count almost daily. Interestingly, the rate of decline in cases almost mirrors the earlier rise in infections during the second wave. While the daily average has fallen by half in three weeks, the count was close to half of the eventual peak three weeks prior to it. The seven-day average stood at 2,03,949 on April 17, three weeks before cases peaked in the country.

This was the third straight day of below-2-lakh daily cases in the country. Coronavirus cases continued to decline in almost all states out the northeast. Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh reported their highest count of daily cases at 1,007 and 497, respectively. Assam too recorded 5,613 fresh cases, close to its highest count of 6,573 reported on May 20. Tamil Nadu again reported the highest cases (30,016) and deaths from the virus (486) in the country. While the daily case count in the state has started to drop after hitting a peak of 36,184 on May 21, Saturday's toll was the highest recorded in the state so far.

Though most states have backed CBSE’s option for a truncated exam, a few states disagreed and some demanded vaccination of candidates and staff before holding the exams. While students have also approached the judiciary and are active on Twitter demanding cancellation, a notification of CISCE (which conducts ICSE and ISC exams) — meant for schools — called for submission of candidate marks in previous classes and got posted on social media, only to be deleted in minutes. The education ministry on May 21 had a meeting with senior officials of states and UTs, followed by a high-level meeting of chief ministers, education ministers and secretaries on May 23 with the Centre, which was chaired by defence minister Rajnath Singh. Read AlsoCBSE mulls 12th exams only for major subjectsCBSE sources, said conducting exams in the present scenario doesn’t seem feasible while ‘#cancelboardexams’ became the top trend on Twitter soon after Sunday’s meeting was announced. A senior CBSE official said a final call would be taken in the first week of June after reviewing the situation andCBSE shared two proposals in the form of Option A and B. "A" is to conduct regular exams for 19 "major subjects" at notified centres between August 1-20 in a single phase or "B" which proposes shorter duration objective-type exams for major subjects at respective schools where the students are enrolled between July 15 and August 26 in two phases. The states/ UTs were also asked to give their detailed suggestions by May 25. An announcement is expected possibly by Tuesday, as stated by education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal in his post on May 23. Even as major parts of the country are still in lockdown or partial lockdown, hectic last-minute parleys are on regarding a final call to be taken on the fate of the Class 12 boards, especially those to be conducted by the CBSE. "Although states/ UTs have made their suggestions, everyone would look at the CBSE way as the guiding principle. Therefore, whatever decision the Centre is likely to take by June 1 will be important not only for the forthcoming entrance tests, but also for states in conducting their own board exams," said a senior official in the ministry of education. Read AlsoCBSE 10th exam cancelled, students to be promoted on basis of internal assessmentNEW DELHI: The Centre on Wednesday cancelled class 10 Board Exams and said that the results will be prepared on the basis of an objective criterion to be developed by the CBSE in view of the surge of COVID-19 pandemic across the country. The decision was taken after a high-level meeting chaired byInterestingly, a document, dated May 27, on the letterhead of the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations stated that the board has begun the data collection exercise by asking schools to collate data about average marks of subjects scored by students in Class 11 as well as in various examinations and internal tests conducted during the session in Class 12. While a CISCE official didn’t confirm or deny sending the "strictly confidential" letter, schools confirmed having received the same. The board has instructed that the papers or subjects must be the same for which candidates have been registered and confirmed for Class 12 exams. This led to speculation that CISCE too is working towards cancelling the exams. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court will hear on May 31 a plea seeking directions to cancel the exams amid the surge in Covid-19 cases across the country.

The trust, which was constituted following the Supreme Court’s Ayodhya verdict, was starved of funds without Section 80G certification that exempts tax for donations to charitable institutions. IICF was formed on July 29, 2020, and applied for tax exemption on September 1, 2020. Trust secretary Athar Hussain told TOI, “Objections and queries raised by the I-T department and procedural delay impeded donations for construction of the mosque-hospital complex. Contributions from abroad too were choked in the absence of Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) nod, which makes Section 80G a mandatory prerequisite.Till now, we have received Rs 20 lakh as donations and we haven’t launched crowdfunding. Well-wishers have voluntarily donated.

Nitika Kaul was broken. In six months, she picked up the pieces, strengthened her resolve and decided she would carry on his legacy in serving the nation — she would join the Indian Army. Two years on, on Saturday, the MBA grad and former MNC employee became an Army officer. “My journey at the training academy has brought me closure… The day I stepped in, I felt that it was the same journey that he had traversed. I am undertaking the same,” Kaul, 29, said. She was commissioned into the Indian Army’s technical wing as a lieutenant after the Passing Out Parade at the Officers’ Training Academy in Chennai, where chief of the Army’s Northern Command Lt Gen YK Joshi, who reviewed the parade, pinned the star of lieutenant on her uniform. It was an exception since it is usually parents who pin the star during the pipping ceremony. She was among 167 men and 31 women cadets who became Army officers. On February 17, 2019, three days after the Pulwama attack, Dhoundiyal, posted with the 55 Rashtriya Rifles, was among four who died on the trail of militants at Pinglena, about 15km from Pulwama. He was 35 then. The operation led to the death of a top JeM terrorist, Kamran. Dhoundiyal was awarded the Shaurya Chakra posthumously. In her farewell to her husband, a video of which had gone viral, Kaul had said, “You loved me, but you loved the nation more. I will love you till my last breath.” In September 2019, Kaul applied for the Short Service Commission. Since she was a war widow, the age limit was relaxed. In February last year, on her husband’s first death anniversary, she announced she would be joining the Army. “I believe he is always going to be a part of my life. He is around. I can feel him holding me and saying, ‘You did it’,” Kaul said on Saturday. “These last 11 months have made me learn so much. I would like to thank everyone who kept faith in me. It made my journey easier… Women must keep faith in themselves. At times, life will seem very difficult and, at times, you will feel things are not working out. You may feel you are losing it. But you need to understand it’s not the end of life, you need to try and get up and some day you will win.” Kaul had earlier told TOI that her mother-in-law played an important role in her decision. On Saturday, Saroj Dhoundiyal was beaming with pride. She could not make it to Chennai because of Covid-19 restrictions but watched the parade online. After the ceremony, she said, “We are proud of her and her dedication. I am happy that after my husband (who was a civil defence personnel) and my son, she, too, will serve the nation. It was a great pleasure seeing her in uniform.” (With inputs from Chennai)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/widow-of-hero-killed-in-jk-is-now-an-officer/articleshow/83076716.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||World||Covid-19: US to open up supply chains for ramping up vaccine production in India||NEW DELHI: India and the US have agreed to work together to open up supply chains for vaccines and access to components to enable Indian manufacturers produce Covid vaccines for India and the world. As external affairs minister S Jaishankar wrapped up the Modi government’s first high-level meetings with the Biden administration, the two sides improved convergence on four big issues — Covid, Indo-Pacific, Afghanistan and trade. The increased cooperation over Quad was evident with Jaishankar tweeting “covered Indo-Pacific and the Quad, Afghanistan, Myanmar, UNSC matters and other international organisations” after his meeting with Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Jaishankar held substantive conversations with almost all of Biden’s national security team — NSA Jake Sullivan, Blinken, defence secretary Lloyd Austin, Avril Haines, director of national intelligence and USTR Katherine Tai besides the foreign relations committee. The most substantive discussions were on Covid and its management. In his public remarks, Jaishankar thanked the US for the aid during the latest surge in India. Dean Thompson, acting assistant secretary of state, told reporters, “Expanding production of safe and effective Covid-19 vaccines is a top priority for both the US and India. Together with our Quad partners – Japan and Australia – we’re continuing to identify options for cooperation in the areas of vaccine manufacturing capacity in India, as well as Covid-19 vaccine administration and delivery across the Indo-Pacific region.” Sources said the US is working on ways to open up vaccine supply chains for Indian manufacturers to be able to ramp up production capacity. This would help to not only inoculate Indians but also reopen India’s vaccine exports, on which a large number of countries depend. Answering questions on the AstraZeneca doses that could be shipped out to other countries, Thompson said that is still several weeks away. “Over 60 million doses of AstraZeneca are still undergoing control checks by FDA and they will become available once those have been completed.” The US is working with Indian vaccine company Biological E to produce a billion doses of J&J vaccines by 2022, US officials said. The US and India deepened their strategic relationship on the Indo-Pacific, specifically the Quad, which is the core of the new global geopolitics. Jaishankar tweeted after meeting Blinken: “A productive discussion on various aspects of our bilateral cooperation as well as regional and global issues. Covered Indo-Pacific and the Quad, Afghanistan, Myanmar, UNSC matters and other international organisations.” The Quad is now a priority for the Biden administration. Even though they inherited it from Trump, officials say they now “own” it and want to develop it much further. India, being the geo-strategic hub of the Quad, will play a bigger role in this new formation. The discussion between the two sides focused on taking Quad beyond a security grouping to encompass other areas of non-traditional security. Both sides focused a big part of their discussions on Afghanistan, though Myanmar also came in for some deliberations. On the latter, the two sides pushed for a resumption of democratic processes and cessation of violence. But on Afghanistan, they worked on cooperation post-US withdrawal. As a senior official explained, “The US is not about to abandon Afghanistan.” The official US readout of the Jaishankar-Blinken meeting said it included “Covid-19 relief, efforts to strengthen Indo-Pacific cooperation through the Quad, and a shared commitment to combating the climate crisis and enhancing multilateral cooperation, including at the UN Security Council. Secretary Blinken and minister Jaishankar also discussed regional developments, the coup in Burma, and continuing support for Afghanistan”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/covid-19-us-to-open-up-supply-chains-for-ramping-up-vaccine-production-in-india/articleshow/83077177.cms||Indrani Bagchi

---||India||Delhi: Key roads may have to be widened for Central Vista project||NEW DELHI: The Central Vista redevelopment project, which is expected to be completed by 2024, will cause an increase in traffic volume on some important roads in central Delhi and these will have to be redesigned and upgraded. This has been revealed in a traffic impact assessment report, prepared by Tata Consulting Engineers Limited. It is part of the environment impact assessment report for the project. The project envisages, among other things, converting North Block and South Block to museums by creating a new Central Secretariat for all ministries, a new Parliament House with increased seating capacity and a new residence and office for the PM and Vice-President. The report says that the project will add a significant amount of traffic to Dr. Rajendra Prasad Road, Maulana Azad Road, Ashoka Road and Shershah Road over the years. Read AlsoCentral Vista: CPWD to transplant 1,838 trees for construction of three new buildingsThe CPWD has decided to transplant 1,838 trees from the campus of Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA), which is proposed to be demolished for the construction of three new office buildings under the Central Vista redevelopment project.It has proposed that Ashoka Road and Sher Shah Road will have to be upgraded to eight lanes; Akbar Road, Rafi Marg and Janpath to six lanes; and Dr. Rajendra Prasad Road to four lanes to accommodate the increased volume. The need for upgradation is pinned to the period stretching from 2026 to 2039. The project is also expected to add to the traffic volume at three roundabouts – the one near the Vice President’s house, Panchmukhi Chowk and Raisina roundabout. The Sunheri Bagh masjid roundabout will, however, not feel much of an impact. Also, the India Gate area, Motilal Nehru Road, Red Cross Road, Raisina Road and Man Singh Road will not be affected. The report also claims that the overall traffic on the road network will be eventually reduced. A pedestrian facility with a minimum of 1.8m walkable width shall be provided as per UTTIPEC (United Traffic and Transportation Infrastructure (Planning and Engineering) Centre) street design guidelines. Crosswalks at intersections and mid-block locations shall be provided to facilitate safe pedestrian movement. A source in CPWD, which is executing the project, said implementation will depend on the final approval from UTTIPEC. The report had been tabled before the expert appraisal committee in April. Read AlsoGovt invites tenders for first 3 Central Secretariat buildings, to be ready in late 2023NEW DELHI: The Central Public Works Department (CPWD) has invited bids for three new office buildings under the Common Central Secretariat project along Rajpath at a cost of Rs 3,269 crore and another Rs 139 crore has been kept for five years’ maintenance. These buildings will have to be completedEnvironmentalists and other experts say the project will cause traffic congestion and add to pollution. “As the report says the roads need to be upgraded and widened, it means the roads will carry increased traffic which will have a negative impact on emissions. When the number of vehicles go up, it will lead to an increase in pollution,” said Amit Bhatt, executive director, Integrated Transport, WRI-India. Bhatt said it will also hamper road safety. “If there is more traffic, there are more chances accidents. The focus should be more on the promotion of public transport and restricting the use of private automobiles. In other parts of the world, historic cities are for people mobility and not for vehicular mobility,” he said. Manju Menon, senior fellow, Centre for Policy Research, too was critical: “The traffic study reveals the logical extension of the flawed design of this project. The project is a major U-turn from the best practices of urban planning because it centralises all the offices at one location. This means that there will be major traffic congestion in this area with all its attendant environmental and pollution impacts from the construction period onwards,” she said. Menon added, “What people also need to understand is that to manage this congestion, free movement of public traffic will be restricted in the area. Basically, this project creates a problem and then creates a bigger problem to solve the earlier problem.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/key-roads-may-have-to-be-widened-for-central-vista-project/articleshow/83077181.cms||Pankhuri Yadav

The United States has proposed a global minimum corporation tax rate of 15%, well below G7 levels, but above those in some countries such as Ireland. But Britain remains concerned the plans do not go far enough on taxation of tech giants such as Amazon, Google and Facebook. "We need them to understand why fair taxation of tech companies is important to us. There's a deal to be had, so I'm urging the U.S. – and all of the G7 – to come to the table next week and get it done," Sunak told the Mail on Sunday newspaper ahead of a meeting of G7 finance ministers on June 4-5. "Negotiations are going well ... But it has to be the right deal for Britain and that's what this week's negotiations will be about." Sunak said that firms like Facebook themselves also wanted resolution on the issue that would give them certainty and stability. He also said that he wanted to "level the playing field for British high streets", with Britain looking at a separate online sales tax. "Fundamentally, the global tax system isn't working ... Large multinational companies, particularly digital companies, are able by the nature of their businesses not to pay the right tax in the right places. And that's not fair," he said. "That's what we're fighting hard to fix in these negotiations. If everyone works hard over the next few days and weeks, I'm confident that we can find a good place."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/uks-rishi-sunak-says-deal-to-be-done-on-tax-at-g7-but-tech-must-pay-fair-share/articleshow/83077812.cms||---

He was 64. The team announced his death Saturday but did not give a cause or details, saying only that it was ``unexpected.'' The Jazz described him in a statement as an ``enduring figure in our franchise history'' who had a ``significant impact in the community after his basketball career.'' The center led the league in blocks per game four times and his average of 5.6 per contest in 1984-85 remains the highest average since the NBA started officially tracking that statistic. Eaton's career blocks average of 3.51 per game is the best in NBA history, and his career happened almost by accident. He was working as an auto mechanic in 1977 when a community college basketball coach persuaded him to enroll. From there, he went to UCLA, and his stint with the Jazz followed. ``I had an unusual background,'' Eaton said for a story published on the Jazz web site two years ago. ``It's an unlikely story to be sure. I basically came into the NBA with two years of junior college experience and sat on the bench at UCLA for two years. And Frank Layden gave me a chance and the team was in a space where they could afford to let me make some mistakes out there and get my feet underneath me. It worked out well for both of us.'' Eaton had been, among other things, a restaurateur and motivational speaker in his retirement. In recent years, he served as a mentor to Utah center Rudy Gobert _ the only other player in Jazz history to win the defensive player of the year award. ``He was so impressive,'' longtime NBA broadcaster Mike Inglis, now the radio voice of the Miami Heat, said Saturday. ``I used to call him the human condominium complex. He was something else on defense, let me tell you.'' Eaton's death came days after he was in Chicago to be part of the celebration for his friend Joe West, who broke baseball's umpiring record by working his 5,376th regular-season game Tuesday night. His 11 playing seasons with the Jazz are third most in team history, behind longtime Utah cornerstones Karl Malone and John Stockton. His durability was noteworthy, with him once appearing in 338 consecutive games. He finished with career averages of 6.0 points and 7.9 rebounds. He also served as an officer in the National Basketball Players Association, and the union released a statement Saturday saying he would be missed. ``It may be cliched, but it's true: Mark Eaton was a giant, in every sense of the word,`` the NBPA statement said. ``A long-time member of the NBPA Executive Committee right through his retirement from the league in 1994, Mark served his colleagues with grace and strength, and continued to watch over them through his service for the Retired Players Association. His imposing physical presence made a delightful match with his warm and thoughtful manner.`` Eaton's No. 53 was one of the first jerseys retired by the Jazz. He was the defensive player of the year in 1984-85 and 1988-89, was a five-time All-Defensive team selection _ three first-team nods, two second-team picks _ and was an All-Star in 1989. He was taken with the 107th overall pick by Phoenix in the 1979 draft, then drafted again at No. 72 overall by Utah in 1982. And he never left; his last game was in 1993, but back problems ended his career and he retired in September 1994. ``It has been a great ride, but life does have a way of moving on and I must move on with it,'' Eaton wrote in a column for The Salt Lake Tribune in which he announced his retirement. ``Thank you for letting me be a part of your life and community. I'll be around.'' True to his word, Eaton remained a Utah mainstay for the rest of his life.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/mark-eaton-shot-blocking-king-and-jazz-legend-dies-at-64/articleshow/83077931.cms||---
---||India||PIO scientist’s genome work has key role in Covid battle||MELBOURNE: From the $1 billion USD and 13 years it took to sequence one human genome in 2000, they brought it down to less than $1,000 now. Chemists Sir Shankar Balasubramanian and Sir David Klenerman from Cambridge University were awarded the bi-annual Millennium Technology Prize on May 18 for their service to humanity during the pandemic. It is the world's largest tech prize, earlier awarded to creator of the World Wide Web Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the LED Shuji Nakamura and the developer of Linux Linus Torvalds, among others.But they think the Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) they developed in 2006 is still in its infancy, they told TOI, because once technology is democratised, “users get creative”. “We are only scratching the surface of what is possible. It is a long journey … We were surprised to see the benefits it has had on basic research and life sciences … It is exciting to see new creative applications of the technology in journals,” Chennai-born Balasubramanian told TOI. The origins of NGS go back nearly 25 years when the two were collaborating as independent researchers. “It was blue-sky research — trying to understand a basic biochemical process. We were not trying to sequence anything or develop technology but the way we were approaching the problem led us to seeing a new way to sequence DNA. Then, we started thinking about how it could be developed further,” Balasubramanian said. NGS sets up millions of fragments of DNA from a sample on to the surface of a chip in an array. They are then amplified. Each fragment is decoded on that chip using fluorescent coloured nucleotides (building blocks of DNA and RNA). The colour-coded nucleotides are detected over and over, mapping the DNA sequence of each fragment. Because this is done with many fragments at the same time, it is fast, inexpensive and scalable. In 1998, Balasubramanian and Klenerman founded Solexa and put together a team to take what they had found and make the technology workable. In 2006, Solexa did just that. The year after, Illumina acquired Solexa and further finetuned the technology. “Now, their sequencers can sequence a trillion bases (the four building blocks of the DNA are called bases) per equipment. Today, in 2021, their sequencers will sequence a trillion bases per equipment, and this is a million-to-ten-million-fold improvement on state-of-the-art 1997,” said Balasubramanian. “We went from a concept that was written down on a piece of paper to a functioning instrument in nine years. That was relatively fast,” said Klenerman. On January 10 last year, NGS was used to map the SARS-CoV-2 genome at Fudan University in Shanghai and made available online. Just 25 days on, Moderna developed its vaccine, aided by this technology. “NGS helped in the pandemic because it can map a large number of viruses and we can see how it is mutating,” said Klenerman. “The genes of those in intensive care is being sequenced to identify pathways of treatment that work effectively.” Balasubramanian said, “Vaccines offer strong protection against the new variant B.1.617. It is preliminary but important information. This suggests every country in the world needs to keep pushing its vaccination programme because, so far, it seems to be very effective.” NGS could also help preempt future pandemics and epidemics. “Imagine a world where routine blood tests can tell you more than your cholesterol or glucose level. It could tell if you are showing early signs of disease and pathogen genomes. You could get a profile of all of that. If this information could be shared in an ethical way globally, this could help create a global surveillance system for infection agents and details of strains and sequences could avoid super-spread,” he added. And it’s not just Covid-19. NGS is also making breakthroughs in cancer and rare diseases. “Sequencing the genome of a tumour provides information specific to that tumour in that individual. It also helps us stratify patients into different categories based on their genomic profile,” said Balasubramanian. “Then, unfortunately, some children are born with rare diseases that are difficult to diagnose and treat. Now, we can sequence the genes of parents and children to find the differences. One specific gene may have gone wrong and finding that leads to diagnosis and treatment,” said Klenerman. Now, Klenerman is working on methods for early diagnosis of Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s and autoimmune diseases while Balasubramanian is working on charting new attributes of the human genome. He said, “Much of this is not in textbooks yet. It is an exciting new frontier.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pio-scientists-genome-work-has-key-role-in-covid-battle/articleshow/83077519.cms||Priyanka A Chokhani

Most have cited fear of contracting Covid-19 outside prison as the reason for preferring to stay locked up. "Another reason cited by those not taking parole was that their sentence was about to end. They say that if they take parole now, it would be counted as a break in their jail term, which they will have to complete when they return," DG (prisons) Anand Kumar said. "Prisoners say that they have access to better healthcare facilities, food and medicine inside the prisons. Many of them feel that they will not get proper care and facilities in their villages," a senior jail official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/convicts-in-up-jails-refuse-parole-citing-covid-scare/articleshow/83078118.cms||---
---||Pune||Recovery rate increased by 1% in Pune rural: ZP report||Pune: The Covid-19 recovery rate in the district’s rural areas increased by just 1% in the last one month. The recovery rate on April 23 was 84%, which had increased to 85% on May 19, stated a report of the Pune Zilla Parishad (ZP). Ayush Prasad, the chief executive officer of the ZP, conceded that the recovery rate was improving at a sluggish pace despite taking several measures to contain the spread of coronavirus. “We have been aggressively conducting tests via our door-to-door survey. On an average, we test 10,000 people daily,” he said. “We have noticed a steady, but sluggish decline in the Covid positivity rate as well. On April 21, the rate was 32.9% and now it stands at 22%. We expect to see it decline further because of the increase in oxygen and ventilator-supported beds. Now, patients are getting timely and the required treatment at our designated Covid hospitals,” Prasad added. The ZP has carried out door-to-door survey of a population of over 20 lakh people, with the help of Asha workers, from May 6 to May 19, an official said. There wasn’t much improvement in the fatality rate as well. On April 23, the fatality rate was 1.5%, which was now 1.35%, the report stated. “The fatality rate on March 23 was 2.1%. It came down to 1.5% on April 23. Despite severe shortage of oxygen and ventilator beds in April and the first two weeks of May, the rate reduced by almost 0.6%,” an official from the health department said.  “This year, the main reason for the spread of the virus was the mingling of asymptomatic patients with the general populace. Maximum people got their tests done with private labs, which did not share the reports with the tehsil administration in time. As a result, it was difficult to put restrictions on positive patients in the villages,” a senior official from the ZP’s gram panchayat department said.

Surprisingly, the baby’s father claimed that she was discharged from the hospital before her test report was received. However, the hospital authorities clarified that it was a borderline case and both mother and baby were healthy, hence they were discharged. “We are surprised why baby was discharged well before the arrival of the test report,” wondered Sunil Kumar (name changed), the father of the newborn. However, both mother and baby are doing well, he added. The mother, who was admitted to the Sir Sunderlal Hospital of Banaras Hindu University, tested negative for Covid-19 before giving birth to the baby in a caesarean delivery on Wednesday. Sunil said that the nursing staff only showed the baby, and later informed that she tested positive for Covid-19. Medical Superintendent Prof KK Gupta said that RT-PCR test method has its limitation, hence the samples were sent to lab for Covid test again. In the second reports of RT-PCR, both tested negative. “RT-PCR’s sensitivity is 70% which means there are 30% chances of false result. In such cases repeat tests are conducted to confirm infection. The same process was followed in this case,” said the MS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/covid-positive-newborn-tests-negative-after-2-days/articleshow/83071380.cms||---

The minister shared a photo on social media after a meeting with former chief minister (CM) and HAM(S) president, Jitan Ram Manjhi, on Saturday. He said, “The tenure of the representatives of the three-tier panchayati raj institutions should be extended so that they can continue with development works at the grassroots level.” Sahani’s unscheduled meeting with the HAM(S) chief, however, created ripples in the political circles. Earlier, Manjhi had urged CM Nitish Kumar to extend the term of the elected members at least for six months. Sources have, however, claimed that the government is not in a mood to extend the term of the panchayat representatives. The five-year term of around 2.58 lakh representatives will come to an end on June 15.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/minister-backs-demand-of-panchayat-representatives/articleshow/83072230.cms||---

The inoculation drive for this age group would not be conducted even on Sunday. Patna DM Chandrashekhar Singh said the vaccination drive for 18+ had been temporarily suspended due to shortage of vaccine doses. “The vaccination for this age group was last conducted on May 26. We had received 50,000 vaccine doses last Sunday, which was administered on beneficiaries for three days starting from Monday. We have no vaccine left for 18-plus age group now,” the DM said. He added, “The vaccination drive will resume only when we get the fresh stock of vaccines from the health department. For 45+ people, the vaccination is being carried out smoothly as we have enough doses for them.” So far, 1.04 lakh people in the age group of 18-44 years have received their first jab at 54 selected sites in Patna. The DM said the district has the capacity to inoculate 20,000 people in 18+ age group per day. On Saturday, only 10,347 beneficiaries were administered the anti-Covid vaccines in the state in the 18-44 age group. So far, 15,95,096 people have taken the first jab of vaccine in Bihar, as per the data shared by the health department Even though the vaccination drive for 18+ have been hampered, Bihar was among the top three states in the country with the highest number of vaccines administered to people in this age group in the third phase on inoculation. The non-availability of vaccines is making people jittery. Saroj Kumar (36), a resident of Jakkanpura, said it was the fourth day that he returned from the designated centre without getting the vaccine jab. One Soumya Singh said she was turned away from the vaccine centre due to vaccine shortage. “I got the slot about a week ago. However, the vaccine centre was busy in clearing the backlog,” she said. Prashant Jain, a resident of Hanuman Nagar, said he was regretting that he did not book the slot earlier when vaccines were available.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/vaccine-paucity-several-districts-halt-inoculation-for-18-age-group-in-bihar/articleshow/83072003.cms||Faryal Rumi

The village falls under Raghopur assembly constituency, which is represented by RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav. “The team, headed by the medical officer of Bidupur primary health centre, will submit its report soon. We will take action accordingly,” Vaishali civil surgeon Indradeo Ranjan told this reporter over the phone on Saturday. Mujahid Anwar, a resident of Mansurpur, had claimed that Covid killed 17 co-villagers between April 12 and May 13. He also alleged that he tried to contact Tejashwi several times over the phone, but in vain. “Tejashwi’s callous attitude has caused strong resentment among the people, especially those belonging to the minority community. They will teach him a lesson at the appropriate time,” claimed Anwar whose wife Juhi Parveen is the mukhiya of Chaksikandar Kalyanpur panchayat. To drive his point home, he said the local burial ground was witnesses to the frequent deaths during the period. “Two of the families abandoned their houses and shifted to another place to save their lives,” Anwar added. Mansurpur under Bidupur block has a population of around 4,000. Reacting to the allegations levelled against Tejashwi, RJD spokesperson Mrityunjay Tiwari said, “Anwar’s charges are untrue and baseless because Covid care centres are operating in Bidupur and Raghopur blocks at the behest of Tejashwi.” He added, “The leader of opposition has already donated Rs 1 crore for the treatment of Covid patients. Therefore, accusing him of callousness is nothing, but an attempt to tarnish his image.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/medical-team-visits-vaishali-village-to-verify-death-claim/articleshow/83072089.cms||Ramashankar

While reviewing the vaccination drive and testing facilities at the hospital on Saturday, Prasad claimed that he would be available over the phone to meet all its requirements. The superintendent of the hospital, Dr Pashupati Nath Singh, thanked Prasad for giving them 10 oxygen concentrators and said, “These will help us deal with the pandemic and boost the morale of our doctors and paramedical staff.” He added, “The vaccination drive and the Covid tests are being conducted at the hospital in a proper manner.” Prasad, who is also a BJP MP from Patna Sahib, stayed at the Patna City hospital for about 30 minutes. Later, he reviewed the facilities for Covid patients at the Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) and donated PPE kits and surgical masks to its superintendent, Dr I S Thakur. Talking to the mediapersons, Prasad said the number of Covid-19 patients at the PMCH had reduced to 17. “The treatment of mucormycosis has also started at the hospital,” he added. In reply to a query, the Union minister said, “Nearly 20 crore people have been vaccinated across the country so far. Of them, 1.75 crore are in the age group of 18 to 45 years.” He also revealed that the Centre “aims to complete the vaccination drive by the end of 2021”. Taking a swipe at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, Prasad said, “He (Rahul) should tell the nation whether he has been vaccinated or not.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/union-minister-reviews-vaccination-drive-at-2-hospitals/articleshow/83072315.cms||Ramashankar
---||Patna||Bihar CM to take a call on lockdown after review meet: Health minister||PATNA: Even as the third extension of Covid-induced lockdown in Bihar is ending on June 1, state health minister Mangal Pandey on Saturday said a decision on its withdrawal or continuation would be taken by chief minister Nitish Kumar after a review meeting with the officials concerned. “Lockdown has certainly proved much beneficial for the people. The number of active cases has come down considerably during the last three weeks,” the minister said. Meanwhile, even as the rate of Covid infections in the second wave has subsided considerably after imposition of lockdown in the state, health experts, academia and people in general favour further continuation of lockdown at least for a week to achieve the desired result. Lifting the lockdown at this stage would prove detrimental for the health and lives of the people, they said. Indian Medical Association’s acting state president Dr Ajay Kumar said the present lockdown must continue for some time until the positivity rate declines to the minimum. “Some relaxations may be granted to the daily-wage earners and small shopkeepers, but regular working of offices and public institutions should not be allowed at any cost. Moreover, crowded places like theatres, malls, vegetable mandis and places of worship must be kept completely closed,” he said. Gynaecologist Dr Punam Raman said medical conditions are not yet favourable for the lifting of the lockdown. “The marriage season is likely to continue till June and, once relaxed, people would be free to visit crowded places and get infected with the virus. Even as the number of infections has declined, it has not stopped completely. If any relaxation is given, the infection rate would accelerate to a dangerous level soon,” she added. Paediatrician Dr Arun Shah said any relaxation in lockdown may be given when the positivity rate comes below 5% in all the districts. “A district wise survey may be carried out and the districts having less than 5% positivity rate may be granted some relaxations. There should be gradual relaxation in the lockdown,” he added. Patna University’s zoology department head and former AIIMS research scientist Arbind Kumar said the lockdown should be extended by a fortnight to get full control over the pandemic. “As people are not much health conscious, they would start all their activities in normal mode without adhering to Covid norms as soon as the lockdown is withdrawn. The loss of the economy and industries may be compensated, but the lives lost due to the pandemic can’t be revived,” he said. Laghu Udyog Bharti’s state president Ravindra Prasad Singh also favoured extension of the lockdown with some relaxations. “Small traders and industrialists must be given some economic relief during the lockdown period,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cm-to-take-a-call-on-lockdown-after-review-meet-health-minister/articleshow/83072371.cms||B K Mishra

Two people – Sukhdev Chauhan (65) and Bahadur Kumar (25) – died when a van they were travelling in collided head on with a cement-laden truck on NH-31 under the Mufassil police station area in Nawada around 6am on Saturday. SHO of Mufassil police station Lal Bihari Paswan said Sukhdev was a daily-wage worker and Bahadur was driving the van. “The van was on way to Pariya village under the Kadirganj police station area in Nawada from Ranchi. Sukhdev’s wife and two children sustained injuries in the accident. Other daily-wagers travelling in the van were dropped in Nalanda before the accident. The truck driver managed to escape,” SHO said. In the second incident, circle officer of Baikunthpur in Gopalganj, Rakesh Kumar Dubey (42), died and his friend Ashok Kumar Singh (41) was critically injured when the car they were travelling in was hit by a truck on NH-28 near Lat Basepura under the Musrigharari police station area in Samastipur district around 11.30pm on Friday. The CO was on way to Gopalganj from Bhagalpur. SHO of Musrigharari police station Sanjay Kumar Singh said Dubey died on way to hospital. In another accident, three youths in their early 20s were killed and two others injured when their car rammed into the sidewall of Tilwa bridge on NH-28A under the Ramgarhwa police station area of Motihari in East Champaran district around 10pm on Friday. SHO (incharge) of Ramgarhwa police station Narayan Mandal said the victims were identified as Rohit Kumar (22), Prince Kumar (26) and Deepak Kumar (28). He added the youths were on way to Ramgarhwa from Raxaul amid rain.

Thanks to rain and strong winds, the overall air quality index (AQI) level of Patna was recorded at 40 on Saturday at 4pm, as per the daily bulletin of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). It was the second consecutive day when Patnaites breathed clean air, as the pollutant level in the environment was below 50-mark that falls in ‘good’ category. On Friday, the AQI level was registered at 48. Earlier, it was in the ‘satisfactory’ and ‘moderate’ categories. The overall air quality oscillated between 31 and 45 throughout the day as per the data of a mobile application, ‘Sameer’, which provides hourly updates on the national AQI published by CPCB. According to Ashok Ghosh, chairman of Bihar State Pollution Control Board, 31 was so far the lowest recorded AQI level in Patna in the last three years. He said the combined effect of strict lockdown in the state and continuous rain due to cyclonic effect has improved the air quality. Ghosh added, “In Patna, the major reasons for the increased in air pollution level are anthropogenic (human) activities and geological factors. In this lockdown, people are more disciplined compared to last year because of Covid-19 fear and high mortality rate. It leads to very little vehicular movement on roads and other human activities are also stopped. The rain has played a major role to settle down the dust particles in the air.” The BSPCB has also suggested the state government to impose one-month complete lockdown once a year during summer time, when all educational institutes remain closed as it would give time to nature to restore and heal itself. The officials claimed that the overall AQI of 40 for Patna was the average of AQI level of air monitoring stations at BIT-Mesra-Patna (36), Eco Park (41), S K Memorial Hall (50), Patna City (52) and DRM office, Khagaul (19). The Planetarium air monitoring station was out of order due to a technical snag. An AQI between 0-50 is considered ‘good’, 51-100 ‘satisfactory’, 101-200 ‘moderate’, 201-300 ‘poor’, 301-400 ‘very poor’ and 401-500 ‘severe’. The Air Quality Early Warning System of the ministry of earth sciences has predicted that the overall AQI of Patna will further improve during next 48 hours, owing to favourable meteorological conditions for dispersion of pollutants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patna-air-turns-good-thanks-to-rain-winds/articleshow/83072084.cms||Faryal Rumi

The APSRTC had stalled a majority of its service after the government imposed a partial lockdown. Bus services to destinations less than 150 kilometres are operating between 6 am and 12 noon while sleeper and semi-sleeper buses plying long distances are confined to bus depots across the state. Meanwhile, the management of APSRTC came forward to transform 17 of its high-end Vennela AC sleeper buses into Covid care centres. Each bus will have 10 oxygen beds and three air conditioners will be installed for each bed to ensure patients are comfortable. Oxygen concentrators have been installed on these buses to ensure round-the-clock oxygen supply for patients. Transport minister Perni Venkata Ramaiah (Perni Nani) said, “APSRTC is committed to the welfare of the public. We have started alteration works of the AC sleeper buses to transform them into mini-hospitals. These buses will cater to the emergency oxygen bed needs of tribal areas. Buses will be placed at area hospitals in Araku, Paderu, Rampachodavaram and other tribal areas. Doctors there will monitor the health condition and shift patients in critical condition to the nearby district hospital for treatment.” Power generator sets will be placed at area hospitals to ensure uninterrupted electricity supply to the buses, the minister said, adding that Green Co has come forward to donate oxygen concentrators for the buses. These buses will start operating within a week’s time, APSRTC authorities said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/now-rtc-buses-to-house-covid-care-centres-with-oxygen-beds/articleshow/83072043.cms||Venu Lanka
---||Vijayawada||Four pvt hospitals fined for overcharging patients in Andhra Pradesh||TIRUPATI: The Anantapur district administration on Saturday imposed penalties on four private hospitals for allegedly overcharging Covid-19 patients. A fine of Rs 3 lakh was imposed on Asha Hospital, Rs 2 lakh imposed on SV Hospital, Rs 2.1 lakh on Sai Rathna Hospital and a fine of Rs 2.55 lakh on SR Hospital. The fines were imposed after Anantapur joint collector A Siri received numerous complaints from relatives of Covid-19 patients against various private hospitals and an inquiry was launched. In course of inspections, it emerged that these four hospitals were overcharging patients in violation of the state government’s directive. The joint collector expressed displeasure over some private hospitals acting against the state government’s directive and warned hospital managements of stringent action if they don’t stop fleecing patients. “The state government has issued GO Ms no. 256 which clearly fixes guidelines for private hospitals and has also laid down punitive action to be initiated against hospitals which violate the state government’s order and attempt to fleece patients. We will even go to the extent of sealing off such hospitals which do not heed government orders repeatedly,” the joint collector said.

Their lungs are more affected and difficult to manage, said former dean of the Faculty of Dental Sciences, Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University and convener of anti-tobacco campaign Prof. TP Chaturvedi. “The cells of the lungs of smokers provide an easy entry to coronavirus as compared to non-smokers. Tobacco users or smoking persons also have low immunity, which makes them more prone for corona infection,” said Prof Chaturvedi, who is also the president of the Indian Dental Association (IDA), UP State. He said that at present around 27 crore people are using tobacco in India, and the average age of person to start tobacco use in India is 18.7 years as per global adult tobacco survey. “Chewing of pan, gutkha with tobacco stimulates saliva production in the mouth. Such persons frequently spit and spread corona viruses,” he added. According to him, tobacco causes memory loss, oral diseases, hypertension, heart attack problems, lung diseases, blindness, gastric problems, hair falling, whiteness of hair, more ageing of person, blood diseases and other problems too. Tobacco causes 13% male death and 5% female death in India. Smoking adversely affects the health of females. It will be one of the causative factors for abortion, low birth weight of child, death of infants, cancer of uterus, congenital problems of child. He said that tobacco smoke contains approximately 4,000 chemical elements, 200 poison substances and 60 carcinogenic substances. These dangerous substances are carbon monoxide, ammonia, cyanide, benzene, formaldehyde, methanol (wood alcohol), acetylene etc. These substances cause heart, lung, kidney, blood, and gastric diseases. All of them are life-threatening. “The nicotine present in tobacco damages normally functioning hearts and distorts blood vessels. It increases four times more heart and respiratory diseases. It increases two times more brain stroke. Tobacco may cause eye and kidney problems too. Some of the chewing tobacco ingredients are more than 28 cancer causing carcinogens, including acetaldehyde, arsenic, benzopyrene, cyanide, formaldehyde, lead, nicotine, nitrosamines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/smokers-at-higher-risk-of-coronavirus-infection/articleshow/83071345.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Covid-recovered patients still occupy most ICU, ventilator beds||Ahmedabad: Covid-19 is not letting off severe patients easily. Even after recovery from the viral infection, its morbid-effect continues to keep patients hospitalized or forces them to seek critical medical attention after discharge. City-based private hospitals said that over 70% of the ventilators and ICU beds for non-Covid patients are in fact occupied by the Covid-recovered patients. Dr Bharat Gadhvi, president of Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (AHNA), said that 168 private hospitals are currently treating Covid patients. “Majority of them have now adopted a hybrid model where they also offer non-Covid treatment. But our recent analysis revealed that over 70% of the ventilators and ICU beds for non-Covid patients are in fact engaged to provide treatment to Covid-recovered patients,” he said. Dr Gadhvi, who is also regional director of HCG Hospitals, said that all 12 non-Covid ventilators at his hospital in the city have Covid-recovered patients. What brings many Covid-recovered patients back in ICUs? Dr Sanjay Shah, head of emergency department at Apollo Hospitals, said that the phenomenon identified as post-Covid sequelae is responsible. “Majority of the patients have respiratory issues due to high lung involvement during Covid infection. They thus need ventilator, BiPAP or NRBM support,” he said. “At our facility, out of total capacity about 60% ICU and ventilator beds have Covid-recovered patients.” Dr Jigar Mehta, critical care specialist at KD Hospital said that all 20 ventilator beds for Covid patients continue to remain occupied even as Covid numbers are headed south. “Majority of the patients with highly damaged lungs need ventilatory support for 30 or 45 days. They neither record any improvement or deterioration in condition. It’s a major emotional and financial drain for the patients,” he said, adding that only 25-30% get fully recovered. Dr Anil Jain, medical director of Epic Hospital, said that the most common post-Covid complication is lung inflammation. “These patients find it difficult to maintain desirable oxygen levels, and thus need both BiPAP or invasive ventilation depending on the oxygen dependency. Apart from mucormycosis, septicemia (bloodstream infection) and secondary bacterial infection are also seen in many recovered patients,” he said, adding that the majority of critical care beds at his facility have such patients. Damage to the heart is also very common among the Covid-recovered patients, said Dr Sameer Dani, CEO of Apollo CVHF, who said that there are several implications of severe Covid infection for patients. “Clotting due to Covid can cause vascular complications, stroke, heart attack, and ischemia (restriction of blood supply to tissues),” he said. “We have also seen patients of myocarditis (inflammation of heart) that required ICU and ventilator care.” Dr Minesh Mehta, a senior intensivist with Shalby Hospital, said that out of three ICU units, two are full with 30-odd Covid-recovered patients. “Several patients don’t recover completely from the lung damage caused by the viral infection, and they need prolonged support. Prolonged stay generally graduates from single organ failure to multiple organ failure – thus, often these patients get critical and require extra care,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-recovered-patients-still-occupy-most-icu-ventilator-beds/articleshow/83073627.cms||Parth Shastri

---||Patna||Bihar still short of tankers to procure oxygen||PATNA: The state government is still unable to procure the daily quota of 274 metric tonnes of liquid oxygen fixed by the central government due to lack of sufficient cryogenic tankers. The government expects to get at least eight cryogenic tankers from the Centre to procure its complete quota of liquid oxygen. As per the counter affidavit submitted by the health department principal secretary Pratyaya Amrit before the Patna high court, the allotment of eight additional tankers would make the state capable to lift 60MTs of liquid oxygen out of the daily quota of 274MTs. In the affidavit submitted in high court on May 25, Amrit mentioned that the allocation of 274 MTs liquid oxygen per day appears to be sufficient for the state following drop in fresh Covid cases and positivity rate in the state. The state government is using seven nitrogen tankers of Comfed, two liquid natural gas and three ISO-type containers of Indian Oil Corporation Limited and other containers of private gas manufacturing plants like Inox Air, Linde, Air Water India Private Limited-Jamshedpur and Gupta Air Products-Darbhanga. Inox has been earmarked by the Centre for supplying 60MTs of liquid oxygen to Bihar and Steel Authority of India Limited 50MTs. Both the plants are located in Jharkhan’s Bokaro. Also, 50 MTs is earmarked for allocation from Linde’s two gas manufacturing plants at Jamshedpur, 30MTs from Vedanta Electrosteel Steels Limited in Bokaro and SAIL’s another plant at Burnpur in Asansol and 20MTs from Air Water India plant in Jamshedpur. Besides, 34 MTs are being supplied by air separation units across Bihar. Some plants are functional in Patna too. AIIMS-Patna director Dr Prabhat Kumar Singh said the oxygen crisis during the peak of second Covid wave was like a reality check for Centre and state governments. “This must be clear to everyone that oxygen production capacity in the country was not an issue. Arranging logistics and systems for its transportation was. This crisis was not envisaged early,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-still-short-of-tankers-to-procure-o2/articleshow/83072349.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The district administration, Bihar Urban Infrastructure Development Corporation (BUIDCo) and Patna Electric Supply Undertaking also lent their support to the civic body. In a statement issued on Saturday evening, the public relations officer of the PMC, Harshita, said, “The rainwater has been drained out by 42 permanent and 21 temporary sump houses operated by the BUIDCo in Patna.” The city manager of the civic body, Arvind Kumar, also claimed that the PMC men had worked all day long to clean the waterlogged areas. PMC’s additional commissioner, Sheela Irani, said, “Rainwater, which was accumulated in several low-lying areas, has been pumped out with the help of motors.” Some residents also thanked the PMC and the district administration for taking timely action and draining out rainwater from their areas. Sanjeev Kumar of Rajbanshi Nagar said, “Other than road number 2, there is no problem of waterlogging in my area. I am thankful to the PMC.” Shastri Nagar resident, Kaushal Jha, on the other hand, claimed that the condition of most waterlogged areas in the city had improved only because of low rainfall on Saturday. “The area near Survey Bhawan is still submerged in water,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/pmc-rolls-up-sleeves-drains-out-rainwater/articleshow/83072030.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||These women bid final adieu to hundreds of Covid dead in Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: Taraben, a 60-year-old woman in Nadiad, cremated nearly 300 Covid dead in the local crematorium where she has worked for many years— first with her husband and then alone as a widow since 2010. She says the second wave of coronavirus overwhelmed her, who is used to being around the dead. “We used to get an average of 20 bodies in the month of April which started reducing. Now we get only one or two bodies. God has shown some kindness,” says Taraben, adding she was left aghast by the fear Covid-19 had triggered in people who would fear even performing final rites of their loved ones. “I would get requests from many people to perform all the rites by myself as they did not want to risk getting infected for their family’s sake. Some would even tell me to feed them holy water. Many would bring the body to the crematorium and leave, telling us to do the needful,” she adds. Across Gujarat, Covid-19 pandemic saw women, who as a gender generally refrain from even entering crematoriums due to social taboos, take the forefront in giving a decent farewell to people who succumbed to the deadly viral infection. They took the lead and took reins of the rituals from their scared kin who were fearful of getting infected themselves. “There were at least 10 bodies which were abandoned by kin. I gave them the final bath, dressed them up and performed all rituals as per tradition to give them a decent farewell from the world. But such acts of abandonment broke my heart over the disintegrating humanity,” says Hasinaben Ladla, who has performed final rites of more than 600 Covid victims in the second wave. She took to cremating unidentified dead in 2005 when her husband was diagnosed with blood cancer and she felt she had to serve humanity as she believed it was the only way to pray to Allah for the well-being of her husband. “I would feel shocked when relatives would remove ornaments from the dead body but be scared to touch for final rites. I saw human fear and greed, both up close,” says Hasina. She says she was especially disturbed when she saw two dead bodies of young women, who were only recently married. “If only the pandemic had spared them.. it was too early for them to go,” says Hasina. Heena Velani, 24, a law student in Bhuj, Kutch is probably the youngest woman who took upon this task on herself along with a team of 15-20 women of cremating Covid dead. She says she joined her father, a RSS worker, in this noble cause. “On one of the first days, I saw a young wife who brought her Covid victim husband’s body, all on her own, for cremation. I could feel her pain. I witnessed from close quarters the grief inflicted by the pandemic on families,” says Heena. She says she is glad her operations were shut on Saturday as the pandemic deaths have reduced significantly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/these-women-bid-final-adieu-to-hundreds-of-covid-dead/articleshow/83073721.cms||Bharat Yagnik
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Covid forces change in cop dog training regimen||KOLKATA: With the second wave of Covid hitting the city and Kolkata Police losing five personnel in this period, even the dog squad has been forced to make changes to their daily routine. This is the squad’s golden jubilee year, but Kolkata Police has suspended outdoor training for the 40-odd police sniffer dogs fearing that the limited number of handlers can get infected with Covid if they come in contact with too many citizens. “The dogs need to be taken out and trained across the city to make them aware of actual working conditions. They also need training on roads to strengthen their feet. Those in the explosives and drugs detection units need to get ground training under actual conditions. Usually, a part of this training is done at the Maidan and Rabindra Sarobar. But, as of now, we have stopped this activity. The training is taking place within the confines of the Police Training School. The dogs are going through their usual duties, though. We are carrying special ice packs for the dogs on outdoor assignments,” said a police source. A senior officer overseeing the training said the aim was also to use the swimming pool. “We are looking at multi-purpose exercises since we cannot take them out of PTS. Not only will swimming be relaxing, it will also fight high humidity and will be good exercise. Some of the dogs, like Labradors, love to swim and hence enjoy the new drill,” he said. The Covid situation has also meant that their trainers have to be vigilant about themselves not contracting the disease. “We had initially planned more adjustments when wide-scale Covid cases were reported last year from PTS. But now that the situation is under control, we have to bring in some measures so that we can keep the squad fit,” said an officer at Lalbazar. The city police’s dog squad, which is attached to the detective department, has different breeds, including Labrador, Dobermann, German Shepherd and Golden Retriever and each dog specializes in one of five policing categories — narcotics tracking, explosives tracking, crime tracking, search and rescue, and guard and assault.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cov-forces-change-in-cop-dog-training-regimen/articleshow/83072726.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Since taking over, welfare has been the main focus area of Jagan, whose YSR Congress won 151 of the 175 seats in the state assembly, and 22 of the 25 Lok Sabha seats. He took his election manifesto — Navaratnalu — as his agenda in administration. The last two years saw the state and the country going through a severe crisis due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but it could not deter him from continuing with his welfare agenda. The various direct cash transfer schemes that he introduced came in handy for people during these critical times. The government has so far paid Rs 95,528.50 crore directly and Rs 36,197.05 crore indirectly to beneficiaries in the last two years. Besides the cash transfer under various schemes to various sections of people, his initiatives under Nadu-Nedu have changed the very look of government schools and hospitals. People have started looking back at government schools, with the number of admissions increasing in the last two years. In fact, thousands of parents have got their wards admitted to government institutions from private schools. Even government hospitals, from the primary health centres in the villages and wards to the general hospitals in the city, have become strong under Nadu-Nedu, and now boast of better infrastructure. The villages have also undergone major development due to the administrative reforms introduced through the village secretariats, which brought administration to the doorsteps of people. The construction of Rythu Bharosa Kendras, warehousing facilities, primary health centres have added to the infrastructure in rural parts of the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/welfare-agenda-marks-first-two-years-of-jagans-tenure/articleshow/83072025.cms||Gopi Dara

---||Patna||Number of black fungus cases rises to 300 in Bihar||PATNA: It is a double whammy for some Covid and post-Covid patients as the pandemic has not only affected their health, but also made them permanently disabled with mucormycosis, a rare black fungal infection. So far, more than 300 cases of mucormycosis, commonly known as black fungus, have been recorded in the state. To stop the spread of mucormycosis, doctors in some cases are forced to take tough decisions like removing eyeballs, nasal septum that separates the left and right airways of the nasal cavity, mandible bone (lower jaw, which is the largest and strongest bone in the human facial skeleton), maxilla that forms the upper jaw and part of the brain to save people’s lives. This is fallout of ignoring early symptoms of mucormycosis. Dr Bibhuti Prashun Sinha, head of regional ophthalmic centre at IGIMS, said exenteration (complete removal of eye leaving a hollow) has to be done in three patients. “The primary surgery in mucor is debridement, which is to remove all the dead tissues from maxillary, sinus, floor of orbit to restore the blood circulation. More than 35 surgeries took place at IGIMS to treat mucor patients,” he said. The number of mucormycosis cases at IGIMS has reached 84, including 23 Covid patients. A 61-year-old man, who defeated Covid recently, has contracted mucormycosis. “In the early stage, we did not realise. When he visited an eye specialist, it became clear that he was suffering from mucormycosis. The doctors removed the dead tissues. If his situation does not remove, doctors might remove one of his eyes,” said a family member of the patient. Altogether 11 patients are fighting mucormycosis at Ruban Memorial Hospital. Two patients have died due to late reporting at the hospital. Dr Satyajit Kumar Singh, hospital’s managing director, said eye extraction has happened in two cases. The number of black fungus cases at AIIMS-Patna has increased to 89. Dr Sanjeev Kumar, nodal officer for Covid-19 at AIIMS-Patna, said some mucormycosis patients came after the infection spread from their sinus to the eye orbit, affecting their vision. Additional professor and head of ENT department at AIIMS-Patna, Dr Kranti Bhawna, said the doctors removed the dead tissues from 3-4 patients where eye involvement was found. At PMCH, out of 11 mucormycosis patients, one needed eye surgery. Head of ENT department at PMCH, Dr Vinit Sinha, said as the hospital did not have surgical instrument, the patients are being referred to AIIMS-P and IGIMS. Nitish’s direction on treatment: Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Saturday asked the health department to make necessary arrangements for the treatment of black fungus cases in all medical colleges and hospitals in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/number-of-black-fungus-cases-rises-to-300-in-bihar/articleshow/83072278.cms||---

So far, over 100 patients suffering from mucormycosis (black fungus) have been admitted to the hospital of Banaras Hindu University. According to medical superintendent Prof KK Gupta, 112 such patients were admitted to the hospital till Saturday, out of whom 17 lost their lives during treatment. Three patients were discharged on Saturday. Currently, 92 patients are undergoing treatment for black fungus at the hospital. So far, 67 surgeries of black fungus patients were conducted in the hospital. The patients suffering from black fungus have been admitted to Covid and non-Covid wards. The first case of black fungus was reported in Varanasi on April 30, while a 54-year-old woman from Azamgarh was the first patient to succumb to black fungus infection at the BHU hospital. Meanwhile, the district administration arranged 250 vials of Amphotericin B injections, which is required for treating black fungus infected patients, on Friday. Earlier, 100 vials of the injection had been made available by the district administration on May 19 while 50 more vials were provided on May 23, said Gupta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/92-patients-undergoing-treatment-for-black-fungus-at-bhu-hospital/articleshow/83071415.cms||---

With only 14 out of the 33 districts having vaccine centres, the number of people who got vaccinated in the 18-44 group is quite negligible, officials said. “Only a few big private hospitals can buy these vials but it is not possible for all the private hospitals. That is why we are seeking the help of the government,” said Dr Kishan Rao, president, Telangana Hospitals, Private Nursing Homes Association (THANA). Initia0lly, Telangana government provided free vaccines it got from the Centre. Recently, the government gave permission to private hospitals to purchase the vaccines from manufacturers. According to Rao, THANA will invite vaccine vial requests from all the interested private centres and that would be passed on to the government which will facilitate buying the doses. The hospitals will pay for it. Though around 400 private vaccine centres got registered for the vaccination drive, only 67 are giving the jab to people. Among the 14 districts having private vaccine centres, only Hyderabad (27) Medchal Malkajgiri (8) Nizamabad (8), Rangareddy (13) Nalgonda (2) and Warangal Urban (2) have more than one private vaccine centres. “In Warangal there were about 50 centres registered. Now only one or two are giving vaccines, if the district medical health officers act as nodal officers between us and companies, many can provide vaccines,” Dr Rakesh, president of Telangana Aaroyasri Network of Hospitals ( TANA) said. Most of the hospitals registered as private vaccine centres belong to TANA and each of them have more than 150 beds and there will be around 250 such hospitals in the state. “Not all private centres can administer the vaccines, as it requires a lot of space and logistical support,” Dr Rakesh said. In fact, the drive in private centres slowed down after the state health department stopped the supply of Covid-19 vaccines. Even among the big hospitals in Hyderabad, though some are continuing the vaccine jab for those aged 45 and above, the drive for those aged 18 years and above has not begun. “It will be at the end of the first week of June or so, as most of the hospitals also don’t have enough vials and registration is not being allowed still,” the manager of a top hospital said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pvt-hospitals-seek-govt-help-to-procure-vaccines/articleshow/83072924.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Hyderabad||IIT-H researchers develop oral solution for black fungus||Hyderabad: Amid a shortage of medication for black fungus treatment, researchers from IIT, Hyderabad said that oral tablets of Amphotericin B (AmB), which can potentially treat black fungus, are now ready for technology transfer. The researchers said that using tablets will be cost-effective as 6mg AmB tablets will only cost about Rs 200. Back in 2019, Saptarshi Majumdar and Chandra Shekhar Sharma from the Department of Chemical Engineering are said to have conducted a study about oral nanofibrous AmB being effective against Kala Azar. “That was a first-ever attempt to fabricate nanofibrous oral tablets of AmB for potential cure of Kala Azar. With the 2 years of advancement of examination, we are now confident that the technology can be transferred to suitable pharma partners for large-scale production,” said Sharma. He said that at present, the Kala Azar treatment is being used for black and another fungal infections in the country and due to its availability and affordability there is need to allow its emergency use and immediate trial of this oral drug. Researchers said that AmB is generally not prescribed in the tablet form as solubility within the body is poor and can increase toxicity. To overcome this, in present research funded by DST-Nanomission, a team led by Majumdar and Sharma along with their PhD scholars Mrunalini Gaydhane and Anindita Laha intended to deliver AmB orally at an extremely slow rate. Citing the importance of solutions in given circumstances, Sharma said, “The technology developed is free from intellectual property so that it can be mass-produced and is affordable and available to the public at large.”  The Kala Azar treatment is being used for black and another fungal infections and due to its availability and affordability there is need to allow immediate trial of the oral drug, said a researcher||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/iit-h-researchers-develop-oral-solution-for-black-fungus/articleshow/83072911.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

So far, more than 300 cases of mucormycosis, commonly known as black fungus, have been recorded in the state. To stop the spread of mucormycosis, doctors in some cases are forced to take tough decisions like removing eyeballs, nasal septum that separates the left and right airways of the nasal cavity, mandible bone (lower jaw, which is the largest and strongest bone in the human facial skeleton), maxilla that forms the upper jaw and part of the brain to save people’s lives. This is fallout of ignoring early symptoms of mucormycosis.

---||Patna||Met predicts widespread rainfall in north Bihar today||PATNA: Cyclone Yaas may have weakened, but its impact is not over yet as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued forecast for fairly widespread rainfall, thunderstorm, lightning and gusty winds in the state on Sunday as well. The remnant of Cyclone Yaas, which made landfall as a ‘very severe cyclonic storm’ in coastal Odisha on Wednesday morning, continued to make its presence felt across the state on Saturday, either in the form of overcast skies or heavy rainfall at some places, particularly in north Bihar. Chief minister Nitish Kumar also issued a statement on Saturday that the impact of cyclone is weakening, but people should remain alert. “Departments concerned and authorities of districts have been asked to take necessary steps for uninterrupted water and electricity supply along with transportation and other civic services,” Nitish tweeted. Few places which received significant rainfall in the last 24 hours included Valmikinagar (215mm), Triveni (210mm), Darbhanga (183.6mm) and Begusarai (135.5mm). Patna Meteorological Centre maintained yellow alert for rainfall with lightning at one or two places in all districts on Sunday. “Rainfall continued in the last 24 hours under the influence of low-pressure area formed owing to the weakening of cyclone Yaas. The rainfall and cloud cover also led to drop in maximum temperature by 9-12 degrees C. The remnant of cyclone Yaas was present in the form of cyclonic winds over east Uttar Pradesh and a trough line formed under its influence and stretched towards east,” said Amit Sinha, an officer at Patna Meteorological Centre. He added, “Under the influence of the two weather systems, north Bihar is likely to receive light to moderate rainfall on Sunday.” The India Meteorological Department (IMD) also stated in its all-India bulletin issued at 8pm on Saturday that scattered to fairly widespread rainfall is likely with isolated thunderstorm, lightning and gusty wind in Bihar and east Uttar Pradesh and isolated heavy to very heavy rainfall in Bihar during the next 24 hours. “Rise in temperature amid prevailing high level of humidity in the atmosphere owing to rainfall over the last two days may lead to formation of thunderclouds along with lightning at a few places over the next two days,” Amit said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/met-predicts-widespread-rainfall-in-north-bihar-today/articleshow/83072014.cms||Piyush Tripathi
---||Patna||Farmers bear Cyclone Yaas brunt in Bihar||PIRMOKAM (KATIHAR): The 32-hour incessant rain and stormy wind in the wake of cyclone Yaas have broken the backbone of farmers of this panchayat in the Falka block of Katihar district. Farmers of Purnia and Araria are also hit as their cash crops like maize and jute have been destroyed due to waterlogging in farmland. The kisan salahkars of the panchayats concerned have started assessing the damage caused to the standing or harvested maize crop in Purnia division. The farmers, in turn, have been hoping that the government would announce compensation. Normally, maize is harvested and sold in the mandis of Gulabbag and Gedabadi, or to the local traders having linkage with the mandis, by mid-May. However, labour shortage due to their migration to Punjab delayed the process and made farmers vulnerable to cyclone. The tale of Guddi, a farmer from Chandwa village, is revealing. On Wednesday night, Guddi had last seen the heaps of dry maize ‘bhutta (cobs)’ with their ears/husks pealed, which he had abandoned in the plots of land near Nahaki village, thinking that the cyclone will be weak. He returned to his village, somewhat satisfied that he will get good returns on the maize he had cultivated. On Friday morning, he saw that the heaps of cobs were either submerged in water or had thigh-deep accumulated rainwater. Several other farmers in Purnia, Araria and Katihar districts also faced similar experience. The conditions were the same in six villages of Pirmokam panchayat – Pirmokam, Telghi, Barbaria, Nahaki, Darmahi and Janakpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/farmers-bear-cyclone-brunt-in-katihar-other-districts/articleshow/83072117.cms||Abhay Singh

The annual vacation of the Patna high court started from May 22 and is scheduled to end on June 20. Hearing of cases by a bench during the vacation period is governed by The Patna High Court Rules, 1916. Patna High Court Advocates’ Association president Yogesh Chandra Verma on Saturday sent an email to Chief Justice Sanjay Karol, raising concern over the issue. He said denial of filing of the bail application in high court would mean denial of justice to the litigants. Verma further wrote that from the last 14 months, there is no normal judicial functioning of Patna high court and it has brought untold miseries to the legal fraternity, including lawyers, clerks and other people concerned. Verma told TOI over phone that since The Patna High Court Rules, 1916 has not been amended, filing of bail application cannot be stopped during the annual vacation. “At least 16,000 bail matters are pending for hearing before the high court. Those litigants who need to approach the high court right now would be able to do it only after vacation ends,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/annual-vacation-bail-plea-cant-be-filed-in-hc/articleshow/83072269.cms||Debashish Karmakar

It will help gasping patients while they wait for a bed to be allotted or while admission formalities are being complied with. MR Bangur Hospital, with 587 operational Covid beds, has been treating Covid patients from the first wave itself. The oxygen booth, spread over 128 sq ft, has been set up near the emergency unit of the hospital. Installed by Linde India, the booth has the capacity to support around eight patients at a time. The booth will be managed by the hospital. “We are committed to supporting the government in this fight against the pandemic and will continue to explore other avenues to help address the challenges emerging during these trying times,” said Moloy Banerjee, head gases - South Asia, Linde South Asia Services Pvt Ltd. “There is a need to have additional facilities for Covid patients to get access to oxygen support system. An oxygen booth like this would be helpful for the patients-in-waiting,” said Narayan Swaroop Nigam, principal secretary of state health and family welfare. “We already have a 25-oxygenated bed facility in our emergency wing. But during a sudden surge of patients, all these beds too would be taken up. Now this oxygen booth will help us in time of crisis,” said MR Bangur superintendent Sisir Naskar. Among others present at the opening of the oxygen booth was North 24 Parganas CMOH Somath Mukherjee and other health officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mr-bangur-gets-oxygen-booth/articleshow/83072676.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: We need to change the entire assessment pattern||KOLKATA: Several principals of CISCE and CBSE schools feel an offline examination may not be possible in the current Covid situation, even if it is a short exam, because the chances of contracting the virus cannot be ruled out, it was pointed out at an online discussion on the challenges in holding board exams now. The meet was organised by St Augustine Day School, Barrackpore and Shyamnagar, on Saturday. CBSE said it would take a decision on Class XII exams by June 1, while CISCE said it would decide on ISC exams by the second week of June. On Friday, the council wrote to affiliated schools, asking them to submit ISC candidates’ marks scored in classes XI and XII by June 7. While the principals spoke about the need to vaccinate children appearing for their Class XII boards — as many are looking to study abroad — India is yet to approve any vaccine for children below 18. In fact, no trial for vaccines on kids has been carried out yet. The government has only indicated that vaccines for 12-18-year-olds would be introduced later. Many wanted an online examination because drawing up a mark sheet on the basis of a formula might just not be enough. Most principals felt it was time to arrive at a foolproof online examination system. Rupkatha Sarkar, principal of La Martiniere for Girls, felt that we need to change the entire assessment pattern and bring in the semester system. “Moreover, the report card should change from the traditional format of just marks and look at a 360° evaluation of a child,” she said. Aruna Gomes, principal of Loreto House, said that all board examinees were stressed and were yearning to know the decision. Rodney Borneo of St Augustine Day School, Shyamnagar, reminded that students were trained for 14 years to expect a final exam before they left school for higher education and suddenly they are being told that there’s an alternate reality. Among the school principals who sent in their opinions were Father Bikash Mondal, principal of Don Bosco Park Circus and Devi Kar, director of Modern High School for Girls. “Universities need that exam mark sheet,” reminded Father Bikash. “We need to arrive at a fitting formula,” felt Kar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/we-need-to-change-the-entire-assessment-pattern/articleshow/83072706.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

The Surat Municipal Corporation has started having daily meetings with health experts and officials to chalk out a plan if the Covid-19 cases once again start rising in the city. However, this time the civic body’s focus is on creating health infrastructure for children. “There is a possibility that kids may be more affected if a third wave comes because they will not be vaccinated. We are also preparing for a situation wherein people of all age groups may be affected as the virus may mutate,” said municipal commissioner Banchhanidhi Pani. As part of its preparation, the civic body is ensuring to create oxygen beds for children, paediatric intensive care units (PICU) and neonatal intensive care units (NICU). An SMC official said that they are planning to create 2,000 to 3,000 beds for children if at all a third wave comes. The civic body officials have held meetings with members of Indian Academy of Pediatrics’ Surat chapter and have taken recommendations from them. Meanwhile, nursing staff are also being trained to handle the kids. “To ensure easy availability, we have already installed PSA (Pressure Swing Adsorption) plants at New Civil and SMIMER hospitals and Pal and Bamroli health centres. We are also planning to install more such plants so that medical oxygen can be locally generated,” Pani said. Initiating genome sequencing is also in the pipeline, Pani said. “We are seeking permission for it whether we can do it here or not,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/third-wave-surat-focuses-on-creating-health-infra-for-kids/articleshow/83072511.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Going beyond grief: Things not to say to the bereaved in Mumbai||In a scene from the iconic British comedy series ‘The IT Crowd’, Roy — a socially inept techie — searches for the right thing to say to the bereaved wife at his boss’s funeral. “Just say ‘I’m sorry for your loss’ and move on,” his colleague advises. Emboldened by the crisp script, Roy walks up to the mournful woman and whispers: “I’m sorry for your loss. Move on.” Real life doesn’t have canned laughter or we would be drowning in its surround sound right now, given the number of people pulling a Roy in the face of Covid’s dark hand, as the virus continues to cram graveyards and renders speechless even those fluent in the art of breaking bad news. Humanity’s eternal lack of vocabulary around loss is being increasingly laid bare by a bevy of solemn social media posts which — like signboards inside restaurants — bear lessons in etiquette that are assumed to be common sense until they aren’t. “Do not keep calling us and expect us to give minute by minute details of the medical history or incidents which happened prior to or during hospitalisation as well as reasons for the death,” reads the second bullet point in a six-point recent blog by a Chennai-based mental health professional who lost her husband to Covid-19 and was shocked “when someone claimed that he was more depressed because he knew my husband since school, so he has more rights to be depressed than me and my children.” Besides asking people to avoid statements such as “you should have given him the vaccine earlier,” and what breathing exercises the kids should do, the mental health professional reiterates in the blog: “Don’t use our grief to promote business. I was shocked on seeing a post in a professional circle that claimed that I was helped by that person to secure injection for my husband.” This doesn’t shock Dolly Sharma (name changed), a Bangalore-based college professor and mother of two teen girls who has “grown up” in the last one year after losing the life partner who mollycoddled her for 22 years before Covid took him in April last year. Fresh in the wake of the demise, a family friend from Sharma’s native Jamshedpur, said to her: “This is the right time to convert (to another religion).” “Someone had converted her without her knowledge when she had lost her husband a few years ago. She wanted me to do the same,” says 48-year-old Sharma, adding that there were many who not only took “undue advantage” of her situation but also “bonded with friends over my incident.” “One friend compared her situation to mine. She told people that her husband has only lost his job to Covid, while I had...” says Sharma. Besides the showers of advice, even well-intentioned platitudes such as “they are in a better place”— while acceptable in the case of death from prolonged illness — sting like verbal darts in the context of Covid. “You are a strong woman,” callers kept telling Thane-based Dr Rajani Jagtap when she lost her husband, Shridhar, to Covid in June last year. But then, is there even a right way to condole? “You don’t have to say anything profound,” answers a social media post by Sindhoor Pangal, a bereaved wife whose loss is still raw. ‘In fact, it is really not about what you say. It’s about listening. It is about answering the call knowing very well there will be an hour of sobbing.” For Sharma, resilience came from second-hand empathy. She had heard that her college principal, a woman, had told someone about Sharma: “She’s a lady, she will bounce back.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/going-beyond-grief-things-not-to-say-to-the-bereaved-in-mumbai/articleshow/83076948.cms||Sharmila Ganesan Ram
---||Hyderabad||NBFCs see demand for gold loans soar||Hyderabad: With a slowdown in the traditional sources of funding as people grapple with Covid-19 induced financial stress, non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) are seeing demand for gold loans rise across customer segments. Thomas Muthoot, executive director, Muthoot FinCorp Limited, attributed the high growth in demand for gold loans to two factors – firstly, gold loans were available easily to meet immediate demands as compared to other options. Secondly, the gold prices reigning on the higher side also meant a higher loan availability for customers. In FY 2020-2021, Muthoot FinCorp expanded its physical network by more than 100 new branches, mainly in the north, east and west regions of India, most of which were in rural and semi-urban areas. The NBFC had opened 70 branches in FY20. In August 2020, RBI had increased the gold loan to value (LTV) ratio to 90% from 75% until March 31, 2021. The apex bank has now reverted the LTV ratio to pre-Covid levels of 75% this financial year. As per RBI data, the outstanding loans against gold has nearly doubled to Rs 60,464 crore in FY21 as against Rs 33,303 crore in FY20. Even Ashish Panchal, chief of staff - corporate strategy of Pune-based Bajaj Finance Limited, said the NBFC increased its gold loan branches from 480 to 700 in the last financial year. “The acceptability of gold loans as a means of quick and low-cost funding for personal and business needs is growing. We have plans to add another 100 plus branches this fiscal,” he said, adding that its loan book grew 52% last year to Rs 2,300 crore. He also pointed out that the popularity of gold loans as a short-term working capital option has grown, which has led to an increase in ticket sizes from Rs 75,000 to Rs 85,000 last year. Bengaluru-based Rupeek Fintech Private Limited, that mainly caters to urban customers, too confirmed that there has been a higher inflow of new consumers during the pandemic due to the scarcity of credit from other channels and higher requirement of credit due to distress. “Our disbursals grew 2.5 times during the calendar year 2020. We were in 10 cities by the end of 2019 and we have added 17 more to our list through 2020-2021 till date,” Abhinav Vadrevu, senior director - growth at Rupeek Fintech said. The NBFC expects the momentum to continue and the formal gold lending market to grow between 15% - 20% Y-o-Y in the next couple of years due to two factors. The first being an expected post pandemic boom to restart businesses, which means there will be higher requirement of credit. Secondly, there will be higher technology adoption and digitisation in the industry along with the advent of innovative models leading to increased adoption of gold loans from consumers who were reluctant to use the category owing to higher interest rates and social stigma, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/nbfcs-see-demand-for-gold-loans-soar/articleshow/83072975.cms||Swati Rathor

The memos were issued after some persons, reportedly not eligible to take the vaccines, were given the jabs and a few others were spotted with tokens at the vaccination centre in Goshamahal. The memos were served soon after chief secretary Somesh Kumar made a visit to the vaccination centre in Goshamahal circle. “The memos were issued seeking an explanation from the officers whether the tokens were given to the correct beneficiaries or not,” a GHMC official said. The government had instructed the GHMC to identify people and distribute tokens only to those categorised under high-risk groups like hawkers and grocery shop owners. Under the special vaccination drive, only such people with tokens are eligible to take the jab.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/2-ghmc-officials-get-memos-over-vax-mess/articleshow/83072967.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||CCTV footage confirms leopard presence, confusion about its presence||NAGPUR: The sighting and presence of a leopard by two residents of Gayatri Nagar on Friday was confirmed after the animal was caught on CCTV camera of an infotech company in the early hours of Saturday. Till the time of paper going to print, there was no confirmation if the animal, which remained hidden from view, had left the sprawling premises. On Friday morning, the leopard was spotted in the bathroom of Narendra Chakole and later entered the house of Kishore Jagtap before jumping into the National Power Training Institute (NPTI) campus. This is the first instance that a leopard has entered a crowded residential area in the heart of the city. Its presence in NPTI cannot be ascertained as the institute doesn't have CCTV cameras. Even as search by forest department teams continued during Friday night, the leopard was directly sighted at 2.15 am by security guard Omprakash Naidu (58) working with Trust System & Software. Naidu is a resident of Rambagh Colony. “I saw the leopard from 15-20 feet jumping the wall to enter another info-tech company premises. This is for the first time in my life I spotted a leopard in the open. Earlier, it was only in the zoo I had seen the animal,” Naidu said. “I was scared and before I could alert my colleague Abhijit Shende, the big cat escaped,” Naidu told TOI. Naidu immediately dialled 100 and within 15 minutes police reached the spot along with a forest team which had just completed their search and had gone back. “We checked all the CCTV footage of IT companies on the premises but there is no record of the animal. I suspect the leopard must have crossed the South Ambazari Road through a nullah near VNIT. It is 700-metres long and touches the overflow point. It must have then crossed over to the Ambazari forest,” said deputy conservator of forest (DyCF) Bharat Singh Hada. However, an employee of waterworks department and a resident of Corporation Colony Tejas Vaidya claimed he sighted the leopard in the morning on a Gulmohar tree. “I was having tea and spotted the animal on the tree around 10 am. There was no one around and hence I rushed to call my boss. The forest team was not ready to believe that I had I spotted the big cat. Why will I lie,” said Vaidya. ACF Surendra Kale says after the security guard spotted the leopard, no one has seen the animal. The footage of CCTV installed on the roadside was also checked but there is no record. “A sniffer dog was deployed again but there were no clues. Residents have been appealed to dial forest department toll-free helpline 1926 & rescue center at 0712-2515306,” said Kale.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cctv-footage-confirms-leopard-presence-confusion-about-its-presence/articleshow/83074257.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

All of them have suffered losses due to the restrictions. We ask the government to provide special packages to them,” Sachin Nivangune, president of the association, said.Nivangune said the government should also disburse loans at zero interest to traders and waive interest on existing loans. The association has also urged the government to push 11am deadline by three more hours, as it would help grocers and customers.Shopkeepers also said they were apprehensive of being penalized by police and civic authorities while undertaking home deliveries after 11am, even though it is allowed. “A shopkeeper must open his/her shop to pack home delivery orders, but many members are asked to shut their shops. We ask PMC and police for cooperation,” Nivangune said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/retailers-body-pushes-for-aid-for-women-entrepreneurs/articleshow/83074277.cms||---
---||Lucknow||21 Uttar Pradesh convicts cite pandemic to refuse parole||LUCKNOW: At least 21 convicts lodged in different jails of Uttar Pradesh have refused to avail parole being granted to them. Most of them have cited the fear of contracting coronavirus infection outside prisons as the reason to stay back in jail. Earlier this month, UP jails had started releasing under trials and convicts on bail and parole in compliance with the Supreme Court directives for decongestion of jails in view of coronavirus pandemic. Director general, prisons, Anand Kumar said majority of 21 convicts in nine prisons of the state have refused parole citing Covid-19 scare in their districts. “The convicts say they are getting better care in jails,” he added. So far, nearly 10,000 inmates have been offered bail/parole in UP. Another reason cited by those not taking parole was that their sentence was about to end. They say that if they take parole now, it would be counted as a break in their jail term which they will have to complete when they return,” the DG said. “Prisoners say that they have access to better healthcare facilities, food and medicine inside prisons. Many of them feel that they would not get proper care and facilities in their villages,” a senior jail official said. Another jail official said ever since the outbreak of coronavirus pandemic, health of prisoners is being constantly monitored. “We give them nutritious food. A doctor is available round-the-clock for check-up. We have been able to keep a check on the spread of the virus inside prisons,” he said. At least 10,123 under trials and convicts have been released so far on bail and parole in compliance with the Supreme Court directives. As many as 8,463 under trials were released on interim bail while 1,660 convicts were given a parole of 60 days. Maximum of 703 under trials have been released from Ghaziabad district jail, while maximum 78 convicts have been given parole from Kanpur district jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/21-up-convicts-cite-pandemic-to-refuse-parole/articleshow/83075389.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty
---||Pune||Traders from Pune seek reopening of all shops, plan to meet Ajit Pawar||PUNE: Traders from the city have decided to meet deputy chief minister and district guardian minister Ajit Pawar to push for the reopening of non-essential shops, shut for two months. Officer-bearers of the Federation of Trade Associations of Pune (FTAP) said they had expected non-essential shops to be allowed to operate from this weekend, but relief was given only for outlets selling essential commodities. “We were expecting some relief from this weekend, but our demand to resume the trade was not met. We will hold a meeting with Ajit Pawar and explain how critical the situation has become for all traders, especially for smaller shopkeepers. We will decide a future course of action after the meeting,” one trader said. Non-essential shops in the city have been closed since April, while essential shops could function between 7am and 11am. Traders said they have faced huge losses as a result. FTAP secretary Mahendra Pitaliya said they were pinning their hopes on a positive outcome. “Cases have gone down drastically in Pune in the past three weeks. This is right time to allow shops to reopen. Traders are ready to follow all the norms, but keeping stores shut is very difficult. Traders have cooperated with the government during last year’s lockdown and for the past two months when stricter restrictions were imposed,” Pitaliya said. Suresh Mehta, a trader, said shopkeepers had faced losses for two consecutive years. “We somehow managed to pay salaries to staffers, but for how many months can we pay them, especially when there is no business? Many traders are finding it difficult to pay their loan instalments and taxes,” Mehta said. FTAP said that it has already held a vaccination drive for its members and added more such drives would be held, depending on the availability of vaccines. Sanjay Shah, who sells electronics and mobile handsets, said he had been getting many enquiries, as electronic items and mobile phones were used daily by people. “People are facing a lot of difficulty in procuring these products because of the restrictions,” Shah added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/traders-seek-reopening-of-all-shops-plan-to-meet-ajit-pawar/articleshow/83074268.cms||Sarang Dastane

The market is located in Secunderabad Cantonment. With coordination of the district medical and health office, a separate vaccination unit was arranged on the premises of the market on Saturday. Secunderabad Cantonment Board chief executive officer B Ajith Reddy inaugurated the camp. A team from Bowenpally Urban Health Centre organised the drive. “We hope to administer vaccine to 5,084 frontline workers, including daily-wage workers (hamalis), commission agents, weighing machine operators, shop-keepers and vegetable vendors during the ongoing vaccination drive,” Bowenpally agriculture committee chairman T N Sridhar Srinivas told TOI. The vaccination drive would continue for three to four days, he added. Meanwhile, the CEO visited Bolarum General Hospital and interacted with Covid-19 patients. He asked superintendent of Bolarum General Hospital, Dr Rama Krishna, to give best care so that all patients recover at the hospital. Currently, 18 patients were undergoing treatment for Covid-19 at the Bolarum General Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/nearly-400-get-vax-shots-at-agri-market/articleshow/83072995.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||City hosp takes up monoclonal therapy||Hyderabad: A city hospital has started administering monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to treat elderly patients suffering from Covid-19. Dr Anil Krishna, chairman and MD of Medicover Hospitals, said mAb stimulates a patient’s immune system and fights the virus. “This treatment has shown reduced emergency visits or deaths in up to 70 per cent of positive cases,” he said. The single dose infusion-based treatment can be administered intravenously or subcutaneously in an outpatient ward. The treatment is believed to provide protection to Covid-19 patients with mild to moderate symptoms. Doctors said the drug needs to be administered within seven days of the patient testing positive and it can be given to patients older than 12 or weighing at least 40 kg with comorbidities and immune-compromised conditions. A specialist said mAb therapy is a form of immunotherapy that uses monoclonal antibodies to bind specifically to certain cells or proteins. “Similar to antibodies which are proteins that the body naturally produces to defend itself against a disease, mAbs are artificially created in the lab, tailor-made to fight the disease,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-hosp-takes-up-monoclonal-therapy/articleshow/83073024.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Traders seek monthly relief fund, 12pm-6pm shop hours||MUMBAI: Right now, Sion’s Paul Nagarajan is in his native Thiruvarur in Tamil Nadu where he is known as ‘Mumbai Paul’. He had arrived in Mumbai as a frail teenager in 1996 “with barely one pair of clothes” and soon became the moustachioed owner of menswear shops, one each in Dharavi and in Thiruvarur. Recently, due to the curbs in the two states, both his shops are shut. But unlike his employee in Dharavi, who has been forced to join a grocery store, employees of his TN shop are not as dire. “Here,” says Paul, “Everyone with a ration card gets a Covid relief fund of Rs 4,000 till the lockdown ends.” Even as the Maharashtra government looks at extending its restrictions by another 15 days, traders across the financial capital are seeking a “middle path” between lives and livelihoods. Keeping in mind that the state task force has stressed on an “extremely cautious approach” in high risk districts, some traders want shops, including for non-essential services, to be open for longer hours than the current 7am-to-11am standard for essentials. Others are seeking a more considered approach: A monthly relief fund, staggered timings for migrant workers in retail establishments and diversion of out-of-work house help to essential services. Officials said shops selling essentials might be allowed to remain open for longer .“Asking essential shops to remain open till 11am makes no sense in a city like Mumbai where people wake up late and step out after 11pm at most times.  It would be ideal to allow shops to operate from 12 noon to 6pm,” says Viren Shah, president of the Federation of Retail Traders Welfare Association ( FRTWA), who along with other trade leaders and BJP president Mangal Prabhat Lodha, met governor B S Koshyari on Saturday to request the authorities to allow non-essential services to remain open at least for a few hours beyond 11am. Kishore Kulkarni, secretary of Chembur Merchants’ Association, said while the government expects them to pay taxes like water and property, it is asking businesses to stay shut. Mukesh Kumar, chairman, Shopping Centres Association of India (SCAI), says it is time to gradually open the sectors in a “safe and controlled” manner as Covid cases are reducing. Citing that malls were allowed to open only at a later stage during the gradual opening of the nation in the unlock phase, Kumar says the recent curbs had affected 80% of the employees working in malls, shops, restaurants and service sectors who belong to economically weaker sections. “In April-May, the industry incurred losses mounting up to Rs 3,000 crore and will continue to bleed if not reopened soon,” says Kumar, adding SCAI has made representations to Reserve Bank of India and the state governments for financial relief. Interestingly, in a study in the slums around Cuffe Parade from October 2020 and March 2021, 77% of interviewees in small businesses and blue collar jobs had said yes to the question: “If Covid cases rise, should authorities lock down the city?” “They didn’t mention their reasons but the data is counter-intuitive, isn’t it?” says Dr Nishant Kumar of NGO Eyebetes Foundation, which conducted the survey whose results challenged the popular assumption that the poor rate livelihoods over lives. “Unlike the upper classes who have insurance to fall back on, the poor may be worried about leaving behind children without support,” he says. This may explain why Srithar Tamilan of Mumbai Vizhithezhu Iyakkam (MVI), an association of Tamil residents of Dharavi, is not in favour of relaxation of curbs even though he has seen drivers, maids, construction workers and other Tamil migrants struggle. Confessing that he has yet to see the promised relief of Rs 1,500 reach 25-lakh-odd Tamil migrants in the state, he says shops should be open with restricted or staggered timings and at 50% capacity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-traders-seek-monthly-relief-fund-12pm-6pm-shop-hours/articleshow/83073049.cms||Richa Pinto

Such parents will have to produce a document of age proof of their child to avail the facility. Additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad said all the districts would have at least two such booths while big cities like Lucknow, Kanpur and Gautam Budh Nagar could have as many as four centres. “The booths are meant for the parents of children below 12 years. Those registering under this head will also have to furnish a document to prove that their child is below 12 years of age. In the absence of such a document, they will not be vaccinated at guardian booths,” he said. Special guardian booths are being set up on the instructions of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath who is of the view that the move will help in keeping children safe from the anticipated third wave of coronavirus pandemic. According to health department officials, the booths, which will get functional from June 1, are a part of state government’s ‘Mission June’ under which a target of over one crore vaccinations has been fixed. “Since vaccination and Covid-19 prevention protocol are two weapons against the pandemic, the state government is giving a big push to both. While vaccination drive is being organised aggressively, high number of testing is being maintained to bring out hidden cases,” said additional chief secretary, information, Navneet Sehgal. He appealed to the people to shun apprehensions and get themselves vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/guardian-booths-for-parents-of-kids-below-12/articleshow/83075434.cms||Shailvee Sharda

With the number of mucormycosis (also known as ‘black fungus’) patients consistently rising in the district, the administration has designated 40 beds — 20 at Dr Wasade's hospital and 20 at Christ Hospital — for their treatment. Both the hospitals are equipped to carry out surgeries for mucormycosis and other fungal diseases. Treatment of mucormycosis is free at both the hospitals under the government schemes Mahatma Jyotirao Phule Jan Arogya Yojana and Ayushman Bharat Yojana. Amphotericin-B injections will also be provided free of cost under the scheme to eligible patients. The treatment cost of mucormycosis is quite high as it entails expensive injections which are prescribed for 21 days. Since the amount sanctioned under the government schemes is not enough, up to Rs5lakh each will be allotted from the mineral development fund for the patients’ treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rs-5-lakh-each-for-chanda-mucor-patients-from-mineral-fund/articleshow/83072956.cms||Mazhar Ali

The ruling dispensation’s priorities are way off from the basic needs of the public,” Goencho Ekvott convener Creson Antao said.

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: NIMS bed sold for Rs 1 lakh, middleman in ‘custody’||HYDERABAD: An alleged middleman has been booked for arranging a bed for a Covid-19 patient at the state-run Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS) for Rs 1 lakh. Though police claim they are yet to contact the culprit, they have reportedly taken him into custody. The case was registered based on a complaint by NIMS superintendent N Satyanarayana, who conducted an internal enquiry to check if there was any nexus between the suspect and hospital staff. On May 18, as per the complaint, a patient, Sugunamma, was brought to the hospital by her son Krishna Reddy as she was afflicted with Covid-19. At the hospital, Krishna ran into one Prashanth, who claimed that he could arrange a bed for Sugunamma using his contacts. As her condition was critical, Krishna believed him and paid Rs 1 lakh. She was subsequently admitted to the hospital. Later, Prashanth demanded an additional Rs 1 lakh to continue treatment at the facility. He also cautioned that the treatment cost might go up, Rs 3 lakh for oxygen support and Rs 7 lakh for ventilator support. On suspicion, Krishna verified the admission register. He found that only Rs 1,000 was paid to the hospital and there were no other receipts. “When Krishna brought the issue to our notice, an internal enquiry was ordered. We found that one resident medical officer (RMO) instructed him to give admission to Sugunamma. Further inquiries revealed that Prashanth was not an employee or any way connected to NIMS. He is suspected to be having good contacts with some employees of the institute and cheating gullible and innocent patients and their relatives by collecting huge amounts in the name of giving admission and treatment,’’ the superintendent said in his complaint to police. He also said that actions of some greedy persons, middlemen like Prashanth were spoiling the image of the hospital. When contacted, Punjagutta inspector Niranjan Reddy told STOI that the investigation was yet to begin and Prashanth was not yet contacted for questioning. Satyanarayana said that after they got information about it, they tried to reach Prashanth. As he was not cooperative, the hospital authorities lodged a plaint.

Despite the high cost, these concentrators are going off the shelves both from dealers and at online stores due to the panic buying. “A 5 litres capacity concentrator which was earlier available for around Rs 45,000 now costs over Rs 70,000, including the cost of delivery. It is taking a minimum of 15 days to deliver but people are willing to buy them. We have been selling a lot of these to gated communities these days,” said a supplier who has been supplying in bulk to hospitals, adding that the demand has slowly extended from healthcare facilities to individuals to gated communities and even offices. Further, a scan through online options available shows prices ranging from Rs 50,000 to Rs 2 lakh and more. “I realised that the price of concentrators has shot up drastically over the last two months and they were difficult to get. Now, with the online pharmacies advertising concentrators, I decided to try it out,” said Lasya N, a techie. Experts said panic buying can lead to an artificial shortage and that using a concentrator without technical precision can cause a blast. “Trying to do it without knowing the basics can be dangerous,” said a doctor at Gandhi Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/despite-high-cost-o2-concentrators-flying-off-online-pharmacy-shelves/articleshow/83073051.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Kochi||Kerala: Tribes people reluctant to test, take vaccines||IDUKKI: Even as people are trying to get vaccinated against Covid-19 as early as possible, it has turned out to be a tough task for the health workers in the district to bring the tribal community to the vaccination camps. Not only for taking vaccination, the general reluctance is also experienced in attending the Covid-19 tests, said tribal promoters and health workers. In the second wave, Covid-19 cases have largely increased inside the tribal community. But the unwillingness of the tribespeople, especially the Muthuvan community, to undergo testing raises hurdles before the health workers, panchayat, forest and tribal department officials. Marayoor tribal officer V Sureshkumar said that the reluctance of tribespeople to attend the test and vaccination gives them a headache. “When the officials reached the Palappetty tribal settlement under Chinnar wildlife sanctuary to conduct tests, they were not willing to attend it. Presently, 152 people are infected in Marayoor and Chinnar regions.” The official said that even after repeated awareness camps the tribespeople were not willing to attend the vaccination camps. “Only Chandran Kani, the tribal head of Thayannankudy tribal settlement, had taken the Covid-19 test and others were not willing to attend it,” he said. Tribal department officials said that the tribespeople were not allowing people, including health officials, to visit the settlements. “If the health workers are infected, then there is a chance of the disease getting spread in the settlements. Now, we are trying to conduct awareness camps with the help of tribal heads,” said a tribal department official. Integrated tribal development project (ITDP) Idukki district programme officer K S Sreerekha said that the reluctance was mainly from the Muthuvan community. “The other tribal communities like Oorali, Ulladar and Hill Pulaya are willing to take tests and attend the vaccination camps. The district collector has directed to conduct awareness camps among the tribespeople,” she said. She added that the number of positive cases has shown a decreasing trend inside the tribal community.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/tribespeople-reluctant-to-test-take-vaccines/articleshow/83073071.cms||Sandeep Thomas
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Saliva can reveal corona presence, says study||AHMEDABAD: Many citizens are afraid of the Covid test primarily due to the fear of the nasopharyngeal swab going in the nose or mouth. A study carried out by the Government Dental College and Hospital with the BJ Medical College claimed that the saliva sample can also be an effective method to carry out RT-PCR test. Dr Girish Parmar, dean of the college and principal investigator of the project, said that accuracy of the saliva testing for Covid-19 is found to have 83% accuracy in finding the Covid-19 infection. “When compared with the nasal swab, it is found to have 86.7% match. It opens doors for the new method of quicker sample collection at places where trained technical staff is not present,” he said. The project, that started from September last year at the OPD of Covid-19 in the Civil Hospital campus and at Surat Government Medical College, got 308 samples tested with both saliva and swab. Dr Jayasankar Pillai, tutor at the college and co-investigator of the project, said that the method is found to have low sensitivity rate (40%) compared to nasal and oropharyngeal swab. “We also do not recommend it as the sole method currently, but what we do want to highlight is its potential and need for a larger study,” he said. Out of the total samples, the researchers said that 18% had tested positive on saliva and 9.7% on swab tests. In 7% cases, both the methods yielded positive results. Researchers stressed that the self-collection of samples is a big plus as several studies pointed at its potential.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/saliva-can-reveal-corona-presence-study/articleshow/83074306.cms||---

He said, case positivity ratio during the Covid peak was about 18%, which dipped to 5.5% in May. Prasad said, the cumulative case positivity rate for UP (since onset of pandemic in March 2020) is 3.5%. The second Covid wave is on a downswing in UP and this can be gauged from the fact that new cases have declined on every single day for past 29 days, while recoveries have gone up in the same duration, he added. “With recoveries outnumbering new cases, the recovery rate exceeds 96.1%,” he stated, informing that 2,287 new cases and 7,902 recoveries were recorded in last 24 hours. He also said the number of active cases in UP as on date was 46,201. An official spokesperson said, aggressive testing has been the mainstay of UP’s Covid-19 combat strategy. So far, the state conducted more than 4.8 crore tests. The credit also goes to Covid restrictions, which helped to weaken and eventually break the chain of spread. Meanwhile, Covid-19 deaths remained a cause of concern for officials. As many as 57 deaths took states toll to 20,208.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/daily-covid-case-positivity-drops-below-1-in-up/articleshow/83075469.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Kochi||Labour shortage hits paddy cultivation in Palakkad||PALAKKAD: The acute shortage of agriculture workers has adversely affected the first paddy crop replanting from nurseries in the district, known as the ‘rice bowl’ of the state. The replanting from the nursery should start from the first week of June but the guest workers, who are mainly engaged for it, have not returned from home states like West Bengal, Assam, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, etc. The guest workers of West Bengal and Assam went to their native states for assembly elections and could not return due to lockdown because of a surge in Covid-19 cases. Another major problem is that for the guest workers to enter Kerala they have to produce an RT-PCR test certificate, and more than a group of 10 people are also not allowed to come. All these problems are scaring away the guest workers, farmers said. “Due to climate change, dry seed broadcasting could not be practiced this time and now 80% of the farmers have to go for replanting from the nursery and it is labour intensive. The saplings are 15 days old now and in another 10 days they have to be replanted. If not done, the plants will get destroyed in the nursery itself. On an average, the district requires 3,500 planting workers,” the farmers said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/labour-shortage-hits-paddy-cultivation-in-palakkad/articleshow/83073120.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa government cites high court order, denies bride permission to marry||PANAJI: A woman, who had approached the high court seeking permission from the state government to be allowed to hold her marriage ceremony on May 30 was denied permission by the South Goa collector citing an earlier high court order on the high number of Covid cases in the state. The woman had approached the collector as, in court, the state government had “graciously offered” to consider her case. She had approached the high court of Bombay at Goa seeking permission from the state government for the ceremony after the deputy collector rejected her application. The high court had disposed of the petition on May 27 stating that all rights and contentions of the parties — woman and state — on the subject of merit, are left open, and directed the woman to approach the district collector on the evening of May 27 itself. Accordingly, the woman approached the South Goa collector Ruchika Katyal for permission to hold the ceremony in the presence of 30 persons, including five priests, who on May 28, denied permission citing an earlier high court order about the high positivity rate in Goa. “It is pertinent to note that the high court by order dated May 12, in writ petition, had observed that the statistics suggest that the positivity rate in Goa is still high, the medical infrastructure is severely overstretched. Doctors, nurses and paramedical staff at the forefront of this fight against the pandemic are exhausted,” Katyal stated in her order. In her petition, the woman had stated that when her marriage was proposed to be held on the auspicious day of May 30, there were no Covid restrictions imposed by the state government. A 15-day curfew was announced on May 8, which was later extended to May 31 by way of a separate order. Under the curfew order of the collector and district magistrate, South Goa, passed under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, all social and cultural functions, including marriages and other congregations, are prohibited. However, the order leaves a window for the respondent — state — to consider granting permission for individual events. The petitioner’s grievance is that despite her application for special permission to conduct her marriage ceremony, the state not only did not consider it initially, but also finally, by its order passed on May 24, refused it altogether. The HC stated that it was apparent from the order of the deputy collector that the refusal was simply on the grounds of the curfew order passed to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus. The court had noted that the order had left open a window for the state to consider granting permission for individual events on a case-to-case basis and on such terms and conditions as the state may deem fit. It is the case of the petitioner that what has been proposed is simply a ceremony and not a social gathering involving reception or other festivities, the court had stated. “In the premises, the petitioner has a legitimate grievance. The state was bound to consider her application with conditions, if so, thought fit. What the state has instead done is simply throwing up its hands and refusing to consider the matter of permission despite there being an appropriate provision in that behalf in the curfew order,” Justice S C Gupte had observed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-cites-hc-order-denies-bride-permission-to-marry/articleshow/83074293.cms||Murari Shetye
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Discharges 7.5 times of new Covid cases||AHMEDABAD: On Saturday, Ahmedabad city recorded 281 new positive cases in 24 hours ending 5pm. In comparison, 2,107 patients got discharged in the same period – giving the ratio of 1: 7.5 for new and discharged patients – one of the highest in the recent past. In fact, the city recorded 30% of the state’s total discharges. According to the state Covid dashboard, Ahmedabad district had 24,127 active cases a week ago, which came down to 7,349 – recording a drop of 70%. It was one of the highest drops among the districts of Gujarat. To put the figure in perspective, Gujarat recorded a drop of 52% in one week. “The drop is almost as sharp as the rise for Ahmedabad – the city where it was difficult to find a bed today has about 20% bed occupancy for Covid-19 patients in private hospitals. Even for the critical care treatment (ICU and ventilator beds) occupancy is about 50-60%,” said a city-based hospital administrator. “It’s difficult to pinpoint the exact reason for the steady drop, but it’s to do with the bulk of patients completing seven days and reduction in overall hospitalization period.” On the other hand, mucormycosis has remained a concern for the authorities. Experts said that compared to Covid-19, the turnaround time for mucormycosis beds is at least four to five times longer. “Overall, about 30% of the patients have got discharged from facilities like Civil Hospital. Majority of the patients require multiple procedures and observation,” said an ENT surgeon. “It takes anything between 10 to 40 days for a patient to go back home.” According to Civil Hospital authorities, the campus has over 500 active patients of mucormycosis – accounting for one-fourth of the state’s total cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/discharges-7-5-times-of-new-covid-cases/articleshow/83074304.cms||---

Cops arrested Jayvin Mangecha (36), a resident of Raiya Road in Rajkot and Vahid Rafai (30), a resident of Jetpur town who has so far admitted to siphoning off Rs 28 lakh from 30 traders and medical owners from around 13 states. According to police the duo used GST number, name and address of a Jetpur-based firm and opened several bogus accounts on facebook. They posted several pictures of pulse oximeters, hand gloves, hand sanitizers, remdesivir vials and other useful Covid-related things posing as the owners of Shreenathji trading firm. Besides offering these things at a much cheaper rate in bulk, the duo also gained traders’ trust by providing the firm’s GST number and visiting card along with pictures. LCB police inspector, AR Gohil said, “They had provided several mobile numbers on their fake facebook IDs. When somebody approached them they used to show them some oximeters, sanitizers on video calls and would keep empty cartons in the background. They also would show people invoices of other traders and gain their trust.” When any trader wanted to place an order the duo would ask them to deposit an advance amount in their bank account. But, once the money is deposited, they would keep delaying delivery of the goods under various pretexts like shortage of supply, non availability of transportation before switching off the number. According to a police complaint, of the 30 traders they cheated three are from Gujarat including two from Ahmedabad and one from Gandhidham. The trio was cheated for Rs 4.14 lakh. The other traders belong to Telangana, Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Uttrakhand, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Jharkhand and Karnataka.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/gang-duping-traders-with-covid-equipment-busted/articleshow/83073156.cms||---

The positivity rate, too, remained 22% for the second day on the trot. Saturday also saw the number of fatalities drop below the 30-mark, with 27, taking the death toll to 2,598. Over the past week, Goa has seen an average of 38 persons succumb to the virus every day. Of the total fatalities reported on Saturday, 17 died at Goa Medical College (GMC), seven at the South Goa district hospital (SGDH), and three at different private hospitals in South Goa. A 34-year-old woman from Navelim was the youngest among the deceased. She died at GMC after two weeks of treatment. Two men — a 38-year-old and a 35-year-old from Carapur — who did not have any comorbidities, died after over two weeks of treatment. Six of those who died were in their early fifties, and succumbed to the virus after few days of hospitalization. GMC dean Dr S M Bandekar, said the strain — the double mutant — is very virulent, and that patients’ delay in getting hospitalised complicates matters. He said that deaths are mostly those who were hospitalised two to three weeks earlier.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/for-1st-time-in-5-weeks-state-sees-daily-cases-below-1k-mark/articleshow/83074300.cms||---

The engineering department of the MC has prepared a detailed agenda with an estimated amount of Rs 1.70 crore to install these boards. The matter will be brought up in the monthly general house meeting for discussion and approval on Monday. All the three divisions of the building and road wing of the engineering department prepared the agenda items division wise separately as per the area of their divisions. The divisional engineers have surveyed the roads, where these boards will come up. Accordingly, the financial estimate has been prepared. “Before preparing the estimates and doing the physical survey, the engineering department initially held a meeting with the SSP, traffic, and other traffic officials. Since the traffic police is the enforcement agency, their views were taken and then the plan to install the boards was finalised,” an official said. The new speed limit and signboards will be installed at V-3 (sector dividing) road, V-4 (sub-divisional roads of sectors) roads and V-5 (internal roads of sectors), according to the plan. “As per rough estimates, over 1,500 boards will be installed in the entire city. Besides, new zebra crossings and stop line marking are also in the works,” sources confirmed. The transport department of the UT in April had issued a notification regarding new speed limits in the city. The sector-dividing roads, where the maximum speed was 50 km per hour (kmph), will now have a top speed limit of 60 kmph. With this, the speed limit will be uniform on all sector-dividing roads in the city. Earlier, the speed limit for cars on some roads, including Dakshin Marg, Purv Marg and Madhya Marg, was 60 kmph. The speed limit has now been fixed 40 kmph for internal roads of the sectors. As per the notification, roads have been divided into three broad categories: dual carriageway (roads with dividers, which were earlier termed V1 and V2), single carriageway (roads without dividers; earlier V3 and V4) and sector roads (previously V5 and V6).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mc-may-spend-rs-2cr-to-put-up-new-speed-limit-boards/articleshow/83068117.cms||Deepak Yadav

The facility was in the new building of the hospital. A fire had killed 18 people in the hospital’s Covid ward on the night of April 30. The hospital administrator, Ajaz Patel, has stated on an affidavit that the authorities and the fire team knew about the Covid facility being run in the new building. He said the mother of the leading fire officer was admitted in the same Covid ward in the new building, which was visible from the entrance of the campus. He said a huge signboard, ‘New Covid Centre’, had been placed on the new building to assure other patients that the Covid facility had been shifted from the main hospital building. The affidavit was filed on Friday. Earlier this month, the state government and the Bharuch municipality had asserted that the authorities were not informed by the hospital trust, Bombay Patel Welfare Society, that its Covid-19 facility was functional in the new building. They stated in affidavits that a fire team had gone for inspection of the hospital building on April 30, hours before the fire broke out, but the team was shown only the old building and not the new building. A bench of Justice Bela Trivedi and Justice Bhargav Karia asked the hospital administrator to clarify this aspect on affidavit after the hospital’s advocate refuted the claims of the authorities. The hospital administrator has replied that the government and the Bharuch municipality seemed to have reported “inaccurate facts”. He said, “On morning of April 30, 2021, Shri Shaileshbhai Sasiya, leading fire officer of Bharuch nagarpalika, informed the deponent over the telephone at 12.12 pm that two fire officers are at Welfare Hospital.” The fire officers had come for a Covid survey, according to the administrator. The administrator stated that Sasiya said the officers “will take some pictures/videography and that he had instructed them not to enter in the designated Covid facility/premises.” The administrator added: “The said two officers have taken some photos/video from the old building but not visited the designated Covid facility running in the new building.” Patel further stated, “No report or document has been given to the hospital authority for the aforesaid inspection. The mother of leading fire officer was also admitted and treated for Covid in the new building.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/fire-inspection-team-knew-of-covid-centre-bharuch-hospital/articleshow/83074309.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Family spots missing 71-yr-old woman in Bhojpuri star’s FB post, reunited||Prayagraj: An elderly woman going missing from home for almost a year and finally getting reunited with her family thanks to a Facebook post shared by a Bhojpuri movie star could well be a movie plot. However, in the case of 71-year-old Nirmala Devi, this instance of what seems to be a moment of life imitating art is exactly what happened which has helped her get back with her loved ones, all thanks to the power of social media. At a time when several families have lost their near and dear ones in the present pandemic, the 71-year-old Nirmala Devi, getting reunited with her family brought smiles on the faces of not only the daughters who found their lost mother but also for the members staying in the old age home located at Naini area of Sangam city. The reunion was made possible beacuse of a picture posted on Facebook, following which the three daughters managed to find their mother staying here at the Adharshila Vridha ashram for the past eight months. It so happened that Bhojpuri film actor Khesari Lal Yadav was in the city in the month of March this year in connection with shooting of his film. On March 15, he joined the elderlies residing at the ashram located at Naini. While cutting his birthday cake, the woman seen sitting beside him was Nirmala Devi. Few days later, Khesari shared the picture on his FB account. On May 22, one of the relative of Nirmala devi, Ram Pratap Singh of Gorakhpur came across the picture and informed the family members who were trying to find her since July 2020, when she had left her home from Danapur, Bihar. “My aunt had left the house on July 28, 2020 from Danapur and when we started looking for her, all the trails came to a dead end at Varanasi. We never had the faintest of idea that she could be staying at Prayagraj. But when we got the news through one of our relative that she can be spotted in a picture posted on Facebook post, we rushed to Prayagraj and it was indeed her. Now she is staying with us at Alambagh, Lucknow," shared Mahesh Mal, nephew of Nirmala Devi. The manager of the old age ashram, Sushil Srivastava informed TOI that Nirmala Devi had left her house because of some family issues. She somehow reached Banaras, from there she went to Vindhyachal and then to Zero road bus stop of Prayagraj. “On August 3 last year, she was brought to the ashram and despite her faint memories, we tried to locate her house but all efforts proved futile”. It was a pleasant surprise that early this week the family members came to us and informed that Nirmala ji was related to them and that they have been looking for her ever since she had left home without informing anyone in July, 2020," he added. Nirmala Devi has three daughters, Pratibha, Sangeeta and Prabha Singh. Sushil also informed that when the family members met Nirmala Devi, there was a mixed response of emotions and when they all requested her to come with them, she refused saying that she is happy and comfortable at the ashram. However, they again tried and counselled her after which she agreed that she will go with her brother staying at Alambagh, informed Srivastava.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/family-spots-missing-71-yr-old-woman-in-bhojpuri-stars-fb-post-reunited/articleshow/83071615.cms||---

Traders have urged the chief minister that relaxation should be given to those districts which are reporting less than 200 Covid cases per day and corona curfew should be relaxed from 7am to 7pm. President of the Civil Lines Vyapaar Mandal Shushil Kharbanda said: “Traders have been suffering huge economic losses and they will be on the verge of starvation if they are not given relaxation.: He said, “We have assured state authorities that Covid protocols will be strictly followed and only 50 percent staff will be called for work.” All the workers would wear masks and follow social distancing. He claimed that around 80 percent of traders associated with Civil Lines Vyapaar Mandal and Prayagraj Automobile Association have been administered vaccine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/relax-curbs-traders-on-verge-of-starvation-vyapar-mandal/articleshow/83093749.cms||---
---||Goa||Financial reforms helped Goa repay debts: CM||Panaji: CM Pramod Sawant on Saturday said that due to introduction of various reforms in the state administration, the government has been able to increase its borrowing limit from the existing Rs 2,677 crore to Rs 4,530 crore for the financial year 2020-21. This has helped the state repay the amount for various works undertaken, Sawant said. The chief minister said that the government actively coordinated with the Centre to avail of assistance from available central sector schemes and centrally-sponsored schemes. He said that in the financial year 2020-21, due to the pandemic, the central government allowed states to borrow an additional 2% of the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP). Out of this, 1% was unconditional and the remaining 1% was conditional based on carrying out four reforms within the set deadlines by the central government. “These four reforms were One Nation One Ration Card implementation, Ease of Doing Business reforms, Urban Local Body reforms and Power Sector reforms. The government has fully achieved three reforms. Power Sector reforms have been achieved partially. This made the state of Goa eligible for an additional limit of 1.95% of the GSDP, that is approximately Rs 1,800 crore, thus making Goa eligible for a net borrowing of Rs 4,530 crores from the initial limit of Rs 2,677 crore,” Sawant said. The chief minister said that he has been prudently managing, strengthening and overseeing the state finances by regularly holding meetings with officials of the finance department and other line departments, deliberating on measures to augment revenue receipts, reducing liability and curtailing wasteful expenditure. Sawant also said that the Goa’s is the first state government to adopt the TReDS (Trade Receivables Discounting System) mechanism for facilitating payment to MSME contractors through the Receivables Exchange of India Ltd (RXIL) platform. Through this system, till date, the government has paid more than 480 bills received up to September 2020, worth more than Rs 410 crore within a short span of four months and is still effecting payments through this system. The state was able to avail of special assistance to the tune of Rs 97.66 crore from the Centre as it successfully achieved the reforms stated under the scheme. “As regards to borrowing from Nabard, the rural infrastructure development loans (RIDF) bear a low interest rate (currently 2.75%) as compared to SDLs. The government has rightly focused on development of rural infrastructure and Goa was able to fully avail the set limit of Rs 250 crore from Nabard for the year 2020-21 as against previous years’ drawal of Rs 53.79 crore. This boosted infrastructural development in sectors of sewerage, water supply, health and roads in rural areas. The limit to avail assistance from Nabard has been increased to Rs 350 crore in this financial year,” Sawant said. In order to maintain fiscal discipline, the government has targeted various loans that were taken earlier at high interest rates. Some loans, for example of the Goa Waste Management Corporation (GWMC), amounting to Rs 72 crore, were at high interest rates, as high as at 13%, Sawant said, adding that this required to be revisited.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/financial-reforms-helped-goa-repay-debts-cm/articleshow/83074349.cms||---

The wildlife traffickers were nabbed following a joint operation by foresters, members of Society for Conservation of Nature and a special operation group of UP police. At least 55 sundari (lissemys punctata), 6 chitraindica (narrow-headed softshell turtle) and one sonia (nilssonia gangetica) turtle were seized. Foresters later confirmed that five of the 67 turtles had died. All three species are endangered and find mention in the Red List of the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The smugglers were arrested from near the Pilua Mahaveer temple near Yamuna river in Civil Lines area of Etawah. “The poachers were transporting the turtles to Nepal via Uttarakhand, when the consignment was intercepted by police,” said Sanjay Singh, district forest officer Etawah. Secretary, Society for Conservation of Nature Dr Rajiv Chauhan told TOI that such heavy-weight endangered turtles have been seized for the first time in two decades. An autopsy will be conducted on the dead turtles and remaining ones will be medically examined by released in water bodies. The poachers have been booked under the Wildlife Protection Act.

---||Kolkata||Curb violation: Kolkata cops seize over 1,500 vehicles in 72 hours||KOLKATA: The pleasant weather following the heavy rains due to cyclone Yaas has drawn people out on the streets in droves. According to police, violation of the enhanced restrictions was rampant among two-wheeler riders who sported fake e-pass to venture out and enjoy the weather. Many of those violating restrictions claimed they were either cyclone volunteers or that they were rushing to help a relative who had taken shelter in a home. In all, 794 vehicles were confiscated on Thursday after the cops launched a special drive to rein in the huge number of vehicles that hit the road post cyclone. On Friday, 406 vehicles were seized. On Saturday, 309 vehicles had been seized till noon. In three days, between Thursday and Saturday noon, 1,509 vehicles have been seized. In comparison, the first three days between Monday and Wednesday had recorded 1,393 seizures. “It seemed as though the rains had washed away Covid protocols. We decided to order a crackdown and asked the guards to show zero tolerance towards those out on a joy ride. Even the number of four wheelers seized was higher than the daily average recorded since May 16. The added areas witnessed maximum challans,” said police. Despite the rain, cops had decided to continue to man the 30 checkpoints, leading to the high prosecution figures. “Those whose vehicles have been seized will now have to appear in court,” said DC (traffic) Arijit Sinha. The seizure though is of documents and not vehicles as the seized vehicles are not required to be exhibited to the court. “The vehicles are being released quickly once we seize the vehicle papers. This is allowing us to make maximum seizures,” explained an officer. The police said with limited number of e-passes issued, people were sticking temporary posters claiming emergency services. “They try to brazen it off initially but when we interrogate them, they plead to be let off,” said a traffic cop. Cops say that once caught, citizens come up with the most queer excuses. “A man kept arguing at Esplanade that his uncle was a government servant and he had the right to use his uncle’s car that had a valid e-pass stuck to it. A woman near Kasba told us that his mother-in-law was making her feel claustrophobic at home and hence she needed fresh air,” recalled the OC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/curb-violation-cops-seize-over-1-5k-vehicles-in-72-hrs/articleshow/83073179.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Nagpur||Top hospitals launch customized packages for post-Covid issues||NAGPUR: With increase in number of post-Covid complications like thrombosis, lung fibrosis and kidney problems, many top hospitals in the city have launched special customized packages and rehabilitation programmes on outdoor patient department (OPD) basis. Under the packages, hospitals are offering consultation from clinicians, check-ups, investigations and follow-ups. The premium packages also include physiotherapies, consultation from dietician and other value-added services. Psychological counselling and various exercises like breathing, simple yoga and pranayam are also introduced in the packages. The packages offered by reputed hospitals, which mostly cater to their own patients, are designed to be customer friendly. But many times they are out of reach for commoners who already reeling under heavy expenses of Covid treatment, especially in case of critical cases requiring prolonged hospitalization. A prominent hospital in north Nagpur has categorized its post-Covid treatment facility into ‘basic’, ‘premium’ and ‘executive’ packages. It is offering services as per the severity of the complications vis-à-vis extent of co-morbidities along with extent of side-effects. Though most of the post-Covid complications revolve around black fungus infection termed as mucormycosis that needs intervention by a team of doctors, the other common problems are thrombosis, lung fibrosis, cardiac complications and renal problems. Routine issues are blood pressure, aggravated diabetes and related problems. A hospital in west Nagpur has opened up a special clinic for Covid recovered patients where categorized services are also offered. Eight members of the Chavan family residing in south Nagpur were Covid positive. The family had to shell out around Rs 7lakh on treatment, including pre-Covid tests and hospitalizations, of two of its members. “After already having burnt a hole in our pockets, we were burdened with expenses of treating mucormycosis. Fortunately, it was detected in the early stage and hence the treatment did not cost beyond Rs30,000,” said a family member. Dr Anup Marar, convener of Vidarbha Hospitals Association, said almost all hospitals are charging non-Covid regular rates for post-Covid treatment, which is reasonable. “It is essential all post-Covid patients continue follow-up with their respective specialists. Whether it’s lowering the steroid doses or continuing blood thinners or antihypertensives, it is crucial that Covid recovered patients do not abruptly stop their treatment,” said Dr Marar. “Moreover, lung fibrosis needs to be treated to increase the lung capacity. Checking for mucormycosis is also equally most important nowadays,” said Dr Marar. He also said that in most hospitals have a team of physicians, chest physicians, ENT surgeons, respiratory therapists and dieticians, apart from post-Covid follow up programmes that help Covid recovered patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/top-hosps-launch-customized-packages-for-post-covid-issues/articleshow/83074322.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Allahabad||State’s first extradosed six-lane bridge coming up in Prayagraj||Prayagraj: State’s first extradosed six-lane bridge is being constructed over the Ganga river in Prayagraj district. The bridge, stretching from Malak Harhar to Stanley Road (near Beli Hospital), is being constructed by the ministry of road transport and highways. The work on this Rs 1,948.25 crore project is expected to be completed by February 2024. Talking to TOI, project director Raj Kishor Singh said, “This would be the first six-lane extradosed bridge in the state. The overall length would be 9.9 kilometers, of which 3.84 km would be the main bridge and the rest would be the approach section of the bridge.” “For this stretch of 3.84 km, there would be 67 pillars, foundation work of 17 pillars is in process. Of this 3.84 km, the span of 860 meters would be extradosed bridge and the rest would be precast segmental bridge, having a span of 50 meters. Of this, 860 meters, there would be three spans of 200 meters, two of 130 meters would be balancing spans on either side of the bridge. Besides, two spans 50 meters on either side of the stretch,” explained the Indian Engineering Services (IES) officer. He further informed TOI that there would be a flyover of 750 mts over the existing drain towards the Stanley Road. The bridge would start from the Pratapgrah Road (around 500 meters from Malak Harhar tri-section), would gain a height to over-cross the existing Y-Junction (going towards Lucknow), would cross Ganga from Kacchar area and after spanning over Beli village, would end at Stanley Road. “For the commuters, wishing to move towards Lucknow, there would be a slip road using which one can turn towards Lucknow, while those going towards Pratapgrah or Faizabad would stay on the bridge and land on the existing Prayagraj-Pratapgrah highway,” said the expert who has the rich experience of executing construction of Varanasi airport link road. To speed up the construction work, a temporary road has been constructed which would expedite the transport of men and material. The project director said, “We had the challenge of expediting the construction work in the midst of Covid-19 pandemic and scarcity of oxygen was one big hindrance. The total cost of the bridge is Rs 1,948.25 crore and would be completed by February 2024.” An extradosed bridge employs a structure that combines the main elements of both a prestressed box girder bridge and a cable-stayed bridge. The name comes from the word ‘extrados’, the exterior or upper curve of an arch, and refers to how the “stay cables” on an extradosed bridge are not considered as such in the design, but are instead treated as external prestressing tendons deviating upward from the deck.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/states-first-extradosed-six-lane-bridge-coming-up-in-prayagraj/articleshow/83071472.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||‘Hopeful of launching Covid-19 vaccine in July’||The homegrown healthcare major Zydus Group is close to getting the regulatory approval for its Covid-19 vaccine, ZyCoV-D. Dr Sharvil Patel, the managing director of Cadila Healthcare Limited, talks about the vaccine and other developments to TOI’s Kalpesh Damor.Cadila Healthcare is the flagship company of the Zydus Group. Excerpts…When do you plan to roll out your Covid-19 vaccine?Currently, our vaccine is under Phase-III clinical trials, where we have covered several age groups. We are awaiting ‘event data’, which is the number of positive infections. The interim analysis of that data will happen ideally in the coming weeks. Once that is done, we will approach the regulator for emergency approval.If everything goes well, we can potentially see an approval by June-end. Although it is difficult to provide the exact timeline, we are hopeful that the vaccine will come to the market by June-end or in July.How many doses does Zydus plan to produce?We have the capacity to make 1 crore doses per month. Our new plant for producing the DNA-based vaccine at the Zydus Biotech Park in Changodar near Ahmedabad will be commissioned by June-end. We will be able to start large-scale production from July.We are in talks with some contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) which can add another monthly 40-50 lakh doses in the next 4 months. Zydus is also looking to scale up the in-house capacity from 1 crore to 2 crore doses by improving our yield and debottlenecking. So potentially, our monthly production can be ramped up to 2.5 crore doses in the next six months. If we can get more CMO partners, it could even reach 3 crore doses.What about vaccine efficacy? Can it be upgraded to fight newer mutations?ZyCov-D is very good when it comes to immunogenicity and safety. Its immunogenicity aspect is comparable with many other vaccines approved internationally. It is found to be very safe with no adverse events.Given the comprehensive clinical trial — the largest in India — enrolling 28,000 people at 60 sites, almost all kinds of variants will have been covered.The DNA or mRNA vaccines can easily be repurposed for any new variant of concern. We have synthesized our vaccine prototype for the variants found in the UK, South Africa, and Brazil. In the next 10 days, the variant found in India will also be covered.What is the status of trials on children?We have the approval for conducting clinical trials on children in the 12-18 age group. We have already completed 70-80% recruitment and soon we will have a good amount of data on children also. If everything goes as planned, the vaccine can potentially be approved for the 12-18 age group. The next step would be to test it for the 5-12 age group.Zydus had launched remdesivir at the most affordable rates in India. Will your vaccine also be affordable?Our principle about Covid is that whatever drug we manufacture will be made available at affordable prices. For vaccines, our principle does not change. We obviously need to balance the risk that we took but it will definitely be made affordable.There is a lot of excitement around your biological drug Virafin. How many doses are you producing?The drug has shown great results. The institutions and hospitals that were given this drug have already consumed it and have started repurchasing it. This means they are seeing good results. It takes 45 days to manufacture one batch of Virafin. About 28,000 to 30,000 doses have been supplied in May. We are looking to scale it up to 3-4 lakh in June. Its production is planned to be ramped up to 10 lakh doses if required. Since it is a single-dose drug, 10 lakh doses are equivalent to 10 lakh patients.How many products or therapies has Zydus come out with for Covid-19?We have covered a full spectrum from preventives to diagnostics to therapeutics, and hopefully the vaccine. Our journey is still on to find treatments, diagnostics, and devices for Covid-19. In diagnostics, we are continuing our innovation to bring out more products such as home-care kits and saliva kits. We have applied for DCGI approval for conducting clinical trials for monoclonal antibodies cocktail, which will also be an important treatment for Covid-19 in the future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hopeful-of-launching-covid-19-vaccine-in-july/articleshow/83074400.cms||---

Godinho, who is the state government’s representative in the GST council, said that Goa faces a financial crisis if the compensation is not released on time. “The quantum that has been given to us so far is Rs 840 crore and what is due to us is almost similar, another Rs 840 crore,” said Godinho while addressing a press conference. Godinho said that the Centre never releases the entire quantum of funds and instead disburses funds in smaller tranches of Rs 120 – Rs 150 crore. The Centre has released Rs 70,000 crore to the states as GST compensation for the fiscal year ending on March 31. The council met on Friday via a video conference where the GST panel decided that the Centre will borrow Rs 1.58 lakh crore and pass it on to the states to make up for the shortfall in their revenues from the implementation of the GST. During the meeting, Godinho urged the Centre to allocate additional funds for Goa which is struggling financially due to the closure of mining and tourism. He also urged the Council to take a sympathetic view towards smaller states and the north-eastern states. “They should look at smaller states a little more than the attention that they are giving currently. We should be given the money first so that we will not have any financial crisis. If there is a shortfall with the implementation of GST, then they should compensate for it,” said Godinho. Goa has asked the centre to allocate more funds, over and above the Rs 850 crore owed to Goa and the Rs 300 crore allocated for Liberation Day celebrations. Godinho has made it clear that Goa will struggle to meet its committed expenditure and capital expenditure requirements once the GST compensation is stopped in June 2022. A special session of the Council is likely to be convened soon to consider extending the five-year GST shortfall compensation period to states beyond 2022. The transport minister said that the Centre needs to come up with an “out-ofthe-box” solution to aid states who will continue to face a GST revenue shortfall after June 2022. “What do we do after that about the shortfall? We have to either continue the compensation cess or revisit the rates of some of the commodities or open up other avenues that will generate more revenue,” said Godinho.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/crisis-likely-if-centre-does-not-pay-rs-840cr-gst-dues-mauvin/articleshow/83074328.cms||---

Adalaj police on Friday busted the call centre racket being run by the duo — Ibrahim Iqbal, 24, of Mozambique and Pasoon Manalai, 23, of Afghanistan — from a flat in Khoraj. The accused told the cops that they were working for another Afghan national Yusuf who gave them leads to cheat the US citizens. “Manalai is a PhD student from a premier institute in Gandhinagar and Iqbal is an MSc (IT) student from another premier institute in Ahmedabad. They came to India on the student visa and has a good education record so far,” said inspector J H Sindhav of Adalaj police. Sindhav said that they got the numbers and contact details of Yusuf, who was also a student of the institute in Gandhinagar. They were staying in an apartment at Reflection Pacifica Flats in Khoraj. When a team of Adalaj police reached there and barged into the flat, the accused threw their two laptops and two cellphones out from a window. They later told the cops that they were running a call centre where they used to call up US citizens for personal loans and later ask them to scan a QR code at Bitcoin ATM centres. As the US citizens scanned the code, the accused would get their details and used to transfer the money in their account. The cops booked them for cheating, breach of trust, criminal conspiracy and evidence destruction along with IT (information technology) Act and began an investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/accused-are-phd-it-students/articleshow/83073191.cms||---

Within a fortnight of Fr Davis Chiramel launching Covid Death Support, a project which aims at providing Rs 50,000 financial support to 500 families which have lost their breadwinners to Covid, offers have already come in to help 300 families. According to Fr Chiramel, financial aid to 40 families has already been disbursed. “At a time when many families are already finding it difficult to make both ends meet, losing their breadwinners is a very difficult situation. It was in this backdrop that we launched Covid Death Support project, asking people to donate for the cause. Keralites from across the globe responded positively with people donating Rs 50,000 each to 300 families which comes to Rs 1.5 crore,” said Fr Chiramel, a good Samaritan who had earlier donated one of his kidneys to an unknown person. We go as many as 700 applications. The applicants were shortlisted following online meetings to ascertain their eligibility. We also held virtual meetings with the sponsors. We could so far distribute the benefits to 40 families. The amount would be distributed to the remaining 260 families soon. The sponsor would directly send the sum to the beneficiary’s bank account. We just provide the bank account number and other details of the beneficiary to the sponsor,” Chiramel said. “Many organizations of Malayalis across the globe, including the US, have come forward to sponsor families. I am happy to hear that the state government would be providing financial support to the children who have been orphaned by Covid,” Chiramel said. We also have plans to provide Rs 1 lakh to 100 such families for helping them to start their own business or identify a means of living. “The Rs 50,000 is an immediate solace for the families. But, they should get support for making a livelihood. That’s why we plan to give Rs 1 lakh each to the most eligible families,” said Fr Chirmel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/fr-chiramels-initiative-is-a-big-hit/articleshow/83073238.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

---||Ahmedabad||Schools oppose recruitment drive over ‘irregularities’||Ahmedabad: The Federation of Self-Financed Schools, Gujarat, has opposed the state government’s recent recruitment drive for school teachers. The federation has asked schools to withhold appointment letters to candidates. The schools have the final say in handing out appointment letters, according to an association member. “The education department is scheduled to issue recommendation letters based on which appointment orders are to be handed out to 2,938 teachers in the state on June 1. This controversy is likely to delay this process,” said sources in the state education department.Until recently, the governing body of self-financed schools and grant-in-aid schools used to directly hire teachers. This changed in 2011, when a central recruitment committee was formed by the state education department. The committee would send a recommendation letter to the district education officer who would direct it to the school’s governing body. From there, it would reach the candidate. “In the recent recruitment process, it has come to light that appointment orders have been made in advance and the governing council of schools are being given oral orders without written instructions from the district education officer. We have decided to raise our voice against this gross irregularity,” said a senior office bearer of the federation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/schools-oppose-recruitment-drive-over-irregularities/articleshow/83073240.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: City of Panaji hires 6 staffers without government nod||PANAJI: Cash-starved Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) flouted state government recruitment norms while hiring six staff members including a ‘garden consultant’ who was paid Rs 60,000 per month since October 2019. RTI documents show that CCP did not obtain prior approval from the Department of Urban Development, which, in February 2020, rejected the appointments of some of the workers as there was “no sufficient justification for such an expenditure” for a garden consultant. Records also show that despite the department of urban development issuing clear instructions on February 2019 to all civic bodies not to engage contract staff or daily wage workers, CCP went ahead and recruited a garden consultant and an executive manager. It also recruited two municipal engineers, one automobile engineer and one waste management coordinator. What makes things even more puzzling is that some of these staff members were hired in November and December 2019 while the interviews for the posts were conducted in February 2020. While the waste management coordinator was paid a monthly salary of Rs 30,000, the others were paid Rs 40,000 per month. In March 2020, CCP passed a deficit budget of Rs 11 crore. The department of urban development immediately red flagged the appointments, with then additional director of urban development Ramesh Naik writing to CCP commissioner Sanjit Rodrigues in November asking why the recruitment process was not followed while hiring. Department of urban development issued another note advising CCP “not to resort to engagements without taking prior approval” which the civic body took a liberal view of. TOI has copies of the correspondence between CCP and the directorate of municipal administration. CCP’s own reply to the RTI application admits that “no administrative and financial approval was obtained from the department of urban development for appointment of the six staff members.” CCP justified the appointments saying that they were hired as per the solid waste management rules, 2016. The appointment of the garden consultant was cleared by the standing committee on September 23 without any advertisement or interview while the remaining five were appointed at the ordinary council meeting held on March 2. The walk-in interviews were conducted on February 13, the same day that the DMA asked CCP not to hire staff without prior approval. CCP commissioner Sanjit Rodrigues conducted the interviews along with two CCP municipal engineers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ccp-hires-6-staffers-without-govt-nod/articleshow/83074392.cms||Newton Sequeira

Apart from the resumption of dine-in services, AHAR has pleaded for vaccination of the workforce on a priority basis as they are constantly on the move due to the nature of their job and are exposed to residents, municipal authorities and vendors. This would build confidence among the customers, it said.  AHAR has requested extension of the period of renewal of permit room licences and reduction of the applicable fee for the current year. It has also sought extension of validity period for all BMC licences, permissions and NOC to conduct business for the full year. Lastly, AHAR has requested for waiver of property tax for lockdown and partial lockdown period. — Chittaranjan Tembhekar||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-reopen-hotels-restaurants/articleshow/83073246.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Producer-technician row over home shoot||KOLKATA: A section of channel heads, producers and actors are miffed with the objections that Federation of Cine Technicians & Workers of Eastern India (FCTWEI) president Swarup Biswas has raised to shooting of serials at home during the extended period of restrictions in Bengal. While Biswas insists that this trend of home shooting is against the spirit of MoU, the others insist such hurdles will only push units to shoot outside Bengal. On Thursday, Biswas sent a letter to the makers of ‘Krishnakoli’, ‘Karunamoyee Rani Rashmoni’ and ‘Boron’. “I have told them they if they don’t stop this trend, we will have to seriously think about the participation of technicians once shooting resumes on the floor,” Biswas said. Snehasish Chakraborty, who owns Blues that produces ‘Boron’, ‘Jamuna Dhaki’, ‘Gangaram’, ‘Khelaghar’ and ‘Jiban Sathi’, was shocked to receive the mail from FCTWEI. “In my reply to FCTWEI, I have objected to the words used in the letter and requested the organization to maintain a decorum. I have been in the industry for 17 years. Never have I deprived artists or technicians. In my letter, I also said that we are all very concerned about the future of the television world,” said Chakraborty, whose serials are now being shot at home. Susanta Das of Tent Cinema that produces ‘Krishnakoli’, ‘Titli’, ‘Binapani’ and ‘Aparajita Apu’ says FCTWEI needs to get rid of its rigidity and support producers and channels to keep the show running. “If that does not happen, I will shift the shooting of my Hindi serial to Gujarat or Daman,” Das said. Samrat Ghosh, Cluster Head – East ZEEL, says Biswas is “stretching things too far”. “Since we have always financially supported technicians, I wonder if his letter echoes the sentiments of them collectively or this is just his personal reservation. If we don’t shoot from home under the current situation, we risk our viewers shifting to watching Hindi content. That will be a big damage to the Bengali industry. Besides, FCTWEI isn’t even allowing producers to start new serials,” he said. Director Saibal Banerjee, the co-founder of Magic Moments that produces ‘Mohor’, ‘Sreemoyee’, ‘Khorkuto’ and ‘Desher Mati’, said Tollywood must embrace the concept of shooting at home just like other industries have accepted the work from home format. “We are contract-bound with channels to deliver episodes. If new episodes are not telecast, advertisers will shift elsewhere. All the revenue that is generated by serials will be lost. If we generate revenue by shooting at home, we will share a percentage of that with technicians of our unit,” Banerjee said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/producer-technician-row-over-home-shoot/articleshow/83073274.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

---||Dehradun||Caught for illegally entering India, American released||ALMORA: Farida Malik, an American citizen of Pakistani origin who was lodged in Almora Jail since July 2019 for illegally entering India via Nepal, has been released after completing her sentence. The Champawat police had reached Almora jail to pick her up and she will now be taken to Delhi for a medical examination. After completing the formalities, she will be deported back to the United States of America (USA). Govind Bisht, sub-inspector, Sharda barrage outpost in Banbasa, told TOI, “She was released from the Almora jail on Friday. Today (May 29), we got her tested for Covid-19 at Almora Base Hospital.” Dr Jitendra Deoradi, Almora Medical College, confirmed to TOI that her report returned negative. “Now, she will be taken to Delhi. After all formalities, she will be boarded on a flight to the USA on May 31,” SP Champawat Lokeshwar Singh told TOI. Farida was caught at the Banbasa immigration check post in Champawat district, while she was trying to reach Delhi on a bus from Kathmandu without proper documents. Subsequently, the officials at the immigration check-post handed her over to the Champawat police. At the time of her arrest, she had claimed that she was a singer and was travelling to Delhi. Police had registered a case against Farida under section 3 of the Passports Act and section 14 of the Foreigners Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/caught-for-illegally-entering-india-american-released/articleshow/83071685.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: After oxygen trauma, hospitals start early for next round||NEW DELHI: Having learnt a lesson from the oxygen crisis recently, city hospitals are in talks with oxygen plants on installing production facilities in their premises in preparation for the expected third wave of Covid infections. TOI spoke to several hospitals some of which claimed to have floated tenders and are looking at the technicalities of oxygen generation at the hospitals. Fortis Hospital, for one, is holding technical and commercial negotiations with some oxygen plant manufacturers, with finalisation expected soon. “The plants we are talking about generate oxygen of 93-94% purity, less than the medical grade of 99%+ purity. But the gas these plants produce will supplement the hospital oxygen," said Dr Bishnu Panigrahi, group head, medical strategy and operations, Fortis Healthcare. "We cannot use this gas in operation theatres because the present generation of anaesthesia machines malfunction at this purity level of oxygen, but it can be used for patients in wards, high dependency unit and ICU.” At Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, an audit of all oxygen pipelines is being carried out. “We are also trying to increase our oxygen storage capacity. As for a self-generation plant, we will chalk out a plan soon,” said Dr D S Rana, chairman of the hospital. Jaipur Golden Hospital, which suffered tragic deaths due to oxygen shortage recently, said it only had the parking to set up an oxygen plant. “We are trying our best to chalk out a way, but space is an important factor,” said an administrative source in the hospital. “In Delhi, most hospitals don’t have free space in their complexes. We need to look at all aspects and hope the civic authorities will get involved too.” At Aakash Healthcare in Dwarka, too, space is a concern because a plant requires adequate area around for safe operations, said an official. “Talks are under way with overseas firms for equipment. However, there are challenges. For one, even if we get the fastest oxygen generator, the problem is that it has no provision for storage. And then there’s the question of space,” said the official. Max Hospital is consulting experts on the matter, while Apollo Indraprastha Hospitals has made arrangements for any increased requirement of liquid oxygen in the future with its two existing vendors. “In addition, the hospital has installed an oxygen generator plant with the support of the French government. The hospital is also exploring the installation of a liquid medical oxygen generation plant,” an Apollo official disclosed. Dr Shuchin Bajaj, founder-director, Ujala Cygnus Group of Hospitals, preparations were on for any resurgence of Covid. “Installation of five oxygen production PSC plants has started. We are trying to import two more from France,” said Bajaj. “ACT and Swasth Foundation have also helped by giving us hundreds of oxygen concentrators. We are also preparing neonatal and paediatric ICU beds as well as paediatric wards and are in talks with leading paediatric hospitals on providing expert services to small towns and rural communities.” At Shanti Mukund Hospital, an oxygen generator plant had been installed earlier and it produces enough gas to fill 125 type D cylinders. The hospital has also come up with a plan to face any crisis of the recent type.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/after-o2-trauma-hospitals-start-early-for-next-round/articleshow/83073289.cms||Sakshi Chand

The decision was taken after two building crashes – that of Sai Shakti on Friday night and Mohini Palace on May 15. In all, 12 people have been killed, seven on Friday and five in the earlier crash. Both buildings were constructed in 1994-1995, when inferior quality of sand was used for construction of buildings in the township. TimesViewIf UMC is issuing notices, it must also arrange for accommodation for a significant number of people. In addition to this, the state government must urgently take up the task of reconstruction of some of the precarious buildings and at the same time initiate action against the builders who were guilty of constructing such illegal, hazardous structures.Thane guardian minister Eknath Shinde said the state government will give Rs 5 lakh to the kin of each of the deceased in the latest tragedy. Dr Yuvraj Bhadane, public relations officer of Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation, said, “After the Mohini Palace collapse, we in the last 10 days have served notices to 990 buildings which look dangerous from the outside, including 50 buildings that came up in 1994-1995, asking them to get structural audits done.” He added, “To avoid any human loss in future, the civic body on a priority basis will evacuate people living in 50 buildings that have come up in 1994-1995. Most buildings constructed at that time are collapsing because inferior quality of sand was used in that period.” Shinde has asked UMC chief Dr Raja Dayanidhi to submit a report about technical problems faced by citizens in regularisation and redevelopment of illegal buildings despite the FSI of 4 given to such buildings. He said, “In 1994-95, the local civic body had demolished some of the unauthorised buildings by pulling down their slabs, pillars and rods. But some developers welded the iron rods, recast the slabs and reconstructed the buildings. Such structures are now crashing.” He directed the UMC chief to shift occupants of such buildings to safer places.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/notices-to-50-ulhas-bldgs-vacate-if-no-audit-in-15-days-in-mumbai/articleshow/83077227.cms||---

In all, more than 800 students—600 B Tech and 200 postgraduate students—received placement offers from about 250 companies. The institute, which organised a virtual success meet of Campus Placements-2021 on Saturday , said that another 50 students got the jobs through off-campus drives. “The highest package received this year is Rs 51.5 lakh per annum (LPA). Three students from electrical engineering received this package from Atlassian Corporation for a software developer role,” said K Kiran Kumar, head, Centre for Career Planning and Development (CCPD). The next highest package, Rs 43 lakh per annum, was offered to 13 students from Microsoft, he added. He said that amid the pandemic, the institute started concentrating on getting companies recruiting from the banking sector and those looking for data analysts. “When we realised that there is not much hiring in core sectors, we started looking at alternatives,” he added. NV Ramana Rao, director, NIT Warangal said that the average package received this year is Rs 13 lakh per annum. Rao emphasised that NIT Warangal students were placed indifferent sectors such as software industry, banking, educational, service, andcore engineering sectors. “This kind of end result is possible because of the unique academic culture NIT Warangal has and the academic standards institute follows,” he added and appreciated the head at CCPD and his team for their effort in particular and faculty in general for keeping up the spirit among the students during the pandemic.

---||Ahmedabad||Container shortage, high rates plague exporters||At a time when the domestic market continues to reel under the second wave of Covid-19, exports have come to the rescue of the industry by bringing in much needed business from overseas. The exporters’ reprieve, however, seems to be spoiled by the container shortage and spiralling rates of containers. The ongoing second wave of the pandemic has further aggravated the container shortage that began to form last year. Containers are essential for export and cargo movement. Inadequate availability of containers and uncontrollable container charges are eating into the profits of exporters, said market players. "Depending upon the destination of the shipment, the container rates have jumped three to seven times over the last one year," said Parth Ganatra, chairman, MSME committee, Assocham Gujarat. Stating that the shortage of containers — be it for exports or imports—has been hounding exporters ever since the outbreak of the pandemic, Ashwin Nayak, founding chairman, Federation of Indian Spice Stakeholders (FISS), added, "The intensity of the shortage and rates has increased. The rate for a container (40 feet long) to make shipments to the US used to cost $2,500 in February-March last year. The same now costs $ 6,500 to 7,000." For Morocco, the container freight has jumped to $850 from $140. The hike is the same for destinations such as Egypt, Oman and other countries. "If a container needs to be imported from China, the container alone, excluding the goods contained in it, currently costs around $1,000. The rates used to hover around $250-300 previously," said Bhupendra Patel, chairman, Gujarat region, Basic Chemicals, Cosmetics & Dyes Export Promotion Council (Chemexcil). Usually, containers used for imports are deployed for exports to avoid additional transportation cost. Exporters dealing in all sectors such as salt, ceramics, brass, engineering, spices and others are feeling the pinch of higher container rates. According to industry players, container shortage, availability of vessels and high container freights have resulted into delays in shipments and reduction in export orders as well. The cost has also increased due to higher freight and container rates. The waiting period for containers currently ranges between 10 and 15 days, which used to be about a day or so in early 2020. In case an exporter requires a container immediately, he or she ends up paying 100% premium. There are a number of factors causing the shortage, but the prominent among them is uneven exports and import ratio in India. "The mismatch in incoming and outgoing containers in importing and exporting countries, mainly China, has fuelled the shortage. As countries gasp for containers, the rates have shot up," added K G Kundariya, former president, Morbi Ceramic Association. "The turnaround time of a container is increased due to Covid-induced labour shortage and logistics issues. A container that used to rotate in three days is now taking five days," said a senior DGFT official.  Boost to domestic production n the wake of container shortage globally, the Union ministry of ports, shipping and waterways is encouraging manufacturing of containers in Bhavnagar and Kutch. "A Dubai-based company, Transworld, signed an MoU with Sagarmala Development Company Limited (SDCL) in March to invest Rs 200 crore to manufacture containers in Gujarat. Besides, there are other players in Bhavnagar and Kutch, who are thinking of manufacturing containers locally," said Rahul Modi, member, National Shipping Board (NSB). SDCL is established by the Union ministry of shipping and ports. The Dubai-based company, Transworld, is scouting for suitable land in Kandla, Bhavnagar and Hazira to set up its container manufacturing unit. Another company, Malara Shipping Private Limited is also thinking of manufacturing containers in Kutch. India’s growing REQUIREMENTS China manufactures about 90% of shipping containers made globally India currently sources all of its container needs from China India expected to see a demand for 60,000 Twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) of containers for coastal shipping between 2021 and 2026 India’s total external trade grew to $838 billion in fiscal 2019-20, growing at 5.5% CAGR since 2009-10 Increasing trade is translating into higher demand for containers (Source: NSB)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/container-shortage-high-rates-plague-exporters/articleshow/83088185.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

The next of kin to the deceased labourers will get Rs 29 lakh each — Rs 20 lakh from National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), Rs 4 lakh from Uttarakhand Disaster Relief Fund, Rs 1 lakh under a beneficiary scheme of the Uttarakhand government, and Rs 2 lakh each from Uttar Pradesh government and the Centre. Thirty-three labourers from Lakhimpur Kheri district and one from Shahjahanpur district were washed away by the flash flood. Five bodies were later recovered. They were identified as Jalal Ali (20), Vimlesh (23), Avdhesh (19), Suraj (21), all from Kheri, and one Sher Singh from Shahjahanpur. On February 23, the Uttarakhand government had issued a notification authorising nearly 140 people still missing to be declared “presumed dead”. After the missing 140 people were considered dead in March by the neighbouring state government, the required information was provided to them by the Kheri administration. Thereafter, a gazette was published in newspapers on April 23 to "seek objection". With no objection received, the death certificates were issued by Uttarakhand authorities. Among the 29 missing labourers, 13 were from Ichchanagar, eight from Bhairampur and one each from neighbouring villages. Their families are yet to receive the death certificates though. On Saturday, Santosh Raj, a former village head of Ichchanagar, told TOI, “The four families have received the compensation, but the kin of missing people are yet to receive financial aid. We were told that they will receive it in two weeks.” When contacted, Nighasan sub divisional magistrate, Om Prakash Gupta, said, “All the formalities are complete. The 29 missing labourers have been declared dead. No objections were raised after the gazette was published a month ago. The death certificate and the compensation will be provided by the Uttarakhand government and the NTPC.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/tapovan-tragedy-missing-29-kheri-labourers-finally-declared-dead/articleshow/83068283.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Our morning prayers take place at the Brahma Muhurat at 4 am. They are forcing us to break a tradition that has been going on for generations,” said Bhuvan Uniyal, dharma adhikari of Badrinath temple. BD Singh, a senior official of the Devasthanam board who is also the in-charge of Badrinath and Kedarnath temples, told TOI that he has already intimated the board CEO and the concerned officials about the issue. The development comes a week after two seers sat on a hunger strike near the temple premises demanding they should be allowed to visit the temple even though the shrine is closed for pilgrims. They claim that it’s their tradition to eat only after the darshan (sighting) of the idol of Lord Badrinath. Mauni Baba, one of the protesting seers, said, “We are Naga saints and according to our Shankaracharya parampara (tradition), we only partake of food after the darshan of Lord Badrinath.” The two seers started their hunger strike last Sunday (May 23). “There are only a few of us here and we all have our RT-PCR negative reports as well. The government must consider our demand as we will not eat before the darshan of Lord Badrinath,” the seer said. The SOP issued by the state restricts the entry of pilgrims in the Char Dham shrines — Gangotri, Yamunotri, Badrinath and Kedarnath — due to the pandemic. “Priests have been told about the guidelines set by the state. We cannot extend relaxations to selective people,” said Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/change-in-pooja-timings-irks-priests-of-badrinath-shrine/articleshow/83071708.cms||Ishita Mishra

The company runs a large steel plant at Hazira in Gujarat. AM/NS India’s procurement of vaccines comes after the Gujarat government’s health department earlier this month asked corporates and industries here to extend their support by vaccinating their employees as the country was facing constraints in the supply of Covid-19 vaccines. The firm ordered vaccines from Serum Institute of India, the manufacturer of Covishield. The shots will be administered to those in the age group of 18 years and above, the official added. At a meeting chaired by principal secretary (health) Jayanti Ravi earlier this month, the government asked the corporates to start sourcing vaccines directly from manufacturers, including those overseas. The meeting was attended by about 500 representatives from corporates and industries across Gujarat. “The priority of AM/NS India in a pandemic like this is to ensure the safety and health of our employees, their dear ones and our business associates, aiming for 100% vaccination for all. “We remain committed to their well-being and will provide it free across locations of our operations.” said Anil Matoo, Head-HR operations, IR & Administration, AM/NS India. At the meet, industries in the state were encouraged to setup private Covid vaccination centre on their premises upon fulfilling certain conditions.

---||Rajkot||Devastating Tauktae pushes Amreli’s milk production down by 30%||Rajkot: Already reeling under the destruction caused by cyclone Tauktae, the cattle breeders of Amreli district are now witnessing a 30% reduction in milk yield from milch animals. Breeders opine that the primary cause behind the reduced yield is the state of shock that the animals are in since witnessing the devastating cyclone. Lack of proper drinking water and fodder in the aftermath of cyclone has also resulted in reduction in milk production. “The animals don’t give milk when they are in stress or shock. The animals often stop giving milk when they see one from their herd being hunted by wild animals like lions or leopards. After the cyclone the animals are in shock and that has resulted in reduction in yield,” Haresh Khuman, a cattle breeder from Mevasa village of Savarkundla taluka, said. Normally, one buffalo gives 12 to 15 litres of milk in a day but according to cattle breeders now some buffaloes are yielding just two litres of milk while few others aren’t allowing milking. The cattle owners trying to bring the buffaloes out of shock are bathing them five-six times a day. “We are pampering them like children,” Manu Dhakhda , a farmer leader from Vadli village, said. The cattle breeders of Khambha, Rajula and Jafrabad talukas which were most affected during the cyclone are facing this problem. According to cattle breeders some of the animals were tethered on the night the cyclone hit Gujarat so they were not able to escape its fury which added to their shock. “The animals are not giving milk. For the first time in our life we are forced to buy pasteurised milk bags for our consumption,” Jasu Mobh, a cattle owner from Khambha area said. The milk production generally goes down during the summer. The cattle breeders sell the milk to local hotel owners and to their retail customers. The excess milk is sold to Amreli district milk producers union popularly known as Amar dairy. This dairy is also part of GCMMF which markets the brand Amul. This dairy collects the milk from the cattle breeders of Amreli and Gir Somnath district. “Before the cyclone we used to get 1.60 lakh litres of milk per day which was reduced to 70,000 litres soon after the cyclone because the collection centres had collapsed and roads were blocked. The milk collection now is 1.20 lakh litres per day,” Ashwin Savaliya, chairman of Amar dairy, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/devastating-tauktae-pushes-amrelis-milk-production-down-by-30/articleshow/83073374.cms||---

Students said that the institute should instead use internal marks to promote students, rather than ask them to appear for final exams amid the pandemic. “Many students lost their family members, are taking care of their family, and some are undergoing Covid-19 treatment. At this juncture, the institute is asking us to appear for examinations in online mode. A majority are not mentally ready to appear for exams. Why can’t they cancel these exams,” questioned a student. They demanded that the institute cancels exams of first, second, third, and fourth-year students. While exams for second, third, and fourth-year students are scheduled to be held from June 3, for first year students, exams are scheduled to begin from July 22. Students claimed that postponing exams is not an option as they had to utilise most of their time in doing internships as they need to do 10 internships to complete the course. They said that the internal assessment of the institute is robust and accounts for 40% of the total marks and added that the same should be considered to award 100% of marks. In response to the representations made by students and parents, the institute said that conducting the examination is of paramount importance in the life cycle of students and that it has decided to conduct these examinations in the online and proctored mode as per the announced schedule.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/students-demand-exams-be-cancelled/articleshow/83074423.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

NCP spokesperson and skill development minister Nawab Malik said ever since the formation of the Maha Vikas Aghadi government in November 2019, Pawar had been reviewing the performance of the NCP cabinet members at regular intervals. “In recent past, such a meeting could not take place as Pawar underwent a minor surgery. Now that he is back in action, he will personally interact with cabinet members and legislators on Tuesday,” Malik said. An NCP leader said on the agenda will be cancellation of reservation for Marathas following the Supreme Court verdict and the government decision to scrap 33% reservation for Scheduled Castes and Tribes in promotions. Congress has taken strong objection to the decision, saying it was taken by NCP leaders. BJP Rajya Sabha member Sambhaji Raje recently called on Pawar, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, Prakash Ambedkar and Raj Thackeray to seek their views on the Maratha reservation. Raje has given an ultimatum to the CM to take a decision before June, 6, failing which, he will draft a plan of agitation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sharad-pawar-to-review-performance-of-ncp-netas/articleshow/83073319.cms||---

The police in a statement said, “The bungalow was locked from outside when the team reached there to take action. The police found around 20 men gambling after peeping through the window. The team then broke open the door locks and detained 19 men.” The statement read, “The 19 men flouted Covid-19 norms by not wearing face mask. Police have recovered cash and four motorcycles, collectively valued at Rs1,53,900, and gambling articles from the bungalow.” An FIR relating to gambling and disobedience was registered under the Gambling Act, Indian Penal Code, National Disaster Management Act and Maharashtra Covid-19 rules.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/19-detained-on-charge-of-gambling-flouting-covid-19-norms/articleshow/83073323.cms||---
---||Nagpur||At Rs 100 a litre, petrol hits a ton in Nagpur, hike of Rs 26 in a year||NAGPUR: Petrol prices have finally hit a century in the city. After oil companies issued revised rates for Saturday, petrol was sold at Rs100 a litre and diesel at Rs90.60 a litre in the city. In other districts of Vidarbha, petrol had already crossed the Rs100-mark while diesel was well above Rs90. In neighbouring Chhattisgarh, petrol is still Rs92 per litre. Petrol prices have increased by Rs26 a litre and diesel by Rs24.6 in the city since May 29 last year. On March 31 this year, petrol was at Rs96.81 a litre. It took two months of gradual hikes to bridge the gap of Rs3.19 to touch Rs100 a litre. Diesel was Rs86.49 a litre as on March end, according to data shared by a dealer. Amit Gupta, president of Vidarbha Petroleum Dealers Association (VPDA), said the basic price of petrol is Rs36.03 a litre. “As much as Rs18 is added toward central road and infrastructure fund which is used for construction of highways. The component is included in the central taxes. The state government charges VAT of Rs10.12,” he said. If the two components are removed, petrol could have been much cheaper. The state cess was introduced from time to time to meet the expenses during crises like natural calamities. Even after the crisis ended, the cess was not withdrawn, said sources. Apart from consumers, this time even petrol pump owners are feeling the pinch of rising fuel prices. The lockdown-like restrictions have led to a sharp decline in fuel sales. Petrol pump owners are not in a position to buy a full tanker in one go. It is difficult to recover the money soon due to low off-take of both petrol and diesel. Industries are already complaining of increased overheads due to rising transportation cost. Vasant Salpekar, vice-president of VPDA, said that over the months the cost of getting one tanker of petrol has gone up by over Rs3 lakh. For a diesel tanker, the increase is of more than Rs4 lakh. “The sales have come down by 70% due to the Covid curbs. Under such circumstances it is tough to recover the cost of buying a new tanker even if the payment has to be done in a staggered manner,” he said. Dealers have to order one tanker at least. Companies are being requested to accept smaller orders, he said. The difference between diesel and petrol rates has come down to Rs9.4. The gap between prices of the two fuels has been narrowing since seven years. It has finally impacted demand for diesel vehicles now. Diesel prices are getting closer to petrol prices due to removal of subsidies and increase in taxes over the period of time. According to Anuj Pande, president of Vidarbha Petroleum Dealers Associaiton, there has been a major impact. “In the small car segment as much as 90% of demand is for petrol vehicles these days,” he said. Milind Gadre of Shree Travels, a taxi operating firm, said petrol vehicles are being introduced in taxi business too. “There is no point in preferring diesel vehicles,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/at-rs100-a-litre-petrol-hits-a-ton-in-city-hike-of-rs26-in-a-year/articleshow/83074436.cms||Shishir Arya

Flames engulfed one of the tankers as the Oxygen Express reached Chikurai. However, a major fire accident was averted after railway personnel at the spot stopped the train at 38 number railway gate and informed police. “Fire department officials, who rushed to the spot after being alerted by police, separated the burning tanker from other oxygen tankers and controlled the fire,” an SCR official said. There was panic among the officials while trying to bring the situation under control as there was a live electric wire on top of the tanker that caught fire. The burning tanker was delinked after the fire was brought under control and towed away from the train. Though the exact reason was yet to be known, the officials suspect that flames could have erupted when brakes were applied.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/major-fire-accident-averted-on-o2-express/articleshow/83074433.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

All India Motor Transport Congress, under which trucks, private buses and taxis operate in the state, said that they are currently incurring a loss of Rs 3,000 per vehicle and it is becoming increasingly difficult for them to continue operations. “Due to most businesses being shut, only three out of 10 trucks, which carry essentials, are plying. We are having to pay the rest of our staff without making any profits. This year is turning out to be a challenge like last year. The government should allow us some rebate in taxes and fees (toll tax) so we can cover at least some portion of the losses. If there is no support in the coming days, carrying goods, including necessities, will no longer be possible for us,” Anusuya Prasad Uniyal of All India Motor Transport Congress told TOI. Truck operators also sought to be vaccinated. “The truckers have been ferrying vegetables, fruits, medicines and many more essential items. The administration must get us vaccinated. If we start getting infected, there won’t be anyone left to deliver the goods in these times of crisis,” said Dilip Singh, a truck operator. “Goods and passenger carriers as well as taxi operators associated with us are set to lose everything they have been building for decades. Taxi operators too are facing huge losses as they are forced to operate at 50% capacity, which does not even let them recover the basic investment,” Uniyal added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/truckers-facing-losses-say-they-will-have-to-stop-ferrying-essentials-without-govt-aid/articleshow/83071753.cms||Abhijeet Singh

Dhan Singh Rawat, state higher education minister, has said that students in the final year of their college will give their exams but the other students will be promoted based on their performance in the internal assessment. The decision has been taken in view of the Covid-19 pandemic situation. Last year too, exams were only held for final year college students. All state government degree colleges and universities, colleges affiliated to state universities and state government-aided colleges will have to adhere to the decision. While the dates of exams for final year students have not been announced yet, it is not expected to be held before August. Notably, colleges, universities and other higher education institutes in the country reopened in February this year but were again shut in April due to the second Covid wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/exams-only-for-final-year-college-students-this-year/articleshow/83071757.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Nagpur||Ex-transport panel chief appoints nieces as bus TCs||Nagpur: In an act of nepotism, former Nagpur Municipal Corporation transport committee chairman Narendra Borkar appointed two of his two nieces as ticket checkers in the civic body’s transport department. Documents with TOI show that Apeksha Madhukar Borkar and Mayuri Sudhakar Borkar were appointed during Borkar’s tenure as the transport committee chairman. Though Borkar’s tenure ended in March this year, the NMC extended the duo’s service by six months, said a senior official from the department. Borkar said Apeksha and Mayuri were appointed on merit. “It had nothing to do with I being their uncle,” he said. Aapli bus programme manager Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System (DIMTS) had a special squad of ticket checkers. But, Borkar created special posts to employ his nieces, citing the need of special women checkers for five women-only buses, department sources said. The process to appoint Borkar’s nieces was initiated after he took charge as transport committee chairman in early 2020. The transport department then submitted a proposal to appoint them before the transport committee meeting was held on September 29, 2020 during which time Covid-induced lockdown was in force and the bus service was not operational. The Borkar-headed committee okayed the proposal to appoint Apeksha and Mayuri on a monthly remuneration of Rs 20,000 for six months. The duo joined the transport department as ticket checkers on November 2, 2020. Their six-month term ended on May 2, 2021, but it has now been extended till November 2, 2021 with a monthly raise of Rs 3,000. No NMc official was to speak on the development. Senior corporator Abha Pande, who recently joined the Nationalist Congress Party, said the civic body should not appoint ticket checkers as DIMTS had contractual obligations to do the same. “Borkar could have given preference to party workers or residents,” she said. Said senior Congress corporator Praful Gudadhe, “Appointing relatives is nothing but nepotism and misuse of power.” City BJP president Pravin Datke said he is unaware of the issue and “will look into it”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ex-transport-panel-chief-appoints-nieces-as-bus-tcs/articleshow/83074431.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The bodies found near the second floor stairs indicated the workers had tried to escape to the roof but failed as the terrace door was padlocked. The fire that raged for nearly 48 hours left the factory and an adjoining medicine godown gutted. The bodies were identified by family members as Tanmoy Ghosh (32) of Nadia’s Haringhata, Subrata Ghosh (30) of Ranaghat, Amit Sen (28) of Habra and Swarup Ghosh of Ashokenagar’s Beraberia. All bodies were sent to Kamarhati Sagore Dutta Medical College & Hospital for postmortem. “The bodies were severely burnt. Their families identified them by finger rings, chains, wristwatches and other accessories. They were lying on the second floor staircase near the door that led to the terrace. It appears they had made an attempt to reach the terrace but perished in the fire as the door was locked,” an officer of Barrackpore commissionerate said. “My son was called by factory manager on Monday to resume the work. He spoke to me over phone on Wednesday evening. He didn’t return home that night due to cyclonic storm. But we never imagined that he would have to pay for the night stay with his life,” said Swarup’s father, Samir. Manoj Kr Verma, the police commissioner of Barrackpore, said, “All the four bodies have beensent for postmortem. The factory was run illegally. An FIR was lodged against the factory owner and a raid is on to nab him.” Saugata Roy, Trinamool MP, handed over Rs 2 lakh cheque as compensation to each of the victims’ family at a Barrackpore BDO office on Saturday afternoon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bodies-of-4-workers-found-48-hours-after-factory-fire/articleshow/83073337.cms||Sanjib Chakraborty

Banomal Chandwani (72) and his daughter-in-law Vinita (38) were the only members of their family to survive the crash. They lost four family members and also their home. Banomal, who works in a gaushala as sevak, survived as he had gone to buy a cold drink for his grandson. He lost his wife Mohini (65), son Deepak (42), Deepak’s son Punit (17) and younger son Dinesh (40), who was unmarried. He told TOI, “On Friday night my elder son Deepak, who lived separately with his wife in the same area, and grandson Punit had come home and were playing a ludo game with my younger son Dinesh on the mobile phone. My wife was seated with them in the living room. As my grandson Punit asked me for a cold drink, I went out of the building to get it. Just then the slabs fell, killing four family members.” Another senior citizen, Innuchand Bajaj (60), who works as an autorickshaw driver, survived but lost his wife Amruta (54), son Krishna (24) and daughter Lovely (20). Minutes before the incident, Krishna was playing cricket with his friends and he had come home only to drink water when the slab came down. Krishna was an engineer by profession, while his sister Lovely had completed her graduation. Some others, like Muskan Bhagwani and her three family members, were fortunate. Bhagwani told TOI, “A few hours before the incident, we had gone out to meet our relatives in the area, and my daughter was playing outside the building when the slab portion collapsed.” - Pradeep Gupta||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-two-senior-citizens-lose-their-families/articleshow/83077302.cms||---
---||Patna||Two kids diagnosed with MIS-C in Bihar||PATNA: There seems to be no respite from post-Covid complications yet. An increase in cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) in parts of north India has worried parents here too. Experts have advised parents to remain alert, especially if kids or anyone in the family have recovered from Covid-19. Noted paediatrician and former head of paediatrics department at Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) Dr Nigam Prakash Narain said he has handled at least two such cases this week. “One is a 10-year-old boy from Khagaria and another an 11-month-old baby from Patna,” Dr Nigam said, adding parents should remain on guard for at least six to eight weeks after a child or anyone in close contact of the child recovers from Covid. He said though MIS-C is a serious condition, it is treatable if diagnosed on time. Muzaffarpur-based paediatrician Dr Arun Shah said though just 0.14% of infected children develop MIS-C, alertness is necessary. “In case of noticing persistent fever, rashes, fatigue, red eyes and diarrhoea in kids, parents should seek medical help,” he added. Dr Shah stressed on the need to sensitise parents, doctors and government regarding MIS-C. “It cannot be treated like typhoid or dengue. It has a different line of treatment and hospitalisation is required,” he added. Doctors said intravenous immunoglobulin, which is expensive, is required for treating children affected with MIS-C. Head of paediatrics department at PMCH, Dr Anil Kumar Jaiswal, they have so far not seen any such case. “However, the chances of children developing MIS-C cannot be ruled out. Though rare, MIS-C is a serious condition as it involves several organs like heart, liver, lungs and brain,” he added. The WHO had come up with a brief on MIS-C on May 15 and cited fever for three or more than three days in children as a symptom. Rashes or bilateral non-purulent conjunctivitis or muco-cutaneous inflammation signs (oral, hands or feet), hypotension or shock, features of myocardial dysfunction, pericarditis, valvulitis or coronary, evidence of coagulopathy (by PT, PTT, elevated d-Dimers) and acute gastrointestinal problems like diarrhoea, vomiting or abdominal pain are the other symptoms of MIS-C. At least 100 MIS-C cases have been recorded in Delhi-NCR this week and few cases have also been reported in Jharkhand in the last couple of days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/two-kids-diagnosed-with-mis-c-in-bihar/articleshow/83072344.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Dehradun||Lack of facilities forces Mussoorie woman to deliver in car on way to Dehradun||MUSSOORIE: Lack of maternity care facilities in Mussoorie forced a woman to deliver her baby in a car on Friday night. The woman was unable to get gynaecological support at Mussoorie since the government hospital here has been turned into a Covid hospital. Although the family of the woman kept their distance from the media, a neighbour who rushed the family to Dehradun in his car narrated the incident. He said that the woman started experiencing labour pains on Friday evening. “The Landour Community Hospital (LCH) has already informed the woman and her husband that there was no gynaecologist available there. And the government hospital in the town also could not attend to the woman as it had been turned into a Covid hospital and its labour room was closed. Therefore, we had no option but to rush her to Dehradun,” said Ramesh (name changed), the neighbour. But enroute Dehradun, around 7.30 pm, the woman delivered a baby boy in the car. “A woman from the neighbourhood was accompanying us and she helped in the delivery along with the pregnant woman’s husband. Then we purchased a blade from a shop at Jharipani to cut the umbilical cord,” Ramesh told TOI. The mother and the baby are now home and safe. Commenting on the incident, some locals said that it exposed the poor and myopic planning of the health department. “It is understandable that they converted the civil hospital into a Covid facility but then alternate arrangements should have been made in the town – especially for medical emergencies such as deliveries. There have been four cases in the past few weeks where pregnant women had to be rushed to Dehradun in late hours,” said Rajat Aggarwal, president, Mussoorie Traders Association. Another resident added, “Despite spending crores on the sub-district hospital here, people are neither getting proper Covid care nor rest of the medical services as they have been shut down.” Dr Yatendra Singh, chief medical superintendent of the sub-district hospital (civil hospital), told TOI that a gynaecologist was posted at the facility but she had failed to join duty. “Since we have converted the sub-district hospital into a Covid hospital, therefore, we cannot operate the labour room and the OPD. As an alternate arrangement, a lady doctor was posted at the LCH but she got Covid. Once she recovers, she will rejoin LCH,” said Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/lack-of-maternity-facilities-in-mussoorie-force-a-pregnant-woman-to-deliver-in-car-while-rushing-to-dehradun/articleshow/83071768.cms||Anmol Jain

However, things are fine and we didn't find anything concerning. Only some human interference was spotted.” According to the villagers, the 'cracks' in the glaciers posed the threat of an avalanche or a glacier burst, which could become the cause of a flash flood like the one witnessed in the district on February 7 this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/expert-panel-holds-aerial-inspection-of-glaciers-above-raini-village-find-situation-normal/articleshow/83071769.cms||Kautilya Singh

---||India||Navneet Kalra gets bail in oxygen concentrators hoarding case||NEW DELHI: A Delhi court on Saturday granted bail to businessman Navneet Karla in an alleged case of black marketing of oxygen concentrators, saying he apparently had a clean record and no previous involvement in any criminal case reported by police. Kalra was allowed bail on a personal bond and two surety bonds of Rs 1 lakh each "Apparently, accused has clean antecedents, in as much as no previous involvement of the accused in any criminal case has been reported by the investigating officer," chief metropolitan magistrate Arun Kumar Garg stated in the bail order. For Kalra, senior advocate Vikas Pahwa and advocate Vineet Malhotra had argued that of the 50,000-odd concentrators of the same brand imported in India, their client had merely dealt with about 500 such concentrators and been made a scapegoat to harm his reputation as no action was taken against others. Additional public prosecutor Atul Shrivastava, on the contrary, contended that the very fact that Kalra committed cheating during the current grim Covid-19 situation when people were dying due to non-availability of oxygen concentrators had made the offence graver and it shouldn’t be considered as a simple case of cheating. The order noted that as on date, a bare perusal of the case dairy showed that prima facie there were reasons to believe that Kalra had committed offences under IPC Section 420 (cheating) and under the relevant provisions of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 read with a relevant paragraph under the Drugs (Prices Control) Order, 2013, both of which were punishable with imprisonment up to seven years. However, it came on record that out of the approximately 500 oxygen concentrators being allegedly sold by Kalra, only a few were sold above the MRP. Referring to a Supreme Court judgment, the court said that it was "impressed upon the police officers" not to arrest accused persons without reasonable grounds in all offences punishable with jail up to seven years, indicating that such punishment was not considered to be severe by the apex court to deny bail if no custodial interrogation was required. The court, therefore, stated that the accused’s presence could otherwise be secured by the court at the stage of investigation as well as trial. On the point of police requiring further custodial interrogation of Kalra, it was noted that he was arrested on May 17 and was remanded to three days' police custody and thereafter the plea of the IO seeking five days of police custody had been dismissed, and none of the orders had been challenged by the state. "In fact, it is not even the case of the state that the IO has moved any application for interrogation of the accused in judicial custody at any point in time during his 12-day custody period. Whatever recovery was required to be effected by the IO from the accused has already been effected," it said. The bail order further highlighted that the case was primarily based on documentary evidence and as all relevant documents had already been seized by the IO, there was "no substance" in the argument that he could tamper with the evidence. The order, therefore, reasoned, "Even otherwise the apprehension of the prosecution regarding tampering of evidence by the accused may be allayed by imposing appropriate condition upon the accused at the time of grant of bail. Similarly, there is no material supporting the bald averment of the prosecution that the accused may influence the witnesses being influential." Moreover, it couldn’t be the sole ground for refusal of bail to the accused though the same might have been a ground for cancellation of bail in view of a Supreme Court judgment, the order added. It was held, "No purpose will be served by keeping the accused behind bars in view of the law laid down by the Supreme Court in Sanjay Chandra v CBI that the purpose of bail is neither preventive nor punitive but to secure the appearance of the accused person at his trial by reasonable amount of bail and the right to bail is not to be denied to the accused merely because sentiments of the community are against the accused."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/navneet-kalra-gets-bail-in-oxygen-concentrators-hoarding-case/articleshow/83078120.cms||Aamir Khan

Or, the turnaround time for your air cargo export shipment will now reduce substantially. If all goes as planned, the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International (SVPI) airport in Ahmedabad will operationalise its extended cargo terminal with greater cargo handling capacity by July, confirmed sources. Well-placed sources confirmed that after carrying out domestic air cargo handling operations, Adani Airports plan to start out with interim international air cargo handling terminal. The construction work for extending the existing cargo terminal, which is expected to merge into Terminal 3 of the city airport, is already going on. Flights for Haj pilgrims typically operated through Terminal 3. The newly developed cargo terminal will now extend over 1,500 sq m and is currently under development. This is the second major infrastructure development project being undertaken by Adani Airports, since it took over in November 2020. “The terminal will be equipped with advanced equipment and will also have a sound security-control mechanism to handle cargo. This will supplement efficient cargo-handling processes,” said the source. The city airport handles an estimated 50,000 metric tonne of international cargo every year, according to estimates provided by Ahmedabad Air Cargo Complex. “A variety of cargo including import and export shipments of precious metals, electronics, raw materials and finished goods in pharma, chemical and textile sectors, equipment and medical devices, among others is handled at the city airport. A lot of cargo is often shipped in passenger aircrafts. A bigger terminal with enhanced cargo handling capacity will not just reduce the turnaround time for handling and clearing shipments but also benefit industries procuring and sending goods,” said a source in Ahmedabad Air Cargo Complex. Sources confirmed that SVPI Airport handled 60,749 MT of air cargo volumes in FY 2020-21, which is lesser as compared to the preceding year, when it clocked 103,741 MT in FY 2019-20. “The reduction is mainly due to the pandemic situation. However, Ahmedabad has a significant growth potential for cargo handling in the near and long-term future. This makes infrastructure augmentation inevitable,” said a well-placed source. Sources confirmed that the cargo infrastructure is constantly improving at SVPI airport and the addition of International Cargo Terminal is in line with its strategy to facilitate upcoming growth in air cargo volumes for the betterment of the industry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cargo-terminal-to-expand-at-city-airport/articleshow/83073344.cms||Niyati Parikh

The deceased youth has been identified as Sumit Pardhe of Hatti, in Sillod tehsil of Aurangabad. He took the extreme step on Friday morning. Paradh police station’s inspector Abhijit More told TOI: “The circumstances that triggered the alleged suicide are not yet clear. His family is in shock and they are not in a position to speak.” Police said the youth had completed his masters in science and was a volleyball player. “During the Facebook Live session, this youth can be heard apologising to his parents for embarrassing them publicly. He said that because of him, his parents had to publicly apologise and they even cried out of helplessness,” said More. He can also been heard saying that his decision to go against his parents’ wishes has caused all the problems and embarrassment to the family. Preliminary probe has revealed some incident took place almost three days prior to the youth committing suicide. The youth had left his home to stay at his aunt’s place in Paradh. Sometime on Friday morning, he left his aunt’s home and went to a neighbouring farm, where he hanged himself from a tree. Some of the villagers spotted the body and alerted the police. The youth was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he was declared "brought dead". Paradh police have registered a case of accidental death and have also reached out to the Aurangabad rural police for help in ascertaining the incident that caused this youth to take extreme step.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/24-year-old-ends-life-after-apologising-to-parents-on-fb/articleshow/83070401.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra crosses 25k deaths in May alone, Pune tops||Mumbai: With the addition of 832 deaths on Saturday, Maharashtra’s toll for May crossed the 25,000 mark, which is higher than the toll of most states for the entire pandemic. The state reported 443 deaths on Saturday and added 389 “old” deaths, taking its cumulative toll to 94,030. A closer look at district-wise data shows that in some districts such as Beed, Gadchiroli and Chandrapur, more deaths occurred in May than in the previous 13 months of the pandemic. The tribal-dominated Gadchiroli district, for instance, reported 191 deaths till April 30 and added 225 deaths between May 1 and May 28. Surprisingly, it is Pune and not Mumbai that leads the death charts in May. Data shows although cities such as Pune and Mumbai added the highest deaths in absolute numbers, the growth rate was slower than the smaller districts. For instance, Pune added 2,661 deaths, which was nearly 22% of the total deaths it has reported so far. Nearly one-third deaths of the total deaths reported by Nashik district have occurred in May. Of the total 4,546 deaths reported since the beginning of the pandemic, 1,478 occurred in the first 28 days of May. Solapur, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg, which are reporting large numbers of cases and also have a high positivity rate, have also added a large number of deaths this month. However, doctors said the higher number of deaths in Maharashtra is not an indicator of the virus’s virulence. Dr Avinash Supe, who is a member of the state government’s Covid-19 task force on deaths, said that while 19.6 lakh cases were detected in 2020, the corresponding number is 36.9 lakh this year. “While 49,521 died in 2020 (case fatality rate 2.56%), there were 39,691 deaths between January 1 and May 24, with a case fatality rate of 1.08%,” he said. Dr Shashank Joshi, who is a member of the state government’s task force on Covid-19, said, “The second wave saw an exponential rise in cases (and hence more deaths), but the case fatality rate has been lower in the second wave.” Mumbai, the worst hotspot in both the waves, surprisingly emerged as one of the best managed cities, with the Centre holding up the ‘Mumbai model’ to other states. While there were 11,116 deaths in Mumbai district between March and December 2020, there have been 3,497 deaths between January and May 2021 so far. The case fatality rate fell from 3.79 last year to 0.86 this year so far. “Mumbai saw the maximum number of deaths in April 2020, and the health authorities have since ensured that a proper plan is in place to reduce deaths. There was better adherence to protocols in Mumbai, and there was better logistical development, ensuring patients were transferred faster to healthcare facilities,” said Dr Supe. Meanwhile, the state added 20,295 cases on Saturday, taking the total caseload to 57.13 lakh cases. Mumbai recorded 1,038 cases and 25 deaths, taking the tally to 7.03 lakh and toll to 14,833 so far. BMC officials said the test positivity rate for the second consecutive day was lower than 4%, indicating that the present wave is fast declining.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-crosses-25k-deaths-in-may-alone-pune-tops/articleshow/83075908.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Aurangabad||About 35,000 Maha cops await second vax dose, 15k skip jabs||Aurangabad: The state police force that has been at the forefront of the lockdown management and pandemic duties is still to get fully vaccinated. The policemen were among the frontline workers identified for vaccination under the national drive in January, however, the shortage of vaccine has posed a hurdle. Data from the director general of police office shows that the state has 1,54,046 police personnel in service, including 11,139 officers. Since January, 1.38 lakh policemen have been given the first jab. Of these, 1.02 lakh have got their second dose as well. But as many as 35,000 policemen are waiting for their second dose in the state. Not taking any chance amidst a shortage of Covid vaccines, the state has already decided to divert around three lakh vials of vaccines that were originally meant forthe 18-44 age group. Depending on the availability of vaccines in each district, policemen have been given doses of either of the two vaccine brands. Authorities now hope that with the availability of the doses improving, the personnel can get inoculated on priority. Additional director general of police (admin) Sanjeev Kumar Singhal said, “With the best possible efforts, we have been able to inoculate 1,38,371 policemen with the first dose. Of these, 1,02,891 have got their second dose.” Official data shows that those who have given first dose include 10,185 officers and 1,28,186 constables, while 7,688 officers and 95,203 policemen have got their second doses in the state. However, the police authorities also have to grapple with those who are hesitant about taking the vaccine. As many as 15,675 personnel, including 954 officers of different ranks, have not got vaccinated yet. “Efforts are being made to increase awareness, clear their doubts, answer their queries — so that every single cop gets inoculated,” said Aurangabad commissioner of police Nikhil Gupta. However, Singhal said that most of the personnel who have not taken the vaccine are woman cops who are either pregnant or are lactating.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/about-35000-maha-cops-await-second-vax-dose-15k-skip-jabs/articleshow/83070434.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Huge rush was observed in the marketplaces. Police personnel, traffic cops and officials of the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) have been deployed on the roads to take action against rule violators, but most motorists were not discouraged. Pandit Powar, the head of KMC’s anti-encroachment drive, said, “The rush in the vegetable markets was was relatively low on Saturday but the traffic flow on the streets in the Laxmipuri, Rajarampuri, New Mahadwar Road, Race Course Naka, Uma Talkies chowk, Bagal chowk, Kasba Bawda areas was very high. Vegetable sellers have been asked to sell their produce on the roadsides so that the vegetable markets don’t get over-crowded. The traffic department had to start the traffic signal at the Uma Talkies chowk due to heavy vehicular movement. With banks, industries, grocery shops and other essential establishments open, everyone has some reason to step out of their homes. Strict action will continue to be taken against establishments that stay open and people who are out of their homes after 11 am.” Meanwhile, the meat shops in the city witnessed long queues on Saturday. Sandip Kashid, a customer standing in queue in front of a shop in the Race Course Naka area, said, “I thought there won’t be any rush in the morning so I came at 9am. But the shopkeeper told me that there has been a rush since 8 am. Perhaps this is because it is a weekend.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-city-traffic-lights-activated-due-to-road-rush/articleshow/83070466.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

---||Kolkata||Himsagar cheaper than potato: Yaas, market time curbs lead to distress sale in Kolkata||KOLKATA: Himsagar, the best loved mango variety in Bengal, is being sold off at throwaway prices, because they were plucked ahead of cyclone Yaas and now cannot be sold through the day because of the restrictions. The Calcutta Fruit Merchants Association has written to chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Saturday, drawing her attention to the problem and requesting her to relax the present market timings and allow sale of the huge quantity of mangoes that have come to the city and the suburbs. In most of the city markets, the rate — Rs 20 a kilo — was found to be lower than that of Chandramukhi potato, which was sold at Rs 22 a kg. What happened with milk last year is happening with mangoes now, the association has said in its letter. Thousands of litres of milk had to be thrown away last year since sweet shops were initially not allowed to stay open as they were not in the “essentials” list. However, later sweet shop owners had appealed to the CM and were allowed to stay open. “This year the distress of Himsagar is similar to that of milk last year. Hundreds of tonnes of mangoes are available but cannot be sold because the threehour window, from 7-10 am is not enough. We have appealed to the CM to allow the sale of mangoes to be allowed throughout the day,” said Shahid Khan, joint secretary of the association, a signatory to the letter that was written by its president Md Sohrab. Mango growers had plucked the fruits that were yet ripe to save them from being destroyed by the cyclone. The subsequent flooding of the gardens also caused a lot of rotting. Good quality Himsagar were sold for Rs 100/kg at the beginning of the month and prices fell to Rs 50 last week before the cyclone. It is now selling for Rs 20 a kilo. The smaller ones and the ones that are overripe are being sold off at Rs 10-15 a kilo, much to the glee of the buyers. “People are buying more mangoes than potatoes. In fact, even Chandramukhi potatoes are slightly more expensive than mangoes today,” laughed Avijit Dhar, a resident of Behala who bought five kilos of mangoes on Saturday. “The Belgachhia Market is full of good quality mangoes selling at Rs 20. Naturally people are buying in bulk,” said writer Amar Mitra. “The mangoes were almost ready when they were plucked off. Once that is done, the ripening and rotting sets in very quickly unless they are consumed within three to four days,” said Bilal Khan, a senior committee member of the association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/himsagar-cheaper-than-potato-yaas-mkt-time-curbs-lead-to-distress-sale/articleshow/83073370.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Rajkot||Tattoo helps identify man killed by factory owner||Rajkot: A factory owner in Rajkot was arrested on Saturday for killing his friend, with whom he had an altercation, on Thursday. Two other accused, who had helped in disposing of the victim’s body were also arrested by the crime branch. The victim, whose face was smashed was identified by a tattoo on his right hand. The main accused, Vishal Borisagar allegedly killed Sanjay Solanki, then wrapped up his body in a plastic bag and put it in a carton. Later, riding a two-wheeler he took the body to a dumping yard at the Tirupati Industrial area and dumped it there. Along with Borisagar, police also arrested Vivek Vadariya (20) and Amit Kothiya (30) for helping the accused in disposing of Solanki’s body. The crime branch sleuths found body near Riddhi Siddhi nulla in the industrial area which is under Aji dam police station on Friday night. “We activated our informers’ network and sent them the pictures of the tattoo. Soon, we got the information that the victim could be Sajnay Solanki (38),” V K Gadhvi, police inspector of the crime branch said. “Once the victim was identified we formed separate teams of police to crack the case,” Praveenkumar Meena, deputy commissioner of police zone-1, said. The police came to know that the victim had a verbal altercation with Borisagar a day before. When police rounded up Borisagar he said that Solanki was his friend and that they had an argument but the matter was settled soon. Borisagar is a partner in a factory that manufactures submersible pumps in Tirupati industrial area. “The body was wrapped in the material which was available only in Borisagar’s factory so he was the prime suspect, during interrogation he confessed to the crime,” Gadhvi added. According to police, Solanki and Borisagar had a heated exchange on Wednesday but the matter was resolved afterwards. However, on Thursday evening Solanki again came to Borisagar’s factory and started hurling abuses at him. Borisagar tried to pacify him but Solanki continued with his tirade. Angered by Solanki’s abuses, Borisagar first threatened the former with a knife and then hit him on his head with a pestle. Later, Borisagar repeatedly hit Solanki’s head and face with an iron plate and hammer. Few labourers who were present at the factory when the incident happened ran away after witnessing Borisagar’s angry outburst.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/tattoo-helps-identify-man-killed-by-factory-owner/articleshow/83073362.cms||---

Teachers want that at least the first dose should be administered on them so that they develop some immunity by the time the examinations start. Earlier this week, the government announced that HS and Madhyamik would be conducted in July and August in offline mode and students would take the board exams in their home centres. “Teachers who were given election duty received the vaccine but that was only half of the workforce. According to our estimate, at least 40% to 45% teachers have not received even the first dose of the vaccine. There are other non-teaching staff who play a crucial role in conducting examinations. Even they must be vaccinated,” said Saugata Basu, general secretary of West Bengal Governments School Teachers’ Association. The state government, which was planning to hold the examinations in May and June, had to postpone the boards due to the second wave of Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/teachers-want-vaccine-before-board-exams/articleshow/83073399.cms||---

Vishal Patil, the district Covid-19 coordinator and resident medical officer of Dhule civil hospital, said a private firm has funded the project. “The plant will be commissioned early next week after the formal inauguration. Currently, the test runs are on to ensure there are no technical issues,” he said. At present, the 100-bed Dhule civil hospital gets its medical oxygen supplies from private parties. But once the plant becomes operational, the hospital’s dependency on private parties will reduce to a large extent. The government medical college and hospital in Dhule had set up a liquid medical oxygen generation plant at its premises last year. During the second wave of Covid, Dhule district had faced issues related to the availability of medical oxygen. “The district administration has already planned 11 more PSA medical oxygen generation plants in different talukas of the district. The work for some of these projects are already on,” said Patil. The move to establish these oxygen plants is to ensure the hospitals do not face any oxygen crisis in cases of a third wave. “Our Covid situation in the district is continuing to improve. The district’s positivity rate is around 3.6%, although we are continuing to aggressively conduct around 2,500-3,000 tests per day,” said Patil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/dhule-civil-hospital-gets-o2-plant/articleshow/83070491.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Oil leakage contained from barge hit by cyclone'||Mumbai: A fresh problem arose for cyclone-hit barge Gal Constructor on Saturday after an oil spill was noticed by fishermen, who complained about it to Coast Guard and other authorities after the vessel hit rock bottom as she ran aground near Vadrai coast on May 17.  The barge company has hired services of Smit Salvage, a leading dredging and offshore contractor, for salvage operations after Director-General of Shipping served a notice of arresting the vessel if precautionary measures are not addressed that could lead to marine pollution.The barge ran aground with 137 personnel on board and suffered damage to her hull, where diesel, oil, grease and other oily substances are stored in huge quantities.  Gal Constructor, which got stuck on the rocky ridges at Vadrai coast, Palghar, with 137 crew on board (saved in an operation by Indian Coast Guard, Indian Navy and other agencies), has spilled around 80,000 litres of diesel, lube, grease and other liquids into the water.  An official for AFCONS told TOI, “While it is a prime responsibility of the vessel owner to salvage the grounded vessel (Gal Constructor), Afcons pre-emptively volunteered to arrange and install an oil containment boom around Gal Constructor two days ago to ensure no harm to the environment and marine ecology is not impacted. On account of the pre-emptive action, the oil spill is contained within the floating boom and is being recovered. We understand that salvage operations have commenced as a team from Smit International has boarded the vessel and started making preparations.”  A source from DG Shipping told TOI, “A nautical surveyor has visited the coast to verify the impact of the spill. The oil leaked from the aground barge has been contained within a radius of 10-15 metres using a BOOM (chain of rubber balloons with plastic wires) that blocks the oil from getting water polluted.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-oil-leakage-contained-from-barge-hit-by-cyclone/articleshow/83077347.cms||Sandhya Nair

The students have to produce their letter of admission to educational institutes abroad and other documents for vaccination,” he added.These two hospitals have started vaccination drives a few days back after procuring the vials from the manufacturing firms. The students will have to pay the vaccine charges that the hospitals take from the other beneficiaries.The civic body is not able to vaccinate such students at its centres since the government is prioritising inoculation of those above 45 years. Moreover, the supply of vaccines remains an issue.Deputy director of health, Nashik region, P B Gandal, said that five districts in the region will be getting over 45,000 doses of the vaccine, which include 20,000 doses of Covishield by Sunday morning.

---||Pune||After day’s work, 40 Pune cops go back to class to learn English||PUNE: Senior police inspector Devidas Gheware of Sinhagad Road police station is happy to be back in class after 33 years in service with a childlike enthusiasm. His only regret is that it did not happen early in his career since it would have helped him dodge many a metaphorical bullet caused by the lack of fluency in the Queen’s language. He and 40 of his colleagues attend an online spoken English and communication class, an idea of Zone III DCP Pournima Gaikwad, who realised that her officers needed English communication skills to deal with the increasing cybercrime and also issues of the urban and migratory population in the city. “Court proceedings till the sessions court are in Marathi. But when it comes to the high court and Supreme Court, we need to know English. Some people coming to the police station talk in English. We understand what they say. But our backgrounds in rural areas and our education in Marathi medium make our spoken English shaky. During police training too, English language skills are not honed. We can upskill with these classes,” Gheware said. The officers are in two groups and each batch of 20 gets two hours of class a week. API Shailaja Jankar coordinates the programme where she sends a link at 7.45pm and the classes are between 8pm and 10pm. PI Shankar Khatke with 25 years in service said while learning English is hard, the nature of disciplined forces is such that till a superior officer doesn’t make it mandatory, many don’t take such advice seriously. “Problems arise while drafting official letters, replies and in dealing with police officers from the southern region where Hindi is ineffective. I am glad that I am able to learn English now,” Khatke said. Gaikwad said people take advantage if a police officer does not know English. “Policemen need to talk assertively to solve a problem but when someone starts speaking in English, the officers or constabulary fumble. This fear of the language will be curbed if they start talking it,” she added. “Our police personnel work hard manning chowks, doing nakabandis and patrolling, apart from work at the police stations. Yet, they are enthusiastic about the class. There is a fear of embarrassment for now. I am trying to help so that they can explain matters in simple English. I encourage them to speak to take away the fear. Many send their feedback at the end of the class,” said Ketaki Latkar Mahajan, a US-based Puneite who has designed the programme. “We get letters from the Human Rights Commission, Women’s Commission and other authorities which need to be replied to in English. Sometimes, despite having all the data, due to their lack of English, the drafting takes a hit. In cybercrime, where everything happens in English, the language skills are a must to understand and solve the case,” said DCP Gaikwad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/after-days-work-40-cops-go-back-to-class-to-learn-english/articleshow/83074555.cms||Ardhra Nair

Director-General of Shipping has served notices to all parties to be present before a high-level probe committee. It sank on May 17 after it was moved 200 metres away from Heera oil field instead of getting its anchorage closer to Mumbai, which could have saved the lives of 75 personnel out of the 261 who jumped into the sea and were afloat for over 12 to 16 hours before Indian Navy warships carried out rescue operations. Chief engineer Mustafizur Rahman Shaikh (48) in his complaint said Ballav and the barge company did not follow repeated weather warnings. Ballav’s body was identified by his wife and brother, who reached Mumbai from Patna and are at an ONGC Guest House. The body will be handed over only after the DNA test report is out. A source from DG Shipping said the probe team will submit its report in 15-20 days that will include mishap recreation using stimulator, statements of the survivors and evidence collection in the form of electronic communications that were exchanged by the chief engineer and the deck officer (an IRS officer) appointed on behalf of the ONGC to the barge company regarding weather was not taken seriously. Notices were issued to the barge owner to be present before the probe team. Captain Rakesh Ballav was member of Marine Crew and was employed by the vessel company. Meanwhile, two bodies of tugboat Varaprada crew—Rakesh Kumar (34) and Pankaj Kumar Sharma (45)—were identified by relatives in Gujarat. They will be handed over to them, said police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-family-identifies-sunk-barge-captains-body/articleshow/83077378.cms||Mateen Hafeez

District guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal said the pediatricians from Nashik met him on Friday assuring all cooperation in treating the patients and requested him to ensure the medicines are available. “We have decided to permit the private hospitals, who are willing to treat Covid patients among the children. The hospital managements are aware that they have to maintain two separate covid and non-covid sections so that other patients are not affected. This will also be ensured by the respective authorities,” he said today after the covid review meeting. Bhujbal added that a few private hospitals have started seeking permission for the covid treatment. “The pediatricians have suggested that the medicines, including immunoglobulin, dexamethasone, methylprednisolone and some more are made available. Some of these drugs are costly and will be required only in case of emergency. The administration is also doing its best to ensure the medicine stock will be there in good numbers,” Bhujbal said. There are a total of 64 hospitals in Nashik district with 702 beds – that include ventilators, BiPAP and CPAP beds, oxygen support beds that could be used for the treatment of the children in case of emergency. Nashik city has 44 hospitals, with 157 neonates intensive care units, 84 pediatrics ICU beds and 235 oxygen support beds. There are 29 ventilators, three CPAP and one BiPAP beds in the city. The periphery of Nashik also has 20 beds. Dr Ravindra Sonawane, the president of Nashik unit of Indian Academy of Pediatrics, said, “It is our duty to serve the society. We met the minister with our plan for the forthcoming situation. We have been assured about making availability of medicines.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/private-childrens-hosps-seek-nod-for-covid-treatment/articleshow/83070512.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Kolkata||RWA role shift: From holding cultural events to arranging for Covid care infrastructure in Kolkata||KOLKATA: Back in Covid-free days of October 2019, Krishnendu Ganguly and his team won praises from fellow residents of his housing complex in New Town for organising cultural programmes during Durga Puja. The world completely changed in between and in May 2021, Ganguly took up the responsibility of organising a Covid vaccination camp at the complex, which required him to coordinate with the local administration, health department and 75-odd residents of the housing society. The pandemic has shifted the roles of residents’ welfare associations ever since the novel coronavirus pandemic broke out in March 2020. The members are a group of elected members who are usually responsible for maintaining the common facilities of gated communities and high-rises. They also usually take the lead in organising cultural functions during festivals and resolving disputes among flat owners. While the members are elected and work on voluntary basis, they are bound by housing cooperative society rules. From fixing and maintaining infrastructure and organising cultural competitions almost two years ago, the residents’ welfare associations have now been busy looking for hospital beds for residents, enforcing Covid-safety guidelines set by the governments, arranging vendors to come to the gates for residents and trying to hold vaccination camps. “The pressure has been so immense that it did not even register when exactly my role had shifted from organising poetry recitals during Durga Puja to procuring oxygen concentrators, booking space at safe homes and imposing safety guidelines,” said Ganguly. “We are working like mini governments within the society, where all residents come with their problems and we try to resolve them,” said Mainak Kanrar, joint secretary of the residents’ association at Sukhobrishti, which has over 4,000 apartments. “We have a dedicated team working for Covid care. They are responsible for converting community centres into safe homes to ensuring groceries and medicines are delivered to senior citizens to tracking vacant hospital beds if some resident take ill,” he said. The pandemic has trained the housing society office bearers to factor in diverse opinions, co-ordinate with RWAs of other complexes in the vicinity and work closely with the local administration. “Different residents have different opinions and we have to hear out everybody. The pandemic has also taught us not to give up without exhausting all options because hundreds of people are banking on us for treatment or other facilities. At the end of the day, it is worth it when even one resident is benefited by our effort,” said Samaresh Das, chairman of New Town Forum and News, an umbrella body of RWAs in New Town.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rwa-role-shift-from-holding-cultural-events-to-arranging-for-cov-care-infra/articleshow/83073452.cms||Zeeshan Javed

A committee of senior officers from the civic body, traffic police and State Transport Authority (STA) had been constituted to give their suggestions and advice. Following their recommendations, the matter was discussed and the terms and conditions finalised. An agenda in this regard will come up before the members of the general house for approval during the monthly general house meeting to be held online on Monday. The civic body has placed all required documents in the agenda, so that the members can read them properly and hold discussions on all the aspects. Besides the terms and conditions, the licence fee and other aspects like area and time period have been mentioned in the agenda for the members to go through. Sources said as it is a new initiative, representatives of the traffic police and the STA were especially kept in the committee. “Since it is a completely new thing, we consulted each and every point with the traffic officials and representatives of the STA. Moreover, Chandigarh has its own Advertisement Control Order, which has many clauses and norms. The committee was constituted to study all these points. After discussions and keeping the city’s nature as far as advertisements are concerned in mind, all the terms and conditions and norms had been formulated,” an official said. REVENUE PLAN Generating revenue through advertisements on illuminated/LED mobile vans was the idea of the revenue generation committee of the municipal corporation constituted in in June last year. Sources said while discussing multiple ideas of revenue generation, the committee had suggested this plan and asked officers to work on it. A committee of the officers had then been formed to explore all the angles and study the rules. Finally, the committee finalised the proposal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mc-house-meet-to-decide-on-mobile-van-advts/articleshow/83068598.cms||Deepak Yadav
---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad reports record low cases since Feb 15||Aurangabad: The municipal limits of Aurangabad registered less than 100 fresh Covid-19 cases fourth day in row by Saturday. At 71, the daily count of cases was a record low since February 15 when 72 daily cases surfaced during the second wave. Health officer with the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) Dr. Neeta Padalkar said that the pandemic curve usually follows a bell-shaped path with Aurangabad reaching at its possible low during the second wave. “The positivity rate of Covid-19 has also come down to around 2% and the recovery rate has reached up to 97% now. All these are signs of flattening of the second wave of Covid 19,” she said. Asserting that the third-wave of Covid outbreak cannot be ruled out going by the bell-shaped nature of the pandemics in past, Padalkar said that nobody should become complacent in the near future. “With Covid-related curbs likely to get relaxed to some extent in the days to come, we as a society should not lower the guard,” she said. As per official data, Covid-19 active cases has reached to 968 now, which is a record low in the recent past. Aurangabad on Saturday reported total seven deaths due to Covid, taking total number of casualties to 1,841. Meanwhile, as announced by the AMC, a dedicated call centre for the benefit of Covid patients and others will be pressed into service from Monday. To be launched in association with a Mumbai-based private consultancy, the facility will contact patients in home-isolation and those vulnerable to the infection and undergoing post-Covid recovery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-reports-record-low-cases-since-feb-15/articleshow/83070514.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kochi: 4 years after getting nod, petrochemical park project work yet to kick off||KOCHI: Even after more than four years since mooting petrochemical park and pharmaceutical park in Kochi, government is still unable to start the work on the projects. Though the 490 acres required for the projects have been acquired from Fertilizers and Chemicals Travancore Ltd (FACT) at Ambalamugal near Kochi a year ago, the tenders have not been floated till date. It was in October 2016 that the Kerala Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation (Kinfra), the nodal agency for implementing the petrochemical park project, got nod from the state government for going ahead with the project. Delay in getting Union government’s approval for buying the 490 acres from FACT, a central public sector undertaking, was the initial hurdle in the way of the project. However, the state government purchased the land after clearing all the impediments in 2020. The Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) allotted Rs 977 crore required for the purchase of land. After purchasing the land by spending such a huge amount, nothing concrete happened. “It is a mega project and it would require quite some time for completing the formalities,” an official with Kinfra said. “We will be floating tender for petrochemical park within one-and-a-half months. It will take some time for inviting the tender for the pharmaceutical park,” the official said. Once the petrochemical park becomes a reality, industries which use propylene derivatives such as acrylates, oxo alcohol and acrylic acid as raw materials will be started from there. Industries manufacturing paint, coatings, adhesives, water treatment devices, solvents, etc. also are expected to set foot in the park. Propylene derivatives are the byproducts at the propylene derivative petrochemical project of BPCL Kochi Refinery, which was dedicated to the nation by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in February 2021. As of now, such industries are operating mainly from states like Gujarat and Maharashtra. As per the estimates prepared by the Kinfra in 2018, around Rs 1,900 crore investment is expected once the park is ready. The plan was to commission the petrochemical park within two years of commencing the work. Kinfra is to play the role of facilitator and arrange infrastructure facilities like internal roads, drainage, water treatment plants, internal water supply system, power supply, common sewage treatment plants, common effluent treatment plants, rainwater harvesting and solid waste management. This will help petrochemical industrial units to start their operations from the park. It is estimated that around Rs 200 crore will be required for arranging these facilities. In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and back-to-back cases of zoonotic diseases reported from the state, setting up a pharmaceutical park is the need of the hour. But the pharmaceutical park will start only after the petrochemical park becomes operational, officials said. The plan is to set up a pharmaceutical park where drugs to the tune of Rs 1,000 crore can be produced annually. Kerala constitutes more than 10% of the total drugs market in the country and the annual sales of drugs in the state come to Rs 6,000 crore as per the data available in 2019. Moreover, the state will not have to depend on import or the manufacturers from other states for drugs once the pharmaceutical park is operational.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/4-yrs-after-getting-nod-petrochem-park-project-work-yet-to-kick-off/articleshow/83072000.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

In all, ,1049 people took the doses. The beneficiaries claimed that the reports about lesser number of vaccines being supplied by the central government to Maharashtra prompted them to reach the centre several hours prior to starting of drive. Following the sunrise, queues of people seeking to get vaccinated only got longer with many of them being forced to return without getting a jab. Health authorities maintained that the district civil hospital had received 400 vials of Covid-19 vaccines. “This is my mother’s second dose. She is about 80 years old. As I did not wanted to take any chance, I woke up at 3 am and reached the centre even before 4 am,” said Balbhim Mali. The person next to him said that last time he stood in the queue for six hours before he was informed that the vaccination centre is done with all the received vials for the day. Bhausaheb Pawar, who, too, was standing in the queue for his kin, said that due to shortage of vaccines, large number of people are being forced to return without getting jabs. “This is adding to the worries and distress. I could not sleep entire night as I feared of getting late to reach the vaccination centre for standing queue,” he said So far, Osmanabad district has given over 2.60 lakh doses, of which, 2.16 lakh are ones who took the first dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/osmanabad-citizens-reach-vax-centers-in-wee-hours/articleshow/83070521.cms||Mohammed Akhef

During the peak of the first wave, the caseload was 16,000 and there was an improvement in the situation soon after. Following a discussion with collector Suraj Mandhare, Nashik Municipal Corporation commissioner Kailas Jadhav, commissioner of police Deepak Pandey, zilla parishad chief executive officer Leena Bansod and district superintendent of Nashik Rural Sachin Patil, he told reporters: “The positivity rate of Nashik district is now below 10%.” “This is a very good sign. The weekly positivity rate falling below 10% has ensured that the district gets out of the red zone. However, this does not mean that the people should lower their guard,” Bhujbal said. He said, “The district administration and the health officials have to be ready to face the third wave. There are multiple challenges — like the possibility of more children getting infected. At the same time, there might be adults facing issues like mucormycosis. The administration should ensure that all Covid care centres are maintained properly and started immediately if and when the next wave sets in.”Collector Mandhare also said the number of active cases was falling rapidly in the district. “On May 28, the number of active cases fell by 1,985, which was the highest since the second wave peak. There were 13,972 active cases on Thursday and the number dropped to 11,987 by Friday. The rate of positivity on Saturday was just 6%,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/2nd-wave-peak-had-3-times-more-cases-than-1st-wave-peak-in-nashik/articleshow/83070517.cms||Abhilash Botekar

United under the regional unit of Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD), these MBBS graduates who are pursuing postgraduate studies have also sought large-scale recruitment of faculties to streamline the academic activities. Dr. Pranav Jadhav, president of MARD in central Maharashtra , on Saturday said that both resident doctors and their faculties were neck-deep in Covid-related duties which he said has put academics on the back-seat. “The resident doctors have been playing pivotal role in the fight against outbreak of Covid-19 for last 14 months. Such a service, however, has put our career at stake. The resident doctors are not getting academic orientation towards their parent department,” said Jadhav, who is associated with GMCH, Nanded.

---||Mumbai||IIT Hyderabad develops oral amphotericin B to treat black fungus||Mumbai: The Indian Institute of Technology-Hyderabad has developed nanofibre-based, controlled-release oral tablets of amphotericin B (AmB) to treat post-Covid fungal infections. Researchers have kept the technology free of intellectual property rights and are looking for pharmaceutical partners who can take up mass-scale production. Currently AmB is an injectible drug. In 2019, faculty members Saptarshi Majumdar and Chandra Shekhar Sharma from the department of chemical engineering had released a study about oral nanofibrous AmB to be effective for kala azar, a parasitic ailment that can cause fever, weight loss and swelling of the liver or the spleen. This is a first-ever attempt to fabricate nanofibrous oral tablets of amphotericin B for the potential cure of leishmaniasis or kala azar. With two years of advancement of examination, the researchers say they are confident the technology can be transferred to suitable pharma partners for large-scale production. At present, kala azar treatment is being used to treat black and other fungi in the country and its availability and affordability make it necessary to allow emergency and immediate trial of this oral drug. “Due to its amphiphilic nature, the AmB has poor aqueous solubility and forms aggregates in the system, which stresses renal filtration and thus causes nephrotoxicity. This is the reason the oral administration has abstained, despite being the most comfortable and effective route,” said professor Majumdar. Stressing on the need for pharma companies to come forward, Sharma said, “The main idea behind our research is to find a solution to serve society. The technology developed is made free from IP, so that it can be mass-produced and is affordable and available to the public at large. We can be reached via our public & corporate relations.” In the present research funded by DST-Nanomission, a team led by Majumdar and Sharma along with their PhD scholars Mrunalini Gaydhane and Anindita Laha intended to deliver AmB orally at an extremely slow rate, albeit within the therapeutic window. The purpose was to increase the drug absorption and reduce aggregation, to lower the drug toxicity. For this, the team selected gelatin, an FDA-approved polymer as an excipient for drug molecules. Further, as the gastrointestinal tract contains different enzymes which hydrolyse the polymers, the team checked and confirmed the enzymatic stability of the tablet in pepsin. The main concern with high drug loading was if it imposes nephrotoxicity. To ensure this, the team has carried out a cell viability assay (MTT assay) against human kidney fibroblast cells which showed no evidence of cell toxicity caused by AmB as well as a minute amount of Glutaraldehyde crosslinker. Box: Details of oral drug to treat black fungus* A 60 mg AmB tablet will be priced at around Rs 200 * Enhanced AmB absorption * Drug diffusion barrier * Slow & sustained release * Reduced nephrotoxicity||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/iit-hyderabad-develops-oral-amphotericin-b-to-treat-black-fungus/articleshow/83072009.cms||---

In their plea, Altamount Road residents Viral and Bijal Thakker said their daughter was entitled to vaccine in the US and urged the court to appoint her maternal aunt Purvee Parekh (a co-petitioner) as her legal guardian so she can travel with her niece. The girl is a Class 11 student of an IB school and her academic term begins on July 1. The petition pointed out that while the Indian government has approved vaccination for only those above 18 years of age, the US administration allows inoculation of all those aged 12 and above. The Thakkers further said that in the US, a stay of 21 days was must for administration of the two doses and June affords their daughter adequate time to complete her vaccination. In their petition, the Thakkers further said that due to the Covid situation in India, the US had on April 30 restricted travel of Indians with the exception of American citizens. A minor US citizen can be accompanied by a non-citizen parent or legal guardian. The daughter also holds an Overseas Citizen of India card and has a permanent visa issued to her by India. The couple said they would not be able to travel with their daughter as they lived with their parents who had recently recovered from Covid-19 and required frequent medical consultations. Besides, their son is in India on summer break. They themselves had been advised not to travel for a while, the Thakkers said, adding that Parekh had volunteered to accompany her niece. The petition said only one airline flies directly to the US from Mumbai and it has requirements for unaccompanied minors. Though a minor above 14 can travel alone, the airline and the parents feel the minor daughter should not travel alone, the petition said. The parents sought legal guardianship for their daughter as there is no legal remedy available under the Guardians and Wards Act. They also urged for “other relief as the case may require”. The petition submitted that personal liberty under Article 21 (Right to Life) includes the right to healthy environment, to protect health, to access treatment, etc , and in the current pandemic “it is imperative that any measure which furthers the right ought to be allowed”. “Unless the orders as prayed for are granted, the petitioners will be deprived of their right under Article 21 to provide proper care for their minor child,” the petition, which will be heard this week, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/sobo-couple-wants-to-send-16-yr-daughter-to-us-for-vax/articleshow/83075980.cms||Rosy Sequeira

In all, 55 PSAs are being planned across the district using government as well as Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds. These funds will collectively provide 64 tonne oxygen to all government establishments in the district. “The first Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) oxygen plant that draws oxygen from air and fills it in the storage tanks was commissioned at the civil hospital today. The plant with capacity of providing oxygen to fill 225 jumbo cylinders will thus ensure a good back up for the civil hospital which has a 20 kilolitre capacity oxygen tank,” said district guardian minister of Nashik Chhagan Bhujbal while inaugurating the plant. Apparently, due to huge shortage of oxygen during the second wave of pandemic, the district administration has planned setting up of 55 oxygen plants, the work for which is already under way. Six such plants are already installed while the work on others, including the ones in Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) hospitals is under construction. Bhujbal further pointed out that every sub-district hospital will also get PSA plant with capacity of filling up of 120 jumbo cylinders and the rural hospital will have the capacity of filling up of 70 jumbo cylinders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/state-funded-psa-o2-plant-at-civil-hosp/articleshow/83070541.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Slum-dweller in bus mishap seeks Rs 13L payout, gets Rs 23L||Mumbai: A 36-year-old woman, a slum dweller selling garlic, has been awarded a compensation of around Rs 23 lakh, including interest, after she suffered a fractured arm in an accident on a state transport bus in 2015. While Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) tried to blame the woman, Alka Tupare, for the mishap, claiming that she had stuck her elbow out of the window, leading to the injury when a tempo rammed into the bus, the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal held that there was no evidence to show that the driver had warned her to avoid the elbow from jutting out. The tribunal said that the version that she was warned did not find mention in the police report. “Opposite party (MSRTC) first time mentioned this fact in its written statement [before the tribunal] which is filed after around 3 years of the accident. So, it is clear that defence of contributory negligence came after taking legal advice. So, it is unsafe to rely on,” the tribunal said. The woman had told the tribunal that since she was unable to use her right arm fully, she could no longer sell garlic and had lost her monthly income of around Rs 7,500. She said that her family was solely dependent on the earnings of her husband, an autorickshaw driver. While the woman had claimed Rs 13 lakh, the tribunal said that it had ample power to grant more compensation. Among the compensation components, the tribunal awarded the woman Rs 13.50 lakh towards loss of future income due to her disability. The court accounted for the losses she would suffer for the next 15 years. The woman from Ulhasnagar, now 42 years old, had moved the tribunal in September 2016. She submitted that on May 14, 2015, she was travelling by the bus. The woman said that when the bus nearing Malshej Ghat, suddenly a tempo came from the opposite direction at high speed and rammed into the bus. Due to the impact, she sustained injuries and was taken to a hospital. An FIR was lodged by the bus driver against the tempo driver. The woman said she suffered several fractures. MSRTC submitted that the tempo was being driven at high speed. It said that the bus driver had tried to avoid the accident, but added that the accident took place due to the high speed at which the tempo was moving. The tribunal, however, found that both vehicles were responsible for the accident. “So in case of involvement of two vehicles, it is choice of injured against which vehicle s/he/ wants to file the compensation petition,” the tribunal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-slum-dweller-in-bus-mishap-seeks-rs-13l-payout-gets-rs-23l/articleshow/83077489.cms||Rebecca Samervel

Sources in the LG’s office rubbished this claim and maintained that reopening of markets was neither proposed nor included in the meeting’s agenda. Delhi Disaster Management Authority approved a gradual lifting of the lockdown from Monday after Covid-19 appeared to be under control. Factory work and construction activities will resume from Monday but no other non-essential activities like opening of markets have been allowed. Blaming the AAP government for markets not being allowed to open, Delhi BJP accused Delhi government of ignoring the plight of the traders, among the worst hit by the cessation of economic activities. Meanwhile, after kickstarting a government-run drive-through vaccination centre in north Delhi on Saturday, CM Arvind Kejriwal said, “Yesterday we announced that construction and factories could restart work because the poor section, such as migrant labourers, have faced the most difficulties during the lockdown. Today, only 950 new Covid cases have been reported. As and when the cases keep on decreasing, we will continue to unlock further. We want commercial activities back on track to revive the state economy.” The CM said he understood the difficulties of the traders. “It was with great difficulty that we were able to control the Covid situation. I can understand their difficulties due to the lockdown, but they should be patient. We also want markets and shops to open,” Kejriwal said. Goyal, AAP’s trade wing head, meanwhile, asked BJP not to spread lies in social media about the state government not allowing markets to reopen when in fact it was the LG who was unconvinced with the idea of resuming market operations. Goyal insisted, “The AAP government did propose in Friday’s meeting that along with industries and constructions, markets should also be allowed to reopen. However, the LG was not ready about letting the markets open from June 1 and hence he didn’t allow markets to reopen.” He alleged BJP was indulging in dirty politics and smearing the AAP government on the matter. A source in the LG office responded: “AAP’s statement is baseless, false and misleading. The matter of markets was not even included on the DDMA meeting’s agenda.” The proposal taken up for deliberation in the meeting included opening of manufacturing, production units in approved industrial areas within closed premises and boundaries and construction activities where workers were employed within boundaries. Goyal added, “If the BJP leaders are indeed concerned about the reopening of markets, they must request the LG to allow commercial hubs to reopen from June 1. The LG must call a DDMA meeting and approve the reopening of markets.” He added that in case a DDMA meeting was held, the AAP government would try its best to seek whatever permission was needed for shopkeepers to open up their stores again. Goyal said even though construction activities were being permitted to resume, hardware and cement shops hadn’t been allowed to reopen. “They must be allowed to open. Otherwise how will construction activities restart?" he asked. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor accused AAP of misleading traders. “The decision to not allow markets to reopen from Monday has been taken with the consent of the LG and CM and the same was formally announced by the CM after the DDMA meeting. The traders are disappointed with the AAP government, and so the party is now blaming the LG to placate the traders,” maintained Kapoor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-claims-lg-rejected-govt-advice-on-market-reopening/articleshow/83073541.cms||AlokKNMishra

---||Aurangabad||Pratincole breeding grounds at peril, ESZ remains on paper at Jayakwadi||Aurangabad: The Oriental Pratincole, a summer migratory bird for the region, has found breeding at Jayakwadi bird sanctuary for the first time in the last many years. The illegal wetland farming, fishing and grazing that have been rampant at the sanctuary located around 50 km from Aurangabad, however, have posed a grave threat to the grasslands that serve as breeding spots for these birds. Ironically, these activities have been taking place within the Eco Sensitive Zone (ESZ) of the sanctuary with the forest department accused of gross inaction towards the brazen non-violations. A recent spot visit to Jayakwadi bird sanctuary by TOI had revealed many Oriental Pratincoles, known as ‘Maldivi Bhingari’ in local language, on the outskirts of Lamgavhan, Mawajgavhan and Borgaon, among other hamlets situated in the periphery of Jayakwadi bird sanctuary. Many of these birds falling in the wader category are believed to have stayed back this year for breeding. Honorary wildlife warden for Aurangabad Kishor Pathak on Saturday said that the forest department is taking a soft-stand towards the elements engaged in illegal wetland farming, fishing and grazing within the ESZ. “The Oriental Pratincole prefers newly-formed grasslands for roosting and breeding. The ESZ of Jayakwadi bird sanctuary produces such habitat as the water from the dam starts receding. However, no sooner did the dam witnesses discharge, illegal activities such as wetland farming, fishing and grazing become rampant posing threat to many birds,” he said. When contacted, divisional forest officer (wildlife) Vijay Satpute said that efforts are being taken to sensitize locals about protecting the flora and fauna housing in Jayakwadi bird sanctuary. “Also, there is no zonal master plan charted out yet to notify different dos and don’ts within ESZ of Jayakwadi bird sanctuary, posing limitations on crackdown against alleged illegal activities,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/pratincole-breeding-grounds-at-peril-esz-remains-on-paper-at-jayakwadi/articleshow/83070559.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Private hospitals outdo BMC in vaccinations on Friday, Saturday||MUMBAI: More Mumbaikars got their Covid-19 shots through private hospitals than with the BMC’s free vaccine service in the last two days. Since the mass vaccination programme began on January 16, the free vaccines provided at BMC- and state-run hospitals dominated the drive. But for the first time on Friday, the balance tipped, with 60% of 41,181 vaccinations taking place in the private sector with recipients paying over Rs 1,000 for Covishield (Covaxin is in short supply, said doctors). “It is the first time the private sector overtook us, but as soon as our vaccine procurement gets through, the BMC drive will pick up momentum again,” said BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare. While BMC is vaccinating only those who are 45 and above, the private sector is giving shots across age-groups (18 and above). On Saturday, the daily vaccination numbers surged beyond 50,000 to 55,843 shots, with 38,924 (almost 70%) provided by private hospitals. The public vaccine centres managed16,919 shots. AMC Suresh Kakani said private vaccination is picking up among people willing to pay. “Private hospitals have been allowed to tie up with industrial houses and cooperative housing societies,” he said. The union government, in a deviation from its usual vaccine procurement policy, allowed states to buy vaccines directly from manufacturers. Makers can now sell half their stocks to states and private sector healthcare outfits, leading to price variation from one centre to another. “But for those in Mumbai’s high-rises, vaccine cost in the private sector wouldn’t be a deterrent,” said Kakani, adding the civic body could now focus on the vulnerable and economically weaker sections. Over a dozen private hospitals in the city have bought vaccine doses directly from Serum Institute and started vaccinating corporate employees and residents in societies. “We managed to vaccinate 7,500 people in three housing societies and two corporates on Saturday,” said Dr Prince Surana of Surana group of hospitals. On Friday, he gave 5,500 shots and plans to vaccinate three lakh in June. The focus, according to task force member Dr Shashank Joshi, should be vaccinating the maximum number of people in the next three months. “This period is like a make-or-break period for Mumbai,” he added. Meanwhile, for the first time, 31,322 people in the 18-44 age group took the vaccine in Mumbai on Saturday, all in the private sector as BMC has temporarily stopped vaccinating this age-group. On Friday, the state vaccinated 2.69 lakh people, taking the total number of shots (both first and second) given to 2.19 crore so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-pvt-hosps-outdo-bmc-in-vaccinations-on-fri-sat/articleshow/83077570.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Kochi||Kerala: Only 10% of gas project target met||KOCHI: The city gas project, launched in February 2016 with an October 2020 deadline, hasn’t so far registered a progress of even 10%. Indian Oil Adani Gas Private Ltd (IOAGPL), the firm which is to implement the project, continues with the slow pace of the work as the state government which provided all the support for getting various approvals remains mute spectator. Meanwhile, citing various reasons like the 2018 floods and Covid-19, IOAGPL has managed to secure extension for the project by a year. The project’s target was to give piped natural gas (PNG) connections to 40,000 households in Ernakulam district by 2020. But the firm could provide only around 3,500 connections so far, which is less than 10% of the target. In June 2020, Ernakulam district collector S Suhas had convened a meeting with IOAGPL and sought the firm’s clarification on why the project is being delayed inordinately. With IOAGPL officials giving some excuses, collector asked them to prepare a fresh schedule and expedite the project. It was the difficulties in getting the nod from the local bodies for digging up roads for laying pipelines for the project that the IOAGPL authorities cited for the delay. They had approached the state government for reducing the road restoration charges fixed by the local bodies. After holding a meeting with the IOAGPL and representatives of local bodies, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had instructed the local bodies and the state government to reduce the rates. Still, the IOAGPL couldn’t make any significant progress in finishing the work. After the local body polls in November, Kochi mayor M Anilkumar had convened a meeting with IOAGPL officials for starting the work on the project. It was decided to start the work in the divisions near the national highway bypass along the Edappally-Vyttila stretch. “Though instructions were given to the IOAGPL to deposit various fees required for starting the work, they haven’t made any payment so far. They had agreed to pay the fee and start the work immediately,” a Kochi Corporation official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/only-10-of-gas-project-target-met/articleshow/83072060.cms||M K Sunil Kumar
---||Pune||One needs heart and vision to make something colourful: Muzaffar Ali||Pune: During an online interaction organised by the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) on Saturday to mark the 40 years of the release of film Umrao Jaan, one of the moderators questioned director Muzaffar Ali how he managed to make the film colourful and appealing with a limited budget? “You don’t need money, but heart and vision to make something colourful,” Ali said. The interaction on Saturday, as part of an ongoing series by the FTII, was marked by the cast and crew reminiscing fond memories of the 1981 film. Present at the interaction were actors Naseeruddin Shah and Satish Shah, writers Shama Zaidi and Javed Siddiqui, as well as ghazal exponent Talat Aziz, who sang one of the songs in the musical starring Rekha. The members of the film recalled the process of adapting a late-19th century Urdu chronicle into a screenplay for the film, the layers of acting by lead actor Rekha, the versatility of Shaukat Kaifi as well as the preparation for the roles by the two Shah’s. The interaction was also full of humour and ribbing, interspersed with footage and songs from the film. Aziz even sang a song from the film during the online session. Speaking about the adaptation of the screenplay, Siddique said that viewing tawaifs (courtesans) as important members of the society was important while writing the screenplay for the film. “The original story does not end like the way the film does. Shama and I had to work a lot to turn the story into a screenplay. We worked together on Shatranj Ke Khiladi, which also portrayed how the middle-class people in Lucknow were doing given all the changes that the society was facing,” he said. Naseeruddin also spoke candidly about how he took on the role of Gohar Mirza, Umrao’s slightly effeminate admirer and lover, with “heavy misgivings”. He said he had initially wanted to play the role of the bandit, ultimately essayed by Raj Babbar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/one-needs-heart-and-vision-to-make-something-colourful-muzaffar-ali/articleshow/83073619.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Delhi||Delhi: Lockdown till June 7, rules for unlocking out||NEW DELHI: Delhi Disaster Management Authority on Saturday issued an order permitting operations of manufacturing/production units within closed premises in approved industrial areas and construction activities within their work sites from Monday (May 31) 5am onwards. The lockdown has, however, been extended till June 7 (5am). All existing restrictions, including the suspension of Delhi Metro services and bar on weddings in public places and all wholesale and retail markets, will stay till 5am on June 7.

Initially, the plan is to include OCs and additional OCs and will be limited to weekends. Traffic guards have been following this system for some time, but work pressure at police stations have been forcing OCs to attend office almost every day. The system, if rolled out, will be on the condition that there is no major law-andorder duty on the weekend. The proposal was discussed at a virtual meeting, called by Mitra, on ways to combat Covid in the force. Mitra also proposed to keep the Malkhana clean and ensure the police stations were sanitized. He also announced cops and their families be treated at the Police Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/wfh-proposal-for-cops/articleshow/83073605.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Patna||Number of black fungus cases rises to 300||Patna: It is a double whammy for some Covid and post-Covid patients as the pandemic has not only affected their health, but also made them permanently disabled with mucormycosis, a rare black fungal infection. So far, more than 300 cases of mucormycosis, commonly known as black fungus, have been recorded in the state.To stop the spread of mucormycosis, doctors in some cases are forced to take tough decisions like removing eyeballs, nasal septum that separates the left and right airways of the nasal cavity, mandible bone (lower jaw, which is the largest and strongest bone in the human facial skeleton), maxilla that forms the upper jaw and part of the brain to save people’s lives. This is fallout of ignoring early symptoms of mucormycosis.Dr Bibhuti Prashun Sinha, head of regional ophthalmic centre at IGIMS, said exenteration (complete removal of eye leaving a hollow) has to be done in three patients. “The primary surgery in mucor is debridement, which is to remove all the dead tissues from maxillary, sinus, floor of orbit to restore the blood circulation. More than 35 surgeries took place at IGIMS to treat mucor patients,” he said.The number of mucormycosis cases at IGIMS has reached 84, including 23 Covid patients.A 61-year-old man, who defeated Covid recently, has contracted mucormycosis. “In the early stage, we did not realise. When he visited an eye specialist, it became clear that he was suffering from mucormycosis. The doctors removed the dead tissues. If his situation does not remove, doctors might remove one of his eyes,” said a family member of the patient.Altogether 11 patients are fighting mucormycosis at Ruban Memorial Hospital. Two patients have died due to late reporting at the hospital. Dr Satyajit Kumar Singh, hospital’s managing director, said eye extraction has happened in two cases.The number of black fungus cases at AIIMS-Patna has increased to 89. Dr Sanjeev Kumar, nodal officer for Covid-19 at AIIMS-Patna, said some mucormycosis patients came after the infection spread from their sinus to the eye orbit, affecting their vision.Additional professor and head of ENT department at AIIMS-Patna, Dr Kranti Bhawna, said the doctors removed the dead tissues from 3-4 patients where eye involvement was found. At PMCH, out of 11 mucormycosis patients, one needed eye surgery. Head of ENT department at PMCH, Dr Vinit Sinha, said as the hospital did not have surgical instrument, the patients are being referred to AIIMS-P and IGIMS.PATCHNitish’s direction onblack fungus treatmentChief Minister Nitish Kumar on Saturday asked the health department to make necessary arrangements for the treatment of black fungus cases in all medical colleges and hospitals in the state.

---||Vadodara||‘Map flood plain zones, remove encroachments’||Vadodara: Entire flood plain zone of Vishwamitri river that passes from the heart of Vadodara should be mapped and demarcated. Unauthorized, illegal structures should be removed, and river’s integrity should be maintained and restored. This is what the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has ordered the authorities in connection to the Vishwamitri River Action Plan (VRAP). NGT’s principal bench headed by chairperson justice (retired) Adarsh Kumar Goel has noted that Vishwamitri river is one of 351 polluted river stretches identified by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). “Demarcation of the entire flood plain zone of the river needs to be undertaken. Further, steps are required for plantation and maintaining the integrity of the river in totality,” NGT’s order states. NGT has issued the order based on a plea moved by a group of concerned citizens led by environment activist Rohit Prajapati. “While directing consideration of all the issues by the applicants, we reiterate the direction for implementation of the Vishwamitri River Action Plan including the steps for removal of unauthorised structures, demarcation and protection of flood plain zone and other action points as per the river restoration plan,” the bench said, ordering that the action should be completed by the authorities concerned within three months. Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) has, however, informed the NGT that the project has not yet been finalised and it was only at a conceptual stage. Advocate Maulik Nanavati, who appeared for the VMC and Gujarat government said that issues like illegal constructions affecting the riverine ecology of the river are independent of the project. Nanavati also stated that all the grievances will be duly addressed and if any particular grievance remains, the applicant can take remedies independently, in accordance with law. The group of citizens had moved the environmental watchdog stating that the project violated the Environmental Impact Assessment Notification, 2006, requiring prior environmental clearance, after assessment of the impact of the project on environment. “We (concerned citizens and experts) as a team are willing to work collaboratively with the concerned authorities toward the implementation, in letter and spirit, of the NGT order,” said Prajapati.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/map-flood-plain-zones-remove-encroachments/articleshow/83070895.cms||---
---||Agra||Woman suffering from black fungus tests Covid +ve within 30 days of recovery, dies||AGRA: A woman patient tested positive for Covid-19 infection for the second time within 30 days of recovery. A private hospital referred her to the SN Medical College here as she had developed symptoms of black fungus. There, it was confirmed that she was suffering from black fungus. She was re-tested for Covid and was found to be positive. The patient died during treatment. Now, the health department is conducting a detailed investigation of the case. So far, three patients have succumbed to black fungus in Agra district. The 65-year-old resident of Shahganj locality was admitted at a private hospital when she had trouble breathing. She tested Covid-19 positive there on April 19. The patient recovered from the infection and tested Covid-19 negative on May 12. However, she was not discharged as she continued to complain of difficulty in breathing. According to her family members, she soon started complaining of blurred vision and a deformity began developing on her face. She was referred by the private hospital to SNMC on May 18. Here, she was diagnosed with black fungus. Following an RT-PCR test, she again tested Covid-19 positive on May 20 and was shifted to the Covid ward at the hospital. She died while undergoing treatment on May 25. Dr Sanjay Kala, SNMC principal, said, “Biological mutation has resulted in spread of different strains of Covid-19. A person after being tested Covid-19 positive can get infected with another strain of virus. Getting infected with different strains of the coronavirus can significantly damage the immunity system. In the case of the re-infection as in the case of the woman patient, the same thing happened. Her immunity was negligible. She was diagnosed with black fungus and had several other infections.” He added, “We are investigating the case. A detailed report will be sent to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). To prevent infection in patients, we are keeping them in the post-Covid ward after being tested negative. Patients are being discharged only after they get normal.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/woman-suffering-from-black-fungus-tests-covid-ve-within-30-days-of-recovery-dies/articleshow/83070583.cms||Deepak Lavania

North Delhi Municipal Corporation, which runs four big municipal hospitals, will get five oxygen generation plants and 130 ventilators under corporate social responsibility and PM-Cares funds. North corporation mayor Jai Prakash said that the new upgrades will help in tackling future waves of the pandemic. In terms of ventilators, the capacity of civic hospitals is being increased 14 times the pre-pandemic levels.

The mayor said that these life-saving devices will be divided among Hindu Rao hospital, Rajan Babu Tuberculosis hospital, Girdhari Lal hospital and Balak Ram hospital. Along with Kasturba Hospital, all five of these medical institutions will get oxygen generation plants. “The process for installation of these plants has been started and site inspections have already been carried out. Each unit will be able to provide 24*7 oxygen supply to sustain 200 beds. When situation normalises, these plants will be linked to smaller facilities so that primary healthcare infrastructure also gets boost,” Prakash said. The civic body has also initiated the process for opening of first Covid facility for to children at Girdharilal hospital. “A 100-bed facility will be set up exclusively for children. 10 specialised ventilators for use by infants and children are being procured,” he added.

Over 4,000 patients have been approached and explained how to identify symptoms of the black fungus early so that they can get timely treatment. The SMC has adopted model of Sanjivani Rath for MM awareness where patients are provided information at their doorstep. The teams visit homes of the patient who have tested positive for coronavirus and those who have recovered. “Covid-19 patients are explained about how MM occurs. They are also told how to identify early signs of the black fungus disease and what they should do if they notice any symptoms,” said Banchhanidhi Pani, city municipal commissioner. “We have also adopted the war-room concept for handling MM cases now. Since there is a drop in Covid-19 cases we are using the infrastructure for detecting and monitoring MM cases,” he added. The health department is also creating awareness on the use of steroids for Covid treatment. The teams are also distributing pamphlets with details about MMM symptoms and treatment guidelines to patients. “As soon as a person in detected with Covid-19 our team approaches them on the first or second day.

When the reception started at Chandrapur village on Friday evening and no sooner did guests arrive, cops also arrived. The family was given permission only to organise the wedding with a limited number of people and there was no permission to hold the reception. A case was registered against the tenthouse owner also under the Disaster Management Act. In Vikarabad district, police on Friday stopped a bus carrying a marriage party and to their shock, found 55 people in it. The TSRTC bus belonging to Parigi depot was taken to Tandur police station. A case was booked against the bride’s father who had hired the bus for the wedding at Bomraspet mandal. Police officials said that weddings, receptions and birthday events are superspreaders of Covid-19 as guests tend to drop guard and do not follow social distancing or wear masks. Also, more people end up attending the functions than the permitted numbers. As many as 86 people who attended a wedding at Siddapur in Nizamabad district last month tested positive for the novel coronavirus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/newly-wed-pair-booked-for-lockdown-violation/articleshow/83074298.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

For instance, Pune added 2,661 deaths, which was nearly 22% of the total deaths it has reported so far. Nearly one-third deaths of the total deaths reported by Nashik district have occurred in May. Of the total 4,546 deaths reported since the beginning of the pandemic, 1,478 occurred in the first 28 days of May. Solapur, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg, which are reporting large numbers of cases and also have a high positivity rate, have also added a large number of deaths this month. However, doctors said the higher number of deaths in Maharashtra is not an indicator of the virus’s virulence. Dr Avinash Supe, who is a member of the state government’s Covid-19 task force on deaths, said that while 19.6 lakh cases were detected in 2020, the corresponding number is 36.9 lakh this year. “While 49,521 died in 2020 (case fatality rate 2.56%), there were 39,691 deaths between January 1 and May 24, with a case fatality rate of 1.08%,” he said. Dr Shashank Joshi, who is a member of the state government’s task force on Covid-19, said, “The second wave saw an exponential rise in cases (and hence more deaths), but the case fatality rate has been lower in the second wave.” Mumbai, the worst hotspot in both the waves, surprisingly emerged as one of the best managed cities, with the Centre holding up the ‘Mumbai model’ to other states. While there were 11,116 deaths in Mumbai district between March and December 2020, there have been 3,497 deaths between January and May 2021 so far. The case fatality rate fell from 3.79 last year to 0.86 this year so far. “Mumbai saw the maximum number of deaths in April 2020, and the health authorities have since ensured that a proper plan is in place to reduce deaths. There was better adherence to protocols in Mumbai, and there was better logistical development, ensuring patients were transferred faster to healthcare facilities,” said Dr Supe. Meanwhile, the state added 20,295 cases on Saturday, taking the total caseload to 57.13 lakh cases. Mumbai recorded 1,038 cases and 25 deaths, taking the tally to 7.03 lakh and toll to 14,833 so far. BMC officials said the test positivity rate for the second consecutive day was lower than 4%, indicating that the present wave is fast declining.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/death-rate-in-state-still-lower-than-in-1st-wave-mumbai-city-among-best-managed/articleshow/83079086.cms||---

While Chaudhary, who has been arrested, is reportedly close to RLD, photographs of Sharma with several BJP members have surfaced, sparking a political row. Incidentally, Sharma is still absconding and the Aligarh police has declared a reward of Rs 50,000 for his arrest and taken his wife Renu Sharma, ex-block Pramukh, into custody. Sharma had reportedly joined the BJP a few years ago and was recently elected as a BDC member from the village Jawan. His Facebook account is full of photographs with the party's who’s who, including state minister Sandeep Singh. It has gone viral on social media now. However, local BJP members are trying to distance themselves from him after the incident and claimed that he does not hold any position in the party. “Lots of people get their photographs clicked with ministers. Politicians cannot be held responsible for it,” said BJP district president Rishipal Singh, reacting to Sharma's party connections. “There is no connection of any criminal with the party,” said BJP MP Aligarh Satish Gautam, adding that a "criminal is criminal whosoever he is". Chaudhary, who was recently elected unopposed as BDC member, is the husband of the elected zila panchayat member, Mamta Chaudhary, and is backed by RLD and Samajwadi Party. His arrest on Friday sparked protests with residents of Aligarh’s Gonda area, demanding a "fair and high level probe". They claimed that Chaudhary is being framed by BJP members as his wife is a possible candidate for zila panchayat chairperson.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/political-blame-game-starts-over-hooch-tragedy/articleshow/83070596.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

---||Hyderabad||Indu Projects case: ED adjourns hearing||HYDERABAD: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) special court in Hyderabad on Friday adjourned a case filed by the ED citing irregularities in Indu Projects Ltd-then Andhra Pradesh Housing Board chargesheet to June 30.  AP chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, his relative and TTD chairman YV Subba Reddy, YSRC MLA Vasantha Venkata Krishna Prasad and others were named as accused in the chargesheet. Though the ED sourced its material from the CBI quid pro quo case, what was significant in this chargesheet is that the ED did not make YSRC MP and Jagan’s auditor V Vijaya Sai Reddy as an accused in this case. He continues to be an accused in the corresponding CBI case. While the CBI case charges the accused with causing wrongful loss to the state and its housing board by misusing its prime land plots in Hyderabad, the ED case lists its efforts to track the money generated from the crime narrated in the CBI case. Indu Projects CMD Syam Prasad Reddy, Bengaluru-based realtor Jitendra Mohandas Virwani, Cyberabad Hitech Integrated Township Development Corporation, Indu Projects, Indu Eastern Province Projects, Indu Royal Homes, Vasantha Projects and Embassy Property Developments Pvt Ltd company were shown as other accused in the ED chargesheet. All the accused and the representatives of the accused entities have appeared before the court in virtual mode — some in person and some through their counsel. The CBI alleged that Syam Prasad carted away 135 acres of prime government land plots in Greater Hyderabad when late YS Rajasekhara Reddy was the CM in the guise of developing villas in a joint venture with the then APHB. One of the many allegations the CBI had levelled against Syam Prasad is that he gave away a two-acre plot belonging to the housing board to Subba Reddy. The ED had attached Rs 117 crore worth assets of Indu Projects in January 2018.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/indu-projects-case-ed-adjourns-hearing/articleshow/83074664.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: After conquering peaks, climbers join hands to win Covid battle||KOLKATA: They have battled many insurmountable odds to conquer peaks. Now they are attempting to fight the pandemic by dipping into their savings to help people in distress. From arranging for safe homes, oxygen cylinders and Covid-19 helplines, mountaineers are doing their bit in the fight against the virus. Bengal Police officer Rudraprasad Haldar, also a member of the mountaineering club, Arohi, in Sonarpur, and fellow climbers and trekkers have started an oxygen support service in the South 24 Parganas town. Apart from opening a safe home on the club premises, they have started providing oxygen support to patients. “We have started a helpline. Volunteers are working 24x7 in three shifts. A team of doctors is in touch with volunteers,” said Haldar. They are also reaching medicines to patients. Most of the 22 volunteers are mountaineers and adventure lovers. In the past two decades, Haldar has climbed several peaks, including Everest and Kanchenjunga. “Our volunteers, like Chayan Chatterjee, Avik Mandal and Jay Mandal, are all climbers and trekkers,” he added. Satyarup Siddhanta, another mountaineer and Guinness record holder as the youngest to have climbed seven summits and seven volcanic summits, is a founder member of Covid Care Network. The organization, which started with a Covid helpline in July last year, has set up five safe homes in Birbhum, Taki, Burdwan and the Sunderbans. “We are using cyclone shelter homes and community spaces as Covid care facilities where mild to moderate patients can be treated,” Siddhanta said. CCN is providing oxygen on wheels service in 15 districts. Debraj Dutta, who along with Siddhanta and Haldar climbed Mt Everest in 2016, is one of the few climbers to have conquered three peaks in Siachen. Dutta and his club Behala Hindustan Sangha started providing food and medicines to Covid patients last year. “We have been reaching oxygen to people’s home in Behala-Hindustan Park area,” Dutta said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/after-conquering-peaks-climbers-join-hands-to-win-covid-battle/articleshow/83073677.cms||Monotosh Chakraborty

Singh was addressing the passing-out cadets of the 140th course of the National Defence Academy (NDA) here at Khadakwasla. “The nature of war is changing, and it is important to engage the adversary in all domains. And, for this reason, jointness among the three services is far more important now than in the past. To achieve this, Armed Forces are seeing landmark defence reforms with the establishment of the department of military affairs, the institution of the chief of defence staff and the soon to-be-formed theatre command,” Singh said. Singh said the traditions, identity, uniform, and customs of each service matter as much as the requirements generated by the distinctive role of each. “But jointness in the Armed Forces is paramount ... in today’s complex battlefield,” he added. A total of 311 cadets, including those from friendly foreign countries, passed out after completing three years of military training at NDA. On military leadership, Singh said a few personal abilities and attributes were key for an officer. “Be an example for the men and women you lead. Your men should feel inspired to work with you — not just for you — and that comes when the leader practises and not just preaches. There is no faster way to gaining your men’s trust than to approach every situation with honesty of intent and integrity of purpose,” he added. Reminding the cadets of the rich legacy of the Armed Forces, Singh — the foremost naval officer in the country — said, “You are the future of the services and the nation. Your journey will be rewarding and challenging. From this point onward, everything you have been trained in will start to make sense — you train as you fight, and you fight as you trained.” He emphasized the role of an officer in looking after troops and materiel. “Looking after men involves looking after their professional development, morale, and their safety. Looking after materiel involves looking after machines of which you are in charge, by keeping them fully combat-worthy,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/jointmanship-among-armed-forces-key-to-complex-battlefields-navy-chief/articleshow/83073688.cms||Sandip Dighe

Chandrasen Prajapati was arrested after a brief exchange of fire, but his associate Sonu Jaat fled the spot, said police. Police said the victim had gone to meet his friends near Kashiram Colony on Friday, where he was shot dead. Acting on a tip-off that Chandrasen and Sonu are planning to flee the district, police barricaded the Etmadulla area and when a police team intercepted two bike-borne youths on suspicion, they opened fire at them in a bid to escape, said police. In the retaliatory firing, Chandrasen was injured, while Sonu escaped, said police, adding that the accused was admitted to a hospital. SP (city) Botre Rohan Pramod said police recovered a country-made pistol that was used in the crime from the accused’s possession.

The current lockdown is set to end on Sunday. The state government clamped the lockdown first on May 12 for 10 days, but extended it till May 30. While the state cabinet is meeting on Sunday to take a call on extending the lockdown and also review the surge in Covid-19 cases, ruling TRS elected representatives are believed to have told chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao to provide additional window to people by extending the four-hour (6 am to 10 am) relaxation to six hours (6 am to 12 noon) while continuing the lockdown for another 10 days. This would enable people to buy essential commodities in a leisurely manner and also stop panic buying and crowding at markets, shops and public places, the legislators opined. The CM is also believed to have spoken to some of his ministers and MLAs and made enquiries about the impact of the lockdown in their constituencies and sought opinion on extending the lockdown. Sources in the chief minister’s office (CMO) also said the government, in all likelihood, will extend the lockdown till June first week or by 10 more days. Several states have already extended the lockdown till June first week in their respective regions. Highlighting the concerns of the people on the four-hour relaxation window available now, a minister said: “Banks are open till 12 noon, but people have not been able to go to the banks as the relaxation time ends at 10 am. Some retailers such as vegetable vendors are also seeking relaxation in the timings. Instead of 6 am, restrictions can be eased from 7 am to 12 noon or 1 pm,” he said. The CM has also asked the health and police departments to furnish reports on the Covid-19 situation and implementation of lockdown in the districts. Meanwhile, health officials gave enough indications about the downward curve in Covid-19 cases in the state. They said apart from a decrease in the daily cases in the past one week, the positivity rate has come down to 4 per cent. “We have seen a drop from 8.6 per cent on May 1 to 5.56 per cent on May 18 to 4 per cent now,” a senior health official said. However, the officials said the lockdown should be in place for two more weeks at least to bring the down cases to less than 1,000. Top police brass also felt that the lockdown had led to dip in Covid-19 cases after men in khaki started cracking the whip on the violators following the directions from the CM. For providing impetus to the state’s economy in the midst of an extended lockdown, KCR asked chief secretary Somesh Kumar to suggest activities that do not result in huge gatherings. Already, online slot bookings are allowed for property registrations, which were suspended till May 28. The stamps and registration department is seeking exemption from the lockdown so that it can go full steam as hundreds of registrations are on hold. The government has given relaxation to agriculture and allied sectors and major construction projects too. The state wants to remove curbs on agriculture-related activity as the new farm season will begin in the first week of June before the onset of monsoon. The Centre had directed the states to continue Covid-19 containment measures till June 30 and left it to the discretion of state governments to decide on imposing or extending the lockdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/lockdown-extension-likely-in-t-call-today/articleshow/83074694.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Pongala waste management: Corporation completes internal probe||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The city corporation is learnt to have completed a high-level internal inquiry into the circumstances which led to corporation availing service of 21 trucks for the removal of Attukal pongala waste. Mayor Arya Rajendran and corporation health standing committee have been facing criticism over alleged irregularities in deploying trucks for pongala waste management when the pongala was held in households. The civic body is yet to receive a formal communication from local self-government department (LSGD) regarding an inquiry by additional chief secretary, LSGD. According to officials, the number of trucks required for the waste collection was twice revised — first by mayor Rajendran and then by the corporation secretary owing to the uncertainty over the conduct of pongala. When the tender file was first prepared in December, it was mentioned that around 50 trucks were required. Later it was revised to 35 and then to 21. The corporation secretary also suggested that 10 trucks may be arranged on call basis if at all requirement arises for waste management. Trucks were rented for three days. The health wing officials had communicated to the corporation council that people living in wards coming under festival zone usually dumped all household waste on roadside on the day of pongala hoping that it would be collected from corporation workers during the cleaning drive. On pongala day, the quantity of waste was less than that used to be collected in previous years. When the waste was found to be of little quantity directives were issued to mop up waste piles from other parts of the festival wards. The officials had to deal with unexpected hurdles as the staff of World Market had objected to dumping of waste there. The corporation office had to contact the office of district collector and sought her intervention in resolving the issue. Waste was also transported to a site at Mangalapuram using the trucks which were rented for pongala waste collection. While the officials admit that there were procedural lapses in file work, the city corporation has not paid any money towards the bills furnished regarding collection and transportation of waste. Meanwhile, the row over transportation of pongala waste has also forced the corporation officials to initiate an audit into the manner in which funds were spent for manpower management, waste transportation and collection, providing food and refreshments as part of Attukal pongala waste management. The officials are looking into advance payments and actual expenditure requirements of health officials in the previous years in the wake of the recent development. In a press note issued by the mayor the other day, she said that corporation would spend Rs 20 lakh for deploying temporary staff and that an amount of Rs 25 lakh would be spent annually for removal of waste during pongala and that this year this expense came down to Rs 3.57 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/pongala-waste-management-corp-completes-internal-probe/articleshow/83072194.cms||Aswin J Kumar

The team of officials inspected the site where the proposed water line will be constructed. A water trunk at a length of 3 km will have to be laid between YSR Bhavan where HMWS&SB’s ground level service reservoir is located and TIMS. “The road which was laid under the Comprehensive Road Maintenance Programme CRMP will have to be dug up to lay the water pipeline. The GHMC is proposing to give exemption to the HMWS&SB instead of paying deposit for re-carpeting the damaged portion of the road,” executive engineer, GHMC Serilingampally zone, P Chinna Reddy told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-water-at-tims-team-inspects-site-for-laying-pipeline/articleshow/83074689.cms||---

While a pro-Congress teachers’ organisation has questioned the motive and rationale behind such an order, especially in view of the pandemic situation prevailing across the state, a CPM-backed teachers’ association welcomed the move, terming it as a reassuring step. “This is what the children and the society want. A message from the chief minister, when served at the door step of Class 1 students in these unprecedented times should be welcomed by all,’’ said Kerala School Teachers Association (KSTA) general secretary N T Sivarajan. It is for the first time that the general education department has come out with the idea of distributing the CM’s message to students and their family in connection with reopening of the schools. Kerala Pradesh School Teachers Association leaders have registered their protest against the directive and asked the general education department authorities to spare teachers from door to door distribution of the leaflet, braving the pandemic. “It’s a politically-motivated, bizarre move. The government representatives have not discussed any such idea in the Quality Improvement Programme (QIP) meeting held a couple of days ago to discuss the preparations for the next academic year. The direction tests the common sense of the public and puts to risk the lives of those involved in the exercise. We have asked the authorities to exempt teachers from such a duty,’’ said KPSTA state president M Salahudheen. If at all the CM wants to give a message to the kids, he can give it online or Victers television channel could have broadcast it, as virtual teaching has replaced the physical classroom during this Covid times, he added. In view of the pandemic situation, the school reopening celebrations would be held online, though Vijayan is expected to inaugurate the ‘Pravesanothsavam’ at Cotton Hill Government Higher Secondary School here, adhering to Covid-19 protocol. According to sources, the general education department has printed four lakh single page leaflets with message of the CM, addressed to children in the first standard. The order from the director of general education Jeevan Babu, dated May 29, said the school authorities should try to hand over the copy of the message latest by the reopening day, ie, June 1. The distribution should be carried out with the help and cooperation of ward members, volunteers and PTA, it said. The CM’s message to the kids reminds them that we are living through strange crisis in the pandemic times and urges them to follow Covid-19 protocol strictly. Last year too, the CM had sent his messages to the kids but it was delivered online or read out in schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cms-bid-to-get-in-touch-with-kids-meets-resistance/articleshow/83072246.cms||B S Anilkumar

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Professors help students in personal crisis||KOLKATA: In the age of remote classrooms, college-goers are bonding with their professors like never before, sharing everyday angst and seeking solace. If they talked about career uncertainty last year, the one on-one conversations in the second wave are extremely personal, ranging from alleged domestic violence to financial woes and bereavement. “Our college teachers are now our most non-judgmental listeners,” admitted Atreyee Das (name changed). “When my father lost his job last week, I couldn’t bear to see him crying. So I called up my professor. We chatted for more than an hour until I was ready to face things,” the third year student of a central Kolkata college said. “The second wave has brought students and teachers closer. Our five counsellors have their hands full, resolving issues that are more personal than academic. Since the conversations are strictly confidential, teachers are the most trusted and go-to persons for them,” Rev Fr Dominic Savio, principal, St Xavier’s College, said. Loreto College has two general counsellors, apart from the department-wise mentors (teachers) so that students get individual attention. “Our mentoring programme allows teachers to play a crucial role, not just for helping students with career guidance, but much on the personal front as well,” Sister Christine Coutinho, principal, Loreto College, said. “Last year, the concerns were related to admission to renowned Indian or overseas institutions. Now, the students face the fear of losing a loved one. They need us to act as sounding board,” said Sushma Sahai, coordinator, Internal Quality Assurance Cell, Loreto College. “Three or four generations staying under one roof 24x7 can be overwhelming. We have been counselling them since the 2020 lockdown, but the issues are more serious now,” said Kapila Mundhra, counsellor, St Xavier’s College.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/profs-help-students-in-personal-crisis/articleshow/83073734.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

The Wakad police later arrested the scooter rider, Sanjay Eknath Shedge (42), of Adhale village in Maval taluka. He was produced before a city court on Saturday and was remanded in magisterial custody. Sub-inspector Jitendra Girnar of the Wakad police said “Shedge is a farmer and supplies milk to Pimpri Chinchwad residents. He came down to the Wakad area for some personal work and was heading towards his village when the incident took place.” The injured constable, Shankar Tukaram Ingle (47), of the Hinjewadi traffic division has lodged a complaint with the Wakad police. The entire incident has been recorded by a CCTV camera on the road. According to the police, a traffic police team was executing a nakabandi operation on the road when Shedge was asked to halt around 5.15pm. “When the police team demanded Shedge to show his driving licence and other vehicle documents, he started his scooter and accelerated it to avoid the police action,” Girnar said. “As soon as he accelerated the scooter, Ingle attempted to grab the scooter’s rear bar, but his hand got stuck in the bar. As Shedge increased the speed of the scooter, Ingle got dragged with it for about 50 feet. It was when Ingle screamed that Shedge brought his scooter to a halt,” Girnar said. He said, “Shedge was carrying the driving licence and vehicle documents. The vehicle belongs to his friend.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cop-tries-to-stop-scooterist-gets-dragged-50-feet/articleshow/83073733.cms||---

But the official toll contradicted doctors at the post mortem house who said post mortems have been done on 35 persons till now. BJP MP Satish Gautam, too, said 35 have fallen to the locally manufactured hooch. At least 27 others are fighting for life at various hospitals. This came even as 10 more bodies piled up at the post mortem house by Saturday evening. An inquiry into the tragedy has been marked to SP (crime) Rajesh Srivastava and the SHO at Lodha police station, Abhay Kumar Sharma, has been suspended with immediate effect to “ensure fair investigations”. A day earlier, three excise officials, including the district excise officer, had been suspended. DIG (Aligarh range) Deepak Kumar insisted that as of now the figure given by the administration is 25, with 27 reported to be critical. The government will pay Rs 5 lakh each to the kin of the dead and provide free treatment to those in hospital. However, MP Gautam said, “As per government records 35 people have died from various villages including Karsua, Andala, Cherat, Right Jaitpura, Palsera due to consumption of spurious liquor. I have visited several villages along with the (local) MLAs. If excise officials are found guilty in this matter, FIRs will be registered against them. NSA will also be invoked.” ADG (Agra range) Rajeev Krishna said two persons are in police remand for three days. Cops have seized "suspicious documents" along with bar codes, wrappers and bottle caps of a particular brand of country liquor and further investigations are on. A team of Excise Intelligence Bureau (EIB) officials from Allahabad visited Aligarh on Saturday to look into what is also becoming a political issue with fingers being pointed at each other by various political parties. The EIB officers went to the district hospital in Aligarh and took statements of victims admitted there. They also checked the shops from where the liquor was sold. ASHA workers have now fanned across the affected villages, going from door to door to "survey the health of villagers". Besides, lekhpals, too, have gone to the villages to warn residents not to consume any “country-made liquor” if they have it in their homes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/aligarh-hooch-toll-25-but-post-mortem-done-on-35-as-10-more-bodies-reach-hospital/articleshow/83070609.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

At the personal level, officials also provided monetary assistance to the family to buy fruits and milk for children. The action was taken a day after a TOI published a report on the plight of the family residing in JP Nagar on Mau road. Taking cognizance of the matter, district magistrate Prabhu N Singh ordered the district supply officer to issue a ration card to the family. Authorities also started processing documents for issuing the woman a widow pension card, Ayushman Bharat card, a gas connection under the Ujjwala scheme and construction of a house under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna. District supply officer Umesh Mishra said, “I have personally visited the family. On the DM’s orders, supply of groceries, sufficient for at least one month, has been made to the family. We have also handed over some cash to the woman so that she can buy fruits and milk for the children. They will be provided with a ration card soon after their Aadhaar card is issued. The gas cylinder and stove will be delivered to them on Sunday. Processing to issue a widow pension card to the mother of five children has been initiated.” District magistrate Singh said. “We will ensure that the family in distress gets benefits under the government schemes in a time-bound manner. Samples of the woman and the children have been collected by the health department team for Covid-19 testing. The children will be enrolled in government schools. The family can directly contact me in case of any difficulty.” Facing Covid-19 complications, Kamlesh Devi’s 44-year-old rickshaw puller Rakesh Kumar was not able to get treatment and died after suffering breathlessness on May 17. Father of five children, he was the only earning member of his family. “We are thankful to the district administration for extending help to us. Neighbours are also supporting us. I will find some work soon and take best possible care of my children,” said Kamlesh Devi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/agra-administration-extends-helping-hand-to-ailing-widow-unable-to-take-care-of-five-kids/articleshow/83070613.cms||Deepak Lavania

Police also seized a large number of electronic chips that were used for gambling and 290 bottles of imported premium liquor from the casino that the embassy adviser was allegedly operating from the basement of his house. The casino, which had patrons from across NCR, was busted on a tip-off, police said. Around 6pm on Friday, a team from the Sector 29 police station raided the house in Sushant Lok-1 and found the five playing cards and gambling with the chips, police said. They have been identified as house owner Parvesh Pal Kapoor, South City-1 resident Kavaljeet Singh Sethi, Naresh Kumar of Sector 43, Mohan Lal, a resident of DLF-4, and Harender Singh, a resident of Sushant Lok. Kapoor, police said, had converted the basement of his house into a casino with all the necessary props. The casino had a roundtable with specially designed blocks for keeping chips and packets of cards. Cops seized 300 gambling chips, including 29 of Rs 5,000 value, 30 of Rs 1,000 value, 30 of Rs 500 value, and 85 chips of Rs 100 value, besides 60 packets of cards. Along with the gambling items, police also seized 290 bottles of imported premium liquor. Officials of the excise department were called to the spot. “The seized liquor was worth several lakhs. The excise department is making the valuation,” a police officer told TOI. Assistant excise and taxation officer (AETO) Vivek Agarwal said, “The owner of the house and the casino had no licence or permit to keep such large quantities of liquor. He also failed to produce the bill for the purchase of the same. According to excise norms, an individual can’t keep more than 8-10 bottles of imported liquor at home.” ACP (DLF) Karan Goel said that the five men had assembled at the spot in violation of lockdown norms and none was wearing a mask at the time of their arrest. “The casino was operational for the past few months and people from Delhi-NCR used to visit here often for gambling,” he said. A case was registered against the accused at the Sector 29 police station under the Gambling Act, sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 34 (common intention) of IPC, and under the Disaster Management Act and the Excise Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/home-casino-bust-embassy-adviser-among-five-caught/articleshow/83073766.cms||Bagish Jha

BEST committee members now demand that 100 new double deckers promised for Mumbai should hit the streets in 2021. They plan to take up this issue in the next panel meeting. While tenders have been floated for the new buses, the process for procuring them has been delayed lately, they pointed out. The fleet of BEST double deckers has been reduced from 120 buses last November to just 48 buses in May this year, and is likely to further reduce to 40 buses in the coming weeks, sources said. The old buses are either being scrapped or given away for tourism purposes. A senior BEST official said that it was ‘normal’ for the double-decker fleet size to shrink as the majority of buses have attained its life span. As for the new double deckers, he assured that they were “in the pipeline” and the tenders were already floated to procure new ones. A few decades ago, these double deckers dominated the roads in the island city while the single deckers were primarily operated in the suburbs. This was when the fleet of the twin-deck buses was as high as 242 buses. “The double deckers have a good carrying capacity (maximum 90 passengers) and are favourite among several Mumbaikars. We will try to bring in the new buses at the earliest so that the fleet size is maintained at 120 buses,” said BEST committee chairman (Shiv Sena) Ashish Chemburkar. During lockdown, BEST introduced special double-decker services for the first time for office-goers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-best-double-decker-buses-reduce-by-60-down-to-48-from-120-last-nov/articleshow/83076347.cms||Somit Sen

Baby Fatima is gradually losing strength and movement in her lower body. Doctors say there is no other way than to import "Zolgensma injection", which may save her life, but must be imported from the US, and at such high cost. “When the doctor at JK Lon hospital in Jaipur told me about the cost of the injection, which my daughter needs for her treatment, it was a feeling like I cannot do anything for my baby as the cost of injection is beyond imagination,” said 29-year-old Zeeshan Ahmed, Fatima's father. Zeeshan, who works as a painter and earns between Rs 10,000 and Rs 15,000 a month, hails from Bikaner. Baby Fatima is their only child. What adds more worries for the family is that they cannot get any financial support from the Centre or the state government. “The national policy has categories of rare diseases in three classes -- I, 2, and 3. SMA type - 1 comes under the third category. The national policy says the Centre and state governments will not fund the treatment of rare diseases belonging to the third category. In this case, the family has to take support from others, apart from the government, or raise the cost of treatment through crowdfunding. Early treatment is more effective in recovery,” Dr Ashok Gupta, chairman technical committee on rare diseases, Rajasthan, said. Dr Gupta says: “It is a one-time gene therapy. This therapy will change genetic composition and synthesize SMN protein. In SMA, body does not produce SMN protein, which causes SMA disease.” The family is now running from pillar to post to collect funds for the treatment of their baby. In the last 15 days, they have been reaching out to people and NGOs who could help the family in crowdfunding. “We have got support of a lot of people who are helping us in crowdfunding,” Shageer Ahmed, cousin of Zeeshan, who is helping him raising the fund, said. “What gives us hope is that we have come to know about three cases of SMA for whom crowdfunding was done and they have got the injection, which are very expensive. We are quite hopeful,” Shageer said. Poonam Ankur Chhabra, national president, Sampoorn Sharab bandi andolan, also appealed to people to help baby Fatima in getting the treatment. “We are appealing to the public representatives and have also written to the PM and the CM of the state.” Noor Fatima was born in October 2020; doctors say that she should get the one-time therapy within one year of the birth, for best results. BOX: - Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a genetic disease affecting the nervous system and voluntary muscle movement - It is caused by a mutation in the survival motor neuron gene 1 (SMN1). - In a healthy person, this gene produces a protein that is critical to the function of the nerves that controlour muscles - Without it, those nerve cells cannot function properly and, eventually die, leading to debilitating and sometimes fatal muscle weakness. - There are four primary types of SMA -1, 2, 3, and 4, based on the age that symptoms begin, and highest physical milestone achieved - The severity of symptoms and age of onset varies by the type. Some types are apparent at or before birth while others are not apparent until adulthood. - All the four conditions generally result in worsening of muscle weakness associated with muscle twitching. Arm, leg, and respiratory muscles are generally affected first. - Associated problems may include problems with swallowing, scoliosis, and joint contractures. Individuals with SMA have difficulty performing basic functions of life, like breathing and swallowing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rs-16-cr-injection-needed-for-infant-suffering-from-rare-muscular-disease/articleshow/83073758.cms||---

With all their efforts proving to be futile, cops are now shifting the violators to isolation centres after conducting a Covid-19 test. Those who test negative are counselled by police against coming out on the roads. Their family members are also being counselled against any violations. Adilabad and Nirmal police have designated special vehicles to transport violators to the isolation centres. The violators’ vehicles are seized and cases under the Epidemic Diseases Act are booked against them. In-charge SP of Adilabad district M Rajesh said the vehicles will be returned only after the lockdown is lifted. Police booked 177 persons for not wearing mask on Saturday, 52 for violating the lockdown guidelines and 590 motorists for moving out in colonies. At Ramagundam in Mancherial district, violators were sent to non-Covid isolation centres so that they do not move out on the roads. Nirmal district SP Ch Praveen Kumar, who supervised implementation of the lockdown, said violators were being dealt with strictly. At Shivaji Chowk in Nirmal town, the violators were made to undergo a Covid test and sent to an isolation centre if they tested positive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/lockdown-violators-shifted-to-isolation-centres-in-dists/articleshow/83074746.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

In the review meeting held with all stakeholders, it came to light that several tasks are pending. For instance, Jal Nigam has not completed its repair work in Modinagar because of which the RRTS work had not started there. In addition, the forest department had not given permission to cut 150 trees on Delhi-Meerut road. Threatening departmental action against erring authorities, the commissioner said, “The RRTS project has to be completed in a time-bound manner and it is imperative for the district authorities to coordinate with NCRTC for hurdle-less completion of the project. Any lethargy in this regard is not acceptable." The Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut RRTS corridor will have a total of 24 stations. It will be elevated for around 70.5 km and 11.5 km of its stretch will be underground. Civil construction work is in progress on more than 50-km stretch of this 82-km-long corridor. The 17-km-long priority section between Sahibabad and Duhai of this corridor is scheduled to commence operations in 2023. The entire corridor will be opened to the public by 2025.

---||Jaipur||Demand for medicinal plants on rise across Rajasthan||JAIPUR: Private and forest nurseries in the state are witnessing a rapid rise in demand for medicinal plants during Covid pandemic as residents are increasingly buying such plants for their gardens. As many of these plants with medicinal values including Tulsi significantly improve air quality as per the traditional medicine system, the demand in recent past has increased manifold. Other plants with medicinal value including turmeric, ashwagandha (within somnifera) and guduchi are also in tremendous demand. Ratan Saini, a nursery owner in Jagatpura said, “In a new trend, people are opting for medicinal plants over ornamental plants. Tulsi, which is known to increase the supply of oxygen and absorbs harmful gases, is in high demand.” The forest department also soon plans to implement its ‘Ghar Ghar Aushadhi Scheme’ to promote medicinal herbs with multiple health benefits. Under the scheme, the department targets to distribute medicinal plants including Kalmegh, Tulsi, Giloy and Ashwagandha. Principal chief conservator of forests (development) DN Pandey said, “To benefit every household, the department shortlisted four species of plants which can be planted in pots after studying 1,100 research papers and evaluating 3.5 million database. Even before the scheme is rolled out, people are expressing interest to procure these plants from forest nurseries.” Though these medicinal plants are in demand, experts warned residents to contact doctors before consuming any herb for cure from any particular disease. A senior forest official said, “A committee has been constituted comprising ayurvedic doctor to educate people to consume these plants which can scientifically provide health immunity.” Expert also believe as these plants are anti-viral and proved multi-functional to cure several diseases, the demand would increase in coming years. Radha Jain, an ayurvedic doctor said, “All these medicinal plants in one’s diet provides rich nutrients to help you make your defence mechanism stronger. It’s an age old proven fact, but people forgot it over the years. The pandemic has brought many close to roots.” Rishi Sharma, who has been growing these trees in his garden said, “I have a dedicated medicinal plant area in my garden. During the pandemic, doctors advised me to consume juice to improve immunity.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/demand-for-medicinal-plants-on-rise/articleshow/83073749.cms||---

The administration, meanwhile, imposed further restrictions on entry and exit from the islands citing the rise in Covid cases. The district magistrate has been named as the single point authority for issuing entry permits to the Union Territory. As many as eleven more people were arrested for taking part in Thursday’s protest at Kiltan Island where an effigy of collector S Asker Ali was burned for “insulting’’ the inhabitants. The collector, during a press conference in Kochi, had referred to the Island while talking about the ‘drug problems’ in the archipelago. Representatives of Congress, NCP, CPI, BJP and Janata Dal (U) attended the all-party meet held on Saturday online. UCK Thangal of Congress said the wording of the proposed legislation itself shows the lack of research behind the drafts. “The proposed laws are written for the mainland. Here, there are no hills or rivers but only sea and beaches. They should at least study the environment of Lakshadweep before drafting laws about constructing buildings here,” said Thangal.  He said the forum will approach the central government as well as the president with their grievances. “Besides coordinating protests, we will take legal recourse. Several officials have become administrators here and all of them were quite friendly with the people. We have not permitted any religious fundamentalists or extremists to infiltrate here. We are very secular and we take pride in our nationalism. The new administrator, however, is treating us like enemies,” said Thangal. Kavaratti Village (Dweep) Panchayat (VDP), meanwhile, passed a resolution condemning the legal reforms of the administration. “The panchayat body expressed its objection to the legal reforms brought about by the administration which is undemocratic and unconstitutional. The meet decided to urge the administrator to revoke the proposals and to finalize projects only after consulting the panchayats as per the integrated island management plan recognised by the Supreme Court,” the resolution presented by vice chairman AP Nazeer said. In another development, Lakshadweep Development Corporation Ltd MD has issued an order upping security near ports and ships, citing intelligence inputs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/lakshadweep-protesters-to-set-up-core-committee/articleshow/83072265.cms||---

The government barred five more such facilities from treating Covid-19 patients. These hospitals, the official order issued on Saturday stated, were not only adding “excess and irrelevant charges” to patients’ bills but also resorting to “mismanagement and lack of attention”. The latest list includes Image Hospital (Ameerpet), Ankura Hospital (LB Nagar), Sia Life Hospital (Kondapur), Panchavati Hospital (Bhoothpur in Mahabubnagar) and Sai Siddartha Hospital (Shapurnagar, Sangareddy). Earlier on Friday, the government cancelled the permission of five hospitals, including Virinchi Hospital (Banjara Hills), to offer Covid-19 treatment. While Virinchi was found allegedly violating treatment protocol, the four others — Vinn Hospital, TX Hospital, Max Health Hospital and Neelima Hospital — were reprimanded for overcharging patients. Dr G Srinivasa Rao, director of public health, Telangana once again warned hospitals against flouting norms and said that further action would be taken if they do not fall in line. “Those found guilty of violating established protocols, norms or guidelines will be subjected to suitable disciplinary action,” the official said. Citizens can lodge their complaints on the WhatsApp number 9154170960 against overcharging hospitals, Rao said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/5-more-fleecing-t-hosps-face-govt-heat/articleshow/83074799.cms||Amrita Didyala

The two mucormycosis wards of the hospital have so far registered four deaths, one of them a black fungus case while the investigation and death audit for confirmation of fungus for other three patients is underway. Expressing concerned over the rising number of patients in the two wards of the hospital, Dr Rajkumar Jain of ENT (Surgery), Kota Medical College, who is treating black fungus patients with his team, said around 65-70 patients from Kota, Bundi, Jhalawar and Baran districts are under treatment and 5-6 of them are in a critical stage. Surgery upon at least 25 patients in the two wards has been conducted upon so far while the others are in queue, he added. Another 30-year-old youth belonging to Itawa-Khatoli area of Kota district, who was suffering from mucormycosis that had reached his brain, died during treatment in the ward on Friday night taking the toll to four so far, Jain said. One of the three patients who died earlier in the ward was a black fungus case, where the mucormycosis had crept into the brain while the other two were suspects and investigation for confirmation of fungus were still underway, he said. The death audit report on three patients who died in mucormycosis wards earlier was yet to be received, Dr. Naveen Saxena, MBS Hospital superintendent, said. We have not received regular supply of medicines and injections from Jaipur and none of the patients in the two wards could be given the required dose of medicines and injections as there was no availability of the same on Saturday, the superintendent said. Baran CMHO Sampat Nagar said eight confirmed black fungus patients have surfaced so far in Baran district and all of them are under treatment outside in jaipur, Jodhpur and Kota. The district has registered two black fungus deaths that included Nandkishore Gurjar, who was under treatment at an ENT hospital in Jaipur, and Laddu Panchal in a private hospital in Kota in the last 10 days. All these patients had a Covid history, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/one-more-black-fungus-suspect-dies-toll-at-4-in-kota-div/articleshow/83073771.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Mobile safe homes roll out in Yaas-hit areas||KOLKATA: The state government in association with a group of social welfare organisations have initiated a unique concept of mobile safe homes to reach Covid patients with breathing trouble who may find it difficult to travel till the nearest health care facility especially during and after the cyclone Yaas. As part of the programme,11 buses – each fitted with 200 litres of liquid oxygen, medical equipment to check health parameters, emergency medicines and three healthcare professionals – have rolled out for possible cyclone-hit areas in South and North 24 parganas. Started as a joint initiative by a Rajdanga club, three social welfare organisations O2ku Shawbar, Ek Packet Umeed and Chitlangia Charitable Trust with two buses last week, the state came forward to boost the project. Nine more buses were added to the fleet with the state government supplying necessary medical equipment, power supply, medicines and healthcare professionals. “The state government has supported us with everything from oxygen concentrators to nurses and have even provided us with parking spaces on government hospital premises and a dedicated power supply. This will help us reach out to more interior areas with compromised healthcare facilities,” said Arkadeep Nath, an O2ku Shawbar member. The mobile safe homes have been roving in areas like Joynagar, Kakdwip, Kultali, Canning, Baruipur and Diamond Harbour in South 24 Parganas — all of which has been majorly affected in Yaas and the accompanying spring tide. In North 24 Parganas, they are available at Bongaon, Habra, Barrackpore, Panihati, Basirhat and Barasat areas. “Since the buses need dedicated electric supply to run the oxygen concentrators, we are mostly stationing the vehicles inside the premises of government hospitals and health centres. But in times of emergency, they would move to deeper areas,” said another official. In a video message, South 24 Parganas district magistrate P Ulganathan has lauded the initiative. “There is a huge demand of medical oxygen in our district and this oxygen on wheels service will be extremely helpful to tide through the current situation. The buses would even travel to interior areas like Gosaba and Basanti if needed,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mobile-safe-homes-roll-out-in-yaas-hit-areas/articleshow/83073776.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Thiruvananthapuram||I am a caretaker president: Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee president Mullappally Ramachandran||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran on Saturday said he submitted a report to AICC president Sonia Gandhi soon after the election results came out pointing out the reasons for the failure of the party. He rubbished reports that he wrote a letter to the party president. “I have detailed everything in the report and hence, there was no need to write a letter to Sonia Gandhi,” he said, while speaking to reporters here. He also denied reports that he had boycotted the meetings of Ashok Chavan committee appointed by AICC to probe into the defeat faced by the party in the assembly elections. “I did not boycott the sitting of the committee. I told the committee chairman that I have given a detailed report to Sonia Gandhi explaining the reasons behind the party’s defeat. Hence, I have nothing more to add. I urged the committee to attach that report as my statement in its report,” he said. Mullappally said he has expressed his willingness to resign from the party president’s post and it has been already informed to Sonia Gandhi. “I am now continuing as a caretaker president. That was the reason why I kept away from the UDF meeting held on Friday. It was not proper and politically correct from my part to attend the meeting as KPCC president after I have given a letter to the party leadership to resign,” he said. “Sonia Gandhi spoke to me after she received the report and she had pledged all support for me. I told her that I am shouldering the responsibility for the party’s defeat and hence I am ready to quit,” he said. In his report, Mullappally, is said to have blamed groupism in the party for its defeat. He is learnt to have said that group managers have been dictating terms in the party and he was never a given a free hand to take decisions. From organizational matters to deciding on candidates, it has been the group managers who had the last word. Hence, the party has become dysfunctional at the grassroots and that was the reason behind the party’s dismal performance, he is learnt to have said in his report. Reports have surfaced that Ramesh Chennithala has also written a letter to Sonia Gandhi expressing his displeasure over the way he was unceremoniously removed from the post of the opposition leader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/i-am-a-caretaker-prez-mullappally/articleshow/83072310.cms||---

He said according to experts the chances of a third wave are likely and the state must prepare in advance on the front of oxygen, vaccination and medical infrastructure. He claimed that the state government was able to tackle first and second wave ably and there should be no laxity in planning for the future challenges. The chief minister was holding a review meeting on Covid virtually from his residence on Saturday. He said it has come to light that there were different variants of the virus and there is a chance of a third wave. He said taking experience and research from the world, the state had to prepare its strategy. He asked the officials to form a team of medical experts to conduct research on the latest developments on Covid front. He advised them to share the experiences of expatriate doctors working in various countries as well. The chief minister said a standard protocol had to be made so that the lockdown and other restrictions would be imposed and unlocking done. Similarly, a timeline on increasing the beds and human resources must be framed. He also advised the health department to take the services of alternative medicines like ayurveda, unani, homeopathy and naturopathy in the treatment. Health minister Raghu Sharma said the department is further augmenting health services in rural areas in anticipation of another wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/prepare-master-plan-to-tackle-chances-of-third-wave-cm/articleshow/83073773.cms||---

In all, 31.44 lakh doses of vaccines have been allocated for the month of June. On Saturday, the state received Covishield vaccines for the age group 45+ in two batches — 1.98 lakh doses and 1.5 lakh doses — and 67,000 doses of Covaxin for 45+ on Saturday. The state had received 8 lakh doses of Covishield for 45+ age group on Friday. According to the Covid vaccination daily report, 1.2 lakh vaccine doses were administered on Friday, taking the total number of doses administered to 1.63 crore. So far, 15.72 lakh beneficiaries belonging to the 18-44 age group have been vaccinated. Nodal officer for vaccination Dr Raghuraj Singh said, “For the 18-44 age group, 9.56 lakh doses of Covishield will arrive in June. Around 3.13 lakh doses of Covaxin for the 18+ age group will also come in June. We will receive 18.75 lakh doses of vaccines (Covaxin and Covishield) for 45+ age group in June. A few people, who have plans to go abroad, are a bit hesitant about getting Covaxin shot. Otherwise there isn’t much hesitancy among people.” Covaxin, one of the Covid-19 drugs in India, does not feature in the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) Emergency Use Listing (EUL) for now. A number of countries are yet to approve the vaccine as well. Thus, those vaccinated by Covaxin might not be allowed to travel internationally till the time it gets approved; it is only approved by nine countries for now. On the other hand, Covishield has been reportedly approved by 130 countries around the world. A proposal regarding Covaxin has already been sent to WHO by Bharat Biotech; the guidance document by WHO shows that “more information is required” in the context. WHO’s approval will also mean that other countries in need of Covid-19 vaccination can also import the vaccine from India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/state-to-get-18-75l-doses-for-45-12-69l-for-18-for-june/articleshow/83073777.cms||---

Shivajinagar received 24mm rain till 8.30pm on Saturday, while Lohegaon recorded 36.6mm rain. On Saturday, the city’s relative humidity was as high as 93% with significant cloud cover in the evening. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), light showers (may be even moderate at isolated areas), thunder and lightning activities are expected to continue in the city in the afternoon or the evening in the next few days as pre-monsoon activity. Anupam Kashyapi, head of the weather forecasting division, IMD, Pune, told TOI, “Currently, no strong/active weather system is present over Maharashtra. Still, moisture incursion is happening. Moderately strong westerlies are dragging moisture into Maharashtra from the Arabian Sea. Hence, there was rainfall activity in parts of the state on Saturday. We expect similar conditions on Sunday with chances of isolated light rain, mainly in the four meteorological subdivisions of Maharashtra.” Kashyapi said the southern part of Maharashtra may get light rain (with isolated moderate rain) in scattered locations from May 30. He said the city had chances of very light to light rain on Sunday, too. There is a possibility of increase in clouding in the evening during the next few days. “The city has a light rain, thunder and lightning forecast from May 30 to June 4. On a few occasions, there might be moderately strong winds gusting at 30-40km per hour. With clouding and rain expected during the next few days, the maximum temperature would be around 35°C in Pune. The minimum temperature would be on the higher side — around 23-24°C — because of the presence of moisture in the air,” Kashyapi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/sharp-showers-in-evening-after-a-humid-day/articleshow/83073790.cms||---

The R-value of TN, which went above 1 in the third week of February, was around 1.4 and 1.2 until the second week of May. On May 11, it was around 1.1. Based on cases reported until Friday, epidemiological analysis shows the state has achieved an R-value of 0.9 on May 21. This explains why new cases are shrinking every day, say health experts. “Bringing down the infection rate below one was one of the key targets of the lockdown,” said health secretary J Radhakrishnan. “We had to do this by increasing fever camps and testing across the state. There are some districts which have R-values greater than one, but we are now confident that with sustained efforts we will bring them down too,” he said. On Saturday, TN reported 486 Covid-19 deaths and 30,016 new cases leaving 3.10 lakh people under treatment for the viral infection. On Friday, the state had more than 31,000 new cases. The average number of cases reported by the state over the past one week has dropped to 33,265 from 35,307 four days ago. With increase in discharge of patients from hospitals, the number of active cases has come down from 3.13 lakh on May 27 to 3.10 lakh on Saturday. Cases in hotspot Coimbatore dropped to 3,692 from 3,937 on Friday, and new cases in Chennai dropped to 2,705 from 2,762.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/covid-19-transmission-falling-in-tn-r-value-below-1-after-3-mths/articleshow/83073792.cms||Pushpa Narayan
---||Mumbai||Petrol hits a century in Mumbai, retails at Rs 100.19, diesel at Rs 92.17||MUMBAI: Mumbai on Saturday became the first metro in the country where the price of petrol hit a century and retailed at Rs 100.19 per litre. Diesel, too, hit a new all-time high of Rs 92.17 in the city. Over the past seven years, there has been a Rs 17 drop in the per litre base price of petrol due to the reduction in international crude oil rates between August 2014 ($118) and May 2021 ($68). Yet, fuel rates have increased due to taxes imposed by both state and Central governments, which contribute to 66% of what a motorist pays, said Kedar Chandak, senior petrol dealer and pricing expert. Chandak further said the Central government frequently increased the excise duty on petrol. Meanwhile, the state imposed taxes and VAT, the third highest in the country. The VAT and surcharge on petrol, for instance, rose Rs 11.20 to Rs 28.19 from Rs 16.99 in August 2014. Similarly, the Central excise duty, too, increased Rs 24.32 to Rs 33.80 in 2021 from Rs 9.48 per litre in 2014, thereby giving no relief to the common man. Dealer commission, too, rose Rs 1.46 during this period. Banker Shirish Kulkarni, who commutes to Bandra-Kurla Complex regularly, said, “At home, I need my two-wheeler for daily travel to markets or grocery shop. I also take my car to the office and therefore will have to pay more for fuel, which has been hiked by Rs 24 a litre in the past one year.” Another car owner, Ajay Gowale, said it was high time the government reduced taxes on fuel. Maharashtra earns more than Rs 25,000 crore annually from VAT on fuel. Every one rupee hike per litre of petrol and diesel prices gives the state additional VAT of Rs 140 crore and Rs 275 crore respectively, officials said. Across Maharashtra, 28 districts now have petrol prices of over Rs 100 a litre and the highest rate on Saturday was at Parbhani, at Rs 102.55. The price of petrol in neighbouring Thane and Navi Mumbai was hiked to Rs 100.32 while diesel was a record Rs 92.29 per litre. Petrol pump owner Ravi Shinde said, “It is a double whammy for Covid-hit traders.” Diesel, too, crossed Rs 90 in 32 districts, upsetting transporters. A media statement issued by the All India Motor Transport Congress on Saturday read: “There is a consistent demand from the transport industry to bring diesel and petrol under GST and switch back to an administered pricing regime.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/petrol-hits-a-century-in-mumbai-retails-at-rs-100-19-diesel-at-rs-92-17/articleshow/83072320.cms||Somit Sen

SJP national general secretary Pradeep Gopalakrishnan in a statement here on Saturday has urged the President of India “to direct the central government to make Lakshadweep a part of Kerala and end the rule of the Island administrator to accelerate the development of Lakshadweep and ensure democratic life for them while protecting civil liberties, preservation of their cultural identity, customs, land and human rights of the Island’s tribespeople.” “Lakshadweep issue is growing from being a political issue in the country to a global human rights issue,” the statement said. “The islanders mainly depend on cruise ships from Kerala for their journey from the Island to mainland and back. It is to be suspected that the move by the Lakshadweep administration to cut off the services is an attempt by the central government to isolate the islanders from the general public and turn the Island into an open prison. Air ambulance service was rejected to transport a fully pregnant woman from Kalpani to a hospital at Kavaratti. The only option available before them to reach Kavaratti is by boat in which more uncertainty prevails,” the SJP statement said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/sjp-urges-centre-to-make-dweep-a-part-of-kerala/articleshow/83072335.cms||---

TOI had earlier reported that the pandemic had left 101 children in UP orphaned while it had robbed 454 kids of one parent. According to the updated data from nine districts of Meerut zone, a total of 68 children were orphaned with a maximum of 18 such cases from Saharanpur and 13 from Ghaziabad. In compliance with the apex court directive to states to furnish details of children orphaned or having lost earning parents during the pandemic and efforts made for their rehabilitation, UP has begun compiling a list. Apart from the orphaned ones, over 1,300 destitute children, having lost an earning parent, have been identified. “If such children want to stay with their families, compensation will be credited to the account of the family member or the legal guardian. Child protection committees and the probation officer in the respective district will monitor the process,” Gupta said. The state government, on Saturday, announced a scheme for such orphaned and destitute children. As per the provisions, a sum of Rs 4,000 will be given to parents or legal guardians of the children. For orphaned children below the age of 10, arrangements of rehabilitation will be made at the five state-run infant homes. Experts feel that orphan children are most vulnerable to child trafficking and sexual abuse and should be rehabilitated on priority. “If such children are staying with their relatives, they are vulnerable to sexual abuse and child trafficking. If the child is an infant, the relatives might give them up for adoption in exchange of money,” Anita Rana, a child welfare committee member in Meerut, said. Meanwhile, according to the information available with the Union ministry of women and child development (WCD), states across the country reported as many as 577 children lost both of their parents to Covid-19 during the second wave of the ongoing pandemic since April.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/200-children-orphaned-during-covid-in-up-alone-says-head-of-state-child-rights-panel/articleshow/83070641.cms||Piyush Rai

---||Meerut||Uttar Pradesh: 2,500 trained sub-inspectors sulking at home as recruitment hits legal hurdle||MEERUT: Married barely for a couple of weeks, Shashank Singh (in his mid-20s) of a Meerut village died of Covid-19 last Sunday. Singh, a trained sub-inspector, had been waiting for his posting for the past one year. And consequently, his family did not get any government benefits as his recruitment process had got stuck in legal wrangles. Singh was among 2,486 sub-inspectors (SIs) across UP who have still been waiting for their postings despite being trained at various police training schools. A few of them who had even resigned from their previous government services have their future hanging fire. On June 17, 2016, the UP Police Recruitment and Promotion Board had issued an advertisement for the recruitment of 3,307 sub-inspectors, platoon commanders (PAC) and fire brigade second officers based on an online written examination of 400 marks comprising four sections of 100 marks each. In the response, a total of 6,30,926 applications were received and the examination had to be conducted in multiple shifts with different sets of examination papers that necessitated a “normalisation” process — that means, equalising the scores of the candidates who appeared in multiple shifts based on the difficulty level. “The rule also stated that to be eligible for the post, each candidate had not only to score 50% in each of the four sections but also needed to score at least 50% after the normalisation,” said Sankalp Narain, an Allahabad high court lawyer. Following the process, 2,486 candidates were selected and sent for one-year training in July 2019. At this juncture, writ petitions were filed by those candidates who had scored 50% or more before normalisation but fell short of the minimum criteria after normalisation. They sought quashing of the final list. A Lucknow bench of the Allahabad HC gave judgment in the favour of the latter, stating that “though normalisation is a part of the selection process, ‘50%’ or more raw marks will be treated as eligibility criteria for the applicability of the normalisation process”. The judgment came in October 2019, and in the same month, a Special Leave Petition was filed in the Supreme Court by the selected candidates against the HC order. In June 2020, meanwhile, the training of the selected candidates was completed and they were sent back home, citing the sub judice cases. After hearing the matter, the apex court has, meanwhile, reserved its order. It’s pending since February 2021. It’s been almost a year since the trained SIs were sent back home. They are now facing hardships. Ajit Singh, a resident of Mirzapur, was an assistant loco pilot with the Indian Railways and had given technical resignation for the SI training with the UP Police. “The resignation can be revoked within two years, which is about to expire, but the matter is still sub judice. If I leave the SI job, I will have to pay Rs 4 lakh that the UP government has spent on my training. I do not have that much money. I am about to lose my job with the railways, and, on the other hand, I don't have a posting with the UP police yet.” Aparajit Singh Chauhan, a resident of Panipat in Haryana, is facing a hand-to-mouth situation and is under debts. “I don’t have financial back up and have to toil making both my ends meet. During the training, I had sent my family to our relatives’ place as I was unable to bear the expenses of my family and my daily training. Now, it’s been a year since I am sitting at home with no work.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/nearly-2-5k-trained-up-sub-inspectors-sulking-at-home-as-recruitment-stuck-in-legal-wrangles/articleshow/83070629.cms||Sandeep Rai

In case there is a need to shift them to a hospital, it should be done promptly without wasting time, he said. Over 21,000 doctors had participated in the event. Thackeray said that Covid symptoms are deceptive and that family doctors have a responsibility to properly identify a patient. “We need to be sure that the patient receives proper treatment at home, especially in the primary and middle stages. Doctors should also be careful about when the patient needs to be moved to the hospital,” he said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/monitor-home-quarantined-patients-in-maharashtra-cm/articleshow/83077839.cms||---

So, the state government should cancel the allocation of Rs 2.51 crore to the HR&CE department immediately,” said Kovai Selvaraj, who tweeted and tagged a similar message to Stalin on the day.The AIADMK leader also urged the DMK government to take stringent steps to contain the contagion. “The state government should conduct special camps in villages at ward level to take swab samples from the residents. The government should not allow Covid patients to home quarantine, as they are likely to transmit the virus to other members in the family. Instead, Covid care centres should be created for them on their nearby school premises.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/cancel-rs-2-51cr-allocation-to-hrce-says-aiadmk/articleshow/83073800.cms||---

Yet, the district topped the state in the daily caseload. With 3,188 people getting discharged from various treatment centres on the day, the total number of recovered patients increased to 1,23,446. Presently, the recovery rate stands at 75.5%. The district also logged 20 Covid deaths, which is a 33% drop from the 33 fatalities that it reported on Friday. Among the deceased were two men aged below 40 years - a 32-year-old man without any comorbidities who died three days after admission to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH) and a 35-year-old diabetic man who died in a private hospital in Salem five days after hospitalization. Pointing to the decline in fresh cases in the two consecutive days, officials say the district may just have crossed its peak of the second wave. From 4,734 cases on Thursday, the district has seen the numbers declining to 3,937 on Friday and 3,692 on Saturday. Dr G Ramesh Kumar, former deputy director of public health, said, “Looking at Chennai’s model, cases have already started dipping in the district. It will drop more drastically by the end of next week or June 8. There is a chance for the caseload to dip below 3,000.” District collector S Nagarajan said they had created a 24-hour Covid casualty centre at the Government Arts College with 100 beds with oxygen facilities to improve care for Covid-19 patients. The administration has also renamed Covid care centres with oxygen facilities as Covid oxygen centres. The Covid screening centres at the CMCH and the ESI Hospital have been shifted to St Francis School and Varadharajapuram Corporation High School, respectively. More oxygen expresses passed through the district, unloading more rakes of liquid oxygen. The health minister said the state now has excess oxygen. “We have 650MT oxygen any given day, while we need only 550MT.” The day saw Dr Senthil Kumar succeeding Dr G Ramesh Kumar, who was transferred to Theni, as the deputy director of public health in the district. The neighbouring Tirupur, meanwhile, logged 1,697 new cases of Covid and 20 deaths.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/cases-continue-to-drop-in-dist/articleshow/83073815.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan to scale up oxygen generation to 800MT daily||JAIPUR: The health department on Saturday said availability of oxygen for medical use will be increased in government and private hospitals by setting up oxygen generation plants and installing oxygen concentrators, which can extract 750MT to 800 MT oxygen from the air daily. The need for oxygen during Covid had gone up to 800MT daily. Over the past one year, the state government increased the number of oxygen-supported beds, which pushed up the requirement of oxygen. The number of O2 beds have also been increased from 6,949 to 18,540 in a year, said an official. Besides, the number of ICU beds have increased from 1,778 to 2,913 and the number of ventilators have gone up from 904 to 2,344. Amid fears of a possible third wave, the health department has started preparations. “In the next two months, we are targeting to scale up production of oxygen of up to 800 MT from oxygen generation plants based on oxygen separation from air in private hospitals and government hospitals and also by installing oxygen concentrators,” said a senior health department official. He said they have directed private hospitals having more than 60 beds to install their oxygen plants. Also, the health department has got around 10,000 oxygen concentrators while another 20,000 are in the pipeline. “We are targeting to produce 750 MT to 800MT of oxygen in two months,” said a senior health department official. The health department had to depend majorly on the supply of liquid medical oxygen from the Centre during the second wave of Covid. The health department is targeting to ensure that even the community health centres in rural areas will have facilities of oxygen for patients and for the purpose, the health department is installing oxygen concentrators in community health centres so that patients get immediate oxygen when they need it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/state-to-scale-up-oxygen-generation-to-800mt-daily/articleshow/83073797.cms||---

They are unable to buy chicken meat to prepare food for strays and are forced to buy milk and biscuits, which are twice more expensive. K P Balakrishnan of Saibaba Colony, a member of an informal group of caninophiles, says he feeds 30 strays a day. “I used to buy 2kg chicken for Rs 120, including flesh, bones and fat, cook it with rice and feed them. From Monday, I am buying four litres of milk, which is the only thing available now, to make porridge for dogs. As some dogs are not used to it, I feed them biscuits, which cost me Rs 10 per pack. Now I have to shell out Rs 250 to Rs 300 a day.” Meat shortage has also affected Sumathi, a housekeeping staff at Ramanathapuram, who feeds 30 to 50 dogs near Olympus. “I used to spend Rs 100 to Rs 150 per day to buy chicken for the dogs. But now I spend as much as Rs 200 to Rs 250 to buy branded pet food, milk and biscuits.” Perur-based dog lover S Gowri, who seeks alms to feed the strays outside the temple, says she is also struggling as fish shop in the area are closed. “It was cheaper to buy dry fish or karuvadu to prepare food for strays. It has become difficult to find money for the dogs as I am not allowed to seek alms due to the lockdown.” Stray dogs are starving as garbage bins on roads are empty, says Balakrishnan. “Due to the lockdown, the amount of food dumped on streets has come down. As a result, more dogs are turning up at the feeding time,” he adds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/stray-dog-feeders-struggle-as-meat-shortage-hits-hard/articleshow/83073796.cms||---

The children were playing near the brick kiln in Biharipur village on Delhi-Saharanpur highway, according to police. The man-made pool was overflowing and a deep puddle developed in the vicinity. The three kids were playing in the puddle when they unknowingly moved into the pool which had considerable depth and drowned. It was only after a labourer's child informed the elders nearby that they rushed to the place and got the children out. Mintu Singh, a local villager, said, "The children had strayed into the area and drowned. It was after a while that one of the children playing there informed us and we rushed to the spot. The three kids had died by then." On Saturday, Baraut circle officer Alok Singh said, "We had to face tough resistance from relatives of the kids who had died. They did not want a postmortem. We did a lot of counselling after which they relented." This is the second such incident in a month. On May 7, five children accidentally locked themselves inside a car. Four of them died of suffocation. The tragic incident took place in Baghpat's Sangoli Taga village under Chandinagar police station. The children aged between four and eight got inside the parked car, but could not come out.

According to the police, the incident occurred when the 17-year-old stepped out of her home to meet the accused, who is a resident of Dharmaram village located roughly 15 km away from Sitaram Thanda. The two, believed to be in a relationship, went to an isolated spot where the boy assaulted her sexually. The girl suffered seizures in the process and started bleeding from her private parts. When the girl fell unconscious, the accused panicked and called his friend, who happens to be a relative of the victim. “They took the girl to a registered medical practitioner (RMP), who declared her brought dead,’’ said superintendent of police, Nandhyala Koti Reddy. “By that time some villagers also gathered there and handed over the boy to the police,” the SP added. Police said that while the accused, during interrogation, claimed that he was unaware of how the girl died, he was charged with murder since the minor’s family members alleged that she was murdered. Her parents claimed that the 22-year-old forcibly took the victim to an isolated place and raped and murdered her. The girl was a degree first year student. The accused has been booked under Sections 376 (rape), 302 (punishment for murder) of the IPC and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.

While the district administration had announced that the vaccination drive would begin only at 11am, the residents started to gather in front of PHCs and other centres as early as 5.30am to get tokens for the vaccines. However, many PHCs were yet to receive the vaccines even 30 minutes after the scheduled time. While some of them had Covaxin doses in stock, they refused to administer them on the people aged below 45 years as a first dose. At the PSG Rural primary school, the queue for token was seen for a distance of 200 metres from its main gate at 9am. While the queue got longer, the drive hadn’t begun even at 11.40am. Things weren’t different at the PHC at KK Pudur, where the assigned 300 doses of Covishield hadn’t arrived even at noon. “There is a huge demand for Covishield among the people aged above and below 45 years. But stocks are yet to arrive. We have already issued 100 tokens,” said a staffer at the PHC. Long queues were also seen at Ramanathapuram PHC, Seethalakshmi hospital and Thudiyalur PHC. After waiting for hours in the queue, people stopped following social distancing and hand hygiene, and started to touch walls, benches, tables and poles. A 52-year-old woman, who was waiting at Kavundampalayam PHC, said, “The doctor says they will give preference only to the people coming for their second shot. How long will we have to wait to see if they have extra doses?” At the KK Pudur PHC, the staff and doctors asked the people aged above 45 years to come back on Monday to get Covishield as the first or second dose. “Many of them haven’t completed 84 days after the first dose. They give us a false date and when we check the system, their first dose certificates can’t be found,” said a staff nurse at the PHC on Raja Street. “We don’t know for sure if they have taken the first shot. Hence, we now insist on an SMS or their first shot certificate.” Watch Covid-19: Shortage of vaccines hamper vaccination drive in Coimbatore||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/vaccine-shortage-plagues-district/articleshow/83073816.cms||---

As many as 9,984 residential units were launched in Hyderabad out of the total 21,963 units launched in these four cities, putting Bengaluru at second spot with a 34% share in new launches, followed by Chennai and Kolkata with a 14% and 7% share, respectively, said the report titled ‘Connect Q1 2021’. According to the report, affordable and mid-segment housing accounted for a chunk of the new launches during the quarter. “While the second and third quarter of the previous year had seen lockdown affecting the number of new launches in the city with migration of labour being one of the major concerns, the year-end saw the market improving substantially as developers resumed their plans of launching their projects. The full-scale resumption of construction activities and positive buyer sentiment has contributed to the rise in the number of new launches during Q1 2021,” Vestian said. When it comes to new office space completions too, Hyderabad led the way with 48% share with 3.9 million sq ft out of the total 8.2 million sq ft new office space completions in five major cities that included Mumbai, Bengaluru, Kolkata and Chennai. Hyderabad was followed by Bengaluru with 41% share (3.4 msft) and Mumbai with 10% share (0.8 msft) and Kolkata with just 1% share (0.1 msft). In Q1 2020, Bengaluru was streets ahead of Hyderabad in terms of new office space completions at 3.9 million sq ft vis a vis 1 million sq ft, and Mumbai had 2 million sq ft. However, when it comes to office space absorption, Hyderabad lagged behind Bengaluru and Mumbai. The five major cities clocked a total office space absorption of 7 million sq ft, a 23% drop over Q1 of 2020. The report said that though the office space demand in the Hyderabad market slowed down nearly 21% in Q1 2021 with an absorption of 1.3 msft as compared to 1.64 msft in Q1 2020, the city’s office market is expected to gain momentum with a large quantum of pre-committed space getting operational shortly. It also said that the west region comprising Hi-Tec City and Gachibowli continued to attract occupiers and accounted for a major share of the leasing activity during the quarter with IT/ITeS sector leading the demand and flexible space operators too accounting for several deals during the quarter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyd-pips-bluru-chennai-in-new-housing-launches-report/articleshow/83074887.cms||---

The state government is in touch with the Centre to procure the anti-fungal drug.” Antifungal medication Amphotericin B is now being procured by the centre and distributed to states based on the number of patients infected. Speaking about Tirupur, which has 16,894 active Covid-19 cases, Subramanian said the district still has 1,000 vacant beds and thus there was no need for panic. “There are 16,000 vaccine doses in the district storage unit which will be administered soon. Of the 95.59 lakh doses we have received so far, 82.41 lakh have been administered. We have around six lakh doses for the 45 years and above age group and around two lakh doses left for the 18-44 age group, which will be administered soon,” he said. “Revenue, health and police departments have been instructed to carefully monitor if any industries are functioning discreetly despite the lockdown and take strict action. The chief minister will visit the district on Sunday and inaugurate a 110-bed facility with oxygen at Tirupur GH and 20 car ambulances, which would pick up patients who test positive and take them to GH or triage centres,” the minister added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/28-black-fungus-cases-in-tirupur/articleshow/83073814.cms||---

---||Pune||Pune: Empty roads key reason for speeding among motorists||PUNE: Empty roads due to the Covid-19 restrictions is one of the key reasons for speeding among vehicle users in Pune, traffic experts have said, while blaming the urge for joy rides, racing and enjoying music while riding as among the other factors. “Speeding should not happen. If motorists are involved in speeding and are using alternative routes to avoid nakabandi points, then we will check CCTV cameras and start taking action against them as per the law,” Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta told TOI. Deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Rahul Shrirame said, “The problem of speeding can be checked by creating massive awareness and self-discipline. Action against speeding motorists is being taken even if they slow down at nakabandi points. The problem is also rampant on Pune-Satara and Pune-Bengaluru highways. We have installed two inceptor vehicles with speed guns for taking action against erring motorists driving at high speed at Katraj tunnel and Narhe bridge.” He said a majority of traffic personnel have tested positive for Covid-19, while others are assisting local police stations in taking action against people not wearing masks and other Covid-related duties. Retired IPS officer Rajendra Sonawane said, “Empty roads, coupled with fewer vehicles, have become a runway for speeding vehicles. Riders don’t have the fear of the law. The police should make good use of CCTV cameras and speed guns for taking action against motorists indulging in such behaviour.” Sonawane said the police should start impounding vehicles and confiscating driving licences of errant motorists till the restrictions were in place. “Mobile courts should be set up for on-the-spot fines. These measures will act as deterrent and curb the problem of speeding to a larger extent. The regional transport office (RTO) should be instructed to strictly enforce the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act and rules in larger public interest,” he said. Rajendra Sidhaye, founder chairman of Save Pune Traffic Movement, suggested that the police should plan a strategy for taking action against motorists ‘anytime and anywhere’. “The violators should know that police will get them and that they cannot take situation for granted. While manning important chowks/junctions, the police should take action relating to speeding and wrong-side driving in adjoining areas. These measures will deter motorists from indulging in such risky behaviour,” Sidhaye said. Nilesh Sonagra, secretary of the Nagar Road Citizens Forum, said, “Most two-wheeler riders involved in speeding also tend to ride without helmet. Online delivery boys are also seen driving in high speed because they are in a hurry to deliver food packets and grocery items to their customers on time. It has been seen that the delivery vehicles are over filled with grocery products and driving in high speed can cause accidents, endangering their life and that of others.” Sonagra said, “The delivery boys need to be counselled. Traffic signals between Vimannagar and Kharadi should be made operational to avoid signal jumping. Police presence on roads need to be increased to curb speeding among motorists.” Maithali Manakawada, secretary of Wanowrie residents’ association, said, “Most roads don’t have speed limit signs. These must be displayed before penalising motorists. Heavy penalty for over speeding vehicles and surprise radar checking by traffic police are the immediate measures.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/empty-roads-key-reason-for-speeding-among-motorists/articleshow/83073821.cms||Asseem Shaikh
---||Chennai||Rs 5 lakh for kids orphaned due to Covid-19, edu aid till graduation||CHENNAI: The state government on Saturday announced that children who lost their parents to coronavirus will be provided an assistance of Rs 5 lakh. The state will also bear their education expenses till graduation. The decision was taken at a high-level meeting chaired by chief minister M K Stalin at the secretariat on Saturday. “The state government will sponsor the education of these children including tuition fee and hostel fee. They will get priority in government homes and hostels. They would receive the amount with interest after they attain 18 years of age,” the release said. For children who had lost one of their parents, the government will give Rs 3 lakh as a relief to the family. “If they are under the care of relatives or guardian or in government homes or hostels, they would receive Rs 3,000 per month towards maintenance till they complete 18 years,” a government order said. The state government will monitor the disbursement of relief to these children and their education through a special committee to be set up at district level. These students and single parents will get priority in welfare schemes. If the child was raised by a single parent and he or she had lost that parent in the pandemic, then the state government will deposit Rs 5 lakh in the name of the child, it added. The government said it would form a committee consisting of the finance secretary, social welfare department secretary and NGOs to frame the guidelines for the same. In the release, the state government said it had already formed a task force headed by district collectors to identify children orphaned by Covid-19 and distribute the relief. Child rights activists welcomed the announcement of the special package. “Usually, the relatives will send the kids to government homes if they lost both their parents. But giving monthly maintenance to relatives and guardians, will help these children to grow in a family environment which is familiar to them,” said Andrew Sesuraj, state convenor, Tamil Nadu Child Rights Watch. He also requested the state government to give the responsibility of monitoring the children to village-level child monitoring committees. “The announcement will help the children who are affected by Covid-19 to continue their education. The maintenance allowance will help to keep the children under non-institutional care,” said Virgil D’Sami, executive director of Arunodhaya Centre for Street and Working Children. She further said ensuring the aid reaching children is also important.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/rs-5-lakh-for-kids-orphaned-due-to-covid-19-edu-aid-till-graduation/articleshow/83073819.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

He was speaking to reporters after inspecting the Covid control room at the city corporation’s main office at Town Hall along with forest minister K Ramachandran. The minister said the city corporation was collecting about 5,000 samples daily from its limits for Covid-19 testing. The city corporation limits, where about 18 lakh people reside, daily see a caseload of 1,500 to 1,800 on an average. He said the civic body had been taking all the necessary steps to contain the virus spread. “It has been regularly conducting door-to-door survey to identify the people with Covid-19 symptoms. There are 7,500 streets and five lakh houses in the corporation limits and the survey teams have already covered 1,244 streets and 1.21 lakh houses so far.” Sakkarapani said there were 524 containment zones in the corporation limits and they were being disinfected with 43 vehicles. “The corporation had distributed 2,938 medical kits on Friday alone and deployed an official and a volunteer for every containment zone to address the needs of people there.” Pointing out that the number of cases had come down by 800 in the district on Friday, the minister expressed hope that the caseload would continue to drop. “Public should not step out of their houses unnecessarily. To distribute vegetables and fruits at their doorsteps, the city corporation has granted permission to 2,537 vehicles. At least 1,645 private vehicles, 70 corporation vehicles and 200 agriculture department vehicles are together selling 180 metric tonnes of vegetables a day.” Sakkarapani said chief minister M K Stalin would visit the district on Sunday and conduct a review meeting with officials. “He will also flag off 10 vehicles per zone to transport patients to hospitals from their houses.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/will-deploy-more-staff-for-door-to-door-survey-min/articleshow/83073817.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Alert issued on rising water level in rivers||KOCHI: Ahead of the arrival of the southwest monsoon, most likely by May 31, the Kerala state disaster management authority has issued alerts warning of rise in river water levels in Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Pathanamthitta, Alappuzha and Kottayam districts. Following regular rainfall for the past two weeks, the central water commission (CWC) has been issuing warnings for rivers where the levels have crossed or touched the danger mark based on the data received by the CWC’s monitoring stations. The water level at the Kallooppara monitoring station in Manimalayar has risen to 5.98m against the warning level of 5m. People living on the river banks have been advised to be cautious. Similarly, the water level in Malakkara in the Pamba river in Pathanamthitta district touched 7m which is the danger level. The highest flood level attained is 9.58m on August 16, 2018. The Achankovil river in Thumpamon in Pathanamthitta is flowing at a level of 10.12m, which is above the danger level of 10m and 3.62m below its previous highest flood level of 13.735m. Meanwhile, water is being released from Malankara, Kuttiyadi, Karapuzha, Siruvani, Kallada, Chimoni, Kanjirapuzha, Mariyar, Bhoothathankettu, Moolathara and Pazhassi irrigation reservoirs to keep it within the safe levels. The weather department has said that conditions are likely to become favourable for the onset of southwest monsoon on May 31. The monsoon is in the Maldives-Comorin region, Sri Lanka and southern and eastern parts of the Bay of Bengal. Yellow alert has been sounded for Alappuzha and Ernakulam districts on Saturday, while Alappuzha, Kottayam, Ernakulam, Idukki and Thrissur are likely to receive isolated heavy rainfall of 7-11cm on Sunday. Thunderstorm with lightning accompanied by gusty wind speed reaching 30-40 kmph is very likely to occur at one or two places in Kerala till June 1.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/alert-issued-on-rising-water-level-in-rivers/articleshow/83081366.cms||---
---||Mumbai||IIT Hyderabad develops oral amphotericin B to treat black fungus||MUMBAI: The Indian Institute of Technology-Hyderabad has developed nanofibre-based, controlled-release oral tablets of amphotericin B (AmB) to treat post-Covid fungal infections. Researchers have kept the technology free of intellectual property rights and are looking for pharmaceutical partners who can take up mass-scale production. Currently AmB is an injectible drug. In 2019, faculty members Saptarshi Majumdar and Chandra Shekhar Sharma from the department of chemical engineering had released a study about oral nanofibrous AmB to be effective for kala azar, a parasitic ailment that can cause fever, weight loss and swelling of the liver or the spleen. This is a first-ever attempt to fabricate nanofibrous oral tablets of amphotericin B for the potential cure of leishmaniasis or kala azar. With two years of advancement of examination, the researchers say they are confident the technology can be transferred to suitable pharma partners for large-scale production. At present, kala azar treatment is being used to treat black and other fungi in the country and its availability and affordability make it necessary to allow emergency and immediate trial of this oral drug. “Due to its amphiphilic nature, the AmB has poor aqueous solubility and forms aggregates in the system, which stresses renal filtration and thus causes nephrotoxicity. This is the reason the oral administration has abstained, despite being the most comfortable and effective route,” said professor Majumdar. Stressing on the need for pharma companies to come forward, Sharma said, “The main idea behind our research is to find a solution to serve society. The technology developed is made free from IP, so that it can be mass-produced and is affordable and available to the public at large. We can be reached via our public & corporate relations.” In the present research funded by DST-Nanomission, a team led by Majumdar and Sharma along with their PhD scholars Mrunalini Gaydhane and Anindita Laha intended to deliver AmB orally at an extremely slow rate, albeit within the therapeutic window. The purpose was to increase the drug absorption and reduce aggregation, to lower the drug toxicity. For this, the team selected gelatin, an FDA-approved polymer as an excipient for drug molecules. Further, as the gastrointestinal tract contains different enzymes which hydrolyse the polymers, the team checked and confirmed the enzymatic stability of the tablet in pepsin. The main concern with high drug loading was if it imposes nephrotoxicity. To ensure this, the team has carried out a cell viability assay (MTT assay) against human kidney fibroblast cells which showed no evidence of cell toxicity caused by AmB as well as a minute amount of Glutaraldehyde crosslinker.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-iit-hyderabad-develops-oral-amphotericin-b-to-treat-black-fungus/articleshow/83077894.cms||Hemali Chhapia

---||Hyderabad||Eureka! Winged termites yield breakthrough nanoparticles||HYDERABAD: A medical wonder was discovered from a rather unusual source__Mang Mao (winged termites) insects. Research done on the (shed) wings of the insects collected on Osmania University (OU) campus have yielded silver nanoparticles, which have anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties. These insects get attracted to light during the monsoon. Antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of silver nanoparticles might have applications in biomedical and agricultural sectors. The researchers, from OU and other institutes, found that the (nano) particles were also effective against bacteria like ‘Staphylococcus aureus’. So far, biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles are from plant extracts, seaweeds, micro-organisms and metabolites. The study, ‘Silver Nanoparticles from Insect Wing Extract: Biosynthesis and Evaluation for Antioxidant and Antimicrobial Potential’, has been published in ‘Plos One’ journal recently. Researchers Parameshwar Jakinala, Nageshwar Lingampally, Bee Hameeda from the OU department of microbiology; RZ Sayyed from Maharasthra; Yahya Khan M from Kalam Biotech, Hyderabad; Elsayed Ahmed Elsayed and Hesham El Enshasy from Egypt carried out the study to explore an eco-friendly, cost-effective and novel biomaterial for bio fabrication of silver nanoparticles. According to the researchers, wing termites are abundant in occurrence and rich in proteins, polysaccharides and lipids. These social insects are classified into three groups — soldiers, workers and queen . After a heavy rain, the winged termites fly out in huge numbers during nights and get close to lights. The next day, they shed their wings and die due to lack of moisture. Mang Mao insects are nutrient-rich and are consumed in several Asian countries, including rural areas in India. They are also used to feed chicken, fish and birds. The shed wings of the insects were collected from OU campus, washed with distilled water to remove dust and stored at room temperature in air-tight containers. The researchers said: “Silver nanoparticles extracted from the insect wings exhibit strong antioxidant (around 66 to 87%) activities. These particles have antimicrobial activities with a maximum zone of inhibition against ‘Staphylococcus aureus’, the bacteria causing skin diseases and affects other body parts, and fungus ‘Fusarium oxysporum’, which causes disease in plants. Antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of silver nanoparticles may have applications in biomedical and agricultural sectors,” they said in their study.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/eureka-winged-termites-yield-breakthrough-nanoparticles/articleshow/83074927.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

Rumour mills are abuzz that some BJP leaders were successful in convincing Eatala to join the saffron party and seek a re-election from Huzurabad. But neither the BJP nor Eatala has made a formal announcement about it. BJP leaders said it would be a tough task to pull off a victory in the by-poll to Huzurabad where BJP’s vote share was less than one per cent in 2018, but did not out rule out the possibility of edging out the pink party if the candidate is a formidable one such as Eatala or one of his family members. Though the saffron party had polled just 1683 votes, less than NOTA which got 2,867 votes in 2018 Assembly elections to Huzurabad, Bandi Sanjay of the saffron party had polled over 24,000 votes from this Assembly segment in the Lok Sabha elections held to Karimnagar seat in 2019. This has given high hopes to the BJP cadre in the assembly segment. A lot of water has flowed down the bridge since 2018 polls. BJP has emerged as a strong party since then with its win in Dubbak and good performance in the GHMC elections. Eatala has his own vote bank too, as he has developed a strong support base in the constituency over the years. Despite the ruling TRS going all out to weaken Eatala and wean away his followers and supporters from him into the ruling party, his loyalists are openly coming out in support of their leader. Sources close to Eatala did not rule out the possibility of one of his family members being fielded from Huzurabad if the situation warranted. Chief spokesperson of the BJP’s state unit, K Krishna Saagar Rao said any legislator of other political party has to resign from his MLA’s post first, if they were to join BJP ranks. “It is too premature to talk about the electoral contest and candidature at this point of time, when even his joining is not yet confirmed officially. However, as a political party, BJP will benefit and has nothing to lose, when any mass leader from another party chooses to join,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/saffron-party-eyes-eatala-but-huzurabad-still-a-distant-coup/articleshow/83073827.cms||Roushan Ali

Faizabad businessman Shamshad Khan was brought by road in a cardiac ambulance on April 26 when, two days after he was detected with Covid-19, his oxygen saturation dipped to 70.  They are not the only ones who rushed to the financial capital for medical help when struck with Covid-19 or post-Covid complications, doctors across Mumbai say that patients from outside Maharashtra are coming in increasing numbers. As Shamshad Khan’s brother Rizwan, a Powai resident, puts it: “We had no option but to shell out Rs 1 lakh for the ambulance ride to get him here. There were no oxygen support beds or ventilators available in Faizabad when my brother got serious.’’  Bombay Hospital’s Dr Gautam Bhansali, who coordinates between BMC and private hospitals on Covid care, said he has had 27 outstation patents in two months. Earlier in the week, a patient from Indore with a CT scan score of 24/25 came to Bombay Hospital via an air ambulance. The emergence of mucormycosis has perhaps added to the ‘rush’. Husain had barely recovered from Covid and hadn’t enough time to grieve for his wife’s death from the same disease when the “pain’’ started. “My tooth was aching and there was a weird itch near my nostrils,’’ he said. He got the diagnosis of mucormycosis on May 18, almost a month after he was diagnosed with Covid in Srinagar, and within 24 hours he boarded a stop-over flight to Mumbai. “My friend who knows Dr Bhansali advised me to rush here,’’ said Husain, who got discharged two days back.  While Mumbai is viewed as the Mecca of healthcare in India, talk of ‘Mumbai model’ perhaps prompted many serious patients to rush here. “We didn’t see such a response after the first wave,’’ said Dr Bhansali.  Patients from interiors of the state have always come to Mumbai for treatment. In fact, most of the 40-odd mucormycosis patients admitted in Nair Hospital, near Mumbai Central, are from outside Mumbai. Dr Rahul Pandit, who heads the ICU at Fortis Hospital, Mulund, said many young patients under 45 have travelled from Jalgaon and Nagpur to his hospital. He said many young had severe Covid during the second wave and needed ventilator support that is now accessible in Mumbai.  Dr Abid Sayed from Sai Hospitals said 10 patients came to his Chembur and Dharavi hospitals from Goa, Bhopal Varanasi and Ayodhya. “Most are young, with severe Covid lungs,’’ he said. Shamshad Khan from Faizabad had a CT scan score of 17/25 when admitted to the Dharavi hospital; Khan was discharged after 25 days and continues on oxygen support at home. “The earliest he can go home is July,’’ said his brother Rizwan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/2nd-wave-many-rushing-to-mumbai-city-for-treatment/articleshow/83077938.cms||Malathy Iyer

Despite the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) providing adequate funds for the work, it continued to lag behind schedule without any justifiable reason. Lack of proper monitoring by the government is the main reason for the contractors delaying the work. Even after the Inkel, the special purpose vehicle (SPV) for the project, served notices for showing the cause of the delay, the contractor managed to secure extension citing lame excuses. After repeated warnings failing to make any positive result, the contractor was terminated in December 2020. Though the fresh tender for identifying new contractor was started in March, the financial bid of the tender couldn’t be opened so far. “It was due to the restrictions as part of model code of conduct in connection with the assembly elections that we couldn’t open the financial bid. We have now got the permission for opening the financial bid. We will be opening it in a day or two,” an official associated with the project said. The major two reasons for the delay in carrying out the project can be attributed to lack of political patronage and involvement of multiple agencies. Health department is the owner of the CCRC project. But the government appointed Inkel as the SPV. The funding is by KIIFB. “A decision regarding the implementation of the project should be vetted by all these agencies. Lack of political patronage is another hurdle. Now that the district has got a minister, we are hopeful there may be a political patron for the project,” another official who is part of the project implementation team said. P Rajeev, the new industries minister, got elected from Kalamassery constituency under the limits of which CCRC is located. Even if the work on the structure is resumed within a couple of months, it will take at least two years for opening the CCRC. The fresh tender invited is for completing the structure of the CCRC. The tender for mechanical, electrical and plumbing (MEP) works is yet to be floated. The procurement of medical equipment required for the CCRC has been entrusted with Kerala Medical Services Corporation Ltd (KMSCL). Many of the machines are to be imported. Similarly, the work on the super specialty block of the Government Medical College Hospital, Ernakulam, also got delayed due to a dispute with the contractor. The work on the structure of the super specialty block, which should have been completed by October 2020, has registered a progress of just around 65% so far. The work on the MEP has not begun yet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ccrc-work-lags-behind-due-to-lack-of-proper-monitoring/articleshow/83072452.cms||M K Sunil Kumar
---||Hyderabad||‘Hyd market certain to bounce back in 3-6 mths’||Hyderabad: Despite challenges thrown up by the pandemic, the city continues to be a lucrative destination for property investments, said panellists speaking at The Times of India’s virtual conclave – Hyderabad Real Estate: Building confidence among home buyers during Covid 2.0 -- on Saturday. “Post Covid-19, people have realised the importance of a home. So, if anything, they are seen making faster decisions now, when it comes to investing in property,” said Ravinder Reddy, chairman of Janapriya Engineers Syndicate, confident of the market growing, indications of a third wave notwithstanding. Agreed Sandip Patnaik, managing director, JLL (Telangana and AP) referring to the last three years’ statistics. “During this period, cost of homes in Hyderabad went up by 40% to 50%. And while the annual increment of the salaried class (80% of the customer base) remained restricted to single-digit numbers, sales figures shot up exponentially. This only shows the trust buyers have in the market,” he said. Terming the second wave as just a “brief pause in the market’s recovery”, Nanda Kishore, managing director of Ramky Estates & Farms Pvt Ltd said that the quest for better living coupled with Hyderabad’s competitive pricing is certain to keep drawing consumers to its shore. Other reasons: reduced home loan rates and lack of job cuts. “If you see closely, there haven’t been large-scale layoffs this time around. That’s also a positive for the market,” said R Suresh Kumar, senior vice-president (business operations), Prestige Group, Hyderabad. In fact, buyers are now looking at investing in larger spaces, said Sumanth Reddy. “There is more demand for 3BHKs with people working from home and children attending school from home,” said the immediate past president of the National Association of Realtors confident of this trend continuing even in the future. Another trend that developers are certain will see growth in Hyderabad is affordable housing. “It is only here that we can achieve the price point – of Rs 35 lakh to Rs 40 lakh – and will, therefore, see more such projects take shape,” said Abishek Chanda, director, Vasavi Group that’s doing such a project in Bachupally. Given the current optimism in the market, V Aditya Reddy, executive director of Sri Aditya Homes advised buyers to go ahead with their plans – a thought seconded by Dayanand Reddy, director of TNR Group. “This is a buyer’s market with assured returns. Nobody will lose money,” he said. The event was presented by TOI in association with Sri Aditya Homes, Janapriya Group, TNR Group, Vasavi Group, Ramky Estates & Farms Ltd and Pranava Group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyd-market-certain-to-bounce-back-in-3-6-mths/articleshow/83073856.cms||---
---||Nagpur||‘Covid-appropriate behaviour, enhanced vaccine drive will delay or diminish impact of 3rd wave’||Epidemiologist and physician Dr Sanjay Zodpey is vice-president of the public health foundation of India, New Delhi. He is also director at the Indian institute of public health, Delhi. A resident of Nagpur, Dr Zodpey did his MBBS, MD and PhD from the GMCH. He also worked as professor at the department of preventive and social medicine and faculty in the clinical epidemiology unit. In November 2020, he was featured in the prestigious world rankings of the top 2% scientists. He has been advising the NMC and the divisional commissioner since the outbreak of the pandemic in March 2020. In an exclusive interview with TOI, Dr Zodpey spoke about the Covid scenario and the probable third wave.Q. Your predictions for the third wave?A. Difficult to predict the timing and magnitude. However, we can say with reasonable certainty that it will depend upon factors like Covid-appropriate behaviour, herd immunity, vaccination coverage, role of viral mutants and the health system’s preparedness. Successful implementation of several public health interventions could help us to prevent or minimize the impact of the third wave in the district. Q. In what way can Covid-appropriate behaviour help?A. Infectious diseases like Covid spread among the immunologically naïve and susceptible population. This means that once we reduce the stringency of the lockdown and start opening up, it is possible that the number of cases would start increasing, especially among the unvaccinated and susceptible population. We may want to call this the third wave, but this is the core characteristic of infectious diseases. With public meetings at weddings, religious, social and sports events and even market places, the transmission of the disease goes up drastically, especially among susceptible individuals. Therefore, it is recommended that everyone must consistently ensure that they and family members practice Covid-appropriate behaviour — proper use of mask, frequent hand washing, avoidance of crowded and closed spaces with poor ventilation and physical distancing. Q. Are we close to herd immunity because of the second wave?A. Over the last few months, a certain proportion of the population has suffered from the natural infection resulting in either symptomatic or asymptomatic diseases. Many have received one or two doses of the vaccine. Both these groups have some level of immune protection. However, there will be great variation in the level of herd immunity achieved in different geographic areas within the district. It may be higher in urban areas as compared to rural areas. There will be certain pockets where more number of people are still susceptible to the infection. As an epidemiologist, I would want to look at the seroprevalence data to understand what proportion of the population has protective levels of antibodies. Though the natural infection confers immunity, we still do not know the scale of the seroconversion at the population level because of disease transmission in the district. What we have is data from previous sero surveys. There is a high probability that after the second wave the proportion of population which has seroconverted because of symptomatic disease or asymptomatic infection would have increased. Also, the vaccination drive that we have seen in the past few weeks would have resulted into a large proportion of population being protected by virtue of antibodies in their blood. However, as we know that the transmission of the disease is quite heterogenous across geographical areas, socio-economic groups, occupations and age groups, it is advisable that we now conduct a wide scale sero survey in the district to assess the current level of protection at the community level and identify pockets at high risk. Vaccination is the most important tool that we have to defeat. However, despite a certain level of herd immunity, we still have a significant proportion of population which is vulnerable to the infection. In addition, several people are at high risk because of their age, co-morbidities and occupational status. This section of population needs to be protected with vaccines through massive scaling up of the vaccination drive. It is important to emphasize that availability of the vaccine must be ensured at the designated health facilities and that citizens should come forward to get themselves vaccinated, as and when their turn comes. Our speed of vaccination is crucial for protecting the population and achieving safe levels of herd immunity. It is also important to note that vaccinated individuals are also at some risk of development of the disease, although significantly reduced risk as compared to unvaccinated individuals. Hence, it is recommended that even vaccinated individuals along with unvaccinated ones must practice Covid-appropriate behaviour to protect themselves until the pandemic is under complete control. Q. There is also lot of discussion regarding mutants and variants.A. With each new infection, the virus is exposed to a new host and its genetic environment and the viral multiplication within the host gives rise to new progeny and with each replication cycle, there is high probability of mutation. This is especially true for mRNA viruses such as SARSCOV2, which is what is giving rise to mutant strains. Furthermore, we know that some variants of concern also called mutants are circuiting in the population which may lead to a spike in cases and deaths. We need to conduct research to understand their behaviour. The enhanced surveillance through testing and genomic sequencing is necessary to detect mutants at the earliest stage before they create problems at the population level. Ideally, at least 1% of the samples must be tested for genomic sequencing to detect any emerging variants, which may be of concern. However, the good news coming from research studies is that two doses of the vaccine are providing a sufficient level of protection and immunity against these circulating strains. This means that we definitely need to scale up our vaccination efforts massively to quickly vaccinate a majority of our population. This will also help us in preventing new infections and emergence of new mutants. If the virus mutates and new variants are more transmissible and virulent, then it will certainly affect the magnitude of the next wave. Q. Any suggestions for the administration to improve the healthcare system?A. I have closely observed that the district administration since the start of the pandemic. They have done a commendable job in prevention, control and mitigation of this pandemic. We have had our fair share of successes and failures, and we have emerged stronger and more resilient after this second wave. One of the most important interventions to prevent further waves is to massively scale up vaccination in the district. Over the last few months, there has been upgradation of testing and treatment infrastructure, including availability of beds and core commodities such as oxygen, medicines and other necessary items. Going forward, we need to keep strengthening our healthcare system to ensure access to testing and treatment. We also need to keep an eye on the trend of the new infections as we open up to maintain business continuity and bring back economic and social life. We may consider a staggered approach in this regard. Ten percent of the district population has already contracted the disease. The first and second wave were harsher in Nagpur city as compared to rural areas of the district. Hence, urban area would have achieved a higher level of herd immunity as compared to rural areas. As rural areas would have more susceptible people, the next wave may be harsher for them. However, it will also depend on vaccination coverage and practice of Covid-appropriate behaviour. In order to ensure that health infrastructure remains resilient, especially in rural areas, we need to invest more resources as the possibility of the third wave affecting the rural population and rural households remains high. This can be ensured by improving testing and treatment facilities as well as by ensuring emergency transport services. Finally, a high level of vaccination coverage in rural areas remains a high priority. Q. What should citizens do to prevent or minimize the third wave?A. Citizens are equal stakeholders in the disease control efforts along with the government. They should adhere to Covid-appropriate behaviour. Another important way to protect oneself is to get vaccinated and motivate family members, friends, relatives and colleagues to do the same. All the available vaccines are safe and effective. If someone has Covid symptoms then they should get tested as soon as possible, isolate themselves and seek early treatment. Communities, especially in our country, have a legacy of supporting each other in times of difficulty. In the present context, we have seen several good examples of neighbours, community groups helping affected families in various ways. This positive behaviour should continue and each one of us should take the responsibility of helping those who might need our attention and assistance. These community efforts will support our government’s endeavor to minimize the impact of the disease on our society.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-appropriate-behaviour-enhanced-vaccine-drive-will-delay-or-diminish-impact-of-3rd-wave/articleshow/83073891.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Video calls between horses & owners cure separation anxiety||At this point in the pandemic, Zoom fatigue or the exhaustion one feels after any kind of video call or conference is universal. But for some it’s been a source of much joy and comfort they never knew they needed until their horse joined them for a virtual meeting from their barn. Unlike other pet parents for whom their dog or cat curled up next to them has provided additional comfort through the isolating times, it’s been different for horse owners separated from their four-legged friends navigating a new normal in their stables. To alleviate this separation anxiety, horse owners have been facetiming with their steeds stationed in their wooden shed at the Amateurs Riders’ Club in Mahalaxmi Racecourse that has been taking care of over 150 thoroughbred horses since last year March. While it might not necessarily be a very successful “conversation” with their horse for they may not be able to reminisce about the good old times of getting fed carrots or being petted after a good ride, it seems the horses too feel comforted by the virtual sights and sounds — their ears perking up almost instantly and their front legs pawing the stable door — which the vets agree can do wonders for the well-being of the horses and owners alike. Uncle Scrooge is a little less grumpy these days after Hemang Goradia decided to bring his eight-year-old bay thoroughbred into his drawing room in Chowpatty over once-a-week video calls. While Uncle Scrooge may stare at the screen when his groom holds up the phone and is unlikely to comprehend the moving images on a tiny cell phone screen, Goradia feels certain that his horse is reacting to his voice. “In the previous lockdown I had installed a CCTV camera to keep an eye on him but due to network issues, I switched to video calling. This also allows Uncle Scrooge to experience a connection with me. I can’t give him his usual treat of jaggery after a ride but at least I can call out his name,” he says. Prakash Mehta, who has had a particularly close and gentle relationship with his horses Pepper and Golden Tower — he calls his “partners, not pets” — describes why it is essential for riders to find ways to maintain the bond with their horses just like they would with family and friends despite social distancing. “They don’t know about the cheque exchange between buyer and seller or you as their owner. Horses, like humans, are emotional creatures. What matters to them is companionship. If you don’t cuddle them or look them in the eye, you will never be dear to him,” says Mehta who delights in his horses’ reactions when he realises they are actively looking for him. “Pepper is someone with lots of attitude. He will snort or bob his head when he hears me calling out his name while Golden Tower is a feisty female. If she’s in a corner of the stable, she’ll turn around and flutter her eyes when she hears me call,” he says. Also, their human owners aren’t the only ones struggling to get their pre-pandemic bodies back after gaining the notorious lockdown weight. With equestrian events cancelled and riders restricted from the racecourse, the horses — used to three hours of galloping around with their riders in a day — are currently largely confined to their stables. Reduced activities during lockdown have meant loss of muscle and fitness on one hand and behavioural issues caused by boredom, on the other. “Some will start fights, bite each other and kick the fence when they’re bored. Like kids, they also get excited and start eating voraciously when they’re restless,” says Dr Pandurang Sawandkar, the club’s veterinarian. Mehernosh Patel who would go mounting on Romeo everyday until last year’s lockdown recalls seeing how his halfbred looker had gained weight after a three-month break, as he sat in his car and watched Romeo from a distance, careful “not to raise the animal’s expectations” of regular meetings with his non-equine friend. “He was a disciplined horse but due to lack of working out, he had put on weight. We cut down his feed,” says Patel. To help the horses slim down, the vets have cut down around 40 percent of the animals’ daily intake of green grass barley and oats while the grooms are making sure they carve out enough time for daily walk, trot and canter. Given the demand for video calls with horses, the Club is now in the process of installing CCTV cameras across different corners of the sheds. “It will help owners check on their horses round the clock. We’ve covered half the stables and for the horses, we are planning to add speakers to pipe music into the stable in the coming days. In the west, they play music played in the barn to calm the horses and maybe we could do the same and break up their boredom,” said Chandan Tak, special events chairman at ARC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-video-calls-between-horses-owners-cure-separation-anxiety/articleshow/83075022.cms||Mohua Das
---||Pune||Pune: Interior designers in demand for that workplace feel at home||PUNE: Many people are seeking interior designers’ help to make their homes work-conducive with more and more companies are prolonging the WFH arrangement in the time of the Covid pandemic. “When work from home (WFH) was seen as a stop-gap arrangement following the outbreak of the Covid pandemic last year, many people bought portable tables or brought office chairs home for a temporary set-up. But with the work-from-home stint extending long term, there is a high demand for creating a permanent work space at home,” said interior designer Shalini Agarwal. A major challenge for the interior designers to meet the high demand is the lockdown-like-restrictions and curfew timings in the city. “It’s becoming increasingly difficult to make the right purchases and getting workers on time. Besides, the expense on the workforce has gone up. At the same time, the clients want heavy discounts on products,” Agarwal said. Interior designer Yasir Ansari said a study space in every room in most of the residential projects was becoming the order of the day. “The clients want a study set-up in their children’s room, master bedroom and even in the puja room in some cases. There was a shortage of workers, as most of them had left for their home towns last year. I convinced some of them to stay back and work on the ongoing projects by reducing my profit margin and offering them double pay. I have worked on eight residential projects. On the commercial front, many clients have hired me for designing medical stores,” he said. Harsh Bagdoria, another interior designer, said, “Most clients want us to make the products at our workshops and deliver them to their house only for installation. They don’t want to allow workers and other people into their homes. We get access to the sites only when the clients have got their possession but have not moved. We ensure that all our staffers wear masks at the site,” said On the problem of worker shortage, interior designer Sarika Deshpande said, “Interior designers and workers are co-dependent. Our work also came to a standstill ever since workers left he city. It has been difficult to get raw material due to the travel restrictions. Since January, I haven’t got any work.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/interior-designers-in-demand-for-that-workplace-feel-at-home/articleshow/83073924.cms||---

The project envisages the construction of houses, provision of drinking water, sanitation, provision for health facilities, setting up of fish marketing centres, construction of fisheries schools, etc. Also, projects worth Rs 18 crore will be implemented in Chellanam on a war footing to prevent sea erosion and flooding. This includes the Rs 16 crore allotted by the previous LDF government under the 100-day projects and also the Rs 2 crore emergency fund allotted two days ago. The ongoing geotube project worth Rs 8 crore will be completed in a time-bound manner. The decision was taken at a high-level meeting held in Ernakulam Guest House on Thursday that was led by industries minister P Rajeev and fisheries minister Saji Cherian to evaluate the loss caused by sea erosion in Chellanam and decide the actions to be taken to protect the coast. The meeting was attended by Hibi Eden, MP, K J Maxi, MLA, district collector S Suhas and several other officials. Model fishing village project aims at the comprehensive development of coastal villages through the coordinated efforts of various departments. The ministers said that the project will resolve the problems in Chellanam. Kerala State Coastal Area Development Corporation Ltd (KSCADC) managing director Sheik Pareeth has been entrusted with the responsibility of drafting a study report of the project. A committee led by minister Rajeev will do the overall monitoring of the project implementation and a technical committee headed by Pareeth will monitor the technical aspects of the project. Earlier on Thursday, the two ministers and others, who attended the meeting, have visited Chellanam and interacted with the residents. They also visited the places which were worst affected by the sea erosion last week. Fisheries minister also said that the coastal development projects under the Rs 5,000-crore package announced by the state government will be completed in five years. Tetrapod barrier will be constructed using the Rs 16 crore allotted for seawall construction and the tendering will be completed by June 25. Cleaning and desilting of Vijayan Canal and Upputhodu will be completed soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/govt-to-implement-model-fishing-village-project/articleshow/83072489.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Car pane smashed to nab ‘extortionist’, his wife jumps in front of train to escape||MUMBAI: For a month-and-half, the railway police hunted high and low for alleged extortionist Bablu Thakur and his wife, Rita Singh. The couple had made investments in nine apartments and gold jewellery out of money extorted from hawkers. Their crime run came to an end recently in a rather dramatic way. Policemen riding a bike chased a car that Thakur was trying to flee in and smashed the vehicle's windowpanes to capture him. Separately, his wife had jumped onto railway tracks in a bid to escape from the cops, but she had a fall which cut her flight short. Police said Thakur has been involved in crime since 2008 and has been booked in 14 cases. "He had assembled a gang of history sheeters who would terrorise hawkers into paying up. Last month, a hawker selling masks at Dadar railway station was beaten up and his wares were snatched at the behest of Thakur," said senior inspector Dnyaneshwar Katkar, Dadar GRP. Thakur kept dodging the cops by changing his location. But on May 27, the police received a tip-off that Thakur was to meet political party workers at Govandi. A police team went there. But Thakur got wind of it and hopped into one of the party workers, Sameer Lalzare's, car along with some aides. The group started to move towards Mulund check-naka. Two policemen followed them on a bike after asking the control room to organise nakabandis. "Lalzare's car was moving quickly and they intended to ride past the toll naka. But a nakabandi forced them to slow down. Our personnel smashed a window pane on the driver's side to get him to halt and step out," said inspector Bharat Patil. All this while, another police team had been trying to track down Singh who had moved out of Mumbai. On May 28, the police traced her to Juinagar and picked her up. They were escorting her to the Dadar GRP chowky. Just a few metres before reaching the chowky, Singh shoved the female cop escorting her and jumped on the tracks. A Titwala local was headed her way and Singh's plan was to cross the tracks before running in another direction. But she had a bad fall. Assistant inspector Arjun Ghanvat, who was a part of the escorting team, jumped after her and got her out of the train's way. The motorman had noticed the uniformed cop and halted the train just a hair's breadth away. Thakur and Ghanvat suffered minor bruises. "We have arrested seven people so far including Lalzare. A Fortuner has been seized from Thakur," said Patil.

---||Hyderabad||Invoke PD Act on traders selling spurious seeds: CM||Hyderabad: Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Saturday directed the police and agriculture departments to go hard on traders selling spurious seeds to farmers and invoke Preventive Detention (PD) Act on culprits. Announcing that the government would give auxiliary promotions, rewards and medals to officers trapping spurious seed sellers, the CM said: “Apart from conducting raids across the state and identifying the persons, invoke the PD Act against the sellers.” At a review meeting on agriculture, availability of seeds, fertilizers and financial assistance to farmers, the CM said: “To prevent spurious seeds, the agriculture department should immediately introduce QR code seed traceability so that farmers can identify certified seeds and company details on the seed packets.” He also warned agriculture officers of tough action if they are found to be involved in corrupt practices and encouraging sale of spurious seeds. “They would be dismissed from service apart and jailed for five years as per the law,” he said. Since the new agriculture season is beginning in the first week of June, KCR asked the finance department to deposit Rythu Bandhu amount in farmers’ accounts between June 15 and 25. While asking agriculture officials to be more vigilant on the seeds issue, he said even fake fertilisers are flooding the market in the name of bio-pesticides, which needs to be prevented. He said there is a need for coordinated efforts by collectors, SPs and district agriculture officers. On paddy procurement, KCR slammed the Centre for its partisan attitude towards Telangana in procurement. “While the Centre is procuring 100 per cent paddy through the FCI, in Telangana it is not happening. I will write a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on this,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/invoke-pd-act-on-traders-selling-spurious-seeds-cm/articleshow/83073928.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Myths, govt apathy leave sex workers out of vaccination drive||MUMBAI: Guddi* is not too sure if she wants to take the jab. A WhatsApp message forwarded by her sister, that she has read over and over, says vaccination could lead to illness or even death. Business in the red-light area of Kamathipura never picked up after the 2020 lockdown. “And I don’t want the lone customer that walks in, to leave because I’m sick,” 35-year-old Guddi says. Sex workers seem to be slipping through the cracks where vaccination against Covid-19 is concerned. Many fear the jab and those who want to get it have no idea how to. Activists, while attempting to eradicate the women’s fears, have demanded that the BMC set up separate vaccination camps for them. TimesViewCommercial sex workers in the city must be vaccinated. In fact, there must be a concerted effort to speak to them, by the civic administration in consultation with NGOs working in their areas, in case many have vaccine hesitancy. We are all in this together, and entire sections of society cannot be left unvaccinated if we are to fight the pandemic effectively.About 17600 female sex workers availed medical check-ups through the Mumbai District Aids Control Society in 2020-21, giving an approximate indication of their population. “None of the female sex workers that we have been in touch with during outreach programmes in Kamathipura-Falkland Road or Vashi-Turbhe have been vaccinated, nor have the men living around them including their sons,” says activist Priti Patkar. She added that some women may not have any identity documentation. “But there has been no discussion on their eligibility for vaccination,” says Patkar. Digital literacy in the community is severely lacking. The use of smartphones is restricted to sending WhatsApp messages or watching videos. There is a concern that agents might fleece the women under the pretext of helping them register on the CoWIN app. “But the biggest challenge for us right now is debunking myths. The women are apprehensive that the vaccine will lead to side-effects,” says Manju Vyas of the Apne Aap Women’s Collective NGO. Like it was with HIV years ago, some of the sex workers believe that Covid wouldn’t infect them. “We are sensitising the women about precautions and prevention, and busting false fears,” said Vyas, who teamed up with a tech company and held a session on Thursday registering about 100 sex workers online. “The vaccine stock is quite erratic at present. Once it regularises, we can plan camps for the marginalised, including sex workers,’’ said Dr Mangala Gomare, executive health officer with the BMC. “Vaccinating sex workers should be a priority, especially for those having prior ailments such as STDs. It's also key that vaccination camps are organised close to where the women live as they seldom step outside the red light area,” said activist Dr Swati Singh who has worked for the welfare of sex workers in Bhiwandi since 2018. Dr Singh added that she hadn’t come across anyone who had been vaccinated in Hanuman Tekdi, Bhiwandi’s red light area comprising 350 to 400 female residents.

The cadets offer them various helps via online and arrange counselling sessions with experts if needed. They also conduct various online fun activities and games to help patients relax during their quarantine period.The project is implemented by SPC with the support of Ramamangalam police station, village panchayat, public health centre and Nanma doctors help desk. The service is available to all Covid patients Ramamangalam, Pambakkuda, Maradi and Manidu panchayats. The SPC students will keep an eye on the Covid patients and help those who need digital and technical support to interact with the doctors virtually.“Students will be talking to the patients over phone and collect details about the availability of food, medicine, etc. They also provide the contact number to Nanma help desk. Leading doctors from across Kerala will be part of the project through Mission Better Tomorrow (MBT), which is the platform of Nanma Foundation that brought the activities of SPC programme into a common space to present them on a global perspective. The objective is to help the Covid patients stay mentally well while surviving the infection. The service of professional counsellors too will be arranged by the cadets,” said Ramamangalm HS community police officer Anoob John.The service of Ernakulam Rural district Covid war room too will be made available through the project. The Chiri help desk, aimed at the psychological wellness of the SPC students, will be included into the project so that its service will be available for the kids at the house of the patients. The project was launched by inspector at Ramamangalam Janamaithri police station K Madhavan Kutty on Wednesday in the presence of Ramamangalam HS headmaster Mani P Krishnan, other police officers and cadets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/spcs-provide-emotional-support-to-covid-patients/articleshow/83072501.cms||---

He was 92. One of the few voices who continuously spoke against corruption in higher education and appointment of vice-chancellors, Anandakrishnan in 2017, in his late 80s, headed the Tamil Nadu Curriculum Framework Committee that revamped state board syllabus from Class I to XII. A man with vast experience, Anandakrishnan served as chairman of IIT-Kanpur and was appointed to the Indian embassy in the US as science advisor soon after India’s first nuclear test in Pokharan. At the United Nations, he served at several levels including deputy director of the Commission on Science and Technology for Development. The Padma Shri recipient played a major role in scrapping entrance exams in Tamil Nadu, and standardised the use of Tamil keyboard. He also played a role in setting up TN’s first IT park — Tidel Park at Taramani. It was based on the recommendations of a committee headed by Anandakrishnan that the Tamil Nadu government scrapped entrance tests to professional courses in 2006. Many remember him as a strict disciplinarian yet humble. “Any recommendation for any post by anybody was treated by him as disqualification,” says P V Navaneethakrishnan, former professor of Anna University. Professor N Pichaimuthu said Anandakrishnan had a very broad view of things due to his global experience. E Balaguruswamy, another former vice-chancellor of Anna University, said: “We have lost an academician with the highest calibre and integrity.”  Governor Banwarilal Purohit condoled the death. Chief minister M K Stalin said “He was the hero behind the DMK government’s decision to cancel entrance exams for professional courses. It was his report that opened the doors of higher education to rural students and each doctor and engineer from rural and middle class background will understand this.” Anandakrishnan is survived by his wife Jayalakshmi and four sons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/academician-who-led-revision-of-tn-state-board-syllabus-no-more/articleshow/83072494.cms||A Ragu Raman

Police have arrested the 26-year-old youth, Imran Malick and his girlfriend Deepali Raut, for the murder of Ratanben Jain on April 15. Malick claimed that he worked in a salon, but lost his job during the pandemic and was struggling to make ends meet. He found a job in a nearby bakery but was not in a position to repay the money he owed Raut, who harassed him for the money. Malick moved along with the police team on the pretext of assisting the probe and suddenly vanished to his native place in Uttar Pradesh. The police failed to trace him. They tracked his call records and found he was constantly in touch with Raut.  “By then our teams had questioned several jewellers in the vicinity showing the pictures of gold ornaments but got no information,” said Shyam Shinde, senior inspector of Bhandup police. Based on the phone calls, the cops questioned Raut, who confessed that Malick handed over the stolen jewellery to her. She told the police that she had sold two gold bangles belonging to the deceased. Malick was then traced to UP and arrested. Malick said that he was acquainted with the deceased and often dropped by her house to hand over rent to the owner, who happened to be a friend of the deceased. The police also came to know that Raut had lodged a complaint against Malick for cheating her of Rs 8 lakh, which was later amicably settled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bhandup-murder-youth-killed-senior-citizen-to-repay-rs-8-lakh-to-lover-in-mumbai/articleshow/83075147.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Kozhikode||Muslim outfits step up opposition to Kerala high court order||KOZHIKODE: Muslim organizations and political parties like Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) and Indian National League (INL) have stepped up their opposition to the high court order scrapping the 80:20 ratio followed in the allocation of scholarships to minority students. IUML said that that it was the LDF government which had in 2011 fixed the 80:20 ratio. IUML national general secretary P K Kunhalikutty and national organizing secretary E T Mohammed Basheer said at a press conference in Malappuram on Sunday that it was a mistake on the part of the LDF government in 2011 to convert a national-level scheme brought to address the backwardness of the Muslim community to a scheme for various minorities in the state. They said that the order issued by the LDF government in January 2011 earmarked 10 20% of the seats in coaching centres set up for Muslim youth as per Paloli committee recommendation to students from other minority communities. Later, in an another order issued in February, 20% of the scholarships/hostel stipend granted to Muslim female students as per Paloli committee recommendation were provided to students from Latin Catholic and Converted Christian communities.  Kunhalikuty said that the UDF government in 2015 was left with no option but to carry forward the 2011 order ahead as it was a sensitive subject. He said that the government should implement the recommendations of the Sachar committee in total and should bring a separate project if benefits are to be provided to various minorities. Basheer reiterated the party’s demand that the state government should file an appeal against the verdict. Meanwhile, even as the CPM has not spelt out its stand on the issue, LDF constituent INL has opposed the verdict and has requested the government to file an appeal. INL general secretary Kassim Irikkur said that the HC verdict has not considered the historical background and the reasons why the scheme was framed. “Though the state government has presented the recommendations of Sachar committee report and Paloli committee report before the court, surprisingly the court considered it as an issue of equality,” he said. The Samastha Samvarana Samithi affiliated to the Samastha Kerala Jem Iyyathul Ulema has said that the court order has created serious concerns among the Muslim community. Sunni Yuavajana Sangham state secretaries Abdu Samad Pookotur, Nassar Faisi Koodathayi and Samithi convener Musthafa Mundooopara in a news conference said that many programmes were announced for Muslim community on the basis of the Sachar committee report and Paloli committee’s recommendations. “Later, the government diluted it by giving 20% of the benefits, which were solely the right of Muslim community, to Christian minorities. The verdict will lead to the Muslim community being pushed further backwards,” they said, adding that the Samithi would move against the order legally and would also launch agitation in association with like-minded groups. Kerala Muslim Jamaat state president Kanthapuram A P Aboobackar Musaliyar has said that the HC verdict was painful and disheartening for the Muslim community. He said that the government was not able to properly explain in the court that the scheme was part of a policy decision to solve the backwardness of the Muslim minority community. “The government should take steps to correct the lapse. The Muslim community is concerned over the controversy and the conflicting arguments in the society on the issue. Also, moves by the communal forces to exploit the situation should be foiled and steps to turn it into a Christian-Muslim issue should be resisted,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/muslim-outfits-step-up-oppn-to-hc-order/articleshow/83081170.cms||---

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Class XII students create a info hub for people in need||CHENNAI: From the heart of Mylapore functions a Covid-19 hub of resources, run by students of Class XII from PS Senior Secondary School, making every effort to connect those in need with the right resources. On April 26, when their Class XII board exams were in flux, around 10 students of PS Senior decided to work towards helping people caught in the second wave of the pandemic by creating a virtual platform that of centralised information on Covid resources. And since then it has been a whirlwind of online activity to find, verify and circulate resources for those in need. They work in shifts all seven days, with the volunteers taking off only in case of illness or exams. “The information hub operates on Instagram through the handle @cov19infohubindia. We have also listed services through Linktree, stories, posts, and reels,” says Abhiram Reddy, one of teenagers behind the initiative. “We give out live updates on availability of beds, oxygen concentrators, cylinders, vaccination and restriction news, and home ICU set-ups. The team verifies the information before it is put up,” says Abhiram. “Those who have entrance exams take a couple of days off. We want help people in any way we can,” he says. “When we receive messages from strangers telling us how they managed to get a cylinder thanks to our info hub, we are spurred on,” says Darshana, another volunteer at Team Info Hub. The others include Sidaarth Naresh, Kavita Rajaraman, Akshya Subramanian, Aryan Sreeram Anand, Bhuvaneshwari Mahesh, Akilesh Chandrasekar, Adithi L and Gayathri M Srinivas. “Sifting through information to get what’s authentic is difficult and we help with that. We don’t want people wasting their resources following up wrong leads,” says Abhiram.

---||Chennai||Work interupted: Unscheduled power cuts irritate public||CHENNAI: Unscheduled power cuts across the city and state have irked residents, especially those working from home. On Friday, several neighbourhoods in the city and in suburbs reported extended power cuts for more than two hours. “It was not a scheduled power cut for maintenance. There was no prior announcement. But, from 9am until about 11.30am, there was no power in our neighbourhood and the local officials too could not be reached over phone,” said D Sidharthan of Madipakkam. In the past 24 hours, there were power cuts in Valasaravakkam, Pallikaranai, Kundrathur, Medavakkam, Thirunindravur and other areas. Across the state too, similar issues were reported. Apart from the daytime power cuts, there are also power cuts at late nights giving the residents sleepless nights. “Due to the increased use of air conditioners, transformers could not handle the additional load in several areas. Transformer bursts take time to attend to,” a Tangedco assistant engineer said on the reason for late night power cuts. Residents said with online classes and work from home, the power cuts have made their lives difficult. “Not addressing the issue will only dent the government’s notorious image of being synonymous with power cuts,” said S Karthik, a software professional. A senior Tangedco official maintained that power cuts in summer are due to area wise issues and that the state generates more electricity than the demand. For instance, on Thursday, the state generated 18,074MW and the peak consumption was 11,963MW, the official said. The engineer cited the non operation of major consumers such as malls, commercial complexes, industries during the lockdown as the reason for there being no issues with electricity supply. Earlier this week, state electricity minister V Senthil Balaj directed Tangedco officials to ensure all helplines are in operation receive complaints.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/work-interupted-unscheduled-power-cuts-irritate-public/articleshow/83072498.cms||Srikkanth D
---||Nagpur||Civic body kick-starts Neeri’s testing through gargling samples||NAGPUR: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) became the first civic body in the country to implement the RT-PCR testing technique through gargling samples innovated in a world first by the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri). At the Regional Police Training School (RPTS) collection centre in Nagpur on Saturday, 52 samples were collected in this manner. The commercial manufacturing of sample collection kits has begun and in the coming days, the Neeri-designed one-step RNA extraction buffer will also be available for all to purchase and use. On May 20, TOI was the first to report that the technique innovated by Neeri had got approval from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Innovated by scientist and head at Neeri’s environmental virology cell Krishna Khairnar, the technique is quicker, people friendly and cost effective. On Saturday, people who came to give samples at the RPTS testing centre breathed a sigh of relief as they “didn’t have to go through the pains of nasal and throat swabs”. All they had to was take a test tube with 5 millilitres of sterile saline in it, gargle it for 15 seconds, rinse for another 15 seconds and put the liquid back into the tube. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B, who visited the centre on Saturday, called it a remarkable achievement by the Nagpur-based Neeri. “The best part of this technique is that it is non-invasive and user-friendly. Also, it will reduce the dependence on skilled manpower for collection of samples so we can expand the number of collection points,” he told TOI. The commissioner added that NMC is supporting the initiative and after studying the efficacy of this method and response by people, the civic body will extend it to other centres. The method brings about administration ease, saves time in sampling and does not pose a threat to health workers, pointed out Dr Manoj Morey, nodal officer at the RPTS which has completed sampling of around 50,000 tests. “Earlier, the health worker collecting the sample had to go very close to the person. Many of our workers were turning positive and ill. In this method, a safe distance can be maintained. Also, the skilled manpower which was needed earlier can now be utilized for patients’ care as many civic hospitals are short-staffed,” said Dr Morey. Many people would get scared of the procedure of collecting nasal and throat swabs and hesitate in going for testing. “This procedure is not traumatic, especially for senior citizens. We started implementing it few days back on some samples. Collection was faster as our staff was giving instructions and 4-5 people were following it to give samples at one go,” added Dr Morey. Welcoming the innovation, people who gave gargling samples said that it should be implemented across the country. “The nasal and throat samples was a difficult process especially for my parents. This method was very easy and less time-consuming,” said Nilesh Aotkar, who works in sales. Agreed Vivek Singh, a teacher, who said, “This method is very safe for everyone as it is non-invasive. Many people can give their samples at the same time, maintaining Covid distancing.” On Thursday, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan also appreciated the technique and called it a “game-changer”. As per government sources, a Mumbai-based private laboratory HiMedia Laboratories has started manufacturing and supplying sampling kits to NMC. Another laboratory — Meril Diagnostics which is based in Gujrat — is expected to begin mass production of Neeri-designed RNA extraction buffer that eliminates the need of tedious and costly RNA extraction kits. As Neeri has openly shared its innovation, it can be now implemented anywhere in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/civic-body-kick-starts-neeris-testing-through-gargling-samples/articleshow/83073958.cms||Manka Behl

Local bodies operate the community kitchens in coordination with NGOs and Kudumbashree. Janakeeya hotels mostly cater to rural areas. There are 111 Janakeeya hotels in the state which work with the local self-governments and ensure availability of food to the needy. “Janakeeya hotels serve lunch at a subsidized rate of Rs 20. The food orders come to the panchayat or municipality via ward members and food is prepared according to demand. Food is collected and delivered by volunteers from the locality,” said Kudumbashree district programme manager Ajith P A. In some areas, there are orders for dinner also. “There are package orders which are planned between the local body and team operating the hotel,” he added. Unlike the first wave, which saw wastage of food at the community kitchens, things are more structured now. “Last year, priority was to ensure food for essential service teams like police and healthcare workers apart from street dwellers. It took some time for people to reorganize and move out of city limits to distribute food. This year, it is more structured,” said Mary Anitha, chairperson, Centre for Empowerment and Enrichment, an NGO that is part of the volunteer network in Covid disaster management. “Now, the person who distributes food in a particular area comes to me and says the exact number of parcels he/she needs. There is very limited wastage and no one is going hungry during lockdown.” Anitha says that there are Covid-positive people who struggle to get food. “Last week, a person who is employed as a watchman contacted me. He had tested positive and couldn’t go home. We took his location and provided him food. We are able to trace such isolated cases,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/janakeeya-hotels-ensure-that-no-one-goes-hungry/articleshow/83072513.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

The incident came to light when the deceased man’s brother recently received a message informing that he had been vaccinated. The man grew suspicious as he had taken the first dose in April. When he checked further, it came to light that his deceased brother Kalidas Bhil and his wife Santu Bhil had been vaccinated on May 26. Bhil had died in March 2020 and Santu had never opted for vaccination. The family suspected that their voter ID cards were misused for vaccination. An official said that it had been established that a MPHW had made the registrations. The official said that while it was evident that the health worker was responsible for the registrations, it was not clear if he did so deliberately. The MPHW was on contract and has been sacked as his involvement came to light. The official added that further investigations were being conducted in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/vaccination-of-dead-man-staffer-sacked/articleshow/83072343.cms||---

While it was the third time Nungambakkam crossed the mark this month, Meenambakkam, which covers a part of the southern suburbs, recorded for the first time this month. Weathermen have forecast day temperatures to continue to hover at 40C at least for the next two days. An IMD official said, “The city and the suburbs may experience a maximum and minimum temperature of around 40C and 29C for the next 48 hours.” The agency also issued a warning that maximum temperature is likely to rise by 2C-3C over Chennai and its three neighbouring districts Kancheepuram, Tiruvallur and Chengelpet as well as some parts of north and interior Tamil Nadu. Saturday’s temperatures were 2.2C and 1.2C above normal in the city stations with humidity touching 57% and 55%. “There is a persistent flow of wind from the southwest that moves in from Arabian Sea, which means they carry moisture. Sea breeze entered in the afternoon leaving the rest of the day sweaty and uncomfortable,” an official said. Day temperatures, which had been largely below the average of 37.1C for most part of May considered peak summer, crossed 40C on April 26 and 27 after cyclone Yaas moved north bringing dry northwesterly winds from the land. On Friday, there was a slight drop in temperature with Nungambakkam recording 39.3C. Weather bloggers said temperature may hover around 37C in the coming days though that may also cause sweating and discomfort indoors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/city-dwellers-feel-the-heat-as-mercury-crosses-40c-mark/articleshow/83072508.cms||---

Rashmi Khandelwal, who was attached with a few private hospitals in Kolkata, died at a private hospital off EM Bypass. She was on ventilation support for over a week. According to sources, the gynaecologist tested positive in the first week of May. Initially, she remained in home isolation and was shifted to hospital after her condition deteriorated. An alumnus of Calcutta National Medical College, the 40-year-old had not been vaccinated. Sources said that she had an allergic condition due to which she had avoided the vaccine. “It is painful to lose such young bright doctors. Though the number of doctors dying in the second wave is still lower than the count in the first wave, the virus continues to claim doctors and other healthcare workers,” said gynaecologist Bhaskar Pal, president of the Bengal Obstetrics and Gynaecological Society. As many as 105 doctors died of Covid during the first wave — between March and December 2020 — in Bengal. Though the number of deaths during the second wave is around 40, the medical community is concerned about the fact that these deaths have occurred in a span of five months. “During the first wave, most of the doctors who died were aged above 50. What is shocking this time is that we are seeing younger doctors succumb to the infection,” said a young doctor at SSKM Hospital. In general, fatality among the elderly population who have been vaccinated have reduced this time. Youngsters across professions, on the other hand, have been dying frequently. “Apart from two of three cases, the majority of the 40 odd doctors who died during this wave were not fully vaccinated, which is unfortunate,” said IMA state secretary Santanu Sen. “People might get infected despite being fully vaccinated. But the vaccine protects one from getting a severe disease,” added the Rajya Sabha MP. Abdullah Sohail Hussein, another 34-year-old doctor attached with SSKM Hospital, had died on Friday due to post -Covid complications. “Both the central and state governments have announced ex-gratia to families of doctors who contracted the infection in the line of duty and have died. Some of these doctors have died at the beginning of their careers. We want the authorities to ensure the amount to reach their families,” said radiation oncologist Sharadwat Mukherjee of Doctors for Patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/40-year-old-gynaes-death-shocks-city-2nd-wave-doc-toll-touches-40/articleshow/83072537.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Walk-in vaccination for senior citizens at KMC units, chatbot registry wait for 45+ group||KOLKATA: Kolkata Municipal Corporation on Saturday rejigged their Covishield vaccination plan for recipients who are yet to get their first dose. According to a new proposal, KMC will open 108 Covid vaccination centres for senior citizens (60 and above) from Monday who need to walk in and register their names for an on-the-spot vaccination. The vaccination for senior citizens will be carried out between 9 am and 2 pm. From 2 pm onwards, recipients in the 45-plus age group will be administered the vaccine (Covishield first dose). However, for this age group, recipients will need to register their names through the KMC WhatsApp chatbot service. That may take a while as KMC stopped the service after 50,000 people registered in three hours on Friday. According to a KMC health department official, the initial plan was to include senior citizens in the chatbot service. However, the failure to reach the target of vaccinating the required number of recipients who had applied for the Covishield first dose on Friday through the chatbot service prompted the civic brass to change their plan and offer the seniors a walk-in registration service at the civic vaccination centres. Though the civic body had set a target of administering Covishield vaccine to 5,000-5,500 recipients on Saturday, it managed to administer shots to only around 2,500. “We had a fixed two-hour slot for those who had registered through the chatbot service and were to be given the jab at our vaccination centres. This was an additional task for our doctors and para medical staffers as they were also engaged in arranging Covishield first dose for the priority group,” said a KMC borough executive health officer. While some KMC vaccination centres had called 20 odd recipients based on their applications through the chatbot service, a few of them could not open their centres for the applicants as they were preoccupied with the vaccination of priority groups. A KMC health department official conceded the time slots fixed for the different groups of Covishield recipients was totally confusing and could lead to a delay in administering the vaccines. “Now we need to cater to three different groups of people who will turn up at our centres in three different slots. This will definitely slow down the pace of vaccination,” said a medical officer at a KMC vaccination centre in Tollygunge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/walk-in-vax-for-senior-citizens-at-kmc-units-chatbot-registry-wait-for-45-group/articleshow/83072550.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: BMC readies for polls amid Covid, seeks panel advice||MUMBAI: The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has sought directives from the State Election Commission (SEC) on conducting the municipal election in 2022 in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. The election to the country’s richest municipal body is scheduled early next year but officials said that in view of the pandemic, new directives were important from the SEC. “There may be a need to increase election booths in the city keeping in mind the need for social distancing in the wake of Covid. Currently every booth is known to have around 15,000 voters, who come to cast their vote throughout the day. However, the same in the current situation does not look feasible,” said the official. The BMC on Friday had an internal meeting with its own team on what needs to be done. Ideally, prior to the election, the BMC redraws every municipal ward boundary. Each of the 227 wards had an average of 54,000 voters during the 2017 election. The SEC had asked the BMC to divide the total population of 12.44 million (as per the 2011 census) with the number of wards, that is, 227. “However now the delimitation is to be done based on the latest population figures. In the wake of Covid, however, it was not possible to even conduct the census for the year 2020-21,” said the official, adding that a meeting with the SEC is fixed for Monday. Ravi Raja, corporator and opposition party leader in the BMC, said that the civic body will have to be extremely careful. “We saw what happened in states like West Bengal recently where elections were held and Covid cases went up, and therefore the BMC will need to be careful before it decides anything,” said Raja. Prior to the BMC election in 2017, on October 3, 2016, the lottery for reservations was held for the 227 wards and the delimitation of wards was announced. While 50% seats among these are reserved for women candidates, from the 50% as well there is parallel reservation in the Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe and OBC category.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-readies-for-polls-amid-covid-seeks-panel-advice/articleshow/83078010.cms||Richa Pinto

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Helplines to provide updates on Covid patients||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Following the intervention of newly appointed ministers from the district, the district administration and the health department launched 24-hour helplines in hospitals where Covid patients are being treated. The ministers had raised the need for a communication channel for the family members to be properly informed about the condition of patients on treatment in Covid hospitals in the recent review meeting held at the collectorate.  Staff have been appointed in helpline counters for 24 hours. The health condition of patients and course of treatment will be informed to relatives through the helplines. Meanwhile, a post-Covid referral centre began functioning at the District Homeo Hospital, East Fort, on Thursday. District panchayat president D Suresh Kumar inaugurated the centre. He said that the centre will give assistance to patients dealing with bodily and psychological discomfort after recovering from the infection. A total of 3,210 new Covid-19 cases were confirmed in the district on Thursday when 3,247 persons recovered from the disease.

The KMC Board of Administrators (BoA) chairman Firhad Hakim, who resumed office on Saturday, said efforts were on to recognize domestic help as Covid warriors and accordingly arrange for their vaccination. “I feel domestic help should be given the Covid warrior status to make them eligible for the vaccination free of cost. I shall take up the matter with the state health secretary for taking initiative for inclusion of domestic help in the priority group,” Hakim said. A section of KMC health department officials felt recognizing domestic help as super spreaders and arranging for their vaccination at the civic urban health centres would bring down the infection rate. “A domestic help who works at multiple households carries the risk of infecting many if s/he is infected but remains asymptomatic. If such domestic help are vaccinated, the risk gets minimized,” said a KMC health department official. At present, the KMC health department has identified 102 KMC-run Covid vaccination centres for the city's priority group or super spreaders. Transport workers, hawkers, vegetable sellers, fish vendors and sex workers have been identified as members of the priority group. Some residents’ welfare associations in housing complexes have organised vaccination for service sector employees. At Urbana, the residents have organised vaccination for 850 individuals, including residents, drivers and maids.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/domestic-help-may-get-priority-status/articleshow/83072584.cms||Saikat Ray

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: 11 days on, 21-yr-old yet to figure in Covid fatality list||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Eleven days after a 21-year-old BTech student was reported dead due to Covid-19, his case is missing in the official list being released by the health department. APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University issued a press note on May 17, a first time for an official body, declaring the death of Sooraj Krishna. The press release said he had died of Covid-19. Krishna was a third year BTech computer science student at TKM College of Engineering, Kollam. Vice-chancellor Dr Rajasree M S had condoled the death of Krishna. The official death list for Thiruvananthapuram district shows only three deaths in the age group 15-30 between May 17 and May 27 — a 26-year-old female who died on May 24, a 26-year-old male who died on May 21 and a 15-year-old female who died on May 19. Krishna died at the Medical College Hospital (MCH) on May 16. Official list shows around 12 Covid-19 deaths in the district on May 16 and it doesn’t show death of any person aged below 30. Krishna’s mother Manjusha told TOI that they were told at the MCH that Krishna had tested positive for Covid-19 and that he had pneumonia. “He was shifted from casualty to Covid ICU at the MCH. He died on May 16 evening,” said Manjusha. Manjusha said his body was also not handed over to the family. “His mortal remains were taken to Santhikavadam as per Covid-19 protocol,” she said. According to her, Krishna had symptoms like cold and fever on May 14 and when he tested negative in rapid antigen test in a hospital, they were sent home. She said that she was unaware of the confirmatory test which is done in case of symptomatic cases testing negative in preliminary test. Health department revised the guidelines for Covid-19 testing superseding all previous testing guidelines in February 2021. It said that rapid antigen test shall be conducted for all influenza like illnesses (ILI) and if the antigen test result is negative, RT-PCR shall be performed on the same day (as early as possible during the symptomatic period). It is not known why he was sent home without going for a confirmatory test. “After we came home, his condition worsened. We took him to Vilappil health centre from where he was immediately referred to the MCH,” said Manjusha, a resident of Vilappill, Vattiyoorkavu. Krishna’s father is Suresh Kumar K, a driver. His sister Arya Krishna completed her Plus Two and is awaiting results. Krishna was attending his online classes from his home. TOI had earlier carried two reports showing mismatch in number of deaths in crematoriums in the district and the official list. Besides there was huge variation in actual deaths mentioned in a press note issued by the medical college postgraduate teachers association for one particular day and the official number of deaths confirmed by the department of health.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/11-days-on-21-yr-old-yet-to-figure-in-covid-fatality-list/articleshow/83072571.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Pune||Times Verified busts dangerously misleading claims about vaccines||Since its launch on April 30, Times Verified — a service that calls out fake news and false claims linked to Covid-19 — has helped uncover more than 500 pieces of information that had unverified or completely misleading information. One such message this week involved French Nobel laureate Luc Montagnier. The message, which has been shared across social media platforms, said Montagnier had claimed that all vaccinated people would die within the next two years. First, the Montagnier has been traced back to a source that has peddled fake information before. Second, it later emerged that the French scientist had never actually said 'people vaccinated would die within two years'. That extra bit was added by those who forwarded the message. But Montagnier also claimed that vaccines would trigger a rise in the number of coronavirus variants. He added that a phenomenon known as Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) - in which antibodies boost efficiency of virus infection - would make the Covid situation worse. But scientists worldwide, and in India, responded by saying Montagnier is wrong. All vaccines are being monitored for ADE. In an article on the matter, virologist Dr Shahid Jameel noted that "no ADE has been documented from cases of reinfection or breakthrough infections". Montagnier shared the 2008 Nobel in Physiology or Medicine with Françoise Barré-Sinoussi and Harald zur Hausen for the discovery of the HIV virus that causes AIDS. He has also claimed that electromagnetic radiation can cure Lyme disease, which is caused by tick bites.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/times-verified-busts-dangerously-misleading-claims-about-vaccines/articleshow/83074071.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Covishield arrival in Kolkata a worry as airlines pull out Pune services due to low load||KOLKATA: Transporting consignments of Covid-19 vaccine Covishield manufactured by Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) to Kolkata is proving to be a logistical nightmare with all airlines that operated direct flights between the two cities suspending them citing viability issues. “Flying in Covishield vaccines was always tough due to the restriction on flights from Maharashtra that has been in place for nearly a year now. Flights are allowed to operate between Pune and Kolkata only on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. But now it has become even more difficult with airlines suspending the flights due to poor passenger load,” said an official of a private hospital that has placed orders for Covishield. On Friday, three consignments of Covishield doses weighing 1.2 tonnes arrived from Pune via Delhi on the IndiGo flight 6E 755. On the other hand, the Covaxin consignment of 591kg from Hyderabad was flown in directly by the Air India flight AI 525. On Saturday, another 285kg consignment containing Covaxin doses was flown in from Hyderabad on the IndiGo flight 6E 6358. “It will now be easier to ship Covaxin consignments than Covishield because there are multiple flights operating between Kolkata and Hyderabad against none between Kolkata and Pune. We hope the issue is resolved soon so that vaccine movement gets streamlined,” a health department official said. According to sources, the state health department was even contemplating easing the restriction on flights from Pune when the flights went off the air. Last week, only the Air Asia flight I5 320 had operated once. GoAir, IndiGo and Spice-Jet, which had daily flight schedules, have cancelled the flights citing lack of viability because of poor loads. “There are two problems — the restriction in Kolkata and Bengal and the pre-travel RTPCR test requirement in both cities. While the restrictions in Bengal necessitated by the requirement to reduce Covid cases have been extended by a fortnight, the Covid test requirement for Pune is a big challenge because the swab test needs to be conducted within 48 hours prior to flight departure. This has led to a sharp drop in load,” an airline official said. While SpiceJet does operate cargo flights, it requires 8 tonnes-10 tonnes of goods to make the flight viable. To ensure such load with just vaccines is almost impossible, a freighter official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/covishield-arrival-a-worry-as-airlines-pull-out-pune-services-due-to-low-load/articleshow/83072613.cms||Subhro Niyogi

The gardens were set up as a pilot project to supply nutritious food to Sahariya tribals in Shahabad and Kishangaj area of Baran. At least 55 such gardens, including 30 in anganwadi kendras of Kishanganj and 25 in Shahabad, were set up in July last year as part of Poshan Abhiyaan Jan Andolan by women and child development department, to supply overall nutrition to Sahariya kids and women suffering from malnutrition. But only 10 gardens in Kishanganj and 13 in Shahabad are currently sustaining as others have suffered badly due to scarcity of water in the area leading to withering of plantation. Further, the lockdown has worsened the condition of these gardens as the anganwadi centres are closed and the staff in engaged in Covid duties. The concept of Poshan Vatika at anganwadi centres evolved last year as a pilot project and a budget of Rs 10,000 was sanctioned to each centre in August 2020 allotted from CSR fund of various industries in the area, said Harishankar Nuwal, deputy director, Integrated Child Development Service, which is the supervising authority of the project. The seasonal nutritious plants and vegetables like spinach, fenugreek, radish, carrot, turnip, bottle gourd and others were planted in 30 X 50sqft Poshan Vatika with technical assistance from Action Against Hunger (AAH), an NGO working in tribal area and the plantation did yield fruits and vegetables timely, which were supplied to children, pregnant woman and mothers in the area, he said. But now, due to scarcity of water in the respective areas, most of these gardens have degraded and plants are withering away, he said adding that some gardens are still being maintained by the anganwadi staff. The anganwadi centres are closed due to lockdown and most of the plants have withered away due to lack of care and water, however, a few of them do visit the gardens and if water is available, they water the plants, said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/nutri-gardens-fail-to-meet-food-needs-for-water-shortage/articleshow/83074037.cms||---

He observed the anniversary of his assumption of office with no public celebrations and offered mass at the Mount St Thomas Chapel, Kakkanad. The Synod of the Syro-Malabar Church elected him as the Major Archbishop on May 14, 2011 after the passing away of Cardinal Mar Varkey Vithayathil. He was then the Bishop of Thucklay. He took charge as the Major Archbishop at the Cathedral Basilica of the Archeparchy of Ernakulam-Angamaly in the presence of the bishops of the Synod, and of the representative of the Vatican on May 29, 2011. Mar Sebastian Vaniyapurackal, the Curia bishop, and the priests of the Curia joined him at the holy mass held on Saturday. “Under the major archbishop, new eparchies were created and the boundaries of jurisdiction of many eparchies were extended. With the establishment of the eparchies of Shamshabad and Hosur, Pope Francis has allowed the Syro-Malabar Church to engage in pastoral work over the whole of India. This was a long-cherished dream of the Syro-Malabar Church,” the church said in a statement. It further added that the pastoral ministry of the Church was expanded on a wider scale with the establishment of the eparchies of Faridabad, Melbourne, Mississauga, Great Britain and the Apostolic Vicariate of Europe. “Under his guidance and leadership, a new centre to coordinate the activities of the Church in Rome was made available. Jurisdiction of the eparchy of Melbourne was extended to the whole of Oceania by Pope Francis on March 21, 2021. All these were possible because of the care and attention given by Mar Cardinal Alencherry to the Church,” the church said. He is working at present as the President of the KCBC and the Inter-Church council. “Although as the major archbishop, he is the head of the Syro-Malabar Church consisting of 35 eparchies in and outside India, with a membership of 50 lakh people, he is also the Archbishop of Ernakulam- Angamaly arch eparchy. As a cardinal, he takes part in the conclave that elects the Pope. He is also a member of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches, of the Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith, of the International Council for Catechesis and of the Pontifical Council for promoting Christian Unity,” the statement said. Cardinal Leonardo Sandri, the Prefect of the Congregation for Oriental Churches, Secretary Archbishop George Gallora and the Vatican Nuncio, Leopold Girelli offered their greetings to the cardinal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cardinal-mar-alencherry-completes-10-years-at-helm/articleshow/83071005.cms||---

According to the civic body, the hospital charged different rates for same type of tests to 92 patients. The order issued by NMC additional municipal commissioner said, “It is mandatory for Covid hospitals to charge 80% of total operational beds at rates fixed by the state government. We found out that Radiance Hospital charged different rates for same type of tests to 92 patients. Accordingly, show cause notice was issued on May 20 asking the hospital why action should not be taken and the 92 patients be refunded Rs10,32,243.” The hospital was asked to file reply in two days. “But there was no reply. Then, the issue was tabled before committee which too endorsed refund to patients,” said Sharma. Sharma said he then ordered directors of the hospital to refund excess charges recovered from 92 patients to relatives within seven days and submit compliance report. “Action will be taken under Epidemic Act- 1897, Disaster Management Act-2005, Maharashtra Essential Services Maintenance Act-2011, Bombay Nursing Home Registration Act-2006 and Bombay Public Trust Act-1950 in case of non-compliance,” the order said. According to the NMC, the hospital levied different charges for blood and other examinations. Refuting the allegations, director of the hospital Dr Manoj Purohit said, “Few of our staff tested positive and were treated in the hospital. It is responsibility of the hospital to charge the staff at lower rate. NMC has considered charges levied to the staff as rack rates and compared them with rates for other patients. We charged 80% beds as per government’s rates. We met Sharma on Saturday and will file reply on Monday,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hospital-charges-92-different-rates-for-same-test-refund-it-says-nmc/articleshow/83074077.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

He stated that antigen tests through mobile van were started in the state, especially to cover rural interiors and far-flung areas of Rajasthan. Sharma stated that medical and health department has started the antigen test at block level and gram panchayat level where mobile medical unit, mobile vans and base ambulances were sent with the team of health officers and para medical staff. “We have been doing almost 1,000 antigen tests to detect Covid-19 cases which have to be further referred for RT-PCR test. Out of the 22,253 tests we have so far found that 728 tested positive for Covid-19,” said Sharma while talking to TOI. He added that at village level, the health department has also been identifying patients with influenza-like-illness(ILI) and these patients are further isolated and taken for antigen tests. “Those who are getting positive antigen test are further sent for RT-PCR with the kits so that in the far-flung areas the department can act and react to these cases for prevention and cure,” Sharma added. Giving a detailed account, he said, “Out of these 22, 253 tests, the department had conducted 2,407 in Nagaur, Bhilwara (1,951), Barmer (1,522), Sikar (1,195), Pali (1,180), Jaipur (1,834), Churu (1,340) and at Ajmer 1,088 tests were conducted.” Also, district collectors and chief medical and health officers (CMHOs) have been specifically asked to monitor the progress of these antigen tests to keep an eye on fresh cases and act accordingly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-conducts-22k-mobile-antigen-tests-728-positive/articleshow/83074066.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Have faith in vaccine, tribals being told through hakims & pujaris||Nagpur: District collectors of Gadchiroli and Nagpur are adopting innovative measures to counter vaccine hesitancy among tribal population who have been distracted by messages in social media claiming deaths and impotency due to vaccination against Covid-19. Gadchiroli collector Dipak Singla and his Nagpur counterpart Ravindra Thakare are asking the local village ‘doctors’ like hakims or bhoomkals and pujaris or priests to first take the jab themselves and then encourage the villagers to do the same. The district administrations are also approaching the peoples’ representatives to promote the vaccination drive. The district administrations have also started awareness campaigns in local languages, including the tribal ones like Gondi and Madia spoken in eastern Vidarbha’s Maoist-affected Gadchiroli. The healthcare teams are also visiting remote places like Beenagonda to get cluster of villages vaccinated in the Maoist hotbed of Abhujamadh along the Maharashtra-Chhattisgarh border. Singla said that a 21-point awareness campaign has been kicked-started to first target the hamlets where there is least resistance. The campaign will then move on to villages that are completely refusing vaccination. “We are roping in local doctors who provide the first line of treatment to the villagers. Once these local doctors are vaccinated, they can motovate the villagers,” said Singla. He said help will also be taken of opinion makers like tribal activist Devaji Tofa and well-known faces to boost vaccination. Gadchiroli’s district health officer Dr Shashikant Shambarkar said his team first vaccinated the pujari at a small hamlet in Chamorshi taluka and another at Dhanora. The villagers followed them. “If someone like a bhoomkal asks the villagers to take vaccine, they follow him without questioning. Social media rumours have created mistrust among the tribals who may need the protection of vaccine more than people in urban centres,” said Dr Shambarkar. Thakare, who feels the anticipated third wave may hit the villagers more than urban population, is keen to intensify the vaccination drive in rural parts, especially in the tribal belt of Nagpur district. “We want to capitalize on the trust the local population has in hakims and others who use herbs and so on for treatment,” he said. Vaccination and awareness campaigns have kicked off in 13 talukas in tribal parts of Nagpur district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/have-faith-in-vaccine-tribals-being-told-through-hakims-pujaris/articleshow/83074107.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Bursting at seams, King George's Medical University asks hospitals to share load||LUCKNOW: Overburdened with both non-Covid and Covid patients, including black fungus infection cases, King George's Medical University (KGMU) on Saturday appealed to other government medical institutions and hospitals to share its non-Covid emergency load. Faculty in charge, media cell, Dr Sandip Tiwari and cofaculty in charge Dr Sudhir Singh, held out the request to non-Covid institutes or those running smaller Covid facilities, to run their emergencies to capacity and lessen the burden on KGMU. The statement read that KGMU is running a 988-bed Covid facility, largest in the state, which successfully treated over 5,000 patients, conducted more than18 lakh tests at its labs and administered 40,000 vaccine doses. As of now, over 600 Covid-19 patients and more than 200 black fungus infection cases are under treatment here. KGMU is also running various non-Covid emergency services like trauma centre, obstetrics and gynaecology facilities, dialysis, neonatology, and oncology. The university has a staff strength of over 10,000, including 2,800 doctors. Currently, the university’s resources are overwhelmed and it is unable to accommodate more non-Covid emergency cases. Hence, authorities said, KGMU would appreciate if other institutions share its burden by increasing their capacities and not referring patients to the university. Doctors said, KGMU’s trauma centre has 150 beds and 10 operation theatres (5 major and 5 minor) for non-Covid patients — general surgery, orthopaedics, neurosurgery, plastic surgery and gastrointestinal surgery. On an average, 50 complex non-Covid emergency cases arrive daily. Currently, all beds are occupied. The situation is so tough that at times, patients are treated on stretchers, they added. Likewise, doctors said, in the trauma paediatric and neonatal emergency units, 15 of 20 beds are occupied. Similarly, of 340 beds in Queen Mary's Hospital, occupancy is 150 with15-20 new admissions daily. Cancer patients have occupied 90% of 65 beds in surgery and radiotherapy, they said. Elaborating further, Dr Singh said, human resources have been overstretched because many doctors are suffering from Covid. Also, staff members deployed in Covid wards cannot be deployed at non-Covid wards because they may be virus carriers and can inadvertently pass it to non-Covid patients, he added. Sources said, KGMU vicechancellor Lt Gen (retd) Dr Bipin Puri also updated the secretary of medical education on the situation and sought help from the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bursting-at-seams-kgmu-asks-hosps-to-share-load/articleshow/83075151.cms||---

CID is probing Jalan’s complaints against former police chief Param Bir Singh, encounter specialist Pradeep Sharma and inspector Rajkumar Kothmire of Thane anti-extortion cell. Jalan had alleged he was framed and the officers allegedly extorted Rs 5 crore from him and other bookies. Jalan said Ritesh Shah, with whom they had a financial dispute, filed a false complaint and police implicated them in a betting case. Sharma denied Sonu’s allegations.  The witness, Chirag Majlani, submitted a two-page letter to CID in Hindi. He told CID officials he did not understand the contents of his statement to Thane police as it was recorded in Marathi. He said though he was a witness in the case an inspector threatened him and extorted money. — Ahmed Ali||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/extortion-case-statement-was-not-recorded-properly-by-copsin-mumbai/articleshow/83076822.cms||Ahmed Ali

At a time when people are making money through black marketing and hoarding, Pratapnagar Gurdwara Management Committee and Sikh youths are running a medical helpline where essential equipment such as PPE kits, oximeters, masks, sanitisers, gloves, vapour-steamer machines, etc are being sold at very cheap rates. “The gurdwara is closed, but good work from the holy place can never cease. Looking at the severity of the second wave, we thought of beginning a medical store where people could avail quality products at reasonable prices. We launched the store on May 19 and so far have sold items worth approximately Rs 7 lakh,” Shammi Singh Arora, the vice-president of the gurdwara management committee, said. N95 masks, which cost Rs 80 to Rs 100 in the open market, are being sold here for Rs 15. Similarly, PPE kits, which cost between Rs 500 and Rs 1000, are available for Rs 200. A 110ml sanitiser bottle is being sold for Rs 30 instead of Rs 60 in the market. “Medical shops are charging Rs 2,000 for branded oximeters, but we are providing it for Rs 650. The vapour-steamer machine, which sells for Rs 300 to Rs 500, is available for Rs 180 at our store,” Arora said. As the news started to spread, more and more people are now coming to the gurdwara to buy these medical items. The store functions from 8am-11 am and 4pm-6 pm. A team of around 15 volunteers are devoting their time for the service of the needy. With the increasing demand for items, Sikh volunteers are busy contacting manufacturers and wholesalers for procurement of goods. “We are procuring items from manufacturers and companies at Bhilwara, Indore, Ahmedabad and other cities as per the requirement. We are not making any money, only the transportation cost is added to the cost price and so it is a no loss-no profit service for people,” Inderjeet SIngh, another volunteer, said. The gurdwara committee has also purchased an oxygen concentrator that produces 6 litres of oxygen in a minute. The machine is given free of cost for three days to needy at homes and after that a charge of Rs 1,000/per day is charged for the extended period. Free oxygen cylinders too are being given to patients on being shown hospital slips.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/visit-chittor-gurdwara-for-corona-meds-at-cheap-rates/articleshow/83074102.cms||---
---||Chennai||Finding strength through sharing||“I don’t want to talk. I would like to just listen," says a tremulous voice. "We have lost five of our relatives, including my elder brother, in a day and I am just dealing with getting the news of a loved one’s death every two hours," she says. The others in Zoom session are quick to reassure her, and welcome her into the group, so she can stay, listen to their own stories of battling Covid-19 and, hopefully, draw some strength. For that’s what Listening Circle is all about. Launched by Chennai-based Gazal Raina and Noida-based Harpret Gupta about a month ago, the online support group meets every Saturday at 11am so that people can share their experience of successfully fighting Covid-19. "When my friend, who was in Delhi, got Covid-19, he shut off from his family after some time as he was completely tired of all the advice he was getting," says Gazal, who is also the founder of Milaap, a social support group that furthers the cause of co-parenting. "I realised that it is exasperation that forces many Covid-19 patients to go into mental isolation. Many of them also cannot share their feelings with family members as they are already stressed. I wanted to give them a space where they can share their experiences with people who understand their journey," she says. That’s when she reached out to Harpret of Kuchh Achha KaroNa, an initiative that she started along with her friends Natasha Bhasin Kukreja, Archit Goel and Kanika Gupta, which supports patients or families dealing with Covid through sessions on yoga, breathing, and zumba. And Listening Circle was born, with people from all over the country — Chennai, Bihar, Gurgaon, Delhi — attending the sessions. To encourage people in the Zoom session to share, Harpret shares her own experience of battling Covid. "My husband tested positive in April. It was scary and exhausting as I had two young children to care for," says Harpret, who also soon tested positive, along with her in-laws, child, and three of the domestic help. "Focusing less on the fear of Covid and more on how to come out of it helped me," says Harpret. "People also should pick a doctor and put their faith in them so they can heal better." And that’s the message — to stay positive, and not focus on fear Covid — that emerges from the session. "When I got mild fever and body pain, I quarantined, didn’t do any housework, kept myself happy and slept it off as I didn’t want fear to undermine my positive affirmations," says an elderly woman. "My brother never told me how high my viral load was. He made it seem light and so, thankfully, I wasn’t scared," shares a young man. "The role a caregiver plays is very vital." Caregivers can also join the Listening Circle. And people can choose to remain anonymous on the platform. Most people who have recovered feel as if they have got a new lease of life. "When I tested positive, I actually enjoyed the whole journey. I didn’t work, watched Netflix and took life slow," says a woman. "By going through a phase when I could have died, I realised that I should do something meaningful with my life." So she has begun trying new things — learning yoga, meditation, attending book reading sessions — and living life to the fullest. "Earlier, though I worked round the clock, I just did it robotically. Now I ensure I am making a difference," she says. "It changed my entire perspective of life."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/finding-strength-through-sharing/articleshow/83072654.cms||Priya Menon
---||Dehradun||After 8 years, Uttarakhand ‘ghost village’ comes back to life||DEHRADUN: The last family at Chaundli village in Pauri locked up and left in 2013. It had been a small village, with 40 families, but with no roads, no mobile connectivity and waning resources over the years, they started leaving. It turned into a “ghost village”. Those from the village would drop by once a year for religious rituals and leave again. But the pandemic seems to have catalysed a trend of reverse migration. Three families have made their way back from Delhi this month. Brothers Jagdish Singh, Manmohan Singh and Jagmohan Singh returned to Chaundli with their families, about 20 people in all, three weeks ago. The pandemic had robbed them of hope for a good life in the city, Delhi, and they thought being home might open up more options. So, while their children went back to Delhi for studies, the three brothers who have retired from their jobs decided to stay on. They wanted to take up farming. “Chaundli was once known for its Basmati rice. Despite challenges, the village would produce 40 quintals at one point. Some villagers in this belt would also grow vegetables. This was before everyone left. But the Singh family is confident it can bring those days back,” said Jagmohan Dangi, a social activist from the area. Other settlements, which are nearly ghost villages with just a family or two living there, have also been receiving their former residents back. At Thanool in Pauri, which had two families left until last month, there has been a slow trickle of people coming back from cities. “We see a sudden return of a good number of people back to the village,” said Thanool gram pradhan Narendra Singh Negi, from one of the two families that had stayed back. “At Aalasu, also in Pauri, there had been only two families for many years. But in the past few months, about 10 families have come back. The same has happened in Butli … People who hail from my village and others nearby have been calling me up from different states asking about the feasibility of coming back.” Uttarakhand has over 1,700 ghost villages, most of which are in Pauri and Almora. Little has changed, however, with the problems that turned them into uninhabited settlements. “Jobs, roads, health and education are still challenges. We have tried to improve road connectivity on our own in some villages but some help from the authorities could really change things for us,” Negi said. Agriculture minister and government spokesperson Subodh Uniyal promised help. He said, “A large number of people are returning to villages and the state government is making efforts to encourage them to stay here … Covid-19 numbers are going down and once the situation is under control, we will focus on providing more opportunities to those returning to their villages.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/after-8-years-ukhand-ghost-village-comes-back-to-life-as-migrants-return-home/articleshow/83071057.cms||Kautilya Singh

Valpoi police said that the accused belong to Caranzol, Kumthol, and Bandirwada areas within the jurisdiction of Savordem village panchayat. PI Sagar Ekoskar told TOI that the accused have been booked under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) including attempt to murder, using force to prevent a state servant from discharging his duties, rioting and obstructing public servants using criminal force. The incident had occurred on May 12, when Prabhudesai along with forest officer Tejaswinihad gone to inspect the felling of trees. The situation became tense when the team arrived at Caranzol and seized a sickle from an elderly woman at the tree-felling site. Locals came to know about the incident and gathered in large numbers. A scuffle took place between locals and forest officials, leaving Prabhudesai and three locals injured at Bandirwada. The RFO reportedly fired 3 gunshots in the air to disperse the crowd. Later, villagers resorted to road blockade of Mhadei wildlife sanctuary for several hours. The officials were released only after the arrival of a police team from Valpoi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/54-booked-for-assaulting-mhadei-forest-officer/articleshow/83074112.cms||---

The Chatushrungi police recovered a cellphone and gold ornaments, worth Rs1.34 lakh, from the arrested duo —Sharada Anil Ambildhage (36) of Thergaon — the helper at the Covid care facility — and her aide, Anil Tukaram Sangme (35) of Rahatni. TimesViewTheft of valuables of the deceased at a healthcare facility is shocking to say the least. It served a jolt to the grieving family members for sure because the stolen valuables could well be fond memories of their loved one. While police should ensure exemplary punishment to the Covid care hub’s staffer and her aide, the authorities of all hospitals should conduct thorough background check of potential employees before hiring to stop even such stray incidents.Dr Kiran Bhise of the Covid care centre had on Friday lodged a complaint with the police after relatives of a deceased patient reported theft in the facility. Senior inspector Rajkumar Waghchaure of the Chatushrungi police said, “No one is allowed inside the Covid care facility barring patients, doctors, nurses and helpers. Ambildhage used to clean and sweep the Covid care facility.” He said, “After some theft incidents in the facility in last few months, the authorities installed CCTV cameras on its premises to avert such incidents. Ambildhage was found working suspiciously near the bed of a patient in the CCTV footage. Based on this suspicion, the police questioned her, and the theft incident came to light. The police then realised that Ambildhage used to hand over the stolen ornaments and valuables to Sangme.” Waghchaure said, “During the questioning of the duo, it was revealed that Ambildhage and her aide had stolen valuables of three deceased patients in the past two months. We suspect that they had stolen valuables of serious patients also.” He said, “Ambildhage was employed in the Covid care facility as a helper earlier also. She was removed from her service in December 2020, after repeated theft incidents. The facility was running short of helpers this year and the woman was hired again in February.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/covid-care-hub-helper-aide-held-for-stealing-valuables-of-deceased-patients/articleshow/83074110.cms||---

The area is 20-25km from the boundary of Nagzira Wildlife Sanctuary and this is the first season when water is supplied through tankers. We are doing it from small savings with the NGO and contributions from individuals,” said Sawan Bahekar, president of Sewa.The Jambhli block is rich in wildlife and connects forest areas of three ranges — Sadak Arjuni, North Deori and Goregaon. Moreover, the area falls in the Navegaon-Nagzira Tiger Reserve (NNTR) corridor and is also a buffer zone of NNTR.It is a good habitat for transient and resident tigers, leopards, gaurs, sloth bears, and herbivores. The camera trap images show these animals frequent the water body to quench thirst.“Sewa has been working to revive dead water sources since 2015. For two years we spent money from our pockets to revive these small streams and water holes. After 2017, under the Integrated Tiger Habitat Conservation Programme implemented by the IUCN, we took up rejuvenation of perennial water bodies by cleaning silt and building small check-dams upstream and downstream,” Bahekar adds.“Before we started work on this project, the rainwater used to run off and by February there used to be no water in small streams and perennial nullahs causing problems for wild animals. We recharged these sources without damaging the natural flow. Now there is water till June,” said Chetan Jasani and Ankit Thakur, Sewa volunteers.“As the landscape is big and there are artificial sources too, we felt a need to fill these sources with water by deploying tankers. At least 3-4 tankers of water are being supplied daily to increase storage,” said local villagers Naresh Mendhe and Santosh Kore. “Not stopping at reviving the water sources, our volunteers are also conducting litmus tests of these water sources as wildlife criminals have a tendency to hunt animals by poisoning the small water ponds. Recently, when such an incident came to light after litmus test, we reported it,” said Bahekar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/sewa-volunteers-spend-from-pocket-to-supply-water-for-wildlife/articleshow/83074136.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Yadav told TOI that the third phase of door-to-door survey has been completed where it was checked if children and adults have influenza-like-illness (ILI) symptoms or black fungus. He also reviewed the works of the sub-divisional level core committee. He added that the main problem in border areas is irregular supply of drinking water. He asked the engineer to ensure proper supply of drinking water here and send water tankers where needed. Revenue minister Harish Choudhary too joined the third door-to-door ILI survey in rural areas. He supervised the measures being taken by the administrative teams. Choudhary has been continuously visiting villages since the past few days.

---||Hyderabad||Hussainsagar: Murky waters where champions are bred||HYDERABAD: Despite being polluted and its declining oxygen levels that may not support marine life anymore, the Hussainsagar has been the training ground for several champions who are creating waves in the world of sailing. From underprivileged children who are being selected for national and international championships to those marching towards careers in the army, the lake is creating space for young sailors from diverse backgrounds to reach new heights despite the lake having its own share of environmental challenges. Among those making sailing history after training in the lake are 14-year-old L Jhansipriya, and 15-year-old V Vaishnavi who recently made it to the Indian team for one of the largest sailing championships in Italy. “I overcame all my fears about sailing when I first started practicing in this lake. It provided us with a very calm and safe environment,” Vaishnavi said about her training experience. The duo who are preparing to take part in the world championship in Italy’s Lake Riva Del Garda, which is known for challenging weather conditions, said that they are confident they will do well and that their training experience in Hussainsagar and other international championships will be of help. Each year, around the first week of July, sailors from all over the country make their way to Hussainsagar to compete at the Multiclass National Level Sailing Championships. The event, popularly known as Hyderabad Sailing Week, is the oldest and one of the most popular sailing events in the country. Meanwhile, another student from Rasoolpura’s Alpha Omega School, Manideep Perikatta, was selected for the Army Boy Sports Company in Bengaluru – set up by the Indian Army under its engineers’ regiment in February. “I got selected after receiving four months training at Hussainsagar,” he said, adding that he learned a lot about sailing at the lake and that it was a very good experience. While stating that the lake has its own share of challenges, founder of the Yacht Club of Hyderabad (YCH), Suheim Sheikh, who has been sailing in Hussainsagar for almost 40 years said, “I used to go to the Secunderabad Sailing Club when I first started sailing as a 12-year-old. The water at that point of time was clear. At that time, we would be able to tell the wind speed by just looking at the waves that used to form in the lake. Now there are rarely any waves because the water is much thicker these days.” Speaking about the pollution, Sheikh said, “I have always maintained that industry and population of Hyderabad cannot relentlessly pollute out water bodies and expect the government to spend crores on cleaining. We need a much more compliant and conscientious citizenry that does not throw waste into the feeder nullahs and then the lake will automatically regenerate themselves.” Hardly any ripples despite huge spendDespite the government spending hundreds of crores on cleaning operations, the desired results still look far away, Koride Mahesh explains · In a fresh attempt to curb foul smells and algal blooms, HMDA roped in Bengaluru-based Nacof India for cleaning operations. These are likely to go on for another six months · Nacof had undertaken bio-remediation operations in the lake in 2018 but officials say the results were short-lived · HMDA has called for tenders for automated trash collection at four locations in the lake for five years · A Canada-based company had taken remediation works between March and August 2020 but the contract was terminated as work was not up to the satisfaction of HMDA · Hussain Sagar Lake & Catchment Improvement Project (HCIP) is the biggest clean-up project taken up for the lake with financial assistance of Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) · HCIP was taken up at a cost of Rs 370 crore of which Rs 325 crore has been spent so far.

They have been offered complete fee waiver by the school up to intermediate, as both their parents—Suchita and Anurag Awasthi—succumbed to corona infection within six days last month. The Awasthi family suffered another jolt when Anurag Awasthi’s elder brother Anupam, too, died of corona infection just a week later. On Saturday, Anupam’s younger daughter Aditi Awasthi (15) took her written test for admission to class ninth. The school has offered to 50% waiver of her fee. Her mother Mamta Awasthi now has to arrange money for her uniform, books, and stationery. Both Aditi and her elder brother, Anant Awasthi (17), who cleared his high school in 2020, are now solely dependent on the monthly monetary help announced by the state government on Saturday. Anurag and Anupam both were in private jobs. The family has very little savings which won’t last till the end of this year. “Since last year, all four cousins are sitting at home, as the corona pandemic left our parents jobless. Now I’m searching for a job, as I need to support my mother as well as sister and two cousins,” said Anant, who wanted to become a cop but now has an uncertain future. Similarly, some 35km away from Lucknow in a remote village of Malihabad, Pooja (17) has isolated herself in grief following her father’s death. Eldest among five siblings, the girl dropped out of school last year to support her family. Her gloomy eyes fill with tears when anyone questions about her father. Her younger siblings, like Anit (15), Shivangi (13), Ajit (7) and Ayush (5), are currently struggling to arrange twice meal a day for themselves and their mother. The sole bread earner of the family Sanjevan Lal, who was a daily wage labour with no land or farm field, died of Covid-19 on May 3. Rajkumari along with her children Pooja, Shivangi and Ayush“We have been poor throughout our lives. My husband was a big strength for me. We both were striving hard to get our children educated and get our daughters married but today I’m struggling to feed my children,” said Rajkumari, who lives under a hut covered with black plastic sheet along with her children. Around two weeks back, the family was provided with some ration by state authority. Now, they hope that the help announced by the state government would come to help them. According to child welfare committee, Lucknow, there are at least seven children registered with the district probation office who have lost their both parents. However in total 80 children have been affected (majority lost one parent) by corona pandemic. Speaking to TOI, CWC member Sangeeta Sharma said, “The corona pandemic has not only impacted children of extremely marginalized society and middle class, but also of well to do educated families. For example, Shakti Nagar-based Priya Handa who has been a teacher in two very reputed schools of Lucknow is struggling to secure the future of her two children; age three and two.” “My husband Anshu Handa succumbed to corona in April and now I find it difficult to raise my children, as I don’t have a job. How will I meet the expenses of my children,” said Priya, who currently lives with her inlaws.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/covid-orphans-traumatic-tales-7-lose-both-parents/articleshow/83075158.cms||Arvind Chauhan
---||Nagpur||Ayush-64 tablets start reaching Covid patients in city, rural areas||Nagpur: Asymptomatic, mild and moderate Covid-19 positive patients in the city as well as rural areas are being given Ayush-64 tablets, which reportedly lead to speedy recovery, from the Regional Ayurveda Research Institute (RARI), Nandanvan. RARI works under Central Council for Research In Ayurvedic Sciences, Ministry of Ayush. In another development, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) plans to open five Post Covid care centres from May 31 for diagnosis and treatment of mucormycosis. To ensure proper oxygen supply, the district on Saturday received 50 molecular sieve oxygen generators as a donation from Bauddha upasaka and upasikas from Thailand. Assistant director of RARI Dr R Govind Reddy told TOI that they had received 12 lakh tablets of Ayush-64. “We are handing over the tablets to Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s rapid response team (RRT) which are distributing them to home isolated patients in the 10 zones. Similarly, patients in home isolation and in Covid care centres (CCC) in rural areas are being given the tablets with the help of Zilla Parishad,” he said. Dr Reddy further said that relatives of patients can bring positive report, copy of Aadhaar card or any address proof to the RARI centre at Nandanvan and MLA Hostel and provide mobile number to get the tablets. Bhausaheb Mulak Ayurved College and Research Hospital, Butibori, has also started a centre on Friday. Guardian minister Nitin Raut and former minister Rajendra Mulak inaugurated the centre on Friday by distributing tablets to relatives of 10 patients. Principal Dr Madhusudan Gupta said the tablets will be given to relatives of patients coming to the centre. “We are collecting daily list of positive cases. A team contacts the patients and gives information about the tablets,” he said. Dr Reddy said their team is taking follow-up from patients who are taking tablets on 7th, 15th, 21th and 30th day. “We are noting down progress of the patients and analysing it,” he said. “RARI is also consulting private Covid hospitals for distribution of tablets. Ayush-64 tablets are permissible even if patients are taking allopathic medicines. Standalone consumption is also allowed,” he said. According to Dr Reddy, trails of Ayush-64 were conducted successfully at GMCH with the help of Dr Rajesh Gosavi from June to December last year. NMC chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar said, “Post Covid care centres will be started at KT Nagar, Indira Gandhi Rugnalaya, Pachpaoli Women’s Hospital, Sadar Diagnostic Centre and Pakwasa Hospital. Diagnosis of mucormycosis will be done on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday. Experts will counsel suspected patients on Wednesday and Saturday,” he said. Chairman of Task Force Dr Prashant Nikhade conducted a meeting and gave training to medical officers, 10 doctors and nurses on Saturday. Bauddha upasaka and upasikas of Thailand on Saturday handed over 50 molecular sieve oxygen generators with capacity of five litre each to divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar. Thanking the Bauddha upasaka and upasikas, Nitin Raut said these oxygen concentrators could be brought due to efforts of principal secretary of energy department Dr Harshdeep Kamble and his wife- Rojana. The district registered 392 positive cases, 993 recoveries and 14 deaths on Saturday. There have been more recoveries than new cases for the last 30 days. Active cases dropped to 7,478, which is 1.6% of total positive cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ayush-64-tablets-start-reaching-covid-patients-in-city-rural-areas/articleshow/83074122.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

However, there is no clarity yet on other admissions such as Industrial Training Institutes (ITI) and polytechnic institutes. While implementing the Std XI admission process, students appearing for the Common Entrance Examination will be given preference at all junior colleges based on merit. After the first round of admission, remaining vacancies in junior colleges will be open to students on merit basis. The comprehensive guidelines for the Std XI admission process for 2021-22 will be issued separately, stated the notification issued on Friday. The principal of an ITI said, “If Std X students are getting a marksheet, then in all probability, ITIs will go forward with the merit list prepared based on the marks. However, a policy decision has not been announced yet and we will wait for the official announcement.” Officials of the Directorate of Technical Education were unavailable for comment. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/no-clarity-on-admissions-to-iti-polytechnic-institutes-policy-decision-still-awaited/articleshow/83074131.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Chennai||Making the new normal the better one||CHENNAI: In July last year, Dr Santhosh Jacob sent his then pregnant wife to her family’s place in Finland where she could safely deliver, even as he toiled on the frontlines of Covid-19 emergencies at the Chettinad Super Specialty Hospital here. While his son Marcus was born in November 2020, it wasn’t until March 2021, after he had gotten fully vaccinated, that he could fly over and hold him in his arms for the first time. "Vaccination wasn’t just a shot at hope, but my call of duty — to be available for my family as well as put my best foot forward at work," says the 42-year-old orthopaedic surgeon. "I have seen, touched and interacted with more than 1,500 Covid-19 patients in the past six weeks. I feel so much more secure, as does my family, knowing that I can step into the ICU where we have already treated more than 600 patients, and still come back home alright," he says. Dr Jacob is among the two lakh fully vaccinated people in the country today, whose weary hearts can finally bask in the promise of a freer future — one that is undoubtedly expected to bring about a breather, and yet stands significantly different from the life they left behind pre-2020. At a time when the country is fighting tooth and nail against nearly 1,80,000 fresh cases and 3,000 deaths on a daily basis, the small percentage of people who have gotten both their jabs are trying to find a middle ground between a complex understanding of safety and the possibility of new-found freedom after lockdown, especially since experts have been insisting on the importance of masking and distancing after taking the shots. The vaccine has especially been a game-changer for those who find their equilibrium outdoors — running, surfing or cycling — and were forced to stay home for more than a year. In the case of 52-year-old Arun Vasu, who has been a windsurfer for 37 years and a surfer for 10, the first task to accomplish after getting both his shots last month was to hit the sea at Covelong. "I had tried to compensate with exercises at home, but nothing beat the adrenaline rush I got out of surfing. It helped me release much of the stress that had accumulated over the past year, and the fact that I could do it while being safeguarded from infection gave me some semblance of normalcy, which I greatly miss," he says. But to many who have lost loved ones to the disease, and have friends and family struggling to find beds and oxygen, it’s too premature to celebrate. Fresh out of the jaws of the pandemic, there is an overwhelming sense of ‘what-if’ that vaccinated people are feeling, says counselling psychologist Saras Bhaskar. "One may have, gotten vaccinated and feel healthy, but still fear being that one unfortunate exception to the rule, especially after having survived a harrowing period of unprecedented contagion and loss," she says. "Although fully vaccinated, I myself would like to wait for a while before getting patients over and insist on seeing vaccination certificates before letting anyone in." The family of Meenu Seth is among the fully vaccinated ones in their gated community in Pallikaranai, and yet, they have been treading carefully. The 42-year-old pharma company employee lost her father to Covid-19 during the first wave last year. So, despite getting herself and her family vaccinated in April this year, they plan to stay huddled indoors until there’s better news outside. "Our personal loss has shaken our morale in the system, and we aren’t taking any chances. Adding to this is the fact that there is a dearth of resources in hospitals now," says Meenu. "The second wave could come to an end, the city could open up, but I don’t plan to go back to the workplace anytime soon. If my employers aren’t able to accommodate it, I’ll look for another job. We’d like to wait at least a year before we can think about doing anything differently."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/making-the-new-normal-the-better-one/articleshow/83072665.cms||Saranya Chakrapani
---||Dehradun||Complaint for IMA men to be held for ‘talking roughly’ to Ramdev||HARIDWAR: Arun Bhadoria, a Haridwar-based advocate, on Saturday sought an FIR to be registered against Indian Medical Association (IMA) chairman Dr Jayesh Lele and former IMA national president Dr Rajan Sharma for “threatening and misbehaving with” Baba Ramdev during a TV debate earlier this week. Police have received the complaint but have not filed a case so far. Bhadoria has, meanwhile, threatened to move court if police do not act on his complaint. In the TV debate, in which Ramdev, Sharma and Lele were present, Lele questioned the credibility of “Coronil”, Patanjali’s drug to treat the symptoms of Covid-19 and when interrupted by the yoga guru, asked Ramdev several times to “keep quiet and listen when he was talking”. Speaking to TOI, Bhadoria said, “Baba Ramdev is an icon of yoga and Ayurveda. Dr Lele and Dr Sharma misbehaved with and even threatened the yoga guru during the TV debate, which has deeply hurt my feelings. I want a criminal case to be filed against both doctors.” Bhadoria has also previously filed cases against Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad (ABAP) chief Narendra Giri, among others. Circle officer (city) Abhay Singh said, “We have received the complaint and are probing it. A case has not been registered yet.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/advocate-files-complaint-against-ima-officials-for-threatening-ramdev-on-tv/articleshow/83071111.cms||MS Nawaz
---||Kochi||All village offices to be modernized: Revenue min||Thrissur: Revenue Minister K Rajan on Saturday said that the government would give utmost importance to modernize all the 1,666 village offices in the state and to make these institutions smart and ‘people-friendly face of the government’. Speaking to TOI here on the sidelines of a programme here, the minister said the modernization programme will have five components and digitization will be one of them. Improving the infrastructure, e-service providing, resurvey and setting up front offices will be other components. “All these components will be implemented in phases,’’ the minister said. As per the preliminary information received, ,326 village offices have completed digitization of thandaper register, while over 1,400 villages have completed the digitization of basic tax registry (BTR). The government is also keen on completing the digital resurvey process at the earliest. The resurvey process was launched in 1966, and only 54% of the resurvey was completed during the last 54 years. The resurvey has been completed in 1,024 villages and of them, 928 have undertaken this process manually, which had led to numerous complaints. Out of them, 88 have undertaken the process using the aged ‘totally station’ system, the minister said. The government has allocated Rs 12 crore for starting 28 continuously operating reference station (CORS) systems, a modern technology used for land survey, in the state. “This will be a herculean task. It will require deployment of 35 officials for three months to complete resurvey in one village. It entails massive manpower deployment and other challenges. But once it is completed, it will be a major achievement,’’ the minister said. Rajan said the government would take meticulous steps to take back the encroached land, which are being held by groups even after the lease period, or even after completing the objective of leasing. “The focus will be on launching measures which are legally sustainable and not gaining some short-lived media attention,’’ he said. Providing title deeds to the deserving people as early as possible will be another top priority programme of the government, he said. The minister said that the government would make all out efforts to ensure that there was no landless person in the state. He disclosed that the government would be constructing 10 new revenue towers and taluk offices in the state and Rs 10 crore has been earmarked for this.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/all-village-offices-to-be-modernized-revenue-min/articleshow/83071114.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Will 'convert' 1,000 allopathic doctors to Ayurveda, says Ramdev||HARIDWAR: In the backdrop of controversy over his comments on the adverse role of allopathic drugs in the treatment of Covid-19, yoga guru Ramdev said during a yoga session at his Yog Gram centre in Haridwar that he has set a target of converting 1000 allopathic doctors to Ayurveda during a year’s time. Addressing participants assembled from across the country to participate in a yoga camp with him, Ramdev said that several allopaths holding MBBS and MD degrees were also attending the yoga camp. “These are the doctors who have faced the side-effects of allopathic drugs and have now turned to yoga and Ayurveda. Some of them have taken voluntary retirement from their practice and decided to follow our path. In fact, I have decided that in the next one year, our target would be to convert over 1000 allopathic doctors to naturopathy,” he said. Taking a jibe at IMA president Dr JA Jayalal, he said that he is “not aiming at religious conversion of the doctors like the IMA head is doing but looking at a transformation of their beliefs.” He further said, “It is not bad to support and protect one’s faith and religion. Christianity is backed by big world powers, Islam has the support of a large empire, drug industry is backed by big powers, but yoga, Ayurveda, naturopathy — who will support them? It is you, the people who have supported them, otherwise nobody was taking these ancient sciences seriously.” He added that “if people give just 2% of their earnings as donation to propagate these therapies, a lot more can be achieved.” A couple of days ago, while conducting a morning yoga session at the camp, the yoga guru had said that “parents who cannot keep their children healthy should be penalised and so should rulers who can’t keep the people of their country disease-free.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/now-ramdev-says-he-has-set-a-target-of-converting-1000-allopathic-doctors-to-ayurveda/articleshow/83071088.cms||MS Nawaz
---||Delhi||Delhi govt’s first drive-through vax centre kicks off at Chhatrasal||NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday kickstarted Delhi government’s first drive-through vaccination centre at Chhatrasal Stadium where vaccines for 45+ age group will be administered for free. It is Delhi’s second drive-through vaccination centre. Those below 45 years will also be allowed to get the shots at this facility after the vaccination shortage is over. Currently, vaccination for the 18-44 age group is on hold in the capital due to shortage of vaccines. “People can come here in their cars, motorcycles, even on foot, and can get vaccinated. Currently, this has been initiated for those above the age of 45 years because there is no vaccine for people aged less than 45 years. As soon as adequate vaccines arrive, vaccination for those below the age of 45 (18-44 years) will also be started,” the chief minister stated after inaugurating the facility. He also interacted with some of the beneficiaries and learned that they were very happy with the entire arrangement. Explaining the steps the Aam Aadmi Party government is taking to fight vaccination shortage, Kejriwal said Delhi government had floated a global tender for procuring 1 crore vaccine doses on urgent basis. “We are making all the efforts from our side but till now, all the governments that floated global tenders did not get encouraging response. So we have floated the global tender with the hope that a company comes forward, but on a general note from what I have understood is that all the big vaccine manufacturing companies of the world want to deal directly with the central government and are communicating directly with them,” the chief minister stated. Delhi government has demanded drugs from the Centre as per the needs for fighting black fungus. “I understand that there is a countrywide paucity of black fungus medicines. The central government is giving whatever it can. As I understand, more injections of this medicine will be procured and will be distributed to all the state governments,” said Kejriwal. While AAP has been assailing the Centre over vaccination shortage, the opposition parties have accused it of politicising the issue. On the question of politicising the vaccine procurement, Kejriwal said, “We just want vaccines, where is the politicisation in this? People need vaccines, they should tell where we should get the vaccines from. The central government has to procure the vaccines. After doing so, they should give them to us and we will administer them to everyone. This is not the time for petty politics. This is not the time to play the blame game. This is not the time for finger-pointing. This is not the time for debate and counter. The country is suffering from a pandemic.” Kejriwal further stated that “the experience of all of the world shows that vaccination is the sole solution. They should buy vaccines for the entire country and distribute them to the state governments.” “We will administer them. Why they are debating over this is beyond my understanding,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govts-first-drive-through-vax-centre-kicks-off-at-chhatrasal/articleshow/83072700.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Nagpur||Paid vax for 18+ at 3 Nagpur private hospitals from June 1||NAGPUR: Three private hospitals in city have confirmed that they will be administering Covid-19 vaccines in Nagpur mostly from June 1. While Wockhardt Hospital has already started vaccination of corporate company staff at their respective office premises, Kingsway Hospital and American Oncology Institute will start the programme soon. At least two – Alexis Multispecialty Hospital and Spandan Diagnostic Centre — are set to receive Sputnik V by June second week. The gap between 2 doses of Sputnik V is 3 weeks (21 days). “All above 18 years of age will be eligible for Covishield vaccination,” states a letter issued by Kingsway. Initially, vaccination will be for associations and corporate. It will cost Rs 850 at the hospital and Rs 1,000 if on site. The additional cost include charges for administrative work, hiring of nurse and RMO. Sources said that Kingsway is set to get its first order from Serum Institute of India (SII) on Sunday. Wockhardt has already started onsite vaccination of several corporate company employees. “We had procured doses centrally from SII. Companies had already booked their doses with us which we are currently administering. In a later phase, we might start doses for the general public,” said Avinash Agrawal, marketing head of the hospital here. At the American Oncology Institute (AOI), it will be Covishield for all walk-in registrations. “Ours is a non-Covid hospital in Nagpur and the safest site for vaccination as infection risk is low. We will be getting a share of doses from our centralized procurement by Monday,” said Jitendra Zade, marketing head of AOI here. Alexis, which is also part of a hospital chain, will serve Sputnik V jabs. “We will be getting vaccine doses by June second week. In the initial phase, we will be conducting vaccination of corporate employees,” said Mansi Agrawal from the hospital’s marketing team. Spandan Diagnostic Center is also in contact with Dr Reddy’s Pharma which is currently the main distributor for Sputnik.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/paid-vax-for-18-at-3-ngp-pvt-hosps-from-june-1/articleshow/83074133.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Goa||Goa: Netravali residents worry over damaged power poles||POINGUINIM: In the densely forested Netravalli region, Cyclone Tauktae brought down many trees leaving a number of electricity poles damaged. And now, with the monsoon fast approaching, these poles which are either bent over or broken, and the risk they pose, have become a cause of worry for the Netravalli village panchayat. Several electricity poles across the different wards of Netravali need to be repaired or replaced on priority, said deputy sarpanch Abhijit Desai. Saljini residents in particular have made a fervent plea to the power department to either repair or replace the damaged poles before the monsoon. Villagers fear that the situation will worsen with the rain as the soil will loosen, thereby causing the bent or damaged poles to come crashing down, endangering lives. This apart, the furthermost hamlets of Verlem and Saljini will be the worst affected as the areaswill be leftin darkness, said Desai. “I have spoken to the linesmen, but the work must be done on priority,” he said. Executive engineer Vinayak Mhalshekar said that he is aware of the plight of these people and that he will soon get the poles either relocated or set in the right position so that the safety of residents is not compromised. Some of the residents also urged the EE to look into the long-pending demand of underground cabling in Netravalli village. “No doubt the electricity department has worked on the lines damaged by the cyclone. But as this area is forested and hilly, trees keep falling, which could damage the lines,” said a villager.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/netravali-residents-worry-over-damaged-power-poles/articleshow/83074130.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Get ready to tackle MIS-C in children: HC tells govt||Nagpur: With children likely to get affected by a probable third wave of Covid, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court has directed the state government to plan for multi system inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C), also called ‘MIS-N’ in neonatals. This is increasingly found patients who are recuperating from the virus. While hearing a suo motu public interest litigation on beds shortage, based on TOI report, a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Avinash Gharote also asked the government to consider inclusion of this disease for treatment under the Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Scheme. The directives came after amicus curiae Shreerang Bhandarkar pointed out that black, white or yellow fungus are side effects of post Covid. Many other diseases are also found in patients after their recovery, he added. “One of them is MIS-C which is serious and needs the preparedness of the state. It causes impairing of heart, lungs and kidneys. Therefore, in anticipation, the government would also have to make appropriate preparations for dealing with it,” he said. While quoting pursis filed by the centre, the bench noted that the ministry of external affairs (MEA) was told to perform an active role in procuring the raw material from abroad for production of Amphotericin-B Lipid Complex used for treating mucormycosis. “But the pursis doesn’t provide us specific information of the steps taken by MEA and by the department of pharmaceuticals in this regard. We request the centre to apprise us of efforts to increase the production of such primary drugs and increase their supply to different states, including Maharashtra,” the judges said. Further citing centre’s pursis, the judges mentioned that on May 5, 16,500 vials of Amphotericin-B were allotted to Maharashtra and then there was no supply till May 18. The allocation restarted on May 19 with only 5,700 vials. Thereafter, up to May 24 only 4,360, 5,090 and 4,060 vials have been given to the state on different dates. “Since the regulation of production of this drug is entirely in the hands of the centre, we are of the view that it needs to jack up its efforts in increasing its production in entire India. Of course, some steps have been taken by it, as the number of companies which were manufacturing Amphotericin B has now risen from 6 to 11. It’s informed that the newly added firms would be manufacturing this drug shortly,” they said. MSEDCL donates Rs1.10cr under CSR funds Responding to HC’s query, MSEDCL counsel DM Kale informed that it had already made a contribution of Rs 1.10 crore under the CSR funds from which 20 ventilators were purchased for the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) here. Kale added that even MSETCL is also willing to make its contribution and details would be placed before the next date of hearing. The judges also approved AIIMS request to extend its occupancy certificate granted by the MADC for its new unit for handling Covid-19 patients till June 15.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/get-ready-to-tackle-mis-c-in-children-hc-tells-govt/articleshow/83074140.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Jaipur||Pakistan migrants with IDs get Covid jabs in Jodhpur||JODHPUR: Amid the indecision over vaccination of Pakistani migrants with no prescribed identity documents, the medical and health department began camps at two settlements but only for those who have valid ID cards. Around 350 persons were vaccinated at two sites, Kaliberi and Anganva, on Saturday, which was an addition to 150 such migrants who were vaccinated in April. With their settlements at six locations of the city, the number was, however, miserably low considering the beginning of their vaccination in April, especially when these migrants have been consistently reiterating demand for inoculation. Seemant Lok Sangthan president Hindu Singh Sodha said their primary concern was vaccination of those migrants who do not have any documents. CMHO Balwant Manda, however, said those migrants who have any of the seven prescribed identity documents were being vaccinated first and they would be followed by those who have citizenship but do not have any identity documents yet. “For this, a facilitator has been roped in by their organisation, UJAS, who will be gathering information about all such migrants in a prescribed format,” Manda said. But those having no valid identity documents will have to wait until the state government comes up with the final decision in conformity with the standard operating procedure furnished by the central government. It may be noted that there is a large number of such Pakistani migrants in Jodhpur and Jaisalmer districts who do not have any valid identity documents, which is an important eligibility for vaccination. Though the SOP by the central government has referred to such lot as vulnerable population, the decision on their vaccination hangs in balance in absence of interpretation of the SOP by the state government. Both Jodhpur CMHO Manda and Jaisalmer CMHO Kamlesh Choudhary said they have been waiting for the directions from the state government in order to proceed with vaccination of the migrants with no identity document.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/pak-migrants-with-ids-get-covid-jabs-in-jodhpur/articleshow/83074138.cms||---
---||Delhi||Will get 5.5 lakh vax for 18+ only after June 10: Manish Sisodia||NEW DELHI: Delhi will receive 5.5 lakh Covid vaccines for the 18-44 age group from the central government in June, deputy CM Manish Sisodia said, even as he accused the Centre of “vaccine mismanagement”. Addressing a digital press meet on Saturday, Sisodia asked how private hospitals were getting vaccines while the states were being told that there weren’t any. Sisodia also claimed that the BJP-ruled states had opposed waiving tax on vaccines and Covid-related items in the GST Council meeting on Friday. “We will not get the vaccines from the Centre before June 10. It is due to gross mismanagement on the central government’s part that young people are being denied vaccination,” said Sisodia. “The state governments have had to close vaccination centres for the 18-44 age group due to vaccine shortage. The Centre told us that stocks for the youth wouldn’t be available before June 10. Even after that, there won't be enough to inoculate everyone.” Delhi government has claimed it can vaccinate all the 92 lakh people in the 18-44 age group within three months if there were enough vaccines. “We need 1.8 crore vaccine doses for that. However, we are being told that there aren’t enough available,” said Sisodia. “How is it possible then that private hospitals are being supplied to vaccinate young people at high rates? Delhi Government only received 4.5 lakh doses in April and 3.66 lakh in May." Referring to a meeting of the GST Council on Friday, in which finance ministers of all states discussed the possibility of making vaccines and other Covid essentials tax-free, Sisodia disclosed, “As Delhi’s finance minister, I proposed to make vaccines and other health equipment such as pulse oximeters, PPE kits, etc., tax-free. The finance ministers of West Bengal, Punjab and Chhattisgarh demanded the same. This was, however, opposed by finance ministers of many BJP-ruled states.” Criticising BJP, Sisodia said, “We shouldn’t be thinking of profits or revenues from vaccines, oximeters, oxygen concentrators, ventilators, PPE kits. At this point, our priority should be to make our country and our people safe.” Meanwhile, AAP MLA Atishi said Delhi had received 48,890 doses of Covaxin and 83,970 doses of Covishield for the 45+ group from the central government. “The Covaxin will be used only for the second dose. For Covishield, there is a 14-day stock available for the people in this category,” said Atishi. The AAP MLA added “Government vaccination centres for those aged 18-44 years are almost closed across the country, though private hospitals are getting the vaccine. Is there a scam here? While the vaccine is not available for free inoculation by the state governments, they are available for the private hospitals who are vaccinating at high rates.” She also wondered why the Centre did not import the vaccines approved worldwide. “What connivance does the central government have with the two vaccine companies?” Atishi asked. “It is a matter of grave concern that most states, including Delhi, aren’t getting vaccines to protect the youth from infection.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/will-get-5-5l-vax-for-18-only-after-june-10/articleshow/83072687.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Lucknow||‘Against NEP spirit’: Lucknow University science faculty board junks CMS||LUCKNOW: The Common Minimum Syllabus (CMS) recommended by the state higher education department was rejected by the science faculty board of the Lucknow University on Saturday due to stiff opposition by the teachers who said it was against the spirit of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and “inferior” to the existing syllabi. The higher education department had on April 20 directed the state universities to revise their syllabi with 70% of the content taken from CMS and 30% of their own. It claimed that CMS is in consonance with NEP. Science teachers at LU, however, rejected the argument saying that NEP advocates academic autonomy of the universities, which means they are free to draft their own syllabi, and asked the dean, faculty of science, to convey sentiments to the higher education department through the university’s registrar. As per LU rules, for revising a syllabus of any subject, the proposal is first approved by the board of studies of the department and then it goes to faculty board for approval before being put up with the academic council for final nod. In the meeting, teachers said that CMS has been prepared for a three-year graduation course, whereas NEP-2020 proposes to increase the duration of the course to four years. Also, the sequence of topics is improper. “It’s like asking students to read a book without teaching them about alphabets and words,” remarked a chemistry professor, pointing out that CMS also prescribes practical classes on the topic, which is impossible as most of the degree colleges are reeling under resource crunch. A mathematics professor said that the CMS asks for practical classes in maths for which a special software was required. “When such a software is not available in some colleges in Lucknow, you can imagine the situation of colleges in other districtsn,” he added. Former head of the geology department, Prof Vibhuti Rai, said: “We need to prepare a framework as envisaged in NEP for undergraduate, postgraduate and PhD and then implement it simultaneously to maintain continuity from the lower to higher levels.” LUTA writes to Governor:Lucknow University Teachers’ Association (LUTA) on Saturday wrote to the chancellor of UP universities and Governor, Anandiben Patel, urging her to stop Common Minimum Syllabus (CMS) being implemented in universities. “The State Universities Act empowers a university to frame its own syllabus. However, CMS limits this power by allowing changes in only 30% of the content,” said the letter, signed by LUTA president Prof Vineet Kumar Verma||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/against-nep-spirit-lu-science-faculty-board-junks-cms/articleshow/83075165.cms||---

The Candolim panchayat has started cutting down large trees, especially mango trees to prepare for the pre-monsoon works, Candolim sarpanch Blaize Fernandes said. “People are scared where trees are leaning and they think they will fall on their houses. Since the state government has not acted in this regard, the panchayat has to step in and do the needful,” he said. He said the panchayat has also engaged labourers to clear drains and nullahs. “We’re prepared for the monsoon,” he said. Calangute sarpanch Shawn Martins said the panchayat has been clearing drains especially near the beach areas. “Because of the beach a lot of sand accumulates on the roads and blocks the drains, so we’ve been clearing that,” he said. “Also because of the recent unseasonal rains, we’ve identified areas where there was water-logging because mud has accumulated in the drains and we’re clearing them. All the big nullahs in Agarwaddo, Naikawaddo and Sauntavaddo are being de-silted by the Water Resources Department (WRD) using earth moving equipment for smooth flow of water,” Martin said, adding most of the work is finished and the remaining drains should be cleared by June 4.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/candolim-panchayat-begins-axing-large-trees-at-risk-of-crashing/articleshow/83074150.cms||---

Before jumping into the canal, she made a video explaining why she was taking this extreme step. She accused police constable Maniram and his wife of harassing her and alleged that the constable had raped her. Police have suspended the constable and a case of abetment of suicide has been lodged against him. On Saturday police recorded the statements of the deceased’s husband to know more about the dispute the woman had with the constable. “It was found that the woman got acquainted with the constable when her family had a dispute with their neighbours over wall construction. Thereafter, both were in a physical relationship, but the woman never complained of rape. Many times, the constable and the woman’s family met for a compromise in the presence of village panchs (heads),” said an investigating officer. When contacted, Rajan Dushyant, superintendent of police, Sriganganagar, said, “The woman committed suicide and in her video, she implicated constable Maniram of rape. We have registered a case of abetment of suicide against Maniram and have suspended him. A probe has been ordered.” “Though the constable is absent from duty ever since the case was registered, he is on our radar. He will be summoned soon for questioning in this matter,” he added. The woman before jumping into the canal had shot a video in which she alleged that the cop was harassing her and had raped her. “She had even sent this video to Maniram. It was also found that the video is being circulated on social sites through Maniram’s fake ID,” said a senior officer. “If Maniram is accused in the case, why will he share the video of suicide of a woman who is implicating him of rape. We have taken the woman’s phone and will send it to FSL. We will also speak to the village panchs,” the officer added. Meanwhile, Maniram and his family are missing from their house situated in ward no 13 of Mateeli police station area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/woman-accuses-constable-of-rape-commits-suicide/articleshow/83074148.cms||---

The bus has been converted into a facility with oxygenated beds to treat patients in need of emergency care before being admitted to hospital. It has three beds and seven seats with provision to supply medical oxygen to the patients. Speaking after handing over the bus to district collector Prashant M Wadnere on Friday night, electricity minister V Senthil Balaji said the bus will be stationed at medical college hospital. “Patients who require oxygen supply can be given immediate care until they get the bed inside the hospital. Ten patients can be handled in the facility at a time,” he said adding that the bus can be moved to other places if needed. He said a facility with 156 oxygenated beds being readied at the marriage hall of Tamil Nadu Newsprint Limited (TNPL) at Pugalur will become operational in a day or two as the trial run of oxygen supply has got under way. Chief minister M K Stalin will inaugurate the facility through video conference from Chennai. The minister thanked CII, Young Indians and industrialists for donating Rs 2.8 crore towards establishing Covid treatment facilities in Karur district. On opposition leader Edappadi K Palaniswami’s comment on Covid-19 management in Karur, he said, “In Salem, an average of 1,412 RTPCR tests were done in March but now the number has been increased to 5800,”he said. Alleging ‘cover up’ of 444 Covid-19 deaths during the first wave under the AIADMK regime, Senthil Balaji said chief minister M K Stalin has made the treatment a transparent process now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/karur-mch-gets-mobile-o2-bus/articleshow/83074158.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Four more days of police custody for Sushil Kumar||NEW DELHI: A Delhi court on Saturday remanded Olympic wrestler Sushil Kumar and another accused person, Ajay Kumar Sehrawat, to four days in police custody, saying that the initial days of investigation were important to ascertain facts related to the murder of a young wrestler at Chhatrasal Stadium. “No one is above the law, the law treats everyone equally,” said metropolitan magistrate Mayank Goel. “Though the Constitution guarantees the right to life and liberty to all persons whether they are accused or not, that right is also subject to certain exceptions. Moreover, the importance of initial investigation in unearthing the truth also has to be seen.” Additional public prosecutor Ashish Kajal earlier sought seven days’ police custody describing Kumar as the “main culprit and mastermind” of the murder. “An innocent young wrestler has died. Both actively participated in the commissions of the offence. It is evident from the video clip and also evident from the statement of an eye witness,” submitted Kajal. The prosecutor told the court that in the last six days of custody, the two accused hadn’t cooperated with the cops. “Rather they showed reluctance. It is necessary, therefore, for police to get their custody so that crucial aspects are ascertained. Many assailants fled the scene. There were seven vehicles at the crime scene, but the linkage of only four vehicles to the case has been established,” Kajal said. Advocate Pradeep Rana, who appeared for Kumar, argued that it was the legal basic principle for police to show the court what they had found after using up six days of his client’s custody. “Freedom cannot be curtailed. How the six days have been consumed should be considered by the court,” he said. The court wanted to know how a purported video clip showing Kumar’s involvement in the brawl — purportedly in possession of police — was “leaked” to the press. Rana responded, “The video is a case property. How was it given to the media? There is a leak. I am not saying the media should be stopped from reporting, but seized material shouldn’t be leaked. The video has been used to make the public think my client is the mastermind.” Kajal’s reaction to the video clip was, “It is a matter of inquiry how it got into the public domain. It might be possible that a co-accused or some other person has leaked it.” The order granting the police custody also stated that the court was duty bound to strike a balance between the fairness of investigation and the rights of the accused. “In the present situation, the allegations against both the accused persons (Kumar and Sehrawat) are very grave and serious in nature. Moreover, there was involvement of a large number of persons in the commission of crime as well as in hiding the accused persons, some of whom belong to some notorious gangs stationed in Delhi and outside Delhi.” The court order also pointed out that certain recoveries, including that of a mobile phone and clothes of the accused persons, were yet to be made. “As such in the interest of justice, it is appropriate to allow the application of the investigating officer for police custody of the accused to the extent of four days only,” the metropolitan magistrate ordered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/4-more-days-of-police-custody-for-sushil/articleshow/83072718.cms||Aamir Khan
---||Kochi||Kerala minister G R Anil promises people-friendly initiatives||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Food and civil supplies minister G R Anil said that all public complaints pending with taluk supply offices would be effectively addressed in a month. “A mechanism would be introduced in all taluk and district supply offices, civil supplies directorate and the office of the civil supplies minister to monitor the public complaints. An official each would be engaged to monitor the system in each of the office. The phone number of that official would be publicised. The toll-free number (1967) for registering public grievance would be connected to the minister’s office. Public may also mail their complaints to min.food.kerala.gov.in,” the minister told a news conference here on Saturday. The decision to ramp up the existing grievance mechanism, the minister said, was taken in the light of the interactions he held with public and media persons. Anil said he would be available for public interaction through a phone-in programme that would go live from 2pm to 3pm every Friday. Public may use this programme to bring into his notice their complaints and suggestions regarding civil supplies, consumer affairs and legal metrology departments. The minister said a grace period would be given to people for surrendering priority ration cards if they don’t belong to categories eligible for the same. Such persons may use the grace period to surrender their priority cards latest by June 30. “No fine or punitive action would be taken against those who surrender such cards on their own, before June 30,” he said. The minister said the procedure for nominating a proxy by those cardholders who are unable to visit the ration shop and collect the supply in person would be simplified.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/minister-anil-promises-people-friendly-initiatives/articleshow/83071175.cms||---
---||Kochi||World Book Day: Short stories||They were born into the digital media age. The so-called Alpha generation---those born since 2010--- are experts at handling technology and spend their time clicking, scrolling, and swiping, having inherited a world of ever-expanding technologies.On the lookout for constant stimuli from smartphone apps and streaming services, they have significantly less ‘story time’ compared to the previous generations. The smartphone era has made children more self-centered, says Sreejith Perumthachan whose novel “Kunjuvinundoru Katha Parayaan” recently bagged the Pala KM Mathew Award, instituted by the Kerala State Institute for Children’s Literature. The benefits of reading go far beyond literacy. In Perumthachan’s words, only stories can prevent the moral decay that awaits the children in the future. Perumthachan says as the planet celebrates World Book Day children should be reminded about going back to stories and developing a deep love of reading. “The protagonist in my novel is Kunju, a four or five-year-old boy. The novel shares Kunju’s experience when he stays with his grandparents. The stories they tell him have a strong influence on him,” he says.Children should be read to at the right age. Parents are key to developing the children’s reading. The challenge is not just getting them to read but getting them to enjoy it too. “Most of our well-known writers have written for children. G Sankara Kurp, Sugathakumari, Akkitham, to name a few, have all written for children. “Manthrikappoocha” of Vaikom Muhammad Basheer was never branded as children’s literature, but it is perfect for a child to read,” says Perumthachan. A child’s knowledge about folktales, local festivals, village life, nature, etc will benefit her immensely in the future. “When I say reading, I don’t mean reading just popular fiction. There is a decline in morality even among children who read such literature. In my opinion, a child growing with a deep love for folklores would learn more values than those who quickly finish big books,” he says. Perumthachan says parents should also have the right taste to discover such stories and tell them to their children. For instance, take stories like ‘Mannaamkatta and Kariyila’. Not having heard such stories leave a vacuum in character development, he says.“Parents must start telling stories to a child when he or she is three or four years old. Besides written stories, we have stories passed down through the generations by word of mouth. For example, anthologies like “365 Kunju Kathakal” by Ashitha can be read to a child, every day for a year. Parents should find out such sources,” he says. Parents’ interest is also key. “Everyone may not like stories or storytelling. You have to make a conscious effort to make the space, and time for books. If you take that effort to get to know about stories and then tell them to your kids, it would teach them great virtues. Knowledge is not enough. A child’s sense to give his seat to an elderly person in a crowded bus comes from good stories, not school education,” says Perumthachan.“I read a story about a boy who said his favourite sound on this planet was the ATM cash-dispensing sound. We should be able to let them know how insignificant something as common as money is. Parents should not reduce themselves to human ATM machines,” says Perumthachan. “With their gadgets, children stay “connected” and look busy, but the question is, what is the worth of this busyness? Our children should not be made to think that it is okay to become professionally successful in life and not have any values,” he says.A magician once converted his child into a parrot. He was however unable to transform him back into a child. The child was hated by parrots because they knew he was not one among them. He was equally ignored by humans because he looked like a parrot. The situation of children nowadays is similar to that of the parrot, says Perumthachan. “In the race towards a pre-set target, children forget to look around and see the life around them. Storybooks would help them have a better perspective of life,” he says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/short-stories/articleshow/83060053.cms||Disney Tom

---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Government officials face hurdles in conducting health surveys||JAIPUR: Health officials, who have been assigned the duty of conducting door-to-door surveys of patients with ILI (Influenza like illness) symptoms, say they face a lot of resistance from people living in Jaipur urban areas in cooperating with them. They say, either the guards at the housing societies and apartments don’t allow them to enter or people living in independent houses refuse to open the doors. They also face similar resistance from people living in slums. However, there’s pressure from higher authorities to cover all houses in the district during the surveys. It has been observed that in urban areas around 70% ILI surveys could be conducted. “The door-to-door surveys are being conducted by nursing staff, nursing students, Asha workers and CHOs. However, they are facing a lot of resistance in getting response from people living in the urban areas of Jaipur. Either they refuse to open the doors or they don’t cooperate with us while providing information. Sometimes, the guards don’t allow them to enter the apartments and gated housing societies. They have to fill up the note-sheet with details including - name of the head of the house, phone number, number of family members etc., and if anybody has ILI symptoms,” said a health official, who did not want to be named. “Such reluctance among people has been observed across the city regardless of any specific area. They also refuse to accept the medical kits. We keep requesting them to provide necessary details. But they refuse and even misbehave with the health officials at times. They even tell the officials not to come again and again. However, the higher authorities instruct us to conduct such surveys on a regular basis and not miss out on a single house. Such reluctance among people is not observed in rural areas,” the official added. Chief Medical and Health Officer (CMHO-1) Dr Narottam Sharma said, “Yes, we have seen such resistance among people in at least 20-25% area of the city. Initially, the resistance was much more. Now, people in some areas have started cooperating with the health officials. Those living in apartments, big colonies and independent houses show reluctance. We try our best to convince them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-officials-face-hurdles-in-conducting-health-surveys/articleshow/83074160.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: 200 small traders duped of lakhs via fake app, 1 nabbed||NEW DELHI: At least 200 small traders in southwest Delhi’s Palam and Uttar Nagar were allegedly duped of lakhs of rupees by a man using a scamming app that showed fake recepits of payments through a online wallet in lieu of the goods bought. Police said that the man would ask for shopkeeper’s phone number instead of scanning the QR code displayed, and generate a notification similar to that of the wallet. The scammer would show the fake notification to the traders and walk away without actually paying. DCP (southwest) Ingit Pratap Singh said that the accused, identified as Kunal Sharma, has been held and his phone with the fake wallet app has been seized. The accused was nabbed by a team led by SHO Paras Nath Verma who started tracking him after several complaints were received about him. One Ramesh Kumar, who had a grocery shop in Palam Village, had also reported about the man. Kumar said the accused bought goods worth Rs 2,560 and showed a notification to him to confirm payment, which later turned out to be false. After the shopkeeper lodged an FIR, the cops took up the probe and used technical as well as local surveillance. “Sources were also deployed near adjoining shops as there was a strong possibility of him trying to dupe others using the aame modus operandi. Finally, the accused was nabbed from Palam,” the DCP added. Meanwhile, in north Delhi’s Inderlok, a 34-year-old man was arrested for allegedly committing burglary at a house when the owners were in hospital for Covid treatment, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/200-small-traders-duped-of-lakhs-via-fake-app-1-nabbed/articleshow/83072731.cms||---

In an interview to TOI, Mami Mizutori, chief of UN office for disaster risk reduction (UNDRR), said Odisha’s example gives important lessons on “strengthening disaster risk governance, investing in preparedness and scenario planning while spreading a greater understanding of disaster risk”. Mizutori said: “Patnaik ... has provided political commitment necessary to build a robust and well-resourced disaster management authority. In 1999, some 10,000 people died on Odisha coastline and that has never been repeated”.  UNDRR has previously appreciated Patnaik’s efforts during cyclone Phailin, in 2013.

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh Board: Class 10 exam cancelled, 12th in July if Covid wanes||LUCKNOW: Taking a cue from Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), the state government on Saturday cancelled UP Board Class 10 exams amid Covid’s lethal second run. Class 12 exams, however, are scheduled for second week of July provided the pandemic wanes. Also, the government decided to promote all students from classes 6 to 8, 9, and11, irrespective of board affiliations. Cancellation of class 10 exams has impacted more than 29.9 lakh registered students and UP Secondary Education Board (UPSEB) has been directed to chalk out a framework for promoting them, said deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma. The Board has sought marks of half-yearly and preboard exams of class 10 students to hammer out the promotion formula. Since Class 12 exams are key to student careers, Sharma said, exams will be held in second week of July, while keeping in mind safety and convenience of students and in adherence to Covid protocols. Over 26.1 lakh candidates have registered for the exam this year. Also, the duration of class 12 exams has been reduced to 1.5 hour from the earlier 3hour schedule and will be spread over 15 days. Also, unlike previous years when students answered any five out of 10 questions, the clause has been relaxed to three of their choice from 10 questions. To ensure social distancing, the state government will raise the number of examination centres. A timetable for the proposed examination will be shortly released by UPSEB. The class 10 and 12 exams, which were to be held from April 24, were rescheduled to May 8 due to panchayat polls. Under the automatic promotion formula forced by the pandemic, the deputy CM said, class 9 or 11 students who took their annual exams will be promoted on basis of their performance and in schools where annual exams are due, internal evaluation will be the yardstick. Sharma, however, said in the absence of any assessment criteria, students would be promoted in a uniform manner. The government has fixed responsibility of district inspector of schools to ensure compliance. In case of violations, parents can lodge complaints.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-board-class-10-exam-cancelled-12th-in-july-if-covid-wanes/articleshow/83075184.cms||Isha Jain
---||Goa||Goa: Coast Guard commissions patrol vessel ICGS Sajag||PANAJI: At a time when the Indian Coast Guard finds itself assisting in disaster relief operations and maritime accidents, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval commissioned a 105m offshore patrol vessel ICGS Sajag. Built by Goa Shipyard Limited (GSL), the indigenously-built warship will be based at Porbandar, Gujarat and will be deployed extensively for EEZ surveillance. The commissioning of the ship is yet another addition to the Indian Coast Guard’s fleet of 157 ships and 62 aircraft. The commissioning of ICGS Sajag will enhance the Indian Coast Guard’s operational capability to discharge multifarious maritime tasks, said Doval. ICGS Sajag is the third in the series of 105m Offshore Patrol Vessels (OPVs) being built by GSL. Fitted with a 40/ 60 Bofors gun and two 12.7 mm guns, the ship is designed to carry one twin engine helicopter and four high speed boats, including two inflatable boats for boarding operation, search and rescue, law enforcement and maritime patrol. “The sustenance and reach, coupled with the latest and modern equipment and system, provides her the capability to perform the role of a command platform and undertake tasks to fulfill the Coast Guard charter,” the Coast Guard said in a statement. The Coast Guard said that the ship is propelled by two 9100 KW diesel engines and can attain a maximum speed of 26 knots. The force has 34 surface platforms at various stages of construction at different Indian shipyards and 16 Advance Light Helicopters are under production at HAL, Bengaluru which will provide the added strength to the surveillance capabilities of ICG to deal with the ever-dynamic maritime challenges, said director general Indian Coast Guard Krishnaswamy Natarajan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/coast-guard-commissions-patrol-vessel-icgs-sajag/articleshow/83074192.cms||Nikhil J Nair

While the city had been reporting one or two daily casualties until the end of April, the city reported nine deaths on many days in the past week. Since the pandemic, close to 58% of the total casualties in the district was reported in the city, while the 14 rural blocks recorded 42% deaths.  The mortality saw a 140% surge in a month, of which a significant number of casualties were reported in Trichy city. Until April 29, the entire district recorded only 213 Covid-19 casualties. But in the second wave, the number of deaths has increased to 517 (excluding the cross notified deaths) as on May 28 in the district. While Ariyamangalam and Srirangam zones each record 20% of the deaths, K Abishekapuram and Ponmalai zones account for 32% and 28% of the deaths. Official sources said that a majority of the deceased had comorbidities and were above 50 years old. Delayed medical attention besides the hesitation towards vaccination was cited as the major reason for the high number of mortalities. Even as the residents aged above 45 were identified as the most vulnerable group, the civic body’s vaccination drive failed to focus on them. Vaccination for 45 and above in UPHCs and GHs continues to remain dull. The vulnerable age group accounted for only 25% of those getting jabs every day. “Vaccination at doorsteps can help the civic body cover the aged population. But authorities are yet to take such a measure,” K P Rangaprasad, joint secretary of Sattapanchayat Iyakkam, said. The hesitation to take the jab continues even among the educated. “The doorstep screening, which is underway in all the four zones, helps identify the vulnerable people and get them medical attention at an early stage. Mortalities will be brought down,” a senior official with Trichy Corporation said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-reports-140-surge-in-mortality-rate-over-a-month/articleshow/83074167.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Jaipur||400 CHCs will be upgraded across Rajasthan to tackle 3rd wave||JAIPUR: As the country is staring at an impending third wave of Covid-19 pandemic, the state government has already started preparing itself to face the situation. The state government has decided to strengthen 300-400 community health centres (CHCs) across the state. Apart from increasing the number of beds, each bed will be linked with an oxygen cylinder or concentrator. Also, ICU facilities with ventilators would be set up in all the CHCs. “We are preparing a module for strengthening of CHCs across the state ahead of the third wave. In a bid to improve rural health infrastructure, about 300-400 CHCs will be strengthened across the state. The objective is to convert these CHCs into model centres,” said a senior health official. There are over 600 CHCs in Rajasthan. “The CHCs will be equipped with oxygen cylinders, concentrators, oxygen plants (in bigger CHCs) and medicines for children. A core team has been formed by the health department to prepare the plan. Medicines and equipment have been identified for the CHCs and the process of procurement has already started,” the official added. The official further said that there are 300 blocks in the state and at least one CHC in every block will be strengthened in the process. “The chief minister (Ashok Gehlot) had announced that each MLA will establish a CHC in their assembly constituencies. Those CHCs will also be included in this plan,” he added. “Oxygen plants will also be installed at all the district hospitals across the state in order to ensure there is no shortage in future. Plants will also be installed at the 100-to-150-bedded CHCs. We are almost ready with the plan, just giving a final shape to it. In some CHCs, oxygen concentrators have already been made available and place an order for more, including 5-litre and 10-litre concentrators,” said the official. Health minister Raghu Sharma on Thursday said, “In view of the possible third wave, the number of ICU beds is being increased at all the paediatric hospitals and other units of the state. In addition, the work of installing oxygen generation plants and to centralize the oxygen system is also being done.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/400-chcs-will-be-upgraded-across-raj-to-tackle-3rd-wave/articleshow/83074173.cms||---

However, the dedicated doorstep vaccination to cover all PwDs in the city and district remains unclear as officials at present are focussing on vaccinating inmates of differently-abled welfare homes. Although vaccination camps for 18-44 years are underway, PwDs who are considered in the high-risk category had expressed apprehensions in visiting the camps. As their caretakers are mostly family members who are senior citizens, they were hesitant to approach the camps. A team led by Dr A Mohamed Hakkim administered the maiden jab in the district to a 43-year-old PwD woman in Puthur on Saturday. PwDs said that several of them are in need of similar support but on a large scale. District differently-abled department said that they are in the process of completing the vaccination camps for 468 inmates in 11 camps across the district including 214 belonging to above 45 years category. “Soon after we complete the vaccination for the inmates in government recognised homes, we will launch the doorstep vaccination by enumerating PwDs requiring the option,” said R Ravichandran, district differently-abled welfare officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/doorstep-jab-for-pwd-in-trichy-city/articleshow/83074178.cms||---
---||Trichy||Trichy corporation to build aerator to improve water quality||TRICHY: With drinking water sourced from Kollidam river having high iron content, thus causing water discolouration at times, Trichy Corporation has proposed to build an oxidisation plant to remove the surplus iron. A multiple-tray aerator is proposed to be built at a cost of Rs 5 crores which will ensure that the chemical parameters of the drinking water supplied to the city are balanced. It was found during a study that the water collector well III situated on the Kollidam river bed had iron content higher than the permissible level, thus creating residues and stains in the potable water supplied through pipelines. The multiple-tray aerator, akin to the one in Srirangam, will bring the water sourced in contact with open air. A fountain-like structure with 11.5 metres diameter and 3.5 metres height from the ground is proposed at the vacant space available on Ayyalamman ghat on Karur road. The 19MLD water drawn from Kollidam through collector well III will flow through the fountain-like structure during which the oxygen in the air will oxidise its high iron content. “The permissible iron content level is 0.3 mg per litre. The aerator will be designed in a manner to ensure that iron content does not exceed the permissible level,” an engineering department official in the corporation said. The fund required for the project was brought to the notice of municipal administration minister K N Nehru at the recent review meeting. Officials said the minister has promised to sanction available fund for improving the water quality. They said the work will take six months to complete. The aerator will be positioned at a level higher than the ground to ensure safety. The quality of water supplied to as many as 10 overhead tanks from collector well III will improve after the construction of the aerator.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-corpn-to-build-aerator-to-improve-water-quality/articleshow/83074171.cms||Deepak Karthik

In Jodhpur, the health department and AIIMS have been trying to find out the reasons for the sudden spike in cases, a senior health department official said. He said epidemiological study could help in finding other reasons for mucormycosis apart from misuse of steroids and uncontrolled diabetes. On May 26, health minister Raghu Sharma had said 800 patients were found with mucormycosis or black fungus. On Saturday, health department officials said the number had risen to 1,300. While the maximum number of cases have been reported from Jaipur, districts like Jodhpur, Kota and Udaipur too have reported black fungus cases. At Sawai Man Singh Hospital, 200 patients have already been registered and admitted to the mucormycosis ward in the past 14 days. In Jodhpur, 150 patients have been undergoing treatment while in Kota, the figure is around 70. Ajmer and Udaipur have also reported a few cases. Health department’s teams are currently conducting door-to-door surveys in all districts to identify suspected mucormycosis cases. The department has allowed 28 hospitals across the state to provide treatment for the deadly fungus since the ailment has been declared as a notifiable disease. Officials warned that those who are taking steroids should keep checking their blood sugar levels. In most cases, the blood sugar levels of even non-diabetic patients may shoot up to 300-400 after taking steroids and therefore it is essential to continuously monitor one’s sugar level, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/state-adds-500-mucor-casesin-4-days-tally-rises-to-1300/articleshow/83074184.cms||---
---||Jaipur||35-year-old Rajasthan Administrative Service officer all set to join Territorial Army||JAIPUR: A Rajasthan Administrative Service (RAS) officer is all set to join Indian armed forces after he cleared the Service Selection Board (SSB). He will join Territorial Army (TA) after CM Ashok Gehlot approved it on Thursday. Mahendar Pratap Singh, a 2011 batch RAS officer will be the first government official from Rajasthan to join the forces. Presently he is the deputy secretary in Rajasthan Child Rights Protection Commission and will join an infantry battalion of TA on June 1. Singh appeared for the written exam to join the forces along with 1.5 lakh others and was part of the 2,200 who qualified for the personal interview. His name was among the 850 candidates who qualified for SSB interview in Bhopal. He was part of the 25 candidates including 13 women who were recommended for commissioning in Army. Initially, he will serve a tenure of 45 days with the battalion and has already undergone his medical examination at the Military Hospital (MH), Jaipur. Speaking to TOI, 35-year-old Singh said, “I am quite elated at this opportunity and being the first as well as the only RAS joining TA, I feel that I have a great responsibility towards my state to keep the flag high. During this critical time, it becomes imperative for each one of us to do double the work we used to do in normal circumstances. I believe that one who sweats in peace bleeds less in war and will give my best to the armed forces. Singh joined as assistant commandant in BSF and served in Central IB before joining the RAS. However, he continued to strive to join the defence forces. He will be joining the battalion stationed in J&K and will be undergoing recruitment training at the rank of a lieutenant of the Indian Army following which he will undergo officer training either at Indian Military Academy (IMA) as and when he is scheduled for the same.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/35-year-old-ras-officer-all-set-to-join-territorial-army/articleshow/83074202.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Critics find assessment for external students confusing||PUNE: While the state has announced the assessment pattern for Std X, there is still widespread confusion about the plight of students appearing externally, using Form 17, and repeater candidates. For regular students too, schools reopened for hardly two months and only 50% attendance was allowed at a time, so teachers were frantically trying to finish their syllabus rather than undertake assessment. This situation raises questions about the 30% weightage awarded to internal assessment. Critics of the system said 50% weightage is given to Std IX marks for regular students, but no exams were conducted last year due to Covid-19 and Std IX marks were also based on internal assessment. Education expert AL Deshmukh said that he spoke to about three registered centres that admit external students, and none had received any worksheets from the board this year. “With no worksheets provided, on what basis will the students be assessed for 80% of their marks? I think the committee should have also checked the ground realities to understand the status of worksheets, practicals, and internal exams held this year before forming an opinion,” said Deshmukh. A student planning to appear externally said that he did not receive an assignment from the school until Friday. All of a sudden, the school asked him to submit assignments in two subjects. “I failed in Std IX and applied for Std X as an external student in the same school. Now, I do not know on what basis the school will assess us as we have submitted no assignments till date,” said the student. Avinash Takawale, principal of Poona Night High School and Junior College, further said that 20% weightage given to oral/practicals will be a daunting task at the moment. “As many as 50% of our students are from villages. Most of them own basic phones. Even if I call them, it would be difficult to ascertain that the person answering my questions is the same student, not somebody else. There are many schools still running in the city in partnership with private coaching classes. Do you think the assessment will be fair at these places? The entire process is futile,” said Takawale. Meanwhile, chairman of Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Dinkar Patil said the board will publish a manual with examples for ease of teachers preparing the result.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/critics-find-assessment-for-external-students-confusing/articleshow/83074197.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Goa||Goa: Rift in Congress, Vijay Bhike doubts Kandolkar’s party loyalty||PANAJI: Trouble appears to be brewing in the Congress camp yet again, this time in Mapusa with North Goa District president Vijay Bhike questioning former Mapusa municipal council chairperson Sudhir Kandolkar’s loyalty. Bhike said he would complain to the party higher-ups and request them to take immediate action against Kandolkar for working against the party’s interests. Bhike claimed that Kandolkar has played “hide and seek” whenever the party required him and made no attempt to prevent independent councillors who won the Mapusa Municipal council elections from joining the BJP. Three councillors from Mapusa — two independents and one backed by MGP — joined BJP on Tuesday, boosting the BJP-backed Mapusa Development Front. “Till this date he has not shown one percent of loyalty towards the party,” said Bhike. “My question to Sudhir Kandolkar is whether he still loves BJP? Is his loyality right now with Congress or with BJP?” Kandolkar, who served the BJP for over 20 years, quit the party and switched over to the Congress in March 2019 after he was denied the BJP ticket for the Mapusa bypoll. Kandolkar’s entry into the Congress upset the applecart for Bhike who was eyeing the Mapusa constituency. When TOI reached out to state party president Girish Chodankar about the developments in Mapusa, Chodankar said that he was not aware of the rumblings in the north. “I haven’t received any complaint. I will talk to Bhike,” said Chodankar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rift-in-cong-bhike-doubts-kandolkars-party-loyalty/articleshow/83074163.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Disaster fund collected from students of no help to them||MUMBAI: At a time when institutes are setting up Covid-19 funds to offer fee discounts and tuition waivers to students who have lost their family to the coronavirus, the University of Mumbai has decided to tap into its disaster fund, built by the contribution of students, to fix its creaky infrastructure.  Plans are also afoot to use the fund to distribute masks, sanitisers, oximeters and an infrared thermometer to colleges. The fund was set up after the July 2005 floods in Mumbai. Every student admitted chipped in Rs 10 to build the large corpus. Now, the university says money will be used to fix the damage caused to college and university buildings by the recent cyclone Tauktae. “Cyclones have increased in number and we are going to recommend that colleges must get their infrastructure insured,” said T A Shiware, chairman of the Association of Non-Government Colleges. Last year, when cyclone Nisarg hit western Maharashtra, the university distributed Rs 61 lakh among 16 colleges that were affected. “The disaster fund was set up to assist students. It is meant to support students affected by a pandemic or a disaster. Why should the university provide college staff with masks and install sanitiser stands and provide cans of sanitisers to affiliated colleges?” said a former V-C. Another university senate member said: “Colleges have been charging a development fee from students. Despite online classes, fees have been collected for sports, extra-curricular activities and library charges. College managements can definitely use that to buy masks for their staffer and install sanitiser vending stands.” University registrar Baliram Gaikwad said: “Two separate committees will be formed to look into both these matters, infrastructural damage caused by the cyclone and for the distribution of masks and sanitisers. The committee will assess the damage caused, and see which colleges need financial assistance and how much. In case of masks and the other items to be provided, the panel set up for that purpose will understand if there are some colleges that require university’s help.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-disaster-fund-collected-from-students-of-no-help-to-them/articleshow/83076916.cms||Hemali Chhapia
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh announces scheme for Covid orphans with Rs 4,000 monthly aid||LUCKNOW: Days after CM Yogi Adityanath declared the state would take on the responsibility of children orphaned by Covid-19, the Uttar Pradesh government on Saturday announced the UP Mukhyamantri Bal Sewa Scheme, which entails monthly stipend of Rs 4,000 for each child and state funding of their education and marriage. The government has identified 197 minors, who lost both parents and 1,790 children who lost one parent. As on Saturday, 1,000 minors qualified for the scheme, said a senior government official after verifying the income criteria. Beneficiaries include children who lost both parents or guardians to Covid, those who lost the sole bread winner and those with a single parent, who succumbed to the virus. The chief minister has approved a financial aid of Rs 4,000 per month per child to be given to guardians or care takers. Girls orphaned by Covid would be given Rs 1,01,000 at the time of marriage and a laptop or tablet to orphaned children in school, college or pursuing vocational education,” said Navneet Sehgal, additional chief secretary (information). Importantly, boys below the age of 10 who have no guardians or an extended family will be rehabilitated in Rajkiya Bal Grihas or child shelter homes in Mathura, Lucknow, Prayagraj, Agra and Rampur. For minor girls without guardians, the government will arrange their stay in Central government-run 13 Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas or in 18 Atal Residential Schools, currently being set up by the state government. Their education expenses will be borne by the government. A task force has been formed in each district to identify such children and the child development and nutrition department has directed local administrations to keep vigil on illegal appeals on social media for adoption of these children to prevent trafficking.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-announces-scheme-for-covid-orphans-with-rs-4000-monthly-aid/articleshow/83075220.cms||Neha Lalchandani

The bag was kept in a five-star hotel room’s locker where his employer had stayed between May 23 and 27 before a case of theft was registered. Accused Indrajit Singh, employed as a bodyguard for the Kolhapur-based businessman Pranil Bhoite, splurged Rs5.85 lakh of the total stolen sum partying (alcohol and food) and lending money with villagers of Gavraipada in Nallasopara for two days and three nights before he was nabbed from Kurla Terminus while he was trying to board a train to Uttar Pradesh. Bhoite, who is into the business of infrastructure, hired Singh along with few other bouncers six months ago for his safety. “Singh committed the offence after Bhoite gave him the hotel room access card. He knew the four-digit locker code. He had splurged half of the stolen money carelessly,” said a police officer. The police team used manual intelligence and paid money to informers to get information about Singh. Cops were informed that the accused had only four fingers on his right palm and the thumb is missing. DCP (Zone VIII) Manjunath Singe supervised the teamnabbed him after identifying his missing finger. He was found drunk at Kurla Terminus on Friday. “Singh who was heavily drunk replied in English when asked his name,” said the police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-businessmans-guard-steals-rs-10l-held/articleshow/83075292.cms||Narayan Namboodiri
---||Jaipur||Jaipur Development Authority to appoint consultant to prepare DPR for northern Ring Road corridor||JAIPUR: Inching closer to implement the multi-crore northern Ring Road project, the Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) has decided to appoint a consultancy firm to prepare the project detailed project report (DPR). For the same, expression of interest is invited from consultancy firms for the northern corridor of Ring Road project connecting Delhi and Agra highway. An official said, the project cost of 45 km (Bagrana to Achrol) is pegged at Rs 2,887 crore. To reduce the cost, the JDA is planning to build the Ring Road corridor on surface instead of elevation. However, final decision will be taken after the DPR is prepared. The Ring Road project will consist of a six-lane access-controlled expressway, a three-lane service road on both sides. The northern corridor will also be developed on the lines of the 47km, southern corridor (Agra Road to Ajmer Road) and the JDA will acquire 360-metre-wide strip of land. While the transport corridor will be constructed on a 90-metre-wide land, the civic body proposes 135 metres wide development corridor along the transport corridor for commercial purpose. Not learning lessons from the past, the JDA is once again planning to acquire extra land for the northern corridor which might force farmers to protest in future. “In the Master Plan 2025, the JDA has kept the northern corridor 360-metre-wide, same as southern corridor,” said an official. As per the initial proposal, the civic body would require approximately Rs 1,808 crore for acquiring land for transport corridor. The agencies have identified land in 26 villages of three tehsils — Amber, Jaipur and Jamwa-Ramgarh — to acquire it for the ring road. The Ring Road project was proposed to be constructed in phases. “Now, the state government is only planning to construct the corridor to connect Delhi Road and Agra Road. Chandwaji Expressway would be used as Ring Road to Delhi Road and Ajmer Road via Sikar Road,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jda-to-appoint-consultant-to-prepare-dpr-for-northern-ring-road-corridor/articleshow/83074203.cms||---

Besides, a team of specialist doctors from SGPGI has been made to monitor patients of black fungus. On Saturday, the CM asked doctors to continuously stay in touch with patients, adding that he should not receive any complaint regarding lack of treatment or medicines. In a meeting to review the Covid-19 situation, the CM said that there should be sufficient medicines to handle cases of ‘black fungus’. “Make sure adequate amounts of Amphotericin B injection and the two other medicines prescribed by experts are present in every district,” the CM said.

---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Charge against school for denying child from attending online class||JAIPUR: The child commission has received a complaint about a Jaipur private school according to which a class X student was not allowed to attend online classes despite paying fees. The school authorities, meanwhile, claimed that the matter is factually wrong and they have ensured that the child’s studies continued uninterruptedly. The commission has written to the district education officer and asked for a report in a week. According to the complaint letter, the child was apparently removed from the school’s WhatsApp group and online classes since May 24 and the authorities were trying to give the student transfer certificate despite payment of fee. The school, however, challenged these claims and Vikas Khandelwal, administrator, Vardhman International School said, “If a parent is paying the fees, then why would any school stop their children’s classes? This child was attending the classes. We have his attendance on Google also. And due to some technical flaws, he was not able to attend some classes. Nowadays, children are not regularly attending classes. And similarly, he was also off and on attending classes. It might be possible that his parents have deliberately not allowed him to login/attend the classes.” The school official said that they have received the fee and there is no issue from their end. Few days back, the child body had also held a discussion with various schools and appealed to them to not deprive any student of education due to payment issues. Earlier this month, quashing the Rajasthan High Court order on school fees issued on October 28 last year, the Supreme Court on Monday directed the private unaided schools to charge 85% the annual school fees of 2019-20 for the 2020-21 academic year. It ordered reduction of 15% fees in lieu of unutilised facilities by students. The apex court also upheld the Rajasthan Schools (Regulation) Act 2016.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/charge-against-school-for-denying-child-from-attending-online-class/articleshow/83084980.cms||---

So, he said, district-wise assessment would have to be done with the local administration with the help of the local task force. “The state would have to opt for an extremely cautious approach for any kind of relaxations,” Dr Joshi said.The task force member said there should be zero tolerance regarding any Covid protocol violation and crowding in any of the districts. “The curbs cannot be eased till the vaccination programme for the vulnerable population is completed,” he said.The state is hoping to scale up the vaccination programme in the coming three months, which would be crucial.Dr Joshi said the state was reasonably ready with the health infrastructure and medicine supply preparedness to handle the Covid situation in future.After the Covid-19 review meeting in Pune on Friday, state health minister Rajesh Tope had also said a very cautious approach would be taken while announcing any relaxations for any district. “Stricter lockdown-like restrictions would be in place for districts having a high positivity rate, while those showing some decrease in the case positivity rate would have only some relaxations ahead of the third wave. Relaxations would be done in a phased manner in such districts after taking everything into consideration,” he had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/extremely-cautious-pill-from-task-force-for-relaxations/articleshow/83074218.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Additional chief secretary (excise) Sanjay Bhoosreddy and ACS (home) Awanish Awasthi on Saturday issued directions to all divisional commissioners, deputy inspector generals of police, police commissioners, district magistrates, SSPs and SPs to constitute joint teams of local administration and excise officers and immediately start a 15-day-long enforcement drive. The teams will not just crack down on manufacturing and sale of spurious liquor but also inspect excise shops. “In the recent past, some incidents have come to light where illicit liquor has been sold in country liquor bottles. Illicit liquor trade not only affects the state’s revenue but its consumption also results in loss of life. The CM has said that Gangster Act and National Security Act should be invoked against persons involved in organised crime of illicit liquor. He has also authorised the department to attach the property of such persons,” said Bhoosreddy. Excise minister Ram Naresh Agnihotri has also directed officials to take action against the accused under relevant sections of IPC and the Excise Act. An official said that during inspection of shops, the teams will verify the bar code and QR code of the stock. Apart from this, these teams will conduct raids at suspected places of manufacture and sale of illicit liquor. Tankers will also be checked to rule out possibility of theft of alcohol from there. Dhabas and hotels on national and state highways will also be inspected. “During the drive, people will be made aware about the danger to life due to consumption of illicit liquor. Joint and deputy excise commissioners have been directed to monitor the enforcement drive and take strict action against personnel who are negligent. During the drive, no leave shall be allowed to any officer or employee without prior permission,” said an official.

These were the first few discharges of mucormycosis patients after they were kept in post-operative observation for 3 to 5 days. Dr Manish Gupta, a resident medical officer, ENT Hospital at Koti, said they all have recovered from black fungus and survived. “They might have residual problems like recurrent infection in the nose for a long term. Some of these patients, however, will have to undergo plastic surgeries after a few months to correct the facial disfiguration left due to removal of black fungus-affected parts,” he said. The hospital has so far seen nearly 700 cases (including outpatients and inpatients) and has completed 160 surgeries for black fungus. Apart from the discharges, post-operative cases are being shifted to Sarojini Devi Eye Hospital, which is also reporting 40 to 45 cases of mucormycosis each day now. At the second nodal centre for mucormycosis, Gandhi Hospital, a total of 206 cases have been reported so far of which 14 have been operated upon. “We are getting cases from various districts across the state and they are in different stages. We are also seeing post-Covid-19 patients who have cheek pain and are suspected to be mucormycosis cases but they do not have it and others who come with eye pain but have a full-blown infection inside. We have operated some of them in the last two days. More surgeries are lined up in the coming days,” said Dr C Narendra Kumar, civil surgeon administrator, Gandhi Hospital. He said the black fungus numbers are going up.

---||Pune||Float global tenders only for shots given DCGI nod: Experts||Pune: Public health experts have asked states to float global tenders only for the vaccines that have been approved by Drug Controller General of India (DCGI). Sputnik V is the only shot, besides Covishield and Covaxin, granted emergency use permit in India so far.The experts said a centralised procurement system for vaccines from abroad would have been more effective. Maharashtra, Karnataka, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Haryana, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh are among states that have floated global tenders to directly buy vaccines from manufacturers or suppliers. Former health secretary K Sujata Rao said, “So far, none of the three foreign manufacturers — Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson and Johnson — have the DCGI licence. Besides, both Moderna and Pfizer have said that they will only deal with the central government, So there is little gain here,” she said. Rao added that in fragmenting markets, by making each state bid separately, bargaining power is lost. “We may all be paying more per dose than what the cost would’ve been if the country had issued one tender,” she said. Dr Jacob John, a leading virologist, said vaccine procurement has become a game of “political football” between states and the Centre. “In the past, states have not taken matters into their own hands. But now, they have apparently been forced to approach foreign manufacturers on their own. The relationship between the Centre and states seems broken today,” he said. Dr Giridhara Babu, an epidemiologist, said this is the time to course-correct procurement. “Some major manufacturers have said they will only deal with the central government and not states. It’s time we set up a special purpose vehicle for the procurement of vaccines,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/float-global-tenders-only-for-shots-given-dcgi-nod-experts/articleshow/83074224.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The victim often abused his parents and brother if they refused to give him money to buy alcohol. Due to this behaviour, there were frequent fights between the family members and the victim. On October 12, 2017 the victim made a demand of Rs 500 from his mother to buy alcohol and when she refused, he left the house in a fit of rage only to return after sometime and ask for Rs 2,000 from the accused.

We will approach the government in this regard to seek further guidance," said Rubal Agarwal, additional municipal commissioner. The Centre has extended the gap between two Covishield jabs to 12 to 16 weeks. City-based activist Sandeep Khardekar has written a letter to PMC chief Vikram Kumar asking for a drive for students who're headed abroad and reduced interval between shots.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-to-hold-spl-drive-for-students-going-abroad/articleshow/83074222.cms||---

The drives (paid) have helped double the number of recipients in the 18-44 group — from just about 49,378 till mid-May to 1.06 lakh on May 28. Pune and Mumbai districts are currently leading in the state in vaccinations among the 18-44 category. Units like Ruby Hall Clinic and Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital are covering an estimated 1,800 to 2,000 citizens from the 18-44 age group daily. Dr Purvez Grant, managing trustee and chief cardiologist of Ruby Hall Clinic said, “We are vaccinating about 3,000 citizens every day, including beneficiaries from the 18-44, 45-plus groups and corporates. Nearly 60% of the day’s numbers are those in the younger age category.” Bomi Bhote, CEO of Ruby Hall Clinic, said the more than one lakh jabs among the 18-44 group — in all of May — is still a low number. “Vaccination in this group must increase further with government participation because many in the 45-plus group now have some time before their second jab. Once this category reaches the end of the 84-day period after their first shot, the rush for shots will increase. This time should then be used to inoculate many more from the 18-44 group,” Bhote said. Dr Dhananjay Kelkar, medical director of Deenanath Mangeshkar said, “Our vaccination site gets about 300 to 400 people from the 45+ category daily. There are about 2,000 from the 18-44 turning up. This is because many citizens over 45 are yet to complete the interval between first and second Covishield doses.” Dr Pradeep DCosta, chairman of KEM Hospital's vaccine committee, said, “We have a large number of citizens from the 18-44 category turning up for jabs daily. This is the high-risk group and the working population of Pune. It should then get sufficient coverage before another Covid surge.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/big-drives-by-pvt-hospitals-help-double-18-coverage/articleshow/83074220.cms||Neha Madaan

However, police in preliminary investigation found that the assailants are wanted in a case of loot and attack. The doctor couple, Sudeep and his wife Seema Gupta had been given bail in a case of setting a woman (Deepa Gurjar) and her six-year-old son on fire in 2019. Primary investigation suggested that the deceased doctor was in an illicit relationship with Deepa and later set her on fire. “One of the assailants, identified as Anuj Gujjar, had been planning to avenge his sister Deepa’s murder. Since January 2020 Gujjar has been planning to eliminate the doctor couple. We also found that he was booked in an attack case as a juvenile at the age of 16 and was also wanted in a case of firing at Bharatpur’s Rudawal police station area,” said Devendra Bishnoi, superintendent of police, Bharatpur. The investigation suggests that Anuj was forcing the doctor’s family to give him a huge sum. “It was learnt that Sudeep had agreed to pay Rs 50 lakh but Anuj was demanding more,” said Bishnoi. The SP said that teams have been formed to make arrests. “We have conducted raids at a few places. We are also working on some solid leads to nail down the culprits,” Bishnoi added. Police proble suggests that the doctor couple had received threats from Anuj Gujjar and his aides. The gruesome murder was recorded on camera and the CCTV footage showed the face of one of the accused covered while the other’s face was clearly visible.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/beauticians-brother-who-killed-docs-has-criminal-record-cops/articleshow/83074223.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Members of Rung community living in cities extend help to those living in remote hills of India and Nepal||Pithoragarh: Members of the Rung community living in cities are helping those living in remote areas of Dharchula in Uttarakhand and Darchula in Nepal by handing over medical kits that include face masks, thermometers, pulse oximeters, sanitisers, medicines as well as user guides explaining how to use these. The initiative was taken by Rung Kalyan Sanstha, a social organisation of the community. These kits are readied in Delhi, transported to Dharchula, Pithoragarh and then distributed to members of the Rung community, which is spread across Byas, Chaudas and Darma valleys in Dharchula division of Uttarakhand’s Pithoragarh, as well as Byans municipality in Nepal’s Darchula district. Members of the Rung community in Nepal often use Indian roads to reach the district headquarters of Darchula because of lack of road connectivity on the Nepal side. People of the community from both countries also share marital bonds. Being a migratory tribe, Rungs migrate to plains in the winter and return to their summer villages in the upper reaches around April-May. “Most summer villages of the Rung community are in remote areas and they have no medical facilities, so the Rung Kalyan Sanstha sends medical kit to these villages. Members of the Rung community who live and work in metro cities and in other states have pooled in the money and with the advice of doctors in the community, we put together these medical kits,” said Krishana Garvayal, chairman of the organisation. “Apart from sending help to Rungs living in upper reaches of India, our community members have also been handing over kits to residents of Tinkar, Changru, Dumling, Rafaela and Syankan villages of Nepal when they come to Dharchula for work. We have told the villagers that in the case of any emergency, they can directly contact the local branch of our sansthan,” Garvayal added. Ashok Bora, a resident of Changru village and a beneficiary of the scheme, said that “residents of the village are very thankful to the sansthan”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/members-of-rung-community-living-in-cities-extend-help-to-those-living-in-remote-hills-of-india-and-nepal/articleshow/83087185.cms||Prem Punetha
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: High hopes turn sour as untimely rain, pest attack hit mango crop||LUCKNOW: Despite good flowering in February and March, the mango crop in Malihabad has been severerly hit by pests and unusual weather this month. Malihabad has an average annual production of 6-7 lakh metric tonnes of mangoes, primarily Dussehri. President of the All India Mango Growers Association, Insram Ali, said: “Caterpillars cause the biggest loss to mango crop and insecticides are not working on it. We have informed the Union agriculture ministry that the insecticides available in the market could be duplicate. Even the scientists have not been able to suggest a solution.” “This time, the production has only been around 2.5 lakh MT due to the loss,” Ali said. Both the early and late maturing varieties like Jauhari and Lakhnauva Safeda, Chausa and Langda were as much as affected as Dussehri. Mangoes were to hit the market by May-end but weather has delayed the plucking of the fruit. Corona curfew has also stalled its transportation to other states. “Finding contractors and labourers to send the produce to the market has been a challenge for mango-growers. But the weather has been the biggest challenge,” said Ali. Had the day temperature been high, it would have killed the pests. Director, Central Institute for Subtropical Horticulture (CISH), Shailendra Rajan said: “If the rain continues, possibility of diseases would increase. Mango has a protective layer and rain will damage it. It would made pests thrive on the fruit. Mangoes would get damaged outwardly and may drop.” Possibility of fungal diseases like anthracnose and pests will increase due to rain. Humid weather may also cause black spots on mangoes. The development of mango varieties that have yet not matured will also be affected. Malihabad and adjoining mango-producing regions had a good crop this year because of favourable weather, lesser rain and thunderstorm till April but the change in weather in May has been devastating for the crop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/high-hopes-turn-sour-as-untimely-rain-pest-attack-hit-mango-crop/articleshow/83075318.cms||Neha Shukla
---||India||Adhir, Odisha oppn leader were also invited: Suvendu Adhikari||KOLKATA: Leader of opposition in the Bengal assembly Suvendu Adhikari has squarely blamed the Bengal chief minister for the circumstances at the PM’s Kalaikunda review meeting on Friday that preceded the recall order to chief secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay. “I was there. The CM came to the review meeting along with the chief secretary after some time. She spoke to the PM for one-and-a-half minutes, presented some papers and walked out with the CS. This is a breach of IAS protocol. The Bengal CM won’t allow the state bureaucracy to observe protocol,” Adhikari said on Saturday. “The PM waited for half an hour after the meeting for a presentation on the extent of the cyclone devastation. He asked additional secretary Bhaskar Kulbe to find out if state officials would like to make the presentation. Kulbe reported that state officials had nothing to add,” he added. The BJP leader also reminded that the CM didn’t send any state official to the meeting when Modi came to Kalaikunda after cyclone Fani in 2019. “She also gave a miss to a number of Covid meetings,” he said. Refuting the CM’s “preoccupations”, Adhikari said: “The PMO informed both Odisha and Bengal about the PM’s itinerary on Thursday night. Accordingly, the CM rescheduled her programme. She changed her mind after she came to know that the leader of the opposition was invited. She decided to skip the meeting but changed her stance later realising that her absence might deprive Bengal of central support.” The LoP tore into the CM’s version of “BJP political meeting” at Kalaikunda. “The PMO had invited Odisha opposition leader Pradipta Naik too. But Naik had Covid and couldn’t make it,” he said. The PMO had also invited Congress Lok Sabha leader Adhir Chowdhury. “Chowdhury was in Delhi and couldn’t attend,” he said. Adhikari urged Banerjee to shun her “arrogance” and “petty politics” in the state’s interests. “She doesn’t need to touch the PM’s feet. The only thing she needs to do is to abide by the Constitution. I have no inhibition showing respect to her as my CM. Similarly, she should have some respect for the PM.”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/adhir-odisha-oppn-leader-were-also-invited-suvendu-adhikari/articleshow/83078659.cms||Rohit Khanna

The injured was sitting in the balcony when it collapsed, said officials of the Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC). The SMC team and police evacuated 80 residents from 31 houses in the Lakshmi Apartment as the building structure was in dilapidated condition. SMC officials said that the balcony of the three-storied building collapsed when some repair work was going on. “Some labourers were using heavy machines inside the apartment during repair work. Due to the vibration from the heavy machine, the gallery collapsed. The building was built in 1985 and its structure has become weak,” said an SMC officer. After examining the building, the structural engineer of SMC removed some portion in the front of the building to reduce weight. “Five members of a family did not have alternate accommodation and they are being kept at SMC community hall, while other residents went to stay at their alternate arrangement,” said the officer. After the dangerous portion was removed, SMC team assisted the residents to remove valuables and essential goods from their flats. After consultation with the structural engineer, the residents will have to decide if they want to repair the building or demolish it, said SMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/80-evacuated-after-bldg-balcony-crashes/articleshow/83072541.cms||---

Only a few know that before donning the khaki uniform he had earned degrees and acquired the white apron. Waquarib holds an MBBS and MD degree in community medicine and often enters the Covid-19 hospital to provide consultation to patients admitted there. A 2015 batch IPS and an alumnus of Jawaharlal Medical College under Aligarh Muslim University, he has passion for both medicine and administration. Talking to TOI, Waquarib said, “I started this as I felt that every single hand which can help our healthcare workers matters as they are overburdened. My family members and I were infected in April and my mother was in ICU for quite some time. When my mother was in hospital I was looking after her along with other doctors and this motivated me and I decided that I can do it for other patients too.” Adding further, Waquarib said he discussed the treatment protocols with his medico friends as well as doctors in his district after which he decided to treat patients. “I almost did take training for a week with doctors in Koderma on treatment protocols as it was changing every now and then. Apart from that I also spoke to my friends who were treating Covid-19 patients at different centres after which I consulted patients at our district hospital,” said Waquarib. The senior IPS officer had also led the surveillance team during the first wave when he was posted as SP (rail) in Jamshedpur GRP after he was requested by the then DC of East Singhbhum Ravi Shankar Shukla when he became aware of his educational qualifications. Patients who were consulted by Waquarib were an excited lot as they said that it was an experience in itself to be treated by someone who was donning a uniform. “I hadn’t seen a doctor treating patients in ‘khakhi wardi’ until now. For me it was a pleasant surprise when the SP himself asked me about my problems and advised accordingly,” said Lakshman Ram (55) a resident of Herno village under Chandwara police station limits who is admitted at the ICU of the district Covid hospital, where the SP is visiting and treating patients. Adding further, Lakshman said, initially he did not realise that the man inside the uniform was a doctor but when he came to know that the man is a doctor-turned-IPS, it changed his feelings towards him. People generally get scared after seeing police but after seeing such police officers, one should start believing that kind hearts beat under uniforms too.” Another patient Ram Prasad Ram (55), a resident of Lohdanda under Koderma police station limits, said: “It was a pleasant experience to see the SP treating Covid-19 patients in the ICU ward of the hospital. This kind of a gesture will not only lift police’s image in society but also act as a catalyst in boosting morale of doctors and healthcare workers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/doc-turned-cop-plays-double-role-to-help-covid-patients/articleshow/83073633.cms||Gaurav Pandey
---||Ranchi||95-yr-old woman wins Covid battle in home isolation||Chatra: In a rare feat, 95-year-old Shiyama Devi of Khadaiya village in the industrial town of Tandwa in Chatra district successfully recovered from Covid-19 only by remaining in home isolation and following prescribed protocols. At a time when the second wave of the pandemic had wreaked havoc and burdened the health infrastructure with exponential cases of infection and critical incidents, Devi’s case is unique. According to family members, Devi was detected with the virus on May 1 following a test at a private lab at Ranchi’s Lalpur Chowk. Her son, Sushil Kumar Sinha, had initially taken her to a private hospital in Hazaribag where she was not given proper treatment. Soon, she was taken to her native village where she stayed in home isolation to fight the virus. The elderly woman’s granddaughter Isha Sinha, a college-goer, said although her grandmother isn’t highly literate, she had been following all news about Covid through newspapers for the last one year. “She has been adhering to all Covid appropriate behaviour and precautions since last one year but still contracted the virus. But we are happy that she finally won over it,” she said. Devi was declared cured on May 18 and has not developed at post Covid complication so far, said family members. Her son, Sushil, a government servant, ensured timely food and medicines prescribed by doctor for his mother. Isha said, “My father used to take out time from his busy schedule to give medicines and food to his mother. He was the one who entered her room.” Isha added that the entire family ensured proper atmosphere at home so that the elderly didn’t feel left out. “Although my grandmother initially didn’t like being isolated but gradually she fought through it bravely,” she said, adding that she doesn’t have any comorbid conditions. Chatra civil surgeon Ranjan Sinha, who is currently infected with Covid, said he was elated when he learnt about this elderly woman. “The lady has proved that anyone can defeat the disease even without hospitalisation if there is proper will and courage to do so,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/95-yr-old-woman-wins-covid-battle-in-home-isolation/articleshow/83073578.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Vax card fails to help rural populace as vaccinators leave details blank||RANCHI: In an apparent move to counter the Centre’s move where Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s photographs were affixed in the Covid-19 vaccination certificates, chief minister Hemant Soren had launched separate vaccine cards intending to help beneficiaries in the state’s rural areas but seem to have no practical use. The state government’s green-coloured cards have an emblem of Jharkhand and Soren’s photographs. At the time of its launch in mid-May, the ruling JMM had said the card would help the rural populace who are not tech-savvy to get their doses without getting into the reported complexity of the Centre’s Co-WIN app and where internet access is a problem. The cards are meant for beneficiaries in the age group of 18 to 44 years, the vaccines for whom are procured by the state and provided for free. However, the card could not replace Co-WIN as beneficiaries still have to register themselves with the Centre’s app to get the shots and by default, they will still get the vaccination certificates with Modi’s photograph. During its launch, Soren had said the cards are aimed at giving ease of understanding dates of first and second doses and the brand of vaccine administered. The objective seems to be defeated as the vaccination centres are not paying interest in filling up the details. Take for instance the case of 20-year-old Apoorva Singh of Sonari in Jamshedpur, who took his first dose on Saturday at the Loyola School vaccination centre after filling up his personal details in the state government’s vaccine card and registering himself on Co-WIN. Other crucial details in the card like the date of the first dose, tentative date of the second dose, session site name and phone number to contact in case of an adverse effect, which should be mandatorily filled up by the vaccinator, were left blank. Talking to TOI, Apoorva said when he asked the vaccinator about the missing details, he was simply met with the response “they are not necessary”. Officials involved in the vaccination drive also admitted that even if details in the vaccine card are not filled up, the beneficiary is not going to be refused the second dose. “Every detail of the beneficiary is stored online in the Co-WIN portal. Whenever a beneficiary registers for the second dose, his or her details can be pulled out,” an official said. Assistant chief medical officer of East Singhbhum, Dr Sahir Pall, however, said all vaccinators have been asked to fill up the details. “The incident of Loyola School may be a case in isolation and we are going to get it corrected,” he said. Meanwhile, the development has provided ammunition to the opposition BJP which is looking for a chance to train its guns on the ruling party. The saffron party’s spokesperson Pradeep Sinha said, “If people in Jharkhand are not tech-savvy, as claimed by the government while launching its cards, how is it that slots are filled up at session sites within 10 minutes of opening through the Co-WIN app?” Sinha further said when the vaccinators understand that filling up details in the vaccine card is just a formality without any practical use, they are not willing to waste time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/vax-card-fails-to-help-rural-populace-as-vaccinators-leave-details-blank/articleshow/83073706.cms||Jaideep Deogharia
---||Vadodara||Recovery rate at 88% keeps beds vacant||Vadodara: More people are being cured from Covid-19 than those infected as the Covid-19 wave goes down in the city and district. The recovery rate of patients has now reached nearly 90 per cent. Data released by the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) reveals that the difference between the progressive number of discharged cases and the number of new cases is narrowing consistently. On Saturday, the recovery rate stood at 87.97 per cent. At the peak of the pandemic’s second wave on May 7, 989 new cases were detected taking the total number of cases to 50,504. Against this, the total number of discharged cases stood at 40,644. The recovery rate stood at 80.47 per cent. Officials said that when a wave of a pandemic went down, it is expected that the recovery rate would improve. The steady downfall after May 7 has continued barring a couple of days. At the other end, the higher number of cases reported earlier this month has led to a higher discharge rate at this stage even as the number of new cases is going down. The details of hospitalisation also reveal a similar trend. From peak hospitalisation of 11,089 on May 4, the number of beds occupied in hospitals has been on a decline consistently. On Saturday, the number stood at 3,679. However, this includes cases from both the Vadodara district and other districts as well as states. The higher recovery rate and hospitalization has ensured that several extensions of government hospitals are closed down. The facilities at BAPS Atladara campus, Samras Hostel and the temporary dome erected in the GMERS Gotri Hospital are now not in use. Admissions in Dhiraj Hospital are already on hold due to the row over beds being shown occupied on paper even as they were actually vacant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/recovery-rate-at-88-keeps-beds-vacant/articleshow/83070945.cms||Sachin Sharma
---||Goa||Travel and Tourism Association of Goa to make another attempt to seek aid from government||PANAJI: With chances being high that hotels may not be able to reopen for two to three months more, Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG) has begun assessing its losses to seek assistance from the government. People dependent on the hospitality industry need a helping hand as the revival of tourist trades will be extra challenging post the second wave, TTAG president Nilesh Shah said. “We would like to see that at least Rs 5,000 to 6,000 is paid as subsistence allowance to 1.4 lakh people directly employed in hotels and tour companies. It won’t suffice to meet their needs, but at least it will be of some help,” Shah said. Considering the prevailing circumstances, he said, the hospital industry will be able to reopen only after September. “Currently, sentiments towards destination Goa are negative. As and when it (industry) opens, we will operate with all protocols in place,” he said. The TTAG will submit a memorandum to the government next week insisting that, at this time, the government must help the industry concretely, Shah said. The only little relief the industry has been offered so far was that of a provision in the budget to subsidise landing and parking fees of charter flights, and relief towards interest on loans for businesses, he said. Shah said that their demands, such as relief towards payment of electricity charges, deferment or rebate of various fees like excise and fees charged by local civic bodies, were not considered by the government. Tourist trades will find it difficult to survive for the second season in a row.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ttag-to-make-another-attempt-to-seek-aid-from-govt/articleshow/83074260.cms||---

It was also not known whether Bandhani Devi of remote Asnapai village under Siyari panchayat of Gomia block of the district is suffering from Covid-19 as no test was conducted. Bandhani’s husband Dengara Manjhi had died a few years ago. Her village located between forests on Jinga hill has 15 houses all belonging to the Santhals. According to her family members and villagers, they carried Bandhani till Daniya, where they hoped to get a vehicle to take her to the nearest hospital, but the autorickshaw drivers there refused to ferry her fearing she was infected by Covid virus. Bandhani was suffering from fever, weakness and body ache and her family members decided to take her to a hospital after her health deteriorated. Gomia block development officer Kapil Kumar said though Asnapai village is in a remote area, they have stationed two ambulances at Gomia to help the needy. He said, "We are not informed about the condition of the woman. Had we known about it, we would have arranged treatment for her. I am looking into the matter to ensure that she gets the right medication." Sadly, Asnapai village has no roads and the residents used the forest trails for communication. Whenever any health emergency arises there, particularly for pregnant women or those who sustained serious injuries, it is a practice for the villagers to carry patients on cots till Daniya from where they get vehicles to go to the government hospital in Ramgarh district. Bandhani's son Babuchand Manjhi said, "We carried my mother on a cot after her condition deteriorated. She was suffering from fever for the past six days. She did not take any food and became very weak." Manjhi added, "My mother became ill after suffering from cold and cough. After reaching Daniya, we requested many autorickshaw and taxi drivers to help my mother reach the hospital, but they refused. We had to carry her back home and on the suggestions of the villagers, we are treating her with traditional medicine." Meanwhile, Kumar said, "The government has already sanctioned funds for the construction of a road to the village, but due to some reasons, work has not started yet.” The villagers rued that they have no electricity, too. Their children have to walk three kilometres to the nearest school at Birhordera village.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/ailing-tribal-woman-carried-on-cot-for-5km-in-bokaro/articleshow/83073676.cms||Divy Khare

It has also extended the last date of exam form filling, from May 29 to June 7, following complaints by students and college management. Even the deadline for colleges to submit these forms in NU has been extended till June 10. A majority of students were unable to fill up the online forms and due to lockdown and curfew-like situations. They couldn’t go to their campuses for the completion of formalities. NU officials, however, stated that colleges want to recover tuition and other fees from students and it was the reason they weren’t allowing them to fill up the exam forms. As per the summer exam schedule released by the Board of Examination and Evaluation (BOEE) director Prafulla Sable, 988 exams, including theory, practical, and viva-voce would be conducted over three and half months period from June 15 to September 26. All papers would be held online through a web-based link. In the first phase, practical exams of final year/semester undergraduate courses would commence from June 15 while the theory would begin from June 29. In the second and third phase, practical exams for final year/semester postgraduate programmes along with one year certificate, diploma and PG diploma would start from July 12 while the theory papers would be held from July 19. The last phase of the PG first year/second-semester papers would commence from September 13 with practical exams and the end of September 25 with theory papers. The theory/practical exams of all odd UG and PG semesters would be held after the completion of the winter-2020 exams. As per the notification, the university would be declaring the schedule of the education faculty later. Sable once again reiterated that colleges on not calling the students to campuses for filling up forms considering the pandemic situation and advised them to use online technology. A section of students had demanded cancellation of exams and sought promotion to the next semester like last year citing the pandemic situation where many of them had contracted the deadly disease. Some of them had also lost either one or both parents or their close relatives to the contagious virus. However, the exam director had already rejected their request, clarifying that the students would suffer losses. Earlier this week, TOI had reported how students ran a campaign on Twitter under the hashtag #rtmnu_to get the exams cancelled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nu-summer-2021-exams-in-8-phases-from-june-15/articleshow/83083975.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

CPM MP Bikash R Bhattacharya said, “It is foolish to recall the officer whose extension had been granted a few days ago. Alapan Bandyopadhyay is completing his service career on Monday so there is no point in asking him to report to Delhi on Monday,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/congress-left-attack-centre-on-recall-order/articleshow/83078929.cms||Debashis Konar
---||Goa||Goa extends Covid curbs till June 7||PANAJI: The state government on Saturday extended the state-level curfew till June 7 to control the spread of Covid-19. Though the number of fresh infections in the state are seeing a decline, the positivity rate, which has also dipped considerably, continues to remain above 20%. “Government of Goa has decided to extend the curfew till 7am of June 7. The orders regarding the same shall be issued by respective district collectors,” chief minister Pramod Sawant said. There is no change in the restrictions imposed during the extended curfew period, according to the orders issued by both the district collectors on Saturday evening. TOI had reported on Saturday that the chief minister had consulted some of his ministerial colleagues and senior bureaucrats on Friday over the extension of the curbs. State BJP president Sadanand Shet Tanavade had urged the chief minister to extend the curfew by a week. Recently, the Union ministry of home affairs had written to the states, including Goa, reminding them that the number of active cases were still high, and that states should not be seen slacking in imposing curbs to control the pandemic. When the Covid situation went out of hand, the state government announced a 15-day curfew on May 8, and on May 22, it was extended till the end of the month as cases were still high. The opposition parties were demanding a total lockdown in the state. “Social, political, sports, entertainment, academic, cultural functions, marriages, and other congregations, (except for events with the permission of the government) were restricted. However, cremation with 20 people or less will be permitted,” the collectors said.

He said that many who get infected opt to stay at home and rush to the hospital only when their condition worsens and they start finding it difficult to breathe. “By then it becomes difficult for doctors to bring the situation under control. At that time, oxygen cylinders are really helpful in saving the lives,” he said. Ticlo also appealed to his constituents who are above 45 years to get themselves vaccinated. The MLA was speaking on Saturday at a function held at the Aldona panchayat where five oxygen cylinders were donated to the panchayat by the parents of Alok Shirdokar, who recently succumbed to Covid-19. Shirdokar was a popular sportsperson and a physical education teacher at Government College, Sakhali. “We will be giving these cylinders to those Covid-19 patients who are in need of oxygen cylinders. We are thankful to Shirodkar’s parents for giving us these cylinders as a lot of patients have died due to lack of oxygen,” Aldona sarpanch Pranesh Naik said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/o2-supply-situation-improving-says-ticlo/articleshow/83074290.cms||---

In the past few weeks, commercial fishing has been affected owing to the curfew and the recent cyclone. This has prompted villagers to take matters in their own hands and try their luck in freshwater streams and rivers. Chandrakant Aukhale from Pissurlem, Sattari, said, “I love fishing. Besides angling, we use nets for catching freshwater fish. My family relishes the ‘ambot-tikhat’ preparation of freshwater fish.” During summer, the water level in freshwater bodies drastically declines, making it safe as well as rather easy to get a good catch Goa’s freshwater streams and rivers are known for the local fish varieties like Maral, Valay, Dekale, Kaday, Khavale, Toki, as well as prawns and crabs. Many locals prefer to turn the fishing trip into a picnic, with the prized catch roasted over fire. During onset of monsoon, freshwater fish like ‘Chadhaniche Mashe’ enter the agricultural fields due to the flow of rainwater. As part of the efforts to catalogue the freshwater fish diversity of the Western Ghats in Goa, researchers of Indian Council of Agricultural Research conducted surveys of the freshwater habitat in Goa from 2013 to 2014. This survey yielded 40 species of freshwater fish, seven species of crustaceans and two species of molluscs. Researcher Pradip Gawas from Honda, who has studied freshwater fish diversity in Sattari, speaking to TOI said, “There is a need to conserve and protect this diversity.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/locals-turn-to-freshwater-fish-as-seafood-availability-dips/articleshow/83074364.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar
---||Goa||Goa: Mental health experts offer free services to help locals tide pandemic-related uncertainities||PANAJI: From pregnant women worried about giving birth in a Covid hospital in the face of rising cases, to working professionals who have found themselves unemployed due to the pandemic, the people of the state seem to be anxiety ridden in the face of the uncertain times. In this situation, some mental health experts have risen to the occasion to offer free telephonic counseling services. “When the pandemic broke out, we decided to do whatever we can to help irrespective of whether they are existing clients or unknown callers. Goa’s elderly, middle-aged and youth are suffering from fear and stress, which is causing anxiety and depression,” clinical psychologist and former principal of Rosary college of commerce and arts, Navelim, Father Simao Diniz said. Some of the callers are also grieving the loss of loved ones, and the counselors are attempting to help them cope . “There are mixed reasons that people call to talk about and some of them have underlying depression. There is a lot of uncertainty, especially among the 20 to 30 year age group due to the pandemic,” psychotherapist Cipriano Fernandes told TOI. Despite the free service, the mental health experts have observed that there still is stigma associated with seeking counseling. In such a situation, telephonic counseling is more convenient. “We are especially trying to help people under home isolation whose anxiety is continuously rising. Quite often they do not require multiple sittings to deal with their emotions,” director of the Goa Institute of Counseling, Clifford DeSilva said. They have a team of eight mental health experts that offer counseling in English, Hindi, Konkani, Malayalam and Kannada. They sometimes get calls seeking financial help to fund medical expenses of Covid patients. Sometimes the underprivileged call for help to buy ration. “People are desperate for help due to the financial constraints caused by this pandemic.Despite having counseled hundreds of people in my career, never have I ever seen such helplessness among people,” one counselor said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mental-health-experts-offer-free-services-to-help-locals-tide-pandemic-related-uncertainities/articleshow/83074359.cms||Nida Sayed

It reported 443 deaths on Saturday and added 389 “old” deaths, taking its cumulative toll to 94,030. A closer look at districtwise data shows that in some districts like Beed, Gadchiroli and Chandrapur, more deaths occurred in May than in the previous 13 months. It is Pune and not Mumbai that leads the death charts in May. Data shows that although these two cities added the highest deaths in absolute numbers, the growth rate was slower than smaller districts. For instance, Pune added 2,661 deaths. Of the total 4,546 deaths reported since the beginning of pandemic, 1,478 occurred in the first 28 days of May. Solapur, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg have also added a large number of deaths this month. Mumbai, the worst hotspot in both waves, surprisingly emerged as one of the best managed cities. The case fatality rate fell from 3.79 last year to 0.86 this year so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-maharashtra-crosses-25000-deaths-in-may-alone-pune-tops/articleshow/83078959.cms||Bhavika Jain

Board of Examination and Evaluation (BOEE) director Prafulla Sable told TOI that NU will not allow the college to re-conduct exams and it may either be held by other colleges in the nearby area or by NU itself. “The BOEE took the decision to cancel all their papers after the bribery allegations were prima facie found to be correct and even their students had accepted it. We also received new complaints from the girl students. The BOEE would decide on holding their exams after receiving the report from the probe panel,” he said, adding that NU had all systems in place to conduct their papers. Former NU Management Council member Mahendra Nimbarte, who blew the lid on the bribery issue by sending students’ audio clips to the BOEE director, said the teacher who demanded bribes for clearing papers was allegedly doing it at the behest of the management. “The students told me that such practices have been rampant in the college for many years. The college has an advantage of being situated in the rural area and, therefore, hardly any monitoring is done by the university. At least now, NU should conduct a thorough inquiry not only of Kirsan, but all such colleges located in rural areas. Such unethical practices are common once you hand over the examination system to the colleges, as no one wants to fail their students,” he told TOI. According to NU officials, many well-known academicians from the NU circles are the members of Kirsan college board of governors. It included senior academician Baban Taywade, former higher education director Archana Nerkar, and a head of NU commerce department Anant Deshmukh. No official from Kirsan was available for comments for the second in a row. Quoting RTI information by activist Abhay Kolarkar, TOI had reported on how NU results shot up to 99% due to online examination as students were allowed to appear from home with no proper monitoring system. Even NUs claims of having a proctoring system had failed to stop the students from using unfair means during the papers. Despite opposition from several quarters, NU entrusted colleges to conduct postgraduate exams, as per its own officials. The exam director, however, denied that the proctoring system was faulty stating that they had stopped the exams of many students after their server captured suspicious activities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/re-exam-in-college-accused-of-taking-bribes-from-students/articleshow/83074439.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Citing the alleged remarks of former Madhya Pradesh CM Kamal Nath that India is not great but infamous following the spread of the infectious disease, BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia sought to know Congress’ stand on his comments. BJP also referred to reports in Pakistani media which mentioned “Indian variant” of Covid-19, a term mentioned in the “toolkit”, which has been attributed to Congress by BJP. “What Kamal Nath says is Congress’ ideology and does so on behalf of Sonia Gandhi. Defaming India has become your priority” Bhatia said at a virtual press conference. He also cited comments of Rahul Gandhi and Shashi Tharoor to claim that Congress has been making “irresponsible” statements to weaken India’s fight against the pandemic. Referring to a media report in Pakistan, Bhatia alleged that the term Indian variant used by it had “originated” at the Congress headquarters. “It has provided tools that are used by countries like Pakistan to target India,” he alleged. MP CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan alleged Nath had lost his ‘mental state’. “He could no longer be called an Indian citizen after making defamatory remarks on the land he was born in,” Chouhan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/congress-giving-pakistan-tools-to-defame-india-bjp/articleshow/83078988.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Improved recovery, reduced test positivity may relax restrictions||NAGPUR: The downfall of the Covid-19 curve continued even on Saturday with less than 5% samples testing positive in the last 24 hours. Out of more than 47,000 tests done in the last 24 hours, only 2,116 tested positive in Vidarbha. The district-wise picture may defer between less than 2% to 8%. But all districts in Vidarbha have reported test positivity less than the state average of 9% on Saturday. On the test positivity parameter, all 11 districts in Vidarbha now deserve relaxations from the restrictions, probably from June 1. Another important parameter is the recovery rate. With 4,937 patients recovering in a day on Saturday, now, most districts in Vidarbha have more than 93% recovery rate. Overall, the recovery rate of the region is 94.8%, which is better than the state and national average. Out of total 10,76,793 cases, 10,21,748 have recovered in Vidarbha. The death toll also reduced for the 8th consecutive day on Saturday. Total 68 deaths were reported in Vidarbha. Once again, majority of the deaths came from rural parts of the region, but the number is reducing there too. This shows better control of the Covid-19 infection in rural areas. With the state government’s new measures concentrating on rural areas, the positivity and fatality in rural Maharashtra is also set to reduce further in the next two weeks. The government might think of relaxing restrictions in totality once the rural spread is fairly under control. The number of under-treatment patients has reduced to 34,195 on Saturday. Barring Nagpur and Amravati, no other district in Vidarbha has more than 5,000 patients under treatment. Bhandara: The district conducted 1,844 tests of Covid-19 in last 24 hours out of which 98 tested positive. This means the test positivity is down under 6% of the state average. On the other hand, 80 patients recovered from the district. Two deaths were also reported. Bhandara now has 58,575 cases, 56,534 recoveries and 1,051 deaths. Recovery rate is 96.5%. Total 990 patients are under treatment. Gondia: A record 3,280 tests were conducted in the last 24 hours in Gondia and only 60 of them tested positive which hints at test positivity less than 2% in this district.

Number of under-treatment patients came under 5,000 for the first time in May. Buldhana: The district conducted 5,075 tests in the last 24 hours and 196 of them resulted in positive which means the test positivity has dropped significantly. With 659 patients recovering in a day, Buldhana’s recovery count reached 80,848 out of 84,545 cases. Three deaths were reported on Saturday, taking the toll to 593. Total 3,104 patients are under treatment.

As per the letter, many farmers have been affected due to the Covid pandemic. The three agricultural laws have many shortcomings.

---||India||Congress banking on Chhattisgarh probe||NEW DELHI: Chhattisgarh police’s investigation into Congress’s allegation that BJP leaders have forged a “toolkit” and Delhi Police’s assertion that it is working on the party’s complaint that it claims to have already withdrawn, could stoke the “BJP vs opposition” warfare, this time via the police. Congress has sent to Delhi Police two letters saying it has taken back the complaint it filed on May 18 when the “toolkit” controversy broke out. The discomfort with the Delhi police probe can stem from concerns that it reports to the Centre and it has visited Twitter’s offices in the midst of a parallel government-Twitter showdown and cited the Congress complaint as the reason. In contrast, the probe in Congress-ruled Chhattisgarh may seem a better option. The insistence on the Raipur probe is interesting. Congress turned to the state just a day after filing its complaint with Delhi Police, which did not book a case immediately. It appeared a course correction. So much so, AICC legal adviser Abhishek Singhvi was roped in and he is guiding the party’s moves. The Congress claim is that there can be only one FIR on one offence and thus Delhi has to drop the complaint. Singhvi cited the Sushant Singh Rajput case in which Bihar police probed the matter because Mumbai police had not registered an FIR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/congress-banking-on-chhattisgarh-probe/articleshow/83079007.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Vardhan letter to Ramdev ‘insulting’: Nima||Nagpur: In a 3-page letter addressed to Union health minister Harsh Vardhan and PM Narendra Modi, the National Integrated Medical Association (Nima) has strongly objected to the lack of recognition in the efforts put in by its 7.80 lakh practitioners to control the Covid pandemic in the country. Objecting to the contents of the letter written by Vardhan to Baba Ramdev, in which he has praised the efforts of allopathic doctors, Nima’s letter points to the “painful neglect of the Indian way of medicine by the policymakers despite a positive contribution into Covid-19 control and treatment”. Ramdev is currently embroiled in a controversy with the Indian Medical Association after he debunked allopathic practices in Covid treatment. After Vardhan’s letter, Ramdev had issued an apology for his statements made against modern medicine. Later, Ramdev and senior members of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) had a television debate videos of which further escalate the issue of allopathy vs other pathies. “Your letter written to Ramdev has a mention that doctors of modern medicine are the only Covid warriors behind a good control of infection and less mortality rate of the disease in India. While mentioning the contribution of allopathic doctors, you comfortably ignored the work done by many of us,” reads Nima’s letter. Nima is a registered organization of graduates of integrated medicines. Their president Dr VD Tembhurnikar and treasurer Dr Ashutosh Kulkarni are from Maharashtra. Nima’s letter targeted doctors of allopathic medicine who frequently term ayurveda or traditional Indian medicine as ‘pseudo science’. “Calling Indian medicine as pseudoscience is an insult to this country as well as the entire humanity. Would you express your reaction on this and take action on such people,” the letter questions Vardhan. The letter holds “ignorance of ayurveda” in doctors of modern medicine responsible for such statements. “Many drugs were earlier prescribed to Covid patients and later they were recalled from the protocol accepting their severe side-effects. It’s a subject of research how many Covid patients in this country got severe side-effects of which kind due to the use of these medicines,” states Nima. NIMA officials in Vidarbha told TOI that they will wait for the health minister’s response to the letter. “Did modern doctors ever try any ayurveda medicine on Covid patients? Or do they have any data showing the non-efficiency of ayurveda medicines in Covid? Then why such unscientific statements,” asked Dr Mohan Yende of Nima, Nagpur. NIMA MAKES SOME POINTS * Crediting only allopathic doctors for low fatality and better control of Covid-19 in India is injustice to traditional therapy * The Indian way of medicine is most suitable for the Indian way of life * Calling it pseudoscience is the insult of the great country and its wisdom * Research must be done on long-term ill-effects of allopathic drugs during Covid times * Differences between ayurveda and allopathy, and fight on social platforms not good in Covid times||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vardhan-letter-to-ramdev-insulting-nima/articleshow/83074549.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

With the addition of 13 more districts across five states as well as Punjab and Haryana to the list, Hindus, Sikhs, Christians, Parsis, Buddhists and Jains from three neighbouring countries, who reside in 29 districts and nine states of India, will face fewer hassles in acquiring Indian citizenship and can apply online. Ministry sources clarified the expansion of locations has no link to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). The applicants will have to fulfil residency criteria for citizenship by naturalisation, on par with any other foreign applicant, requiring them to be ordinarily resident in India for 11 of the 14 years preceding the 12 months prior to applying, and uninterrupted residency in the last 12 months. The applicant can’t be an illegal immigrant. In a notification issued Friday, the ministry said collectors of Morbi, Rajkot, Patan and Vadodara in Gujarat; Durg and Balodabazar in Chhattisgarh; Jalore, Udaipur, Pali, Barmer and Sirohi in Rajasthan; Faridabad in Haryana and Jalandhar in Punjab would have powers for registering individuals as citizens of India under Section 5, or for grant of certificate of naturalisation under Section 6 of the Citizenship Act, 1955 in respect of Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladeshi applicants of religious minorities there.

Like mucormycosis, aspergillosis too is seen among Covid-19 positive patients as well as those who have recovered from the virus. At state-run SSG Hospital, there are eight patients who are currently undergoing treatment for aspergillosis. “As many patients of black fungus got admitted at SSG Hospital, biopsy of each patient was taken. Seven to eight patients were found to be infected with invasive aspergillosis which is a yellow to greenish-yellow fungus. Like mucormycosis, it is also invasive fungus,” said Dr Sheetal Mistry, advisor for Covid-19 to city and district administration. “Pulmonary aspergillosis is commonly seen in immunocompromised patients but aspergillosis of the sinuses is rare,” he said. Mistry said that its symptoms are same as black fungus (mucormycosis). “It is less invasive than mucormycosis but if neglected it can cause bone erosion of sinuses, orbit and skull bone,” he said. He said that patients with uncontrolled diabetes, people who are on long steroid therapy, immunosuppressive drugs, are patients of sclerosis of liver, cancer, sickle cell anaemia, HIV patients among others form the high risk group. Non-sterile water used for hydrating the oxygen supply in hospitals is also being said to be responsible for its occurrence. Most people inhale aspergillus spores every day without getting sick. “But people with a weakened immune system or lung disease are at a higher risk of developing health issues due to aspergillosis,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/after-mm-nasal-aspergillosis-cases-surface-in-vadodara/articleshow/83070994.cms||---

The deceased Prakashchandra Rao and his wife Daksha had gone to their native village Achhaliya in Jhagadiya taluka on May 27 to attend a religious ceremony. In the wee hours of Friday, burglars broke into their house and fled with Rs 3 lakh cash and gold and silver ornaments worth Rs 22 lakh. Police said that the burglars locked the couple’s room from outside while they were asleep and carried out the theft. The incident came to light when Daksha woke up around 3.30 am on Friday and found the bedroom locked from outside. She woke up Rao and the two called their neighbours for help. The neighbours found the backdoor of the house open and household items scattered over the floor. After his bedroom was unlocked, Rao found the bag in which the cash and jewellery were kept being empty. A few minutes later Rao suffered a cardiac arrest and within minutes he succumbed to the shock. After completing the final rites later during the day, Rao’s son Jaykumar lodged a complaint of burglary at Umalla police station. “The man suffered a cardiac arrest as he lost the cash and jewellery. We have begun the investigation but are yet to record the family members’ statements,” said a police official.

Though it’s way behind table-topper Maharashtra (2.1 crore doses), it tops the list in south India, with states like Andhra, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Telangana yet to reach the 1 crore mark. These rankings are as per data at 11pm on Friday on the Co-Win dashboard. In Karnataka, among those aged above 45 years, over 20 lakh persons have got both doses of the vaccine, and more than 83 lakh have got one jab. In the 18-44 years age group, 8.5 lakh have taken the first dose since May 1. On Saturday alone 1,06,668 got jabbed with the first dose in this age group. Senior officers of the health department admit the urgent need to ramp up vaccination, which can be done only through increased supplies from the Centre. There is vaccine eagerness now among the public, unlike the scenario in January. We have made vaccines available for all above 45 years. Given the current shortage, it’s not possible to open up vaccination for the 18-44 years group, and hence priority groups have been chosen. The need, however, is to vaccinate everyone above 18 years at the earliest,” a senior IAS officer said. Dr MK Sudarshan, chairperson, Technical Advisory Committee, said we need to speed up vaccination, but that depends on availability. “Supply is the major constraint now. The state is geared up to do more vaccinations provided vaccines are supplied in sufficient quantities. Maximum coverage will help in the long run,” he said. Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (PHANA) president Dr H M Prasanna said the state’s coverage would have more than doubled had the Centre continued the supplies to private hospitals. “These hospitals were dropped off the process from May 1. That was a wrong strategy. PHANA had shouldered the responsibility of vaccination and 75% of inoculation was done in private hospitals in Bengaluru,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/karnataka-tops-vaccination-coverage-across-south-6th-in-india/articleshow/83080316.cms||Sunitha Rao R

---||Delhi||Fresh Delhi Covid cases drop below 1,000 after 2 months||NEW DELHI: Fresh Covid-19 cases in Delhi fell below 1,000 for the first time since the second wave began and the positivity rate too declined to 1.2%, indicating a turnaround in the city's situation. A total of 956 fresh cases were reported on Saturday. Deaths, too, are declining with the capital reporting only 122 deaths in the last 24 hours. Towards the end of March, the capital started reporting a steady increase in daily Covid-19 cases, which reached over 28,000 on April 20 before starting to decline. Delhi last recorded less than 1,000 cases on March 30. A total of 2,380 Covid patients recovered in the last 24 hours while 80,473 Covid tests were conducted. The higher recovery has reduced the number of active cases. Currently, Delhi has only 13,035 active cases. 19,500 of 25k beds available; recovery rate high at homeCurrently, Delhi has only 13,035 active Covid cases. During the peak of the second wave, the city had over 95,000 active cases. Dr Arun Gupta, president of the Delhi Medical Council, said that because of the sudden and high increase of cases, it was expected that the numbers will decline very fast. “Since a large number of the capital’s population has already been exposed to the novel coronavirus, they have developed immunity against it. The immunity developed due to antibodies remain for five to seven months and protects individuals from the coronavirus infection,” Dr Gupta explained. Nearly 53 lakh individuals have received Covid vaccines, out of which nearly 12 lakh have received two doses and are fully vaccinated. The pace of vaccination has slowed down due to shortage of vaccine at government-run centres, many of which are closed. According to Delhi government’s daily health bulletin, currently nearly 19,500 Covid beds are vacant. The capital has 24,997 Covid beds across government and private hospitals, out of which only 5,501 are currently occupied. Among the 13,035 active cases, 6,303 patients are under home isolation. The recovery from home isolation is very high and since the active cases under home isolation are not extremely high, like it was during the peak of the second wave, the patients are easily being managed through a hired agency for remotely managing patients. Among the 80,473 Covid tests conducted on Saturday, the share of gold standard RT-PCR tests was very high. At least 56,559 RT-PCR tests were conducted and only 23,914 rapid antigen tests were conducted in the past 24 hours. Experts have advised keeping the share of RTPCR tests high in the coming months because they are more reliable and accurate as compared to rapid antigen tests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fresh-delhi-covid-cases-drop-below-1000-after-2-months/articleshow/83079070.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Ahmedabad||Covid-recovered patients occupy most ICU, ventilator beds in Ahmedabad||AHMEDABAD: Covid-19 is not letting off severe patients easily. Even after recovery from the viral infection, its morbideffect continues to keep patients hospitalized or forces them to seek critical medical attention after discharge. Citybased private hospitals said that over 70% of the ventilators and ICU beds for non-Covid patients are in fact occupied by the Covid-recovered patients. Dr Bharat Gadhvi, president of Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association, said that 168 private hospitals are currently treating Covid patients. “Majority of them have now adopted a hybrid model where they also offer non-Covid treatment. But our recent analysis revealed over 70% of ventilators and ICU beds for non-Covid patients are engaged to provide treatment to Covid-recovered patients,” he said. Dr Gadhvi, who is also regional director of HCG Hospitals, said that all 12 non-Covid ventilators at his hospital in the city have Covid-recovered patients. What brings many Covidrecovered patients back in ICUs? Dr Sanjay Shah, head of emergency department at Apollo Hospitals, said that the phenomenon identified as post-Covid sequelae is responsible. “Majority of the patients have respiratory issues due to high lung involvement during Covid infection. They thus need ventilator, BiPAP or NRBM support,” he said. “At our facility, out of the total capacity, about 60% ICU and ventilator beds have Covid-recovered patients.” ‘Emotional, financial drain’ Dr Jigar Mehta, critical care specialist at KD Hospital said that all 20 ventilator beds for Covid patients continue to remain occupied even as Covid numbers are headed south. “Majority of the patients with highly damaged lungs need ventilatory support for 30 or 45 days. They neither record any improvement or deterioration in condition. It’s a major emotional and financial drain for the patients,” he said, adding that only 25-30% get fully recovered. P 2 Dr Anil Jain, medical director of Epic Hospital, said that the most common post-Covid complication is lung inflammation. “These patients find it difficult to maintain desirable oxygen levels, and thus need both BiPAP or invasive ventilation depending on the oxygen dependency. Apart from mucormycosis, septicemia (bloodstream infection) and secondary bacterial infection are also seen in many recovered patients,” he said, adding that the majority of critical care beds at his facility have such patients. Damage to the heart is also very common among the Covid-recovered patients, said Dr Sameer Dani, CEO of Apollo CVHF, who said that there are several implications of severe Covid infection for patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-recovered-patients-occupy-most-icu-ventilator-beds-in-ahmedabad/articleshow/83079058.cms||Parth Shastri

On August 10, 2019, Munnekolala resident Kevin Martin reached Chennai airport to board a 6.30am IndiGo flight to Delhi. But IndiGo ground staff refused to let him board, despite the 18-year-old holding a confirmed ticket, saying the flight was overbooked. Martin, who was the 2019 JEE topper in Karnataka and had bagged the trip after winning IIT Guwahati’s technothlon, was to fly out of Delhi on another flight. Martin moved the Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in December 2019. In its verdict on April 3, 2021, the court ruled IndiGo must pay him Rs 1 lakh as compensation and Rs 50,000 for causing mental agony. The airline was told to pay Rs 10,000 towards his litigation and Rs 8,605 with interest towards refund of ticket.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/indigo-asked-to-pay-karnataka-teen-1-6-lakh-for-missed-trip-to-nasa/articleshow/83079066.cms||Petlee Peter

Covid cases are already dipping and we are hoping the situation will be better in another 4-5 days,” the CM said after a three-hour meeting with legislators and public representatives from Mysuru, Hassan, Belagavi, Kalaburagi and Vijayapura districts, which have a high caseload. “Extending or not extending lockdown depends on the number of cases and positivity rate by then.” The state reported 20,628 cases and 492 deaths on Saturday, taking the daily positivity rate to 15% and the case fatality rate to 2.4%. At the video conference, Yediyurappa appealed to elected representatives and officials to strive hard to curb the spread of the virus in the districts, and particularly in rural areas. “You must ensure that the positivity rate drops below 10% in another week in all these districts,” he said. The government is walking a tightrope on the curbs, weighing relaxation against an increase in cases in the districts, and continuation against the potential adverse effects on revenue as Bengaluru contributes more than half of the state’s collection. While deputy CM and head of the state’s Covid task force, CN Ashwath Narayan said a decision would be taken in 4-5 days, cooperation minister ST Somashekhar, who is incharge of Mysuru, opposed extension of the lockdown. “I don't see the necessity to extend the lockdown after June 7 as cases are coming down drastically. The extension will further hurt the working class who are already badly hit,” Somashekhar said. Echoing the CM on taking a decision around June 7, home minister Basavaraj Bommai said curbs may have to be continued if the number of cases doesn’t drop. “Situation can come under control only if the positivity drops below 10%... The death rate and daily caseload should also come down drastically. Only then we can manage the situation with the existing health infrastructure,” he said. The government had initially announced 14 days of closure from April 27 but later imposed a complete lockdown from May 10 to May 24 as the cases climbed. The lockdown was then extended till June 7 as experts said it was yielding results. On Thursday, the Centre directed states to continue Covid-19 guidelines till June 30 and asked them to go for intensive and local containment measures in districts with high case burden.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/no-lockdown-beyond-june-7-if-cases-reduce-says-karnataka-cm-bs-yediyurappa/articleshow/83080322.cms||---

The next of kin to the deceased labourers will get Rs 29 lakh each — Rs 20 lakh from National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), Rs 4 lakh from Uttarakhand Disaster Relief Fund, Rs 1 lakh under a beneficiary scheme of the Uttarakhand government, and Rs 2 lakh each from Uttar Pradesh government and the Centre. Thirty-three labourers from Lakhimpur Kheri district and one from Shahjahanpur district were washed away by the flash flood. Five bodies were later recovered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/tapovan-tragedy-29-missing-labourers-declared-dead/articleshow/83079103.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Three days after the cyclone hit coastal Odisha and caused a storm surge — which breached the embankment in multiple locations and led to flooding of villages and farms across islands — residents are at wit’s end on how to flush out the sea water that has left them trapped. If the dykes are altogether dismantled, more water will gush in at high tide. Using pumps to drain water, on the other hand, is a tough task. During Aila in 2009, water had remained stagnant for weeks before it evaporated naturally under the blazing sun. By the time dry ground had appeared, acres of agricultural land was ruined with no crops possible for three years in the salty wasteland left behind. “Getting the water out is proving to be a Herculean task. Channels were made along the embankment to drain out water, but that worsened the situation during high tide. Our men, along with local villagers, are working day and night to break and make the embankment,” said Bankim Hazra, state Sunderbans development minister. A chunk of the Sunderbans — from Mousuni, Ghoramara, Kakdweep, Sagar and Patharpratima in the west to Gosaba, Basanti, Jharkhali, Sandeshkhali and Hingalgunj in the east — is under waist-deep water even 72 hours after the cyclone and spring tide dealt a double blow. “The flow of incoming water has lessened a bit because the spring tide has weakened. A state-level team of experts will visit the islands on Sunday as we begin a large-scale reconstruction and rehabilitation exercise,” Gosaba BDO Saurabh Mitra said. On Saturday, too, the sight of people standing in waist-deep water, waiting for relief items from either the government or NGOs, was common as it was in the past two days. “The extent of devastation is far more than what the Sunderbans had seen during Aila and last year’s Amphan. Mud huts have either crumbled to the ground or are no longer liveable. Unlike earlier times, there is a dearth of hygienic places for cooking. Community kitchen seems to be the only alternative,” said Anant Nevatia, a trustee of Kolkata Gives, an NGO that has been providing relief items and running community kitchens at 50-plus villages in the Sunderbans. A possible surge in Covid cases and diseases such as diarrhoea, which have some common symptoms, has officials worried. To make things worse, dead cattle and fish have been floating in waterlogged villages. “We are trying our best to remove the carcasses and sanitise the places with bleaching powder,” Namkhana BDO Santanu Singha Thakur said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dyke-dilemma-as-major-rehab-efforts-begin-in-sunderbans/articleshow/83073874.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

He is a member of the state Covid task force committee. “Vaccinated persons would get protection for two to three years if there are no further variants of concern after one year,” he said during a webinar, ‘Covid – 3rd Wave, Vaccination and Protection’, organised by the Karnataka Women Journalists’ Association. Further research is required to determine the exact duration of vaccines’ effectiveness. Dr Ravi believes regular processing of a portion of Covid positive swab samples for genetic sequencing will help identify new coronavirus variants. The double mutant variants’ B. 1.617.1’ and ‘B.1.617.2’ have been found in 26 per cent of the 933 samples processed for genomic sequencing in Karnataka so far, he added. Stressing that every previous pandemic had multiple waves, Dr Ravi said that a third wave was inevitable in the country and preparations must begin to tackle it. “Last year, many were in denial mode, saying India will not have a second wave because of ‘Indians’ immunity’. In reality, India is going through the second wave. We need to be cautious now and be prepared. European countries are going through the third wave, whereas the US is witnessing the initial phase of the fourth wave,” he said. According to Dr Ravi, infection waves generally occur three to five months apart and people who don’t get vaccinated in the next six months will be susceptible to Covid. Children will be a particularly vulnerable group in the coming wave. “In a country with 30 crore children, even if 1 per cent become sick, we do not have the required facilities to treat them,” he said, referring to the shortage of paediatric ICUs. Highlighting the second wave pattern, he said that Maharashtra and Kerala faced it first, followed by Delhi, Gujarat and Karnataka. “Now we see a surge in Tamil Nadu and West Bengal. Different states peaked at different times. Even in a state, districts have surged at different times,” he said. He emphasised the need for preventing large gatherings such as religious congregations and election and political rallies as part of efforts to reduce the severity of the third wave. “By avoiding these, no economic activities get affected. The need is to keep a close watch on the seven-day average Covid positivity rate and impose restrictions as and when there is a surge,” he added. Responding to a query on planning pregnancy during the pandemic, Dr Ravi suggested that women should ideally complete vaccination before conceiving. “There are many who took one dose; they could not take the second one as they were pregnant. In current guidelines, vaccines are not yet advisable for pregnant women,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/vaccines-effective-for-at-least-1-year-says-karnataka-virologist-dr-v-ravi/articleshow/83080330.cms||Sunitha Rao R

He is a member of the state Covid task force committee. “Vaccinated persons would get protection for two to three years if there are no further variants of concern after one year,” he said during a webinar, ‘Covid – 3rd Wave, Vaccination and Protection’, organised by the Karnataka Women Journalists’ Association.

Police said that Ramesh was a resident of Araku Valley in Visakhapatnam Agency. Having tested positive for Covid-19, Ramesh was admitted to KGH a few days ago. Worried that the viral infection may kill him, Ramesh decided to end his own life. Only a few days ago, 49-year-old V Sudhakar, a foreman at Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP) who was undergoing treatment at the Visakha Institute of Medical Sciences (VIMS), jumped from the third floor of the ICU block and killed himself. Ramesh and Sudhakar’s stories are not unique. At least 20 Covid-19 patients have died by suicide in Andhra Pradesh in the second wave of the pandemic. Krishna district has reported the highest number of such suicides in the state. In Visakhapatnam, three Covid-19 patients have died by suicide at KGH and one at VIMS. The dreaded virus is not only affecting various parts of the body but is also taking a toll on the mind. Speaking to TOI, psychiatrist NN Raju said that the virus is making people, old and young, afraid. Some people infected with the virus, especially during the second wave, are facing tremendous mental pressure and are losing hope due to anxiety which is leading to depression and suicidal tendencies. Experts say that reports of long-term complications and viral social media posts are playing a role in creating apprehensions. Financial vulnerability too is driving people to end their lives. Experts suggest that counselling centres be set up at Covid hospitals and tele-counselling be introduced which can create a positive atmosphere and reduce suicide risk.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/20-covid-patients-died-by-suicide-in-2nd-wave/articleshow/83070813.cms||Nalla.Babu

Speaking to the media, Singhal said that the volume of daily cases has come down in all districts over the last one week. “The recovery rate, which dropped to 84.3% in the first week of May, has now improved to 89%. Similarly, the active caseload was about 2.11 lakh on May 17. With recoveries outnumbering daily cases in the last few days, the active caseload has reduced to 1.73 lakh on Saturday,” said Singhal. According to the principal secretary, the state government’s decision to impose curfew from 12pm to 6am and Section 144 during remaining hours helped in containing the spread of the pandemic. Discussing oxygen supply guidelines, Singhal said that the state government’s decision on setting up PSA oxygen plants at private hospitals would be formulated soon. “As per the initial proposals, the industries department would provide some subsidy to private hospitals as they may not be in a position to bear all the expenditure,” said Singhal. On vaccination, the principal secretary said that the state has administered 94.74 lakh Covid-19 vaccine doses so far. “The bids, which were received in response to the global tender floated for procurement of Covid-19 vaccines from foreign players, would be opened on June 3. The state wants to procure two crore doses,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/covid-situation-improving-on-all-parameters/articleshow/83070830.cms||---

Accused Rahul Kathiriya is one of the seven persons involved in the cheating of Rs 27 lakh worth of diamonds. Cops have so far arrested four accused including Kathiriya in the case. Kathiriya was caught based on specific information by Varachha police from Laskana. The gang is booked in Kapodra police station as well in a similar case. Police arrested three others — Vimal Vachhani, Ishwar and Umesh Mangukiya — earlier in the case. “The accused opened an office in a diamond market area in a rented space and advertised online about their interest in purchasing diamonds. While checking the diamond packets from brokers they would then replace the original with duplicates,” said a police officer in Varachha police station. They initially offer a good price for the stones and then when they could gain trust of the brokers they would replace the diamonds in the packet. The broker would realise about it only after a few days when he checked the packet, but by that time the accused would have disappeared.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/one-more-held-for-cheating-broker-of-rs-27l/articleshow/83072572.cms||---

The pharma major has already covered 800-plus children in 12-18 years clinical trials. “We will have a good amount of data on children in this age group. If everything goes well in terms of safety, the vaccine will potentially be approved for use in children aged 12 to 18 years,” said Dr Sharvil Patel, managing director, Cadila Healthcare Limited, the flagship company of the Ahmedabad-based Zydus Cadila Group. When asked about the company’s plan to test the vaccine for use in children below the age of 12 years, Patel said, “Yes, definitely. The vaccine development always happens in phases. Obviously, it starts with adults, followed by children in the 12-18 year age group and then you go towards younger kids aged five and above.” Patel added that the next phase of the trials would be to test the vaccine for children aged 5 to 12. “This platform will be more useful for children because it will be devoid of any side effects that you get to see in many other vaccines. Another benefit of our vaccine is that it involves ‘needlefree’ administration,” he added. Zydus is expecting to receive regulatory approval for the emergency use of its vaccine in adults by June-end or July.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/zydus-cadila-now-plans-to-test-its-covid-19-vaccine-for-5-12-age-group/articleshow/83079105.cms||Kalpesh Damor

It will, however, maintain a stockpile of 50 lakh vials for emergency requirements. Domestic production of remdesivir, used in Covid-19 treatment, has been ramped up 10 times, from around 33,000 vials per day in April to over 3.5 lakh a day, Union minister of state for chemicals Mansukh Mandaviya said on Saturday. The higher production is the result of the number of plants that manufacture the drug increasing three-fold to 60 within a month, he added. Due to the severity of the second Covid wave, the government had decided to take on allocation of the drug following reports of massive shortages and hoarding. Experts pointed out that hoarding and black-marketing of the drug still exist, leaving many in the lurch. The minister said he has directed drug regulatory bodies NPPA and DCGI to continuously monitor the availability of remdesivir in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/output-up-10x-centre-stops-state-allocation-of-remdesivir/articleshow/83079125.cms||---

Goa’s transport minister Mauvin Godinho on Saturday said the finance minister of Tamil Nadu Palanivel Thiagarajan insulted Goa at the meeting by suggesting that being a small state, Goa’s views shouldn’t be given weightage. Godinho, who represents Goa on the GST council, has demanded that Tamil Nadu chief minister Muthuvel Karunanidhi Stalin should act against Thiagarajan and convince him to apologise for virtually asking Godinho to “shut up”. “Thiagarajan’s case is that since he comes from a big state, he should have a bigger vote. It’s like saying, I am the big brother, you shut up, you (are the) small brother,” said Godinho. Thiagarajan appears to have taken issue with Godinho’s plea before the GST council to show preference towards smaller states which are struggling financially. According to Godinho, Thiagarajan said that his constituency is as large as the state of Goa and thus Tamil Nadu should be given additional weightage in the council decision making process. Godinho said the GST council, as a constitutional body, cannot make a distinction based on population of states. He has condemned the alleged statements made by Thiagarajan and said that belittling of Goa’s views was an insult for the entire state. “I take strong offence to the way he conducted himself and expressed himself in the GST council. I want Stalin to condemn his minister for making such a statement and make him apologise,” said Godinho. Sitharaman reportedly informed Thiagarajan that all states carry equal weightage and all decisions are taken by consensus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-minister-alleges-tn-finance-minister-insulted-his-state/articleshow/83074201.cms||---

Emboldened by the crisp script, Roy walks up to the mournful woman and whispers: “I’m sorry for your loss. Move on.” Real life doesn’t have canned laughter or we would be drowning in its surround sound right now, given the number of people pulling a Roy in the face of Covid’s dark hand, as the virus continues to cram graveyards and renders speechless even those fluent in the art of breaking bad news. Humanity’s eternal lack of vocabulary around loss is being increasingly laid bare by a bevy of solemn social media posts which — like signboards inside restaurants — bear lessons in etiquette that are assumed to be common sense until they aren’t. “Do not keep calling us and expect us to give minute by minute details of the medical history or incidents which happened prior to or during hospitalisation as well as reasons for the death,” reads the second bullet point in a six-point recent blog by a Chennai-based mental health professional who lost her husband to Covid-19 and was shocked “when someone claimed that he was more depressed because he knew my husband since school, so he has more rights to be depressed than me and my children.” Besides asking people to avoid statements such as “you should have given him the vaccine earlier,” and what breathing exercises the kids should do, the mental health professional reiterates in the blog: “Don’t use our grief to promote business. I was shocked on seeing a post in a professional circle that claimed that I was helped by that person to secure injection for my husband.” This doesn’t shock Dolly Sharma (name changed), a Bangalore-based college professor and mother of two teen girls who has “grown up” in the last one year after losing the life partner who mollycoddled her for 22 years before Covid took him in April last year. Fresh in the wake of the demise, a family friend from Sharma’s native Jamshedpur, said to her: “This is the right time to convert (to another religion).” “Someone had converted her without her knowledge when she had lost her husband a few years ago. She wanted me to do the same,” says 48-year-old Sharma, adding that there were many who not only took “undue advantage” of her situation but also “bonded with friends over my incident.” “One friend compared her situation to mine. She told people that her husband has only lost his job to Covid, while I had...” says Sharma. Besides the showers of advice, even well-intentioned platitudes such as “they are in a better place”— while acceptable in the case of death from prolonged illness — sting like verbal darts in the context of Covid. “You are a strong woman,” callers kept telling Thane-based Rajani Jagtap when she lost her husband, Shridhar, to Covid in June last year. “It was irritating to hear. Because what you’re feeling is not strong but vulnerable. You just want to put your head on someone’s shoulders and cry,” says Jagtap, who was also startled to find a morose queue of compounders and ward boys waiting with folded hands outside her office when she resumed work last year. “I felt like a museum piece,” recalls Jagtap, who had asked the staffers to get back to work. “There is no standard operating procedure for grief,” well-known radio jockey Rohini Ramanathan said in a poignant podcast in which she recounted navigating life after the sudden demise of her husband in Singapore in January 2017. Besides a wedding “that turned into a funeral” because of the sheer number of people who came forward to condole her, Ramanathan recalled shaking off questions ranging from “You didn’t cry at funeral” to “How much did the thing (funeral arrangements) cost? Was it electric or non-electric?” Similar queries had ambushed a Borivli-based lab technician, who lost both her parents within two days of each other to Covid last year. The parents were staying with her aunt, who had tested positive first. “There were people who asked me: ‘Why was your aunt admitted first and then your father and lastly, your mother?’ Do they think I would in any way discriminate between my very own parents?” asks the technician. “In fact, they had even finished their course,” says the bitter technician, who finds the idea of condolences “hypocritical”. But then, is there even a right way to condole? “You don’t have to say anything profound,” answers a social media post by Sindhoor Pangal, a bereaved wife whose loss is still raw. ‘In fact, it is really not about what you say. It’s about listening, being willing to witness pain and not look away. It is about answering the call knowing very well there will be an hour of sobbing.” For Sharma, resilience came from second-hand empathy. She had heard that her college principal, a woman, had told someone about Sharma: “She’s a lady, she will bounce back.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/going-beyond-grief-all-the-things-you-should-not-say-to-the-bereaved/articleshow/83079071.cms||Sharmila Ganesan Ram
---||India||GoM to study concessions for key items to combat corona||NEW DELHI: The government on Saturday announced the setting up of an eight-member ministerial panel, headed by Meghalaya chief minister Conrad Sangma, to examine the issue of concessions or exemptions to Covid-19 materials like vaccines, oxygen concentrators, hand sanitisers, testing and PPE kits, masks, ventilators and temperaturechecking equipment. The GST Council, which met on Friday had decided to set up a group of ministers (GoM) as some states demanded zero rates on these materials to fight the pandemic. The other members of the panel are Gujarat deputy CM Nitinbhai Patel, Maharashtra deputy CM Ajit Pawar, Mauvin Godinho, minister for transport and panchayati raj, housing protocol and legislative affairs, Goa; Kerala finance minister KN Balagopal; Niranjan Pujari, minister for finance and excise, Odisha; TN Harish Rao, minister for finance, Telangana; and UP finance minister Suresh Kumar Khanna, according to a finance ministry statement. The panel will submit its report on June 8. The fitment committee comprising officers had recommended a reduction in rates for a number of items. While nine states wanted Covid materials to be zero-rated (which means the entire value chain to be exempted while providing tax credits to manufacturers), three states pushed for 5%. The Centre has said it was not clear if the benefit of lower rates on vaccines or other goods will flow to the end consumer. Revenue secretary Tarun Bajaj, following the GST council meeting on Friday, said vaccine is being purchased by the Centre and states and GST on it is coming back to them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/gom-to-study-concessions-for-key-items-to-combat-corona/articleshow/83079178.cms||---

The directive was issued on Saturday. While a pro-Congress teachers’ outfit questioned the motive behind such an order, especially in view of the pandemic situation, a CPM-backed teachers’ association welcomed the move. Kerala Pradesh School Teachers Association members have registered their protest against the directive and asked the general education department to spare teachers from door-to-door distribution of the leaflet. “It’s a politically-motivated move. The direction tests the common sense of public and puts at risk the lives of those involved,” said KPSTA state chief M Salahudheen. If the CM wants to give a message to kids, he can give it online, he added. Kerala School Teachers’ Association welcomed the move. “This is what the children and society want. A message from CM, when served at the doorstep of Class 1 students in these tough times should be welcomed by all,” said KSTA general secretary NT Sivarajan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/row-in-kerala-as-teachers-told-to-visit-kids-with-cm-pinarayi-vijayans-message/articleshow/83079196.cms||B S Anilkumar
---||Goa||Goa: Two students turn personal phone numbers into Covid helpline||PANAJI: When Goa hit the peak of the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic earlier this month, it was distressing for two final year BSc zoology students of Dhempe College, Miramar, to witness the calls for beds and oxygen supply that were flooding social media. Classmates, Vaishnavi Naik and Rohit Nikam wanted to help, but, as students, neither they nor their friends had the means to gather financial donations. The duo then stumbled on the idea of creating a website compiling all the Covid-19 facilities available in the state. Naik said Nikam realised in time that patients’ families may require assistance in locating a facility in the shortest time possible and so they turned their cell phone numbers into helpline. Now, overwhelmed with the experience of having been useful to those in need, the two have decided to continue their assistance even beyond the pandemic. “We would see people putting up status on social media platforms, asking about facilities every day. So we thought instead of families with Covid patients going through this confusion, we will put together all the available facilities on one blog or website, so that they do not have to go about asking,” Naik said. It was a meticulous task, compiling details of all the available oxygen and ventilator beds, etc. “We began making enquiries and started compiling the details. We would call a facility ourselves to ensure that the number is working and that the facility is actually available and only then update it on our website,” said Naik, a resident of Carambolim. Nikam said that it helps that online classes have been suspended for colleges as of now, as the work of updating the data on the website and responding to queries from patients’ families takes up three to four hours every day. “Our website has been checked 250 times. Besides the website, we have also circulated our numbers to receive any SOS calls. One person contacted us as he required a ventilator bed for a relative. The government had just taken control of beds in private hospitals and we found one for him. It felt good to be of help,” said Nikam, a Vasco resident. The duo now also wants to focus on mental health issues through their initiative, which they have called ‘For You Goa’. Naik said they want to help link counselors who are willing to offer free services with those who are on the lookout for such services. “We want make awareness videos, positive videos, videos where recovered Covid patients want to share their experiences and take this content to a wide audience who may benefit from it,” Nikam said. “Now, we have created a Whatsapp group as well and we want to keep adding persons to the group till we have at least one person from each area in it and build a network. We want to use this group to receive information faster about any person who needs assistance,” Naik said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/2-students-turn-personal-phone-nos-into-covid-helpline/articleshow/83074229.cms||---

Raju Samanta (30) was beaten to death while two others were hospitalized with critical injuries. BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari cited the case to argue that post-poll violence was continuing unabated in Bengal. “Our party worker at Diamond Harbour, Raju Samanta, has been murdered. He was brutally beaten to death. The state administration is silent on these killings,” Adhikari said, a day after Calcutta HC directed state officials to present “complete facts” on post-poll violence. Adhikari claimed that as many as 36 BJP workers had been killed while more than 50,000 had been rendered homeless. “The accused have not been arrested. Hundreds of women have been tortured and no step was taken. This cannot go on forever. We will protest if human rights are violated,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bjp-booth-prez-beaten-to-death-in-south-24-pgs/articleshow/83074156.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Breach of IAS protocol at Yaas review meet, says Suvendu Adhikari||KOLKATA: Leader of opposition in the Bengal assembly Suvendu Adhikari has squarely blamed the Bengal chief minister for the circumstances at the PM’s Kalaikunda review meeting on Friday that preceded the recall order to chief secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay. “I was there. The chief minister came to the review meeting along with the chief secretary after some time. She spoke to the PM for one-and-ahalf minutes, presented some papers and walked out with the CS. This is a breach of IAS protocol. The Bengal CM won’t allow the state bureaucracy to observe protocol,” Adhikari said on Saturday. “The PM waited for half an hour after the meeting for state officials to present a powerpoint presentation on the extent of the cyclone devastation. He also asked additional secretary Bhaskar Kulbe to find out if state officials would like to make any presentation. Kulbe came back and said that state officials had nothing to add after the CM had given the papers,” he said. The BJP leader also reminded that the CM didn’t send any state official to the meeting when Modi came to Kalaikunda after Cyclone Fani in 2019. “She also gave a miss to a number of Covid meetings the PM had with CMs,” he said. Refuting the CM’s “preoccupations”, Adhikari said: “The PMO informed both Odisha and Bengal about the PM’s itinerary on Thursday night. Accordingly, the CM rescheduled her programme. She changed her mind after she came to know that the leader of the opposition was invited. The Bengal CM had made up her mind to skip the meeting but changed her stance later realizing that her absence might deprive Bengal of central support.” The LoP tore into the CM’s version of the “BJP political meeting” at Kalaikunda. “The PMO had invited Odisha opposition leader Pradipta Naik too. It is another matter that Naik had Covid and couldn’t make it,” he said. The PMO had also invited Congress Lok Sabha leader Adhir Chowdhury to the meeting, Adhikari said. “Chowdhury was in Delhi and couldn’t attend,” he said. Adhikari urged Banerjee to shun her “arrogance” and “petty politics” in the interests of the state. “She (CM) doesn’t need to touch the PM’s feet. The only thing she needs to do is to abide by the Constitution. I have no inhibition showing respect to her as my CM. Similarly, she should have some respect for the PM,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/breach-of-ias-protocol-at-yaas-review-meet-suvendu/articleshow/83073884.cms||Rohit Khanna
---||Kolkata||Traffic lights on the blink in 3 police districts||Kolkata: Cyclone Yaas has taken a heavy toll on traffic signalling and surveillance systems in the three police districts of East Midnapore, Bankura and Sunderbans. The damage is most extensive in East Midnapore, which witnesses heavy traffic on the Contai-Digha stretch and had a robust signalling system in place. Police sources said it could take months to repair or replace the wrecked systems.  “Over the past few years, the traffic system from Digha and Potashpur to Nandkumar had been hugely developed. The cyclone has now rendered the surveillance system through CCTV cameras useless. The situation is no different in Bankura and the Sunderbans, although the impact there is concentrated to specific points. Several traffic kiosks have been damaged,” said a senior officer at Bhawani Bhavan. Police said they would not rush to restore equipment and funds allocation was a challenge. The primary objective is to get traffic lights at key intersections functional in order to prevent accidents, they said, adding that CCTV cameras would be gradually replaced. “Controlling traffic manually may be possible right now when there are only a few vehicles on the road. But once the restrictions are lifted, we may not be able to maintain proper vigil without all the equipment. We are trying to fix as many CCTV cameras as we can,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/traffic-lights-on-the-blink-in-3-police-districts/articleshow/83074028.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Didn’t ask for anything from PM: Mamata on Yaas relief||Kolkata: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Saturday said the Rs 20,000-crore relief proposal she gave Prime Minister Narendra Modi was based on a “preliminary assessment” of the devastation caused by Cyclone Yaas in Bengal. She emphasised that she did not “ask for anything” and told the PM that he must do whatever he thought was proper. Following an aerial survey of East Midnapore district, Banerjee said: “Water is yet to recede from the fields. Restoration will take time.” Responding to a question related to Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik refusing central aid for cyclone relief in Covid times, she said: “We have not asked for anything either. Based on our findings, we have given a report. We did not get anything for Bulbul and Phani in the past. For Amphan, they (the Centre) had provided an advance of Rs 1,000 crore from the state quota.” Banerjee, after concluding her survey of the three affected districts (North and South 24 Parganas on Friday and East Midnapore on Saturday), further said: “The high tide has caused much more devastation than the cyclone itself. The storm spurred tsunami-like waves. Farmlands, fisheries, animal husbandry, power installations and homestead land have suffered heavy damage.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/didnt-ask-for-anything-from-pm-mamata-on-yaas-relief/articleshow/83073925.cms||---

Around 11.30 pm on Friday, the deceased identified as Badal Varagiya (20), who was living in Navsari district’s Chikhli town, was trying to go around the circle when a speeding pick-up van knocked him down killing him on the spot. Coincidentally, the accident was captured in a video by a car driver who was recording his drive on his mobile phone. Police said that the pick-up van, registered in Maharashtra first overtook the car from left side and then did not slow down at the circle. “The pick-up van driver was at a very high speed due to which his vehicle could have overturned after hitting the bike, but the driver of the vehicle managed to balance and he sped off,” said a police official. The van driver Bhaskar Majulkar, was nabbed on Saturday based on the vehicle’s registration number. Police said that the video recorded by the car driver helped them with the car’s registration number. Majulkar is a resident of Nasik in Maharashtra and was on his way to his hometown when the accident took place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/speeding-pick-up-van-kills-biker/articleshow/83072680.cms||---

Speaking to TOI on the issue on Saturday, state BJP president and Rajya Sabha MP Deepak Prakash said that they have made elaborate plans to celebrate May 30 by serving the people. “BJP believes in the mantra of seva hi sangathan and so, we have decided to mark Modi 2.0 by serving the people. As per the plan, party workers cutting across ranks will visit 5,000 villages and provide all kinds of assistance to the villagers. They will also be informed of the work done by the Union government for farmers, marginalised people and how Modi brought about the overall development of the country in the last two years,” he added. “Every MP and MLA needs to visit two villages each in his/her constituency and interact with the people there and help them with whatever they need. I am planning to visit Simalia and Hata villages in Ratu block,” Prakash said The legislators will reportedly distribute dry ration and essential equipment like oximeters, thermometers, masks, sanitisers and the likes, among the villagers based on their requirements. “All of them have been advised to adhere to Covid-appropriate behaviour,” Prakash said. The party’s youth wing, women’s wing, etc., will organise special blood donation camps across the state. “We have set a target of collecting 3,500 units on Sunday through the special drive. This will help save a large number of lives,” Prakash said. The former chief ministers, however, have been exempted from taking part in the outreach programme for security reasons. “A slew of security measures need to be followed when it comes to a former CM, which may cause problems amid the pandemic. Therefore, they have been excluded from the field visits,” Prakash said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bjp-plans-outreach-programme-in-5k-hamlets-today-to-celebrate-modis-2-yrs-in-office/articleshow/83072725.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Police said the stock, which included rice and wheat, was being diverted for sale in the open market. The owner of the godown and a truck driver have been arrested. The pilferage came to light on Friday night when a truck carrying 20 sacks of wheat, each of 50kg, was stopped at a checkpoint in Kharagpur. The sacks bore the FCI stamp. Driver Ramesh Rao said he was transporting wheat to a grinding mill in town, but did not have any documents for the consignment. He was taken into custody. During interrogation, police learned that the consignment had been sent by one Mahesh Gupta. On Saturday morning, Gupta was questioned and arrested. Police raided his godown at Kharida in ward 19. Kharagpur SDO Azmal Hossain, SDPO Deepak Sarkar, Kharagpur police station IC and a food control inspector were present. Forty sacks of flour, each containing 50 packets of around 1 kg each, were seized along with 18 sacks of rice, each weighing 50kg, were recovered. Rao and Gupta were later produced in court and have been remanded in three days’ custody. “We are trying to trace the ration dealer from whom the grain was diverted to the godown,” Hossain said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/21-tonnes-of-pds-foodgrain-seized-from-godown-2-held/articleshow/83074209.cms||Sujoy Khanra

---||Kolkata||Can even touch PM’s feet, but end political vendetta, says West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee||KOLKATA: CM Mamata Banerjee on Saturday accused PM Narendra Modi of “playing dirty games”, linking the BJP’s anti-Bengal “vendetta politics” after the assembly poll loss to the central directive to state chief secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay to report to Delhi. “If the PM tells me he is going to help Bengal if I touch his feet, I am ready to do that,” Banerjee said. “If it makes you happy, I have no problem. I can do even that for Bengal. But, please Prime Minister, do not play these dirty games. I appeal to you to end this political vendetta. I appeal to you to please withdraw this letter and allow the chief secretary to work for Covid- and cyclone-affected people. We are working as a team. Allow us to work,” she added. The Centre on Friday asked Bandyopadhyay to report to Delhi by 10 am on Monday four days after approving a state government request to grant him a three-month extension. “We believed the Centre would talk to the state and end this. But we have just heard that it has filed caveats in the (Calcutta) HC and Central Administrative Tribunal. This is one-sided. I still want good sense to prevail,” she said. “I have appealed today. We will decide (on the next move) depending on the situation,” she added. Accusing the Centre of revising the schedule for the original “PM-CM meeting”, she said: “Where is the question of skipping the meeting? It was not a PM-CM meeting. They revised the schedule to include the governor, Union ministers, opposition leaders and MLAs.” When asked about the presence of assembly opposition leader Suvendu Adhikari in the PM’s cyclone review meet and whether that was a reason for her skipping that meet, she shot back, “Did the PM meet the opposition leader when he went to Gujarat after Cyclone Tauktae? Did he meet the opposition leader in Odisha?” Banerjee explained her 30-minute delay in reaching Kalaikunda from Sagar, saying her chopper was told to wait for 20 minutes as the PM’s chopper was landing. “We waited on the road. We also had to hover in the air for 10-15 minutes. But this is the security protocol and I have nothing to say,” she added. “The weather was inclement but we took a risk. Courtesy demands that I meet the PM if he is in Bengal,” she said. Banerjee said she sought to meet Modi immediately after reaching Kalaikunda. “Director (security) Vivek Sahay was told by the Special Protection Group to wait for an hour. But, when we heard the PM was in the conference room, we (she and the chief secretary) went there and met him. I submitted the reports, told him of my scheduled visits to cyclone-affected areas. He heard me. He took the reports. I asked him not once but thrice, ‘Sir, can I leave with your kind permission?’ We then left with his permission. Where is the controversy? They showed empty chairs. Did they show us talking to the PM even once?” she asked. “What is his (the CS’s) fault? He was accompanying me as the head of the state administration to oversee the cyclone impact. Isn’t that obvious? But he also met the PM along with me,” the CM said, accusing the PM’s office of “leaking one-sided accounts” that were “parroted by all central ministers”. “Have you seen even one such incident in the last 74 years (since Independence)? This is not only about Bengal’s chief secretary; this is humiliating for all state chief secretaries. Is this the courtesy you extend to someone on his retirement day?” Banerjee asked. “The Centre gave the chief secretary an extension for Covid work. And now you want him back? Everyone is shocked at this unconstitutional and illegal act. There seems to be a separate rule for Bengal these days that does not apply to others. It is as if Bengal is under martial law,” she said, adding: “You can insult me but do not insult my officers. I still believe this needs a constitutional solution and not a political solution.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/can-even-touch-pms-feet-but-end-political-vendetta-didi/articleshow/83074544.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal chief secretary recall: CPM & Congress lash out at Centre||KOLKATA: Congress on Saturday termed the Centre’s action to recall Bengal chief secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay as a “lethal blow” to federalism and said the decision has “shocked the conscience of the entire nation”. CPM questioned the timing of the move. In a statement, Congress general secretary and spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala asked the central government to disclose the reason for the U-turn in recalling the chief secretary. “The abrupt, malicious and unilateral recall of West Bengal’s chief secretary by the Modi government has shocked the conscience of the entire nation. This is a double whammy, when viewed in light of the fact that he was granted an extension for three months by the Modi government itself, as recently as four days ago,” he said. “This is a lethal blow to the Constitution of India as also federalism. If the Union government is permitted to recall All India Service Officers ie IAS and IPS from the states for bipartisan political considerations and at its whims and fancies, the entire architecture of the rule of law and the Constitution will crumble,” Surjewala said. This would lead to “complete and total anarchy” in the country, he argued. Senior lawyer and CPM Rajya Sabha MP Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya questioned the timing of the move. “It is foolish to recall the officer whose extension had been granted a few days back. Alapan Bandyopadhyay is completing his service career on Monday, so there is no point in asking him to report to Delhi on Monday,” he said. Congress leader and senior advocate Arunabha Ghosh said: “What is happening with Alapan Bandyopadhyay is very unfortunate and shows the vindictive nature of BJP. The CM is the reporting officer of the chief secretary. So, if he is asked by the CM to accompany her while she meets the PM, Bandyopadhyay is duty-bound to follow the CM’s directives.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/chief-secy-recall-cpm-cong-lash-out-at-centre/articleshow/83073922.cms||Debashis Konar
---||Jamshedpur||East Singhbhum admin begins cleanliness drive in cyclone-ravaged areas||JAMSHEDPUR: The district administration has begun a massive cleanliness drive across all the low-lying areas near Subarnarekha, Kharkhai and Domuhani rivers, which were submerged in the heavy rains brought on by cyclone Yaas earlier this week. “Now that the water has receded, we have begun a cleanliness drive on a large-scale,” East Singhbhum DC Suraj Kumar said. The overflowing of rivers and drains led to more than 1,200 houses in Kadma, Sonari, Jugsalai, Mango, Baridih, Bagbera, Olidih, and Birsanagar, among others, being flooded, prompting the health department to launch a fogging exercise, besides the cleanliness drive, across the three urban municipal bodies of Jamshedpur Notified Area Committee (JNAC), Mango Notified Area Committee (MNAC) and Jugsalai municipality to avert the possible outbreaks of malaria and diarrhoea. The authorities will also sprinkle bleaching powder in the affected areas to get rid of the breeding grounds of mosquitoes. “Sanitisation has already begun and once that is done, fogging and sprinkling of bleaching powder will be done,” JNAC’s special officer Krishna Kumar said. Some residents have appealed to the social outfits to help the municipal bodies in carrying out the sanitation work. “We appeal to the NGOs to come forward in helping the municipal bodies carry out the cleanliness drive as they have an uphill task ahead of them. Many homes are submerged and they have limited resources, so any help is appreciated,” social worker Subroto Sarkar (30), who lives at Marive Drive in Kadma, said. Meanwhile, the district authorities are planning to organise camps to conduct Covid tests on those who were cooped up in the relief centres when the cyclone battered their homes. Over 10,000 people took shelter in the relief centres across the three urban municipal bodies of JNAC, MNAC and Jugsalai municipality on May 26 and 27. Meanwhile, several houses in Bagbera are faced with water scarcity due to the disruption in supply. “People have returned home from the relief centres but there’s water shortage,” Bagbera resident Subodh Jha said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/e-sbhum-admin-begins-cleanliness-drive-in-cyclone-ravaged-areas/articleshow/83082366.cms||---

The tweet posted in Hindi on Saturday garnered sharp reactions from both Congress and JMM, the two key ruling parties in the state, and urged the government and the Jharkhand high court to take up penal proceedings against the parliamentarian for issuing “threats”. Dubey on Saturday uploaded the transfer letter of West Bengal chief secretary Alapan Bandopadhyay to Delhi, Dubey tweeted, ““Mukhyamantri Hemant Soren ji ke ishare par nachne wale adhikaariyon, Alta ji, Palta ji, Bhajan ji, Achha ji, Kachha ji, Eji, Unchi, sabke liye sabak. Kanoon ke anusaar chaliye, kanoon sammat kaam kariye nahi toh Dilli posting ka intezar kariye.” The parliamentarian was referring to the recall of Bandopadhyay, who is considered close to Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee, after Mamata skipped the meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi to assess the impact of Cyclone Yaas. Former Union minister and senior Congress leader Subodh Kant Sahay termed the transfer as vindictive politics. “This will be the first-ever forced central deputation of a chief secretary of a state. How much lower will Modi-Shah’s BJP stoop? A similar incident happened in 2001 but the then chief minister of Tamil Nadu, J Jayalalithaa, refused to let go her senior officers,” he said. Congress state spokesperson Alok Kumar Dubey said the statement of BJP MP was unfortunate. “This threat of transfer on central deputation aims at demoralising the IAS and IPS officers doing good work during the pandemic. If they resolve to expose the corruption cases of former CM Raghubar Das’s tenure, all BJP leaders would be behind the bars,” he claimed. Expressing shock over Dubey’s tweet, JMM central general secretary Supriyo Bhattarchaya said, “It is an attack on the democratic federal structure of the country. It also seems the Centre wants to bulldoze the federal structure, which is evident from the MP’s threats to the bureaucrats.” He also accused the Centre of depriving the state governments of their share of funds and the Covid-19 vaccine. “If the officers from central service and working with the states are recalled and threatened, it would be difficult for the state governments to function,” he said. The JMM leader further said, “Two days ago, former chief minister Raghubar Das threatened to take the bureaucrats to task if BJP returns to power just because they are probing into the bridge collapse case and other corruption which apparently took place during the previous BJP government. Today, Dubey has come out with an open threat.” Calling upon the state government to lodge a case against both the BJP leaders for issuing threats to public servants. “Even the high court should take cognizance and initiate action against the BJP leaders for the threats,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/file-case-against-nishikant-for-threat-to-bureaucrats-jmm-to-govt/articleshow/83072818.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

Following cyclone Yaas, the water level in the river has risen and was flowing above the danger mark on Friday. Suraj and his friend Gopal Kumar dived together but the latter escaped narrowly. The incident occurred at Sati ghat in Kadma, police said. Health minister Banna Gupta, who is also a local MLA, has directed the district administration to trace the boy. Suraj’s father Baldev Parmanik said the boys had gone to the river for bath but his son got swept away in the current while Gopal was rescued by four people on the bank. The NDRF team was pressed but the boy wasn’t found till the time of filing this report.

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Will be difficult to work if political vendetta claims officers’ scalps||KOLKATA: The repeated attempts by the Centre to issue transfer orders to state officers for central deputation citing all-India service rules, without the consent of the state or the officers concerned themselves, were questioned by a cross-section of senior officers on Saturday for its “political motives”. All-India services rules say if the state doesn’t agree to any such central deputation, the Centre’s decision will prevail. However, states in several cases — including Bengal in the IPS issue — have not released the officers, and in some cases like Tamil Nadu even acted against the officers when they wanted to take up the central offer. There are also examples that states, in a tit-for-tat move, have recalled officers from central deputation. Around 15 senior IPS and IAS officers from Bengal are now on central deputation. Since December, the Centre had ordered transfer of three senior IPS officers from Bengal and on Friday ordered the state’s chief secretary to report to North Block on Monday. Former Union culture secretary and Prasar Bharati CEO Jawhar Sircar questioned the political motive behind the transfer order as he dubbed this as a “revenge for 48% Bengal vote against BJP”. He said, “The procedure is to advertise vacancy. This was not done. Call for options. This was not done. The officer gives his option to go. Not done. State then recommends his option (not done), officer’s name features in the central eligibility panel (not known), the posting offered must match his scale and grade (not known) and finally state has to release ((not done). Until then, it is not legal and procedurally correct. This is an absurdly politically vindictive transfer.” Former KoPT chairman and ex-MP Bikram Sarkar said, “A bureaucrat, at the fag end of his career, is being made to suffer simply because of a political conflict between the Centre and state. There might be political differences with the state and the Centre, but in this way recalling the officer to Delhi is unethical. It is a mean way to teach a lesson to Alapan (Bandyopadhyay) and rather the CM, as she is not toeing the lines of BJP. Moreover, for any central deputation there is an unwritten law that the officer concerned must be willing to go for central deputation but here Alapan is unwilling.” Among serving officers, the notion of “political harassment” has grown stronger. In poll-bound Bengal, central agencies started questioning top IAS and IPS officers for cases instituted long back. In December, an IGP, a DIG and an SP were asked to report to Delhi for deputation. “Officers have to follow state government orders, like central government officers have to follow orders of Centre. Singling out officers for attack to settle political scores is unsettling,” an officer said. DoPT is the controlling cadre for IAS officers, while it is MHA for IPS officers. On Friday, DoPT recalled the Bengal chief secretary; the MHA had done it for the IPS officers in December. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Saturday referred to this growing uneasiness among the IAS and IPS “lobby” at the “illegal and unconstitutional move”. Referring to Bandyopadhyay’s career as a civil servant, she said she never had any single complaint against him. Bandyopadhyay is a 1987-batch officer. He heads the state disaster management authority and overlooks the KMC. “The Centre’s extension to Bandyopadhyay were on the grounds of Covid and cyclone relief in Bengal. Recalling him to Delhi undermines the very reason for which he was allowed an extension by the Union cabinet secretary,” another officer argued. A former state chief secretary argued that as per IAS cadre rules, a secretarylevel transfer can be done by the Centre only with the consent of the state. Moreover, he questioned the rationale of central deputation since the three-month extension to Bandyopadhyay had been given for the post of Bengal chief secretary. “The state can move CAT or Calcutta high court on this,” he argued.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/will-be-difficult-to-work-if-political-vendetta-claims-officers-scalps/articleshow/83073829.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Kolkata||2 weeks into curbs, Covid beds start falling vacant in Kolkata hospitals||KOLKATA: Ever since strict restrictions were imposed by the state government on May 16, there has been a significant decline in the number of Covid admissions across the city’s private hospitals, with more vacancies in general wards than in ICUs and HDUs. At least two leading hospitals said their critical-care beds, too, have started falling vacant since last week for the first time since early-April when the second wave struck. Enquiries for admissions, too, have dropped sharply and waiting lists have been done away with in some hospitals. The slide has been so sharp at some hospitals that two are even planning to open up floors for non-Covid patients as early as next week. Addressing a press meet on Saturday, CM Mamata Banerjee confirmed the trend saying positivity rate in Bengal has dropped to18%-19% from 33%. On Saturday, Kolkata reported 1,735 new cases, a sharp dip from the 3,951 recorded on May 15, when the Covid restrictions were imposed. Similarly, the number of fresh cases across Bengal dipped to11,514 on Saturday from19,511 on May15. At the three centres of AMRI Hospitals, there has been a 20%-25% drop in occupancy at the general Covid wards over the last fortnight and 5%-10% vacancy in ICU and HDU units since last week. “Before the restrictions were imposed, we had 100% occupancy across all our three centres. At least four patients were on the waiting list for each bed. Now, we have no waiting list and the waiting time for an ICU bed has come down to just 24 hours,” said AMRI CEO Rupak Barua. With the restrictions continuing, he expects occupancy to drop by another10% in a week. Covid admissions at RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) have reduced by 30% over the last one week after remaining fully occupied for a month. The positivity rate at RTIICS has come down to 25%-30% this week compared to 50% in the beginning of May, said R Venkatesh, zonal head of RTIICS. “Ward occupancy is around 60% and critical care occupancy is 80%,” he said. Since ICU occupancy has also started coming down over the past week, the Narayana group plans to convert one floor at the Narayana Multispecialty Hospital into a non-Covid section. “Depending on further reduction in Covid cases and an increase in non-Covid patients, we will keep adding the remaining floors for non-Covid treatment by the first week of June,” Venkatesh said. Since mid-May, occupancy at Peerless Hospital has slid from 100% to around 95%. “Almost everyone is getting a bed at both our wards and ICU. If this continues, we may start reconverting Covid beds into non-Covid ones,” said CEO Sudipta Mitra. With enough general beds available, satellite facilities run by private hospitals have now become practically empty. While a few hospitals are planning to close them, others will take a call in three to four weeks. “Satellite facilities are an extension of the hospital. But since we have about 40-odd general beds empty and are expecting a further decline in bed occupancy, we are planning to close our satellite facility for now,” said Simmardeep Gill, COO CK Birla Hospitals CMRI. “Our satellite facility with 50 beds is practically empty,” said Pradip Tondon, CEO Belle Vue Clinic. Medica Superspecialty Hospital has closed one of its two satellite facilities where occupancy had dropped to zero. “The number of ICU patients hasn’t declined much, but the restrictions since May 16 has pulled down the number of general ward patients,” said consultant Arindam Biswas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/2-wks-into-curbs-cov-beds-start-falling-vacant-in-hosps/articleshow/83074553.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

The overflowing of rivers and drains led to more than 1,200 houses in Kadma, Sonari, Jugsalai, Mango, Baridih, Bagbera, Olidih, and Birsanagar, among others, being flooded, prompting the health department to launch a fogging exercise, besides the cleanliness drive, across the three urban municipal bodies of Jamshedpur Notified Area Committee (JNAC), Mango Notified Area Committee (MNAC) and Jugsalai municipality to avert the possible outbreaks of malaria and diarrhoea. The authorities will also sprinkle bleaching powder in the affected areas to get rid of the breeding grounds of mosquitoes. “Sanitisation has already begun and once that is done, fogging and sprinkling of bleaching powder will be done,” JNAC’s special officer Krishna Kumar said. Some residents have appealed to the social outfits to help the municipal bodies in carrying out the sanitation work. “We appeal to the NGOs to come forward in helping the municipal bodies carry out the cleanliness drive as they have an uphill task ahead of them. Many homes are submerged and they have limited resources, so any help is appreciated,” social worker Subroto Sarkar (30), who lives at Marive Drive in Kadma, said. Meanwhile, the district authorities are planning to organise camps to conduct Covid tests on those who were cooped up in the relief centres when the cyclone battered their homes. Over 10,000 people took shelter in the relief centres across the three urban municipal bodies of JNAC, MNAC and Jugsalai municipality on May 26 and 27. Meanwhile, several houses in Bagbera are faced with water scarcity due to the disruption in supply. “People have returned home from the relief centres but there’s water shortage,” Bagbera resident Subodh Jha said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/e-sbhum-admin-begins-cleanliness-drive-in-cyclone-ravaged-areas/articleshow/83072694.cms||---

---||Chennai||Cases drop, doubling time up: Tamil Nadu reaps benefits of lockdown||At least 5.7 lakh people tested positive and 6,597 died of Covid-19 when the state was in lockdown for 17 days between May 11 and 28. On Friday, the state decided to extend the intense lockdown after seeing its positive effects in at least seven districts, including Chennai. Epidemiologists have also reported a welcome increase in doubling time and decrease in infection reproduction rate (R-naught). Rise and fall of casesChennai, which logged 7,466 new cases on May 11, reported 2,762 cases on May 28. Cases in Chengalpet dropped from 2,419 to 1,379 and in Tiruvallur, it came down from 1,204 to 967 in the same time period. "Across the world, lockdown seems to be the only quick and effective way to bring down the infection," said health minister Ma Subramanian. Even in districts that now report more cases compared to May 11, fresh cases are starting to fall. Coimbatore, which reported 2,650 on May 11, reported 4,734 cases on Thursday. But on Friday, cases fell to 3,937. In Tirupur, cases increased from 582 on May 11 to 2,074 on Thursday, but again fell to 1,823 on Friday. Public health officials said closing industries in these districts helped break the viral reproduction. "When we give little chance for the virus to spread, the fall in epidemic curve is as quick as the rise," said director of public health Dr T S Selvavinayagam. Daily cases in TN shot up to more than 36,000 during the lockdown period, but is now around 31,000. Over the past few days, Tiruvarur and Karur districts in central TN have seen an increase. On May 11, Karur and Tiruvarur had 166 and 270 cases respectively. They are now reporting more than 500 cases. "We expect cases to fall in both districts in the next few days," he said. Infection rate downTamil Nadu's test positivity rate - percentage of people testing positive over total tested - has plateaued around 20.3% in the past two weeks. At least 14 districts, particularly Chennai, reported a fall in test positivity rate. The test positivity rate, however, is high across western districts, but officials say the falling R-naught will reduce cases in west and across TN. The R value of TN, which went above 1 in the third week of February, went up to 1.4 on March 20 and was stable for a month.  On May 11, the R-value was around 1.1 and has been consistently declining. Since May 21, the R-value is below 1. The doubling period for cases increased from 33 days on May 11 to 39 days on May 28. Bed availabilityThe availability of beds improved in districts with fall in cases. While occupancy rate in most hospitals was still above 90%, the wait time for an oxygen or ICU bed reduced to an average of two hours from more than six hours on May 11 in Chennai and surrounding districts. "The stressful period of people waiting in ambulances at the foyers is over now," said Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital dean Dr Theranirajan. "Our beds are full, but we are able to take most people directly into the emergency room and allot them beds in wards or ICU." The struggle for beds in high incidence districts such as Coimbatore continues, but officials say they will be able to bring down the incidence in a few days. "Our system was overwhelmed, and doctors were tired, but we made judicious use of resources," said director of medical education Dr R Narayanababu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/cases-drop-doubling-time-up-tamil-nadu-reaps-benefits-of-lockdown/articleshow/83079222.cms||Pushpa Narayan

However, BJP and private hospitals spiked the allegations. The issue snowballed into a political controversy after an audio clip, purportedly containing a phone conversation between a person identified as social activist Venkatesh and the staffer of a private hospital in Banashankari 3rd Stage, went viral. The president of Hanumanthanagar block Congress submitted a representation to deputy commissioner of police (south division), citing the audio clip and pointed out the hospital staffer is heard saying vaccine can’t be sold for less than Rs 900 as a portion of the money had to be given to Basavanagudi MLA Ravi Subramanya. State Congress president DK Shivakumar urged the high court’s intervention, alleging: “According to the reports, elected members from the ruling party are taking vaccines bought by the government and handing them over to private hospitals to sell to the public. We demand the chief justice of Karnataka intervene and order a probe.” Meanwhile, social media reports reportedly linked MLA Ravi Subramanya with AV Multispeciality Hospital in Hosakerehalli in connection with the high vaccine cost. Subramanya, however, denied the allegations and said that he was nowhere connected to the said hospital. “Certain miscreants have used my name in allegations about Covid-19 vaccine charges through an audio recording,” he said. Chairman of AV Multispeciality Hospital Dr Rajesh Murthy said: “The conversation (in the audio clip) is to specifically defame the hospital and Basavanagudi MLA. The audio clip is maliciously concocted.” He said the vaccines were being procured by the hospital and administered to people at the rate prescribed by the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-audio-clip-on-vaccination-cost-triggers-row/articleshow/83079225.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Covid-19: Karnataka government to ramp up medical facilities for children||BENGALURU: With a potential third wave of Covid-19 likely to hit Karnataka in the next three to six months, the state government is preparing an action plan to ramp up the health infrastructure, especially children’s hospitals and ICU beds. Multiple experts have said that children will face a higher risk of infection in the third wave than they have so far. Members of two expert committees, formed to suggest ways to prevent morbidity and mortality in the paediatric stage, held a preliminary round of deliberations in the city on Friday. BBMP chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta said that proposals were being drawn up to establish children’s hospitals and increase the number of ICU beds in existing facilities. After facing severe criticism for its handling of the second wave, the government is moving quickly to reduce the risks for children as virus mutations and their impact on younger age groups are not clear. So far, kids (0-9 years) have been relatively protected. According to the state health department’s data, around 76,000 children have tested positive for Covid-19 since March last year and 57 aged below 10 have died. In the 10-19 age group, there have been 1.9 lakh cases and 75 deaths. The state’s overall tally of infections stood at 25.6 lakh on Saturday. “Though it is not clear what will be the third wave’s impact on children, the epidemiological pattern suggests that they may be at risk,” a health official said. Members of the expert panels told STOI that multiple subcommittees had been formed and asked to submit reports on how to handle possible paediatric emergencies. “They have been directed to give detailed reports on paediatric ICU availability in the state, number of trained nurses and intensivists, and requirement of additional and upgraded infrastructure,” a member said. Another member said that there were about 2,000 paediatricians in Karnataka, and this was a concern. A few weeks ago, experts discussed the care children might need after recovering from Covid-19. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MISC) is associated with Covid-19. It occurs after two to three weeks of Covid recovery, and typical symptoms are swelling in the hands and feet, highgrade fever, rashes and red eyes. “The need is to educate parents about the warning signs,” said another member. One sub-committee is tracking Covid vaccine manufacturers’ clinical trials among children. The government is considering a special policy in anticipation of the third wave. “We are looking at fully vaccinating both the parents to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus to children. We will also focus on increasing the supply of medicines needed for paediatric Covid treatment,” said an official. Another official said that the government was thinking about restricting social gatherings involving children and putting on the back burner the issue of reopening schools. “We will have to come up with a creative campaign to educate children about health protocols and raise awareness on the importance of eating healthy and home-cooked food,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/covid-19-karnataka-government-to-ramp-up-medical-facilities-for-children/articleshow/83079244.cms||Rakesh Prakash

Going by this number, the required number of vials for the six-week therapy would be over 29 lakh. Even with imports and boost to domestic production, what will be available could be way below what is required, considering the fact that more cases are being added daily. On May 22, there were 8,848 cases across India according to the central government. By May 26, the total number of cases went up to 11,717, an increase of 2,869 cases in just four days. The treatment of mucormycosis needs 5-7 vials per patient per day over 42 days or six weeks, about 250 vials per patient. For 11,700 patients, about 70,200 vials would be needed each day. The government has procured and distributed over 1.5 lakh vials since May 22 and says production of just over 1.63 lakh vials in May is expected to go up to 2.55 lakh in June. It also plans to import 3.63 lakh vials in May and 3.15 lakh in June. Gowda tweeted that 3.63 lakh vials of amphotericin-B will be imported in May, resulting in total availability of 5.27 lakh vials. “And 3.15 lakh vials will be imported in June 2021 making availability of 5.70 lakh vials in June 2021 inclusive of domestic production,” he added. Read Also5 more manufactures given license to produce drug used to treat black fungus: GovtNEW DELHI: The Union health ministry on Friday said license has been given to five more manufactures for production of Amphotericin-B, used in the treatment of black fungus, and they will start producing 1,11,000 vials of the drug per month from July. Efforts are being made to supplement theThere are two kinds of amphotericin being used. Lyposomal amphotericin, the more expensive version, which is said to be slightly less toxic for kidneys, costs Rs 5,000-7,000 per vial. So, just the cost of amphotericin for treating one patient could be roughly Rs 15 lakh. Even the less expensive version, lipid complex or lipid emulsion amphotericin costs about Rs 2,000 per vial, which would mean Rs 5 lakh for just the drug without counting the cost of hospitalisation, tests, surgery etc. Clearly, the treatment would be unaffordable for many who might be forced to pay out of pocket. Doctors involved in treating black fungus say the cheaper version is just as good and that the claims about kidney toxicity are mostly industry driven to sell the more expensive version.

Taking note of the increasing numbers, the Central government has emphasised upon expediting the allocation of vials ofWhile the government has stated that it is allocating amphotericin vials to states based on the number of cases, several states including Delhi, Punjab and Maharashtra have said they have more cases than the central government data is showing. Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal stated that Delhi has reported 620 cases so far, nearly five times more than the number of cases (119) reported by the central government. On May 25, the Centre put the number of black fungus patients in Maharashtra at 2,770. But in the Bombay high court during a hearing, the state advocate general said that as of May 26 there were 3,200 such patients and the state needed at least 14,000 vials per day. “We are getting 4,000-5,000 per day from the Centre,” he said. There are six domestic suppliers of amphotericin — Bharat Serums & Vaccines, BDR Pharmaceuticals, Sun Pharma, Cipla, Life Care Innovations and Mylan. Five new companies, Emcure Pharmaceuticals, Natco Pharma, Gufic Bioscience Ltd, Alembic Pharmaceuticals and Lyca Pharmaceuticals have been given approval to produce the drug amphotericin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-shortage-of-black-fungus-drug-looming/articleshow/83079300.cms||Rema Nagarajan
