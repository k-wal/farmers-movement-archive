It said 12,52,320 beneficiaries in the 18-44 age group received their first dose of Covid vaccine on Monday and cumulatively 1,18,81,337 people across 37 states and UTs have received it since the start of Phase-3 of the vaccination drive on May 1. Bihar, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh have administered the first dose of Covid vaccine to more than 10 lakh beneficiaries in the 18-44 age group, it said. The total number of vaccine doses administered across the country so far stands at 19,84,43,550, the ministry said. The beneficiaries include 97,78,142 healthcare workers (HCWs) who have taken the first dose and 67,18,515 HCWs who have taken the second dose; 1,50,74,689 frontline workers (FLWs) who have received the first dose, 83,55,642 FLWs who have taken the second; and 1,18,81,337 individuals in the 18-44 age group who have received the first dose. Besides, 6,15,11,397 and 99,13,239 beneficiaries in the 45-60 age group have been administered the first and second dose while 5,68,98,522 and 1,83,12,067 beneficiaries above 60 years have taken the first and second dose. As many as 23,65,395 vaccine doses were administered on Monday, the 129th day of the vaccination drive. According to provisional data, 21,90,849 beneficiaries were administered the first dose and 1,74,546 received the second dose, the ministry said, adding that final reports for the day would be completed by late night. The vaccination exercise as a tool to protect the most vulnerable population groups in the country from Covid-19 continues to be regularly reviewed and monitored at the highest level, it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/over-19-84-crore-covid-19-vaccine-doses-administered-so-far-government/articleshow/82920816.cms||---
---||World||Covid-19 global developments: New York to open public schools this fall, Malta claims herd immunity and more||NEW DELHI: The Covid-19 pandemic has killed at least 3,465,398 people worldwide since the virus first emerged in December 2019, according to an AFP compilation of official data. The US is the worst-affected country with 589,893 deaths, followed by Brazil with 444,068, India with 303,720, Mexico with 221,647 and Britain with 127,721. Here are the latest developments: US reports lowest number of new Covid cases in nearly a yearThe United States last week reported the lowest number of new COVID-19 cases in nearly a year, with new infections dropping 26% from the previous seven days to just under 180,000, according to a Reuters analysis of state and county data. Deaths from Covid-19 fell 5% to 3,969 in the week ended May 23, the fewest deaths in a week since March 2020. About 39% of the country's population has been fully vaccinated as of Sunday, and 49% has received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. All Italian regions become Covid-19 low riskAll Italian regions turned to "yellow" on Monday, indicating a low risk of contagion, and the lowest level of anti-Covid-19 restrictions, according to national health authorities. Health Minister Roberto Speranza announced this last Friday following the latest monitoring report by the National Institute of Health (ISS), the Xinhua news agency reported. During the week from May 10 to May 16, the national Covid-19 reproduction number (R number), an indicator used to determine how fast the Covid-19 is spreading, dropped to 0.78 from 0.86 registered in the previous ISS weekly survey. Overall, the R number below 1 shows the pandemic is in a regressive phase. The coronavirus incidence rate also dropped to 66 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in the week from May 10 to May 16, against 96 in the previous week. NYC mayor: Public schools will be all in person this fallNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio promised a return to normal for the nation's largest public school system on Monday as he announced that classrooms will open for in-person instruction in September with no remote option. "It's time for everyone to come back,'' said de Blasio, a Democrat. "It's time for us all to be together. It's time to do things the way they were meant to be done. All the kids in the classroom together getting a great education from educators who care, staff members who care." De Blasio said the roughly 1 million students who attend traditional public schools will be in their classrooms with some version of the coronavirus protocols that have been in place in the current academic year, including mask-wearing and Covid-19 testing. Malta has achieved herd immunity with Covid shots, says ministerMalta has vaccinated 70 per cent of its adult population with at least one Covid-19 shot, becoming the first European Union country to achieve so-called herd immunity, Health Minister Chris Fearne said on Monday. The tiny Mediterranean island has had an average of three new virus cases each day in the past week, with the test positivity rate at a low of 0.2%. Two new cases were reported on Monday. "Vaccines are being administered at a rate of one every five seconds," Fearne told a news conference. "Forty-two percent of the adult population has received two doses." Vaccination is currently open to all residents of Malta over the age of 16 and Fearne said children aged 12 and over would also be inoculated once European medical authorities give the go-ahead. India becomes third nation to record 300,000 Covid fatalitiesIndia becomes the third nation, after the United States and Brazil, to record 300,000 Covid fatalities. The country registered 4,454 deaths in 24 hours, the second-highest daily figure so far. Experts say the real numbers of deaths and infections, now 26.7 million, are probably much higher. The brutal second wave has been accompanied by the emergence of thousands of cases of the rare infection called mucormycosis among coronavirus patients. Small group of countries monopolising Covid-19 vaccines: WHOWorld Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus says it is "scandalous" that a small group of countries are monopolising Covid-19 vaccines, calling for a huge global effort to vaccinate 10 per cent of every nation's population by September. More than 75 per cent of all Covid vaccines have gone to just 10 countries, he says at the opening of the WHO's main annual assembly. "We are at war with a virus," he says, adding that "we need the logic and urgency of a war economy, to boost the capacity of our weapons." He said that at least 115,000 health and care workers have died from Covid since the beginning of the pandemic. Japan opens mass vaccination centresJapan opens its first mass vaccination centres to speed up its cautious inoculation programme with just two months until the virus-postponed Tokyo Olympics. The two military-run centres in Tokyo and Osaka will administer thousands of shots daily, with criticism building as just two per cent of Japan's population of 125 million are fully vaccinated so far, compared with around 40 per cent in the US and 15 per cent in France. Dogs can be trained to detect asymptomatic Covid-19 patientsNew research finds that dogs can be trained to detect more than 90 per cent of Covid-19 infections even when patients are asymptomatic. Researchers from the London School of Tropical Medicine say they hope such dogs could eventually replace the need for travellers to quarantine -- which necessarily disrupts every arrival even though the vast majority are not Covid positive. China offers vaccines, medical experts to TaiwanThe Chinese government on Monday offered to urgently send Covid-19 vaccines and medical experts to Taiwan to help it battle a sharp rise in coronavirus infections but drew a swift and angry response from Taipei.  China and Chinese-claimed Taiwan have sparred repeatedly during the pandemic. Taipei has accused Beijing of spreading fake news and trying to limit its access to the World Health Organization (WHO), while Beijing says Taipei is trying to politicise the pandemic for political gain. After months of relative safety from the pandemic, Taiwan is dealing with a spike in Covid-19 cases and is rapidly running out of vaccines, having only received slightly more than 700,000 to date for its more than 23 million people. Courtroom showdown: EU takes on AstraZeneca in vaccine rowAt loggerheads for months with the Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical company it accuses of failing to deliver the promised number of Covid-19 vaccine doses, the European Union's executive branch will try to persuade a Brussels court Wednesday that the case is urgent enough to justify ordering the company to make immediate delivery of the missing shots. AstraZeneca's contract signed with the Commission on behalf of EU member states foresaw an initial 300 million doses for distribution among all 27 countries, with an option for a further 100 million. The doses were expected to be delivered throughout 2021. But only 30 million were sent during the first quarter. Deliveries have increased slightly since then but, according to the Commission, the company is set to provide only 70 million doses in the second quarter. It had promised 180 million. While the EU insists AstraZeneca has breached its contractual obligations, the company says it has fully complied with the agreement, arguing that vaccines are difficult to manufacture and it made its best effort to deliver on time.

---||World||Joe Biden doubling spending to prepare for hurricanes, storms||WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden announced Monday that he's doubling US emergency spending to help communities prepare for hurricanes and other extreme weather events, while launching a new effort at NASA to better understand and track the impact of climate change.  The $1 billion in spending is a small fraction of what the US spends on weather-related disasters. Last year alone, the nation endured 22 weather and climate-related disasters with losses greater than $1 billion each. The disasters, including wildfires, hurricanes and snowstorms, had a cumulative price tag of nearly $100 billion.  2021 has already had significant winter storms that caused a deadly blackout in Texas and other states and underscore the damage caused by climate change.  "We all know that the storms are coming, and we're going to be prepared," Biden said during a visit to the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Washington headquarters. "We have to be ready."  Forecasters predict the Atlantic hurricane season will be busier than normal, but is unlikely to be as severe as 2020's record-shattering year.  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said last week that the hurricane season, which runs from June through November, will likely see 13 to 20 named storms, including at least six that will become hurricanes and three to five categorized as major hurricanes with winds of more than 110 mph (177 kilometers per hour).  Biden, during his visit to FEMA, received a briefing on this year's outlook for the Atlantic hurricane season.  As climate change threatens to bring more extreme events such as increased floods, sea level rise and intensifying droughts and wildfires, the White House said it is the government's responsibility to better prepare and support communities before disasters occur, rather than simply respond afterward.  FEMA will provide $1 billion for the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, which helps states, local communities, tribes and territories to develop projects to prepare for and reduce risks from disasters and natural hazards.  "We're going to spare no expense, no effort, to keep Americans safe and respond to crises when they arise," Biden said. "And they certainly will."  Officials pledged to increase investment in climate research to improve understanding of extreme weather events and hone decision-making on climate resilience, adaptation and mitigation. The new funding should help ensure that communities have the resources they need to build resilience before these crises, the White House said.  The steps announced Monday are part of Biden's pledge to elevate the importance of climate change as a major priority. Biden has set a target to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by up to 52% below 2005 levels by 2030. He also has said he expects to adopt a clean energy standard that would make electricity carbon-free by 2035, along with the wider goal of net-zero carbon emissions economywide by 2050.  Just last week, Biden directed federal agencies to develop a comprehensive strategy to identify and manage financial risks to government and the private sector posed by climate change. An executive order he issued Thursday calls for concrete steps to mitigate climate risks and could result in new regulations on the banking, housing and agriculture sectors, among others.  "Extreme weather related to climate change can disrupt entire supply chains and deprive communities of food, water or emergency supplies,″ the White House said. Snowstorms can knock power grids offline, while floods made worse by rising sea levels can destroy homes and businesses.  The executive order directs White House climate adviser Gina McCarthy and economic adviser Brian Deese to develop a governmentwide strategy within four months to identify and disclose climate-related financial risks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/joe-biden-doubling-spending-to-prepare-for-hurricanes-storms/articleshow/82921747.cms||---

Twitter's global deputy general counsel and VP (legal), Jim Baker – who is also a former FBI official -- has been roped in to take stock of the situation. Sources said the US government may also be approached by the company as the situation has rapidly escalated after Twitter tagged some tweets by BJP functionaries as ‘manipulated media’ . “The only good part is that the local offices in India had been shut due to the Covid situation. The global HQ has stepped into the matter and is closely coordinating with the India team,” top Twitter sources told TOI. While the company is yet to issue any official statement on the issue, sources said there was a situation of “near panic” after the Delhi Police's Special Cell served a notice to Twitter India, with two teams reaching its offices in Delhi and Gurgaon. The company’s global headquarters was immediately informed of the development, even though it was pre-dawn in the US at the time of Delhi Police’s action. Monday's visits followed the serving of a notice to Manish Maheshwari, who Delhi Police addressed in its notice as the "MD, Twitter India". "Whereas it has come to our notice that you were acquainted with the facts of the matter and are in possession of information with regard to the same. You are therefore requested to be present in the office of the special cell with relevant documents," the notice read. A police source said Maheshwari did not appear before the police on May 22, stating that he was not the authorised or the right representative for the company. "The Delhi police team went to Twitter office to serve a notice to Twitter, as a part of routine process. This was necessitated as we wanted to ascertain who is the right person to serve a notice, as replies by Twitter India MD have been very ambiguous," the Delhi Police said in a statement. This led to police teams landing at the office addresses purportedly belonging to Twitter in New Delhi. Delhi Police denied that any searches were conducted. "We are enquiring into a complaint in which clarification is sought from the Twitter regarding the classification of a tweet by Shri Sambit Patra as 'manipulative'. It appears that Twitter has some information which is not known to us on the basis of which they have classified it as such. This information is relevant to the enquiry. Special Cell which is conducting the enquiry wants to find out the truth. Twitter which has claimed to know the underlying truth should clarify," police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal said. Last week, BJP national spokesman Sambit Patra had released a set of pages alleged to be a Congress 'toolkit' to discredit the government's handling of the Covid situation. Congress had responded that the toolkit was a forgery and filed a complaint. Delhi Police's special cell had initiated an investigation following the complaint by Rohan Gupta and Rajiv Gowda of the Congress Party's social media and research cells, a police official said. Meanwhile, Twitter’s global officials are believed to be increasingly concerned over the India situation following the series of regulatory challenges over demands to take down content that is seemingly critical of the official machinery. In February earlier this year, government sources had even objected to Twitter founder Jack Dorsey’s decision to ‘like’ some of the tweets that had been made in support of the farmers protests, saying it “raised questions over the neutrality of the platform.” Baker, it is believed, will lead the next steps on the matter as he was also instrumental in dealing with the previous faceoff when the government had threatened to arrest Twitter officials and impose a financial penalty over its reluctance to take down over 1,400 accounts that were accused of carrying “inflammatory content” regarding the farm laws. After efforts by Twitter’s India team did not reap much results, the company had deputed Baker to carry out discussions with the Indian government. The matter was finally sorted out after his coming into the picture, and Twitter ended up in disabling nearly 97% of the users flagged by the Indian government.

Police are claiming to have found more evidence of Kumar's links with Bawana as one of the vehicles, a Scorpio SUV, which was seized from the spot where wrestler Sagar Dhankad was murdered, has been found linked to a Bawana henchman, Mohit. It has also emerged, according to police sources, that many people accompanying Kumar on the night of the murder were Bawana’s henchmen. At least seven more suspects are at large. Raids are being conducted to nab them. The sources said on Monday that Kumar’s footprints had also surfaced in an extortion case reported from the Model Town area a few weeks ago. Fugitive gangster Sandeep alias Kala Jathedi had demanded Rs 1 crore as protection money from a cable businessman. The call was made from an international number. However, investigations have suggested that Kumar was allegedly behind this demand.  Jathedi was aiming to take complete control of toll tax booths in Delhi, UP and Haryana and wanted Kumar's help in achieving this.  However, the two parted ways two months ago. The extortion incident took place before Jathedi and Kumar fell out over their share in the Model Town property. Soon after, Kumar, as TOI first reported on Monday, allegedly joined hands with jailed gangster Neeraj Bawana and Naveen Bali. The police are now gearing up to question the duo. Kumar, police said, was not only running away from them for over two weeks but also from Kala Jathedi, one of the most wanted gangsters of north India, who is currently believed to be in Dubai. On the night of May 4-5, Kumar had assaulted not only wrestler Sagar Dhankar but also another man, Sonu, a notorious criminal with 19 cases of murder, extortion and robbery. Jathedi, cops say, had been indulging in large-scale grabbing of disputed properties in Delhi through Sonu and others. Kumar allegedly joined hands with Jathedi a while ago and landed a property in M2 block of northwest Delhi's Model Town.  This is the flat at the centre of the entire controversy. This flat was being used to shelter criminals belonging to the Jathedi-Lawrence Bishnoi gang and many crime plots were hatched there, said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cops-probing-sushil-kumars-links-with-gangster-neeraj-bawana/articleshow/82923355.cms||Raj Sekhar

Deaths from Covid-19 fell 5% to 3,969 in the week ended May 23, the fewest deaths in a week since March 2020.  About 39% of the country's population has been fully vaccinated as of Sunday, and 49% has received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Vermont leads the country with 69% of its residents receiving at least one dose, followed by Massachusetts at 65%.  The rate of vaccinations, however, has been slowing for five straight weeks. In the past seven days, an average of 1.8 million vaccine doses were administered per day, down from a peak of 3.1 million shots per day in April.  Nationally, new cases have fallen for six weeks in a row and hit their lowest level since the week ended June 14, 2020.  Nine out of 50 states logged week-over-week increases in new cases, including Hawaii, which reported a backlog of probable cases, and Delaware, which processed a backlog of tests.  Excluding those backlogs, Michigan led the nation in new cases per capita, although new infections have fallen for five weeks in that state. The next highest rate was in Wyoming, where cases rose by 27% or an increase of 125 cases from the previous week.  The lowest rates of infection based on population were in California, Oklahoma and Nebraska.  Nationwide, the average number of Covid-19 patients in hospitals fell 14%, the fifth weekly drop in a row and the lowest weekly number since April 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-reports-lowest-number-of-new-covid-19-cases-in-nearly-a-year/articleshow/82923395.cms||---
---||World||Florida law seeks to rein in large social media companies||TALLAHASSEE: Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill on Monday that seeks to punish social media platforms that remove "conservative ideas" from their sites, though it is not clear if it would pass constitutional muster because it might violate the First Amendment.  The new law will enable the state to fine large social media companies $250,000 a day if they remove an account of a statewide political candidate, and $25,000 a day if they remove an account of someone running for a local office. It takes effect July 1.  "Some of these massive, massive companies in Silicon Valley are exerting a power over our population that really has no precedent in American history," DeSantis said during a bill-signing ceremony at Florida International University in Miami. "One of their major missions seems to be suppressing ideas."  But it's questionable whether Florida will be able to enforce it. Federal law prevents internet companies from being sued for removing posts and federal law trumps state law when there is a conflict.  Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act exempts websites from being sued for removing content deemed to be "obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable" as long as the companies are acting in "good faith."  DeSantis said big tech companies are controlling accounts to remove content that doesn't suit their ideology. Republicans have accused companies like Twitter and Facebook of censoring conservative thought. DeSantis pointed in particular to then-President Donald Trump being banned by Twitter while still allowing Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to maintain an account.  "When you de-platform the president of the United States but you let Ayatollah Khamenei talk about killing Jews, that is wrong," DeSantis said to thunderous applause.  Twitter didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Facebook declined to comment.  The law will give Florida's attorney general authority to sue companies under the state's Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act. It will also allow individual Floridians to sue social media companies for up to $100,000 if they feel they've been treated unfairly.  The bill targets social media platforms that have more than 100 million monthly users, which include online giants as Twitter and Facebook. But lawmakers carved out an exception for Disney and their apps by including that theme park owners wouldn't be subject to the law.  The law will require large social media companies to publish standards on how it decides to "censor, deplatform, and shadow ban."  Regardless of the federal law, the new Florida law is constitutionally flawed, said Computer and Communications Industry Association President Matt Schruers.  "Gov. DeSantis says that this bill is about protecting free expression, but an internet service saying, 'We don't want to host Nazis and people encouraging self-harm' is exercising its own First Amendment rights and that is one of the critical infirmities of this bill," Schruers said.  Democrats opposed the bill and defended the right of social media companies, as private entities, to control the flow of information on their platforms. Democratic Sen. Audrey Gibson said in a press release that the bill was passed in an effort to placate Trump.  "These enterprises take responsibility for what appears on their platforms and have the right to do so," Gibson said. "Vulgarity and inciting violence are not their business model and our legislature should appreciate rather than legislate against such a concept."  While similar bills have been filed in other states, DeSantis is the first governor to sign one into law.  ___  AP Technology Writer Barbara Ortutay contributed to this report.  ___  This story corrects the name of the Computer and Communications Industry Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/florida-law-seeks-to-rein-in-large-social-media-companies/articleshow/82923662.cms||---

A brief video clip of journalist Raman Pratasevich, who ran a popular messaging app that played a key role in helping organize massive protests against authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko, was shown on Belarusian state television Monday night, a day after he was removed from the Ryanair flight. Sitting at a table with his hands folded in front of him and speaking rapidly, Pratasevich said he was in satisfactory health and said his treatment in custody was ``maximally correct and according to law.'' He added that he was giving evidence to investigators about organizing mass disturbances. Ryanair said Belarusian flight controllers told the crew there was a bomb threat against the plane as it was crossing through Belarus airspace on Sunday and ordered it to land. A Belarusian MiG-29 fighter jet was scrambled to escort the plane in a brazen show of force by Lukashenko, who has ruled the country with an iron fist for over a quarter-century. Belarus authorities then arrested the 26-year-old activist, journalist and prominent Lukashenko critic. Pratasevich and his Russian girlfriend were taken off the plane shortly after it landed, and authorities haven't said where they're being held. Ryanair Flight FR4978, which began in Athens, Greece, was eventually allowed to continue on to Vilnius, Lithuania. U.S. President Joe Biden was briefed on the incident and National Security adviser Jake Sullivan raised the issue in his call with the secretary of the Russian Security Council, said White House press secretary Jen Psaki. She added the administration condemned what she called the ``shocking act'' of diverting a flight to detain a journalist. "It constitutes a brazen affront to international peace and security by the regime. We demand an immediate international, transparent and credible investigation of this incident,'' she said, adding the U.S. was in touch with NATO, the EU, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, among others about next steps. EU leaders were particularly forceful in their condemnation of the arrest and the move against the plane, which was flying between two of the bloc's member nations and was being operated by an airline based in Ireland, also a member. The bloc summoned Belarus' ambassador ``to condemn the inadmissible step of the Belarusian authorities'' and said in a statement the arrest was yet again ``another blatant attempt to silence all opposition voices in the country. "President Gitanas Nauseda of Lithuania urged the EU to take ``clear actions in order to change the pattern of behavior of this very dangerous regime,'' and said a previously planned EU summit on Monday would assess whether to close its airspace to Belarus carriers, declare Belarusian airspace as unsafe and expand sanctions against Lukashenko's government. German Chancellor Angela Merkel condemned the ``unprecedented action`` of the Belarusian authorities and demanded that Pratasevich and his girlfriend, Sofia Sapega, be released immediately. Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said ``the scandalous incident in Belarus shows signs of state terrorism and it's unbelievable,`` while EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said it amounted to a ``hijacking.'' EU leaders have tried to bring Belarus closer to the bloc _ to encourage democratic reforms and reduce the influence of Russia _ but have failed so far. Ahead of their summit, some EU leaders threatened more sanctions _ from scrapping landing rights in the bloc for Belarus' national carrier Belavia to exclusions from sports events. Without waiting for the EU, Latvia's airBaltic said it would avoid Belarusian airspace, and Lithuania's government said it would instruct all flights to and from the Baltic country to avoid Belarus as well starting Tuesday. British Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he instructed the U.K. Civil Aviation Authority ``to request airlines avoid Belarusian airspace in order to keep passengers safe.'' He added he was suspending the permit allowing Belavia to operate in the U.K.Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy ordered officials to move to cut the air link with Belarus and ban Ukrainian flights via the neighbor's airspace. The U.S. and the EU have imposed sanctions on top Belarusian officials amid months of protests, which were triggered by Lukashenko's reelection to a sixth term in an August 2020 vote that the opposition rejected as rigged. More than 34,000 people have been arrested in Belarus since then, and thousands beaten. The Belarusian Foreign Ministry bristled at what it described as ``belligerent'' EU statements, insisting Minsk acted "in full conformity with international rules." It ordered all Latvian diplomats out of the country after the Belarusian flag was replaced Monday with the white-and-red one used by the opposition at the world ice hockey championship in Riga, Latvia. The event was moved from Minsk amid the international outcry over the crackdown. Lufthansa said a flight from Minsk to Frankfurt with 51 people aboard was delayed Monday following a ``security warning.'' It was allowed to depart after the plane, passengers and cargo were searched. On Sunday, flight tracker sites indicated the Ryanair flight was about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the Lithuanian border when it was diverted. There were conflicting reports on what exactly happened. Belarusian transport ministry official Artem Sikorsky said the Minsk airport had received an email about the bomb threat from the Palestinian militant group Hamas. Lukashenko's press service said he had ordered a fighter jet to accompany the plane after being told of the bomb threat. Deputy air force commander Andrei Gurtsevich told Belarusian state TV that the Ryanair crew decided to land in Minsk, adding that the fighter jet was sent ``to ensure a safe landing.``But Ryanair said in a statement that Belarusian air traffic control instructed the plane to divert to the capital. The plane was searched, and no bomb was found.Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary described the move as ``a case of state-sponsored hijacking . state-sponsored piracy.'' In an apparent reference to the Belarusian security agency that still goes under its Soviet-era name KGB, O'Leary he told the Irish radio station Newstalk that he believes ``some KGB agents offloaded from the aircraft'' in Minsk.Of the 126 people aboard the flight initially, only 121 made it to Vilnius, according to Rolandas Kiskis, chief of criminal police bureau in the Lithuanian capital where an investigation investigation has begun. Passengers described Pratasevich's shock when he realized the plane was going to Minsk.`I saw this Belarusian guy with girlfriend sitting right behind us. He freaked out when the pilot said the plane is diverted to Minsk. He said there's death penalty awaiting him there,'' passenger Marius Rutkauskas said after the plane finally arrived in Vilnius. ``We sat for an hour after the landing. Then they started releasing passengers and took those two. We did not see them again.''Pratasevich was a co-founder of the Telegram messaging app's Nexta channel, which played a prominent role in helping organize the anti-Lukashenko protests. Nearly 2 million Belarusians in the nation of 9.3 million people have followed the channel, which has been the main conduit for organizing demonstrations and offered advice on how to dodge police cordons. It also has run photos, video and other materials documenting the brutal police crackdown on the protests.Belarus authorities have labeled the channel ``extremist'' and charged Pratasevich in absentia of inciting mass riots and fanning social hatred. He could face 15 years in prison if convicted. In November, the Belarusian KGB also put Pratasevich on the list of people suspected of involvement in terrorism, an ominous sign that he could face even graver charges. Terrorism is punishable by death in Belarus, the only country in Europe that maintains capital punishment.Amid the international outrage, Moscow quickly offered a helping hand to its ally.

The new approach had put Shopian ahead of other districts when the drive was launched in March and sets a template for the country. The ‘apple district’ maintained the lead till two days ago when Jammu pipped it. But still, it is no mean feat in a district in the Valley that has emerged as the hub of new-age militancy and is surrounded by Pulwama, Kulgam and Anantnag. “The entire administration worked with the health department. Auqaf committees (mosque administrators) were roped in to motivate people. BLOs, Anganwadi workers were deployed for a house-to-house survey to ascertain the number of 45-plus in each household and assist those who were yet to be vaccinated. SDMs and tehsildars etc. were tasked with monitoring progress to the village level,” Zainpora SDM Mushtaq Ahmad Lone told TOI. He said the vaccination could progress apace because there was no shortage of doses for the target group, “thanks to LG (Lt. Governor Manoj Sinha)”. “The DM was involved 24x7. If a village showed signs of decline in the vaccination rate, our focus would be concentrated there the next day,” Lone said. District magistrate Sachin Kumar Vaishya did not respond to calls and text messages from TOI. Officials said 78,769 in the target age group have been administered the first dose. The health department set up over 70 vaccination centres, each with a capacity of vaccinating 100-150 people. Officials reckon the Shopian population is approaching three lakh against 2.6 lakh in the 2011 census. Lone also gave credit to social influencers and police for the success. “The administration put its entire weight behind the health department. But it would not have been possible without support from society and its leaders. Police also played a very constructive role. They never denied us help,” Lone said. Asked how felt about his role in the success of the drive, he said: “Naturally, I feel happy. Ghar ka ladka ghar ke logon ke liye ek achche kaam mein kirdar nibha paya. (As a local, I am happy I could play a role in doing larger good for the people).” Other officials said the administration chose to go by headcount for vaccination since many Shopian residents reside elsewhere, such as Srinagar, Jammu or even outside the UT where they have a second house. “Some may have registered here but taken the jab in, say, Srinagar. So Shopian may show empty slots because the jab is registered in Srinagar’s quota,” one official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/shopian-breaks-taboo-gets-all-45-vaccinated/articleshow/82923454.cms||Sanjay Dutta

One of the shortlisted candidates is likely to become the CBI director, a post that has been lying vacant for over four months. At the meeting, the CJI is learnt to have suggested that three names could be picked from the senior most in the panel and the PM said, “We will go as per the rule.” Chowdhury is learnt to have submitted a note of dissent, alleging violation of laid down procedures. He didn’t object to the names though. On May 11, Chowdhury received a list of 109 IPS officers across four batches from which the committee was to select one, according to sources. However, around 1pm, the government, through the department of personnel and training, sent a list of 10 names. Four hours later, six more names were added to the list. Chowdhury is learnt to have raised objection to the manner in which the list of names was trimmed, saying the DoPT had no role in the shortlisting. He is learnt to have urged the panel to reschedule the discussion, sources said, adding Chowdhury said only officers with at least six months of service left should be picked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/panel-to-select-cbi-chief-zeroes-in-on-3-names/articleshow/82923964.cms||---
---||World||Bad reputation: British Museum takes new look at Rome's Nero||LONDON: The British Museum's new exhibition on the Roman Emperor Nero opens with a piece of fake news from the ancient world.  Visitors are greeted with an image of Peter Ustinov as Nero in the movie "Quo Vadis" strumming a lyre - a famous image of the cruel tyrant who notoriously fiddled while Rome burned.  But, the exhibition says, that tale is a myth. As such, it's a fitting introduction to an emperor whose story was largely written by enemies after his death, creating what curator Francesca Bologna calls "the Nero we love to hate."  "Our goal here is to show that this, however popular, image is actually based on very, very biased accounts and therefore we should challenge it," she said during a preview of the exhibition Monday.  "The Nero story is about how we should approach information, how we should always approach our sources critically. This is relevant for Nero, it's relevant for historians, archaeologists, it is relevant for everyday people living their everyday lives."  "Nero: The Man Behind the Myth" opens to the public on Thursday, six months later than originally planned as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The show, which runs until Oct. 24, arrives the week after UK lockdown restrictions were lifted and London's museums were allowed to reopen at limited capacity.  The exhibition draws on the British Museum's vast trove of Roman artifacts, as well as items from collections in Italy, France, Germany and other countries, loaned despite pandemic-related restrictions.  "Everyone throughout Europe and the UK came to our rescue," Bologna said. "They were really understanding. They helped us throughout the process. Even colleagues that were in lockdown themselves and working from home, they were incredible."  Through more than 200 artifacts including statues, helmets, weapons, jewelry and ancient graffiti, it depicts a young ruler with rock-solid imperial lineage; Nero was the great-great-grandson of Rome's first emperor, Augustus. In AD 54, at the age of 16, he became emperor of a Rome that was unrivalled in power but beset by problems, including war with the Iran-based Parthian empire in the east and an uprising led by Celtic queen Boudica in newly conquered Britain to the west.  One vivid section deals with the harsh reality of life in Roman Britain: there are lead ingots mined in Wales, along with thick chains that bound slaves who did the hard work. There's also a bronze head of Nero, found in an English river after his statue was toppled during the uprising, and a family's hoard of coins and jewelry, hidden for safekeeping during the violence and discovered in 2014 under the floor of a store in the east England town of Colchester.  Evidence suggests Nero was popular during his reign. He oversaw grand public projects, strengthening links between the city and its harbor to secure the food supply, building a public market and a spectacular set of public baths. He sponsored lavish public entertainments with gladiators, lion-wrestling and chariot races. He even competed in the races at Rome's Circus Maximus, and was the first emperor to perform onstage.  The youthful emperor was also a style leader, popularizing a boyband-style haircut that the exhibition calls "dashing yet refined."  He didn't start the fire that leveled parts of Rome in AD 64, and neither did he fiddle as it burned. He wasn't even there at the time.  Afterwards, Nero rebuilt the city, brought in tougher building codes -- and also built himself a lavish palace, the Domus Aurea, or Golden House. Little of it remains, but the exhibition gives a taste of its opulence.  Beset by conspirators, Nero killed himself at the age of 30. His death sparked a period of civil war and then a new ruling dynasty. Like politicians down the ages, the new rulers blamed Rome's problems on their predecessor.  Almost 2,000 years later, Nero remains a metaphor for bad government. As classicist Mary Beard wrote recently in the Daily Telegraph, "there is hardly a political cartoonist who doesn't occasionally dress up a modern leader with a toga, laurel wreath and lyre, against the background of smoking ruins, to make the point that he is not taking some contemporary crisis seriously."  Nero's rule was undeniably brutal: He had his mother killed, along with one and possibly two of his wives. But was he more violent than other Roman rulers?  "Not really," Bologna said. "Each and every emperor had people condemned and put to death. Even Augustus, who is the epitome of the good emperor, came to power in a really bloody way."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/bad-reputation-british-museum-takes-new-look-at-romes-nero/articleshow/82924270.cms||---
---||India||Northeast may be next Covid hotspot||NEW DELHI: The north-east could be poised to become the next target of the ongoing second wave of Covid, according to a forecasting tool based on data till May 21. Development Data Lab, a research organisation working on open data, and a team led by University of Chicago’s Prof Anup Malani calculates the reproductive rate (Rt) for the Covid-19 outbreak each day. This is a measure of how many people an infected person is likely to infect in a community. The calculations show that the Rt value is greater than 1 for all northeastern states. An Rt of 1.36, the latest value for Tripura, means 100 cases could increase to over 5,000 in two weeks while an Rt of 0.89 (the value for Karnataka) could reduce 100 cases to 22 in the same period. Of course, if the values change in the interim the scenarios would too. The data shows that there are 15 states and UTs where this value was more than 1 on May 21. At 1.36, the value is the highest for Tripura followed by Meghalaya at 1.31 and Arunachal Pradesh at 1.26. Apart from the eight northeastern states, Lakshadweep and Tamil Nadu are also present in the list of ten states or UTs with the highest Rt values. Other states and UTs that have a higher than 1 value for this indicator are Odisha, Puducherry, Andhra Pradesh, Ladakh and West Bengal, where the Rt ranged between 1,.02 to 1.06. For the remaining 18 states and UTs for which the forecast is available, Rt was less than 1, indicating a declining future course of fresh cases. The list of states with calculated Rt values less than 1 includes Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Gujarat, all of which have been recent epicentres of the ongoing outbreak. A district-wise analysis of the data further buttresses the overall forecast. Of the 579 districts for which data was available as of May 21, the Rt value was greater than 1.3 for 25, of which 19 are in the country’s northeast. At 1.6, Upper Subansiri district of Arunachal Pradesh had the highest Rt value. The value was 1.5 or above for Champhai in Mizoram, and Khowai and Sepahijala in Tripura. The six districts outside the northeast with Rt values higher than 1.3 were Chitradurga in Karnataka, Osmanabad in Maharashtra, Boudh in Odisha and Perambalur, Ariyalur and Tirupathur in Tamil Nadu. Although daily cases are still at low levels in these districts, experience from the states that faced the earlier burnt of this outbreak suggests that a higher infection rate than the previous outbreak means cases can rise very fast and overwhelm the healthcare infrastructure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/northeast-may-be-next-covid-hotspot/articleshow/82924218.cms||Atul Thakur
---||World||Whitmer administration rescinds rule she ignored at bar||LANSING: Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's administration on Monday rescinded a rule that limits restaurant tables to no more than six people, a day after she apologized for ignoring the Covid-19 regulation while gathering with friends at an East Lansing bar.  The Democratic governor has said tables at the Landshark Bar & Grill were pushed together as more people arrived in her party of roughly a dozen fully vaccinated people.  A revised gatherings and face mask order, issued by the state health department, no longer includes the six-patrons-per-table provision, effective June 1. Whitmer had announced last week the planned easing of capacity restrictions on June 1 but had not specified if other changes would be coming in the new order, which was released as expected Monday.  The governor also signed a revised workplace safety order that immediately no longer requires 6 feet (2 meters) of separation between tables.  "It was an honest mistake. I have apologized for it," Whitmer told reporters.  Violations of coronavirus orders are enforced against employers, not customers. State regulators have fined more than 280 employers.  Asked if the Landshark should be fined and, if not, if she would lift fines on other businesses, the governor said the Michigan Occupational Safety and Health Administration has "specifically not gone forward and penalized businesses that are trying to do the right thing. It's those that have flouted and put people's safety at risk that are the most concerning."  Later Monday, the Ingham County Health Department reported having received a complaint about a party at the Landshark exceeding six guests, but said it decided against enforcement action because "non-critical restaurant complaints are initially treated as education/consultation for the owner/manager."  "The matter is considered resolved given conversation with the owner, and the owner's assurance that parties will be limited to no more than six guests in the future," spokeswoman Amanda Darche said. "There is no history of similar complaints with the Landshark."  Republicans in the GOP-led Legislature said Whitmer should rescind fines that were levied on businesses. They previously complained that the six-person limit keeps large families from eating together.  Whitmer also has come under criticism for waiting to release information about a flight to see her elderly father in Florida, which occurred weeks before two top aides traveled south for spring break as Covid-19 cases soared.  In May 2020, Whitmer acknowledged that her husband dropped her name in an effort to get his boat in the water for Memorial Day weekend but said it simply was a "failed attempt at humor."  "Michiganders deserve more than a hollow apology after a year of 'rules for thee but not for me' from their governor," Tori Sachs, executive director of the conservative Michigan Freedom Fund, said in a statement. "We are calling on Whitmer to end her orders today, pardon every individual accused of a similar offense, rescind every violation issued by state and local officials, and refund every fine the state's collected."  Last week, Whitmer announced that capacity and crowd restrictions will be lifted July 1, citing vaccinations and new federal guidance on masks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/whitmer-administration-rescinds-rule-she-ignored-at-bar/articleshow/82924879.cms||---
---||World||Chicago priest Michael Pfleger reinstated after abuse investigation||CHICAGO: Nationally known activist Chicago priest the Rev. Michael Pfleger will be reinstated as the leader of his parish after an investigation found "no reason to suspect" he sexually abused children, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago announced Monday.  The archdiocese said in January that leaders asked Pfleger to step aside after its Office for Child Abuse Investigations and Review received an allegation that Pfleger sexually abused a minor more than 40 years ago.  In a letter to the Faith Community of Saint Sabina, Cardinal Blase Cupich said he had accepted the finding of the office and the archdiocese's Independent Review Board and was reinstating Pfleger as the South Side parish's pastor.  Cupich said the change is effective the first weekend of June.  "I have asked Father Pfleger to take the next two weeks to prepare himself spiritually and emotionally to return, realizing that these months have taken a great toll on him," Cupich said. "He has agreed to do so."  Two brothers, now in their 60s, alleged in January that Pfleger groomed them as children and abused them at rectories in the Chicago area. They accused the priest of taking advantage of two Black boys who trusted him.  A third man later accused Pfleger of grabbing his crotch over his clothes in 1979. The 59-year-old man said he was 18 at the time and pretended to sleep.  Leaders and parishioners at St. Sabina, a Black church in the city's largely Black and low-income Auburn Gresham neighborhood, fiercely supported Pfleger, who is white, after the allegations. Upset by the removal of their pastor, they tied up the archdiocese's phone lines, held rallies, sent letters and threatened to withhold $100,000 in monthly dues.  Pfleger, who moved out of the church rectory, maintained his innocence. His attorney, Jim Figliulo, said Monday that he was elated his client was cleared.  "This is as strong as a conclusion of his innocence as this process permits," Figliulo said. "He has said he is innocent. He is innocent."  Eugene Hollander, an attorney for the three accusers, said his clients were disheartened with the news and were considering whether to file a lawsuit.  "You had not one, not two, but three victims of alleged molestation," he said. "They are of course very, very disappointed with the findings."  While the third man, who lives outside Illinois, had been reluctant to tell his story, the brothers felt compelled to speak up, Hollander said.  "For them to move forward and complete themselves, make themselves whole, they had to tell their stories," he said.  Pfleger was ordained in 1975 and was assigned to St. Sabina Church that year. Pfleger became pastor six years later and has been credited with reviving the parish.  Nationally, the priest dubbed "Father Mike" by parishioners is known for his dramatic approach to activism aimed at chronic problems in the city, including defacement of alcohol and cigarette billboards and paying prostitutes to accept counseling.  Pfleger inspired director Spike Lee, who based the character played by actor John Cusack in the 2015 movie "Chi-Raq" on him.  ___  Associated Press reporter Sophia Tareen contributed to this story.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/chicago-priest-michael-pfleger-reinstated-after-abuse-investigation/articleshow/82925186.cms||---
---||World||Georgia park with giant Confederate carving approves changes||STONE MOUNTAIN: The board overseeing a mountain park near Atlanta with a giant carving of Confederate leaders voted Monday to relocate Confederate flags from a busy walking trail and create a museum exhibit that acknowledges the site's connection to the Ku Klux Klan.  The moves were part of an effort by the Stone Mountain Memorial Association to address criticism of the park's Confederate legacy and shore up its finances. The chairman of the association's board promised more changes.  "We've just taken our first step today to where we need to go," the Rev. Abraham Mosley said at a news conference after the vote. Mosley, appointed by Gov. Brian Kemp last month, is the board's first African American chairman.  The board did not address the carving at Monday's meeting, but Mosley did not rule out changes to it in the future. Critics have called on the board to remove the colossal sculpture of Gen. Robert E. Lee, Confederate President Jefferson Davis and Gen. Thomas J. "Stonewall" Jackson from the mountain's northern face. Completed in 1972, it measures 190 feet (58 meters) across and 90 feet (27 meters) tall. It is the largest Confederate monument ever crafted and has special protection enshrined in Georgia law.  The changes approved Monday come amid a national reckoning on race that brought down dozens of Confederate monuments last year. Many of the Confederate monuments that are now controversial were erected in the early 1900s by groups composed of women and veterans. Some honor generals or soldiers; others bear inscriptions that critics say wrongly gloss over slavery as a reason for the Civil War or portray the Confederate cause as noble.  Work on the Stone Mountain sculpture languished until the state bought the mountain and surrounding land in 1958 for a public park. Finishing the monument gained renewed urgency amid resistance from Georgia and other Southern states to the civil rights movement and efforts to end segregation.  Today, the park 15 miles (25 kilometers) northeast of downtown Atlanta markets itself as a family theme park rather than a monument to the Confederacy. It attracts large numbers of tourists and other visitors interested in hiking to the top of the mountain or walking the grounds. Still, it is replete with Confederate imagery.  Former DeKalb County NAACP President John Evans told the Stone Mountain board before the vote that they needed to do more.  "We need to take down the flags. We need to change all the street names and do what we said we were going to do: eliminate the Confederacy from Stone Mountain Park," he said.  A member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans who spoke at Monday's meeting said maintaining the carving at Stone Mountain is not racist but a way to honor the soldiers who fought for the Confederacy. Eric Cleveland said he did not have a big problem with the changes the board approved, calling them a "compromise," but he said they would embolden critics.  "These people will not stop until our history is completely erased," he said.  The museum exhibit approved by the board will relate the history of the carving, including its roots in efforts to maintain segregation, said Bill Stephens, Stone Mountain Memorial Association's CEO. It will also reflect the site's role in the rebirth of the Ku Klux Klan. The group marked its comeback with a cross burning atop the mountain on Thanksgiving night 1915.  The board also voted to change the park's logo, which currently features the Confederate carving, and seek federal recognition of a bridge built by a prominent African American.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/georgia-park-with-giant-confederate-carving-approves-changes/articleshow/82925585.cms||---

Pakistan's reluctance to issue assignment visas to Indian diplomats and other staff members despite repeated requests by India is said to have led to the recall. Islamabad has not issued visas for the past 2 years to Indian officials, except on a few occasions, it's again learnt. Pakistan had approved the appointment of Indian charge d'affaires Suresh Kumar last year but only after it denied visa to Jayant Khobragade, India's original pick for the job. Islamabad had rejected Khobragade's appointment saying he was too senior to head the mission when ties had been downgraded. Read AlsoPakistan would not hold talks with India until New Delhi reverses its decision on Kashmir: ImranISLAMABAD: Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Tuesday that his country would not hold talks with India until New Delhi reverses its decision of scrapping the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. India abrogated the special status of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 on August 5, 2019 andWhile assignment visas are based on reciprocity and can take time, the recent and protracted delay in approval despite several reminders to Islamabad has clearly not been to India's liking. Indian officials scheduled to return to India were apparently finding it difficult to wait indefinitely in the absence of visas to their proposed replacements. The recall is likely to further restrict the day-to-day functioning of the Indian high commission with the 2 countries having already cut by half the strength of their respective missions following India's decision to downgrade ties last year. After India revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir in August, 2019, Pakistan had also recalled its high commissioner, forcing India to do the same. Read AlsoPak FM Qureshi says willing to talk if India revisits its Aug 5, 2019 decisions on J&amp;KPakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi on Sunday said that Pakistan would be happy to talk out differences and resolve outstanding issues through dialogue if India was willing to revisit the unilateral decisions it took on Aug 5, 2019, regarding the status of Jammu and Kashmir.The delay in issuing assignment visas also may not seem in consonance with the sentiment expressed by Pakistan in the past few months that it was time to forget the past and move ahead to unlock the economic potential of the region by working together. After he was quoted as saying recently that the abrogation of Article 370 was India's internal matter, Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi had denied saying any such thing. Pakistan though has maintained it will oppose any demographic change in Jammu and Kashmir. The 2 countries had surprised many in February as they agreed in a joint statement to "strict observance of all agreements, understandings and cease firing along the Line of Control and all other sectors". While India too has toned down the rhetoric on terrorism, the understanding on ceasefire has so far not lead to any substantive engagement between the 2 countries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pakistan-reluctant-to-issue-visas-india-recalls-a-few-officials/articleshow/82925704.cms||Sachin Parashar

The company has been under tremendous pressure from the government, fairplay regulator Competition Commission and the courts over its new privacy update which it implemented from May 15. WhatsApp now says that if a user does not want to update to the new norms, the person’s app will not lose any functionality, though the user will surely be sent reminders to step up. “We will not limit the functionality of how WhatsApp works in the coming weeks… We will maintain this approach until at least the forthcoming personal data protection law comes into effect,” a company spokesperson said. “Instead, we will continue to remind users from time to time about the update as well as when people choose to use relevant optional features, like communicating with a business that is receiving support from Facebook. We hope this approach reinforces the choice that all users have whether or not they want to interact with a business,” the spokesperson said. WhatsApp said it has responded to the IT ministry’s communication on the matter and has assured the government that privacy of Indian users “remain our highest priority”. It reiterated that the update does not change the privacy of people’s personal messages. “Its purpose is to provide additional information about how people can interact with businesses if they choose to do so.” On May 19, the IT ministry had warned the company of action if it did not respond favourably to a fresh notice on the matter within seven days. “The government has given seven days time to WhatsApp to respond to its notice. If no satisfactory response is received, necessary steps in consonance with law will be taken,” official sources had said, emphasizing that the government is “concerned and serious” over what they called WhatsApp’s “bulldozing its way through to force users” to agree to the update. The IT ministry has told WhatsApp that its new privacy update (which permits sharing business communication of users with Facebook even though personal chats remains encrypted) is a “violation of several provisions” of the existing Indian laws and rules. “In fulfilment of its sovereign responsibility to protect the rights and interests of Indian citizens, the Indian government will consider various options available to it under laws in India,” it told the company.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/whatsapp-defiant-wont-withdraw-privacy-update/articleshow/82926203.cms||Pankaj Doval

Of the total 25,739 Covid-19 positive samples sequenced by INSACOG till Monday morning, 9,508 samples have been found to have VoC. The B.1.617 variant - which was first detected in Maharashtra and found to have high transmissibility - was found in 5,261 samples, making it one of the most common mutations detected till now.

In a four-page statement, the Vardhan said the allegation“We have ensured that a sentinel surveillance system and a strategy has been put in place. States have been requested to regularly send samples for whole genome sequencing regularly,” Vardhan said. Earlier, officials had said that a co-relation has been seen between the surge in positive cases during the second wave of Covid-19 in India with the rise in the B.1.617 lineage of SARS-CoV2. The prevalence of the variant was more common is states like Maharashtra, Punjab, Delhi, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.

Chidambaram saidRecently, the UK health department said that two doses of anti-Covid jabs may be required for strong protection against one of the strains of the B.1.617 variant. However, experts in India are of the view that first dose of Covishield generates adequate antibodies to protect against severe disease of Covid-19. Vardhan also shared details about increasing incidence of Mucormycosis across the country. As many as 5,424 cases of Mucormycosis have been reported from 18 states, with a majority of them in Gujarat (2,165) and Maharashtra (1,188).

With just two days to go to comply with the new norms for significant social media intermediaries, barring Koo, none of players including Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram have complied with the new regulations that require them to appoint a resident grievance officer, a chief compliance officer and a nodal contact person. The government had given the firms three months to comply fulfil the requirements with the deadline set to expire on Wednesday. Although some of the platforms had sought six months, the government currently does not appear in any mood to relent. Their failure to comply with the norms opens the global giants to lose their status and protections as intermediaries and also makes them liable for criminal action, sources said. While Twitter declined to comment, Facebook did not respond to a query from TOI.

In another tweet on Monday, Manjhi wrote, “If one is so fond to have his photograph on the certificate, then the photo should also be carried on the death certificate. This will be justiciable.” Manjhi’s party, for the record, is an ally of NDA in the state. The RJD has supported Manjhi’s stand. “What Manjhiji has said is a big thing, but he should also come in action,” RJD spokesman Chitranjan Gagan said. The JD(U), meanwhile, has played down Manjhi’s tweets. “Have you seen any JD(U) functionary giving reaction to what Manjhiji has said?” a JD(U) spokesman asked. BJP spokesman and former MLA Prem Ranjan Patel said he did not have anything to say on the observation made by Manjhi. However, he said those who are objecting to the photograph of the PM on the certificates should “improve their knowledge”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/why-pm-pic-on-vax-certificate-manjhi/articleshow/82919770.cms||Abhay Singh

---||Business||SAT stays Sebi order on Yes Bank||Mumbai: The Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) has granted an interim stay on an order by markets regulator Sebi penalising private lender Yes Bank Rs 25 crore, alleging mis-selling of additional tier-1 (AT-1) bonds. In the same case, Sebi had also imposed a fine of Rs 1 crore on Vivek Kanwar, the bank’s former head of private wealth business, and Rs 50 lakh each on Ashish Nasa and Jasjit Singh Banga, both part of Kanwar’s team then. The stay by SAT came after Yes Bank told the tribunal that if its appeal is turned down, the bank would pay the penalty amount within two weeks from the date of the order. At the time of imposing the penalty on Yes bank, Sebi had alleged that the bank and some of its officials had misrepresented to its investors the risks involved with AT-1 bonds. In March 2020, while reorganising Yes Bank, the RBI had extinguished all the AT-1 bonds which were issued by the bank. As a result all the AT-1 bond investors, including those retail investors who were sold these instruments by its wealth management team, lost all their money in these bonds. Subsequently, Sebi, to protect the interest of the investors, had fined Yes Bank. SAT asked Sebi to file its reply within four weeks and the bank to file its rejoinder to the regulator’s reply after that. SAT will hear the matter on July 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sat-stays-sebi-order-on-yes-bank/articleshow/82923586.cms||---

In India too the prices of these precious metals are on a northward rally with silver again trading above the Rs 70,000/kg mark and gold nearing the Rs 49,000/10gm level. Market players say with the US market surely rising to the threat of future inflation, the prices of these two precious metals could witness another strong rally this year. The weakness of the US dollar in recent weeks also added to the bullishness in gold. According to some analysts, the massive volatility in cryptocurrencies in recent times and the overhang of fears about the spread of Covid infections in several parts of Asia is further increasing the bullishness about both gold and silver. In the international market, gold prices have gained 6% in the last one month, while for silver the corresponding number is 7% to $27.7. Last year, gold had gained 85% while silver rose 28%. In the domestic market, gold futures for June delivery were trading at Rs 48,580, up 2.2%, while silver for May delivery was at Rs 71,880, up 4.7% on the month. In India, trading in the physical gold market has been hampered by the Covid-induced lockdowns. According to Motilal Oswal Financial Services VP (commodities research) Navneet Damani, gold steadied near the highest level in more than four months amid weaker dollar and a pullback in US yields showing investors’ increased optimism on the precious metal. “The dollar stood near its lowest levels in three months and the US 10-year yield was hovering near a week low,” Damani wrote in a note on gold. “Broader range on Comex (a division of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange) could be between $1,865 and $1,900 and on the domestic front (the price) could hover in the range of Rs 48,400-48,900.” In addition to buying precious metals in physical form, investors are also investing through exchange-traded funds (ETFs). According to a recent report, total holding of the SPDR gold-ETF rose 0.6% on Friday to 1,043 tonne. In India, the government opened subscription for the second tranche of sovereign gold bonds with the price fixed at Rs 4,842 per gram. After this May 2021 tranche, the government will issue five more before the end of September 2021, the RBI said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/inflation-fears-weak-dollar-boost-gold-silver-prices/articleshow/82923470.cms||---

Chaudhary said the results of Class XII examinations have lifelong relevance for students and the examinations should be held at all costs. “However, the examinations should be held only after the present crisis created due to the second wave of the pandemic eases and the situation all over the condition normalises,” he said. The minister added most states are currently under lockdown, but the Covid cases are showing a declining trend everywhere. “The central government must announce the tentative dates of the commencement of Class XII examinations sometimes after a month or a month-and-a-half so that a state of uncertainty prevailing in the mind of students ends and they start preparing for the examinations,” he added. He said the Centre may think of conducting online subjective/objective examinations to save time and ensure hassle-free conduct of examinations and publication of results. The state government has already batted for online Class XII examinations at a virtual meeting held under the chairmanship of defence minister Rajnath Singh and in presence of the Union education minister on Sunday, Chaudhary said. He added in Bihar, Class X and XII examinations were conducted by the Bihar School Examination Board amid the pandemic in March itself and the results of both the examinations were declared on time. “Online classes are currently going on and the text materials have been made available to the students on their cellphones. The state government has already urged the Centre to provide suitable digital devices under Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan to the schoolchildren of the state who are unable to pursue online classes in absence of a dedicated electronic device,” Chaudhary added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-in-favour-of-holding-cbse-class-xii-exams-online/articleshow/82932835.cms||B K Mishra

On Monday, the BSE said its market cap crossed $3 trillion, nearly four years since crossing the $2 trillion mark in July 2017. At the close of trade on Monday, the figure was at Rs 218 lakh crore or a little over the $3-trillion mark. BSE’s market cap is taken as the representative of aggregate market value of India since a larger number of companies are listed on the BSE than on the NSE. According to Bloomberg and BSE data analysed by ETIG, of the $1 trillion addition during the last four years, Reliance Industries added the most, $110 billion, with TCS at $96 billion close behind. Among the top 10 contributors are also bluechips like HDFC Bank, Infosys and ICICI Bank. The list includes Bajaj Finance, which recorded a remarkable rally on the bourses in the last few years. The list also includes Adani Transmission that saw its market value jump nearly 12 fold, from $2 billion to almost $24 billion, data showed. India’s market cap crossed this milestone much ahead of its GDP, which is estimated to cross the $3-trillion mark by the end of 2021, a recent report by the IMF said. On Monday, a Tweet by Ashishkumar Chauhan, MD, BSE noted that in March 2002 BSE had a market cap of $125 million which crossed the $1 trillion mark in May 2007 and then the $2-trillion mark by July 2017. In the last two sessions, the sensex has added over 1,000 points to its Monday close at 50,652, over a two-month closing high. The recent surge in the market came as new daily Covid cases dipped substantially last week, market players said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/bses-m-cap-crosses-3tn-as-sensex-hits-2-mth-high/articleshow/82923407.cms||---

An hour before the curfew comes into force at 1pm, almost all the markets and roads—like Kesar Ganj Mandi, Lakkar Bazaar, Chaura Bazaar, Field Ganj, Gill Road, Dugri Road, Ferozepur Road, Shingar Road, Samrala Chowk and Shivpuri, among others —are jammed.From Monday, the district administration had extended by an hour the curfew relaxation. Therefore, instead of noon, the lockdown started at 1pm. But there was no reprieve from traffic mess, with the markets in Old City the worst affected.  “I had gone to Kailash Chowk to shop. On way home, when I was going from Kapoor Hospital side towards Mata Rani Chowk, there was a massive traffic jam. Initially, I thought opening of markets after two days triggered the gridlock. But later, I learned that the chowk has been closed due to an ongoing work. Neither traffic cops were deployed there, nor any caution sign was displayed. I then turned towards the inside market lanes, but got stuck in another jam,” said Karamjit Singh of Shahpur Road. Rajan Kapoor of Dugri said, “There is much traffic an hour before the lockdown comes into force. To ensure smooth vehicular flow, traffic cops should be present on roads and at markets. The authorities should take steps to address the problem, especially in Old City. Like, shops can open on odd-even basis to lessen the chaos.”Assistant commissioner of police (traffic) Gurdev Singh said, “I have visited all the areas where traffic congestion is a problem. In the past few days, I made proposals for infrastructure changes at Girjaghr Chowk, Division 3 Chowk and Kesar Gunj Mandi Chowk and forwarded them to the municipal corporation as it has to fund them. On Monday, I sent a proposal for Mata Rani Chowk, too, to make it congestion free. With some infrastructure changes, the traffic flow can be smoothened. However, we don’t get support from the MC. Besides, at Kesar Ganj Mandi Chowk, we have put traffic cones to check traffic mess.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/jams-choke-city-roads-an-hour-before-curfew-comes-into-force/articleshow/82918759.cms||Payal Dhawan

Police said the incident took place around 8am when the victim, Dilip Singh alias Pandit, was sitting at the shop of his brother Rajendra Singh. Four motorcycle-borne criminals reached the shop dealing in building construction materials and pumped four bullets into Dilip’s chest and abdomen. He was rushed to a local primary health centre from where he was referred to a government referral hospital. The doctors posted at the referral hospital, however, declared him brought dead. Rajendra said his brother was a teacher at a government upgraded middle school at Bhrigichak in the district. As the news about the murder spread, a number of people assembled at Jamunaha Bazar and demonstrated in front of the Kateya police station, demanding immediate arrest of the killers. Gopalganj SP Anand Kumar said CCTV footages were being obtained from the locality to ascertain the identity of the criminals. “The prime suspect in the case has already been identified and raids are on to arrest him and his associates,” the SP said. Sources close to the victim’s family said a local criminal had demanded a huge extortion money from Rajendra Singh, which he refused to give. SHO of Kateya police station Suman Kumar Mishra said the family had not lodged any complaint regarding extortion demand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/schoolteacher-shot-dead-in-gopalganj/articleshow/82919809.cms||Ramashankar
---||Business||Rationalise peak margin levy: Brokers’ body to Sebi||Mumbai: A recent circular by markets regulator Sebi that hiked margins on some trades to as much as 300% may have resulted in enhancing risk rather than curtailing it as it is prompting traders to resort to more dangerous market behaviour. These margin requirements, if implemented in the current format, may also change the market structure, converting traders into investors, which in turn would hit revenues of brokers and the exchanges, market experts said. Margins are a portion of the value of the trade carried out by investors and traders on the bourses which are set aside by their brokers, at times even before such trades are executed. Any shortfall in margins attracts heavy penalties, which is another way to rein in traders from taking excessive risks. So, for trades carried out on the bourses, margins are used as a risk-mitigating tool. On Monday, ANMI — one of the leading brokers’ bodies in India — wrote to Sebi to reconsider its circular on peak margins and rationalise these levies so that brokers and traders do not have to pay “300% of what should have been the actual levy”. In July 2020, Sebi mandated that between December 2020 and February 2021, traders should maintain at least 25% of the peak (maximum) margin. This margin was raised to 50% between March 2021 and May 2021, will go up to 75% between June 2021 and August 2021, and finally to 100% from September onwards. Brokers explained that if a trader knows that he has about 5% of the value of his trade as margin with his broker, he would probably limit his trading loss to 2-3% of the value of the trade. On the other hand, if the margin is now enhanced to, say 10%, the trader would probably be tempted to incur more losses and cut the losses to 7-8%. This in turn would enhance risks at the individual and at the aggregate (market) level, a broker said. According to ANMI director Rajesh Baheti, margin collection should be correlated to the time in the market. “Short-term day trades carry much diminished risk. By asking for higher margin (from these traders), Sebi will inevitably drive the day trader to become a positional trader, which would actually increase the risk for him,” Baheti said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rationalise-peak-margin-levy-brokers-body-to-sebi/articleshow/82923690.cms||---

Kumar has also asked the ministers not to move around their assembly constituencies to review the Covid situation since the lockdown aims to prevent crowding to prevent the transmission of the virus. In his two official letters addressed to the personal secretaries of the ministers concerned, he even asked ministers not to visit the districts that are under their charge. In his letters, issued on Sunday and Monday, Kumar said the compliance with the lockdown guidelines imposed to prevent the transmission of the virus is also incumbent upon them. His letter released on Sunday said it had come to the knowledge of the department that ministers were making a tour of constituencies or districts that are in their charge to review schemes under implementation or to get an update on the pandemic in the district. If they have to make the review of any government scheme or programme, then they should do it through the virtual medium – through video-conferencing, the letter of the cabinet secretariat department issued on Monday said. "As their movement in the constituencies or the districts would lead to the gathering of people that might leave a negative impact on the mind of people about the seriousness of the lockdown that has been imposed to prevent the transmission of the coronavirus," the letter stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-ministers-asked-not-to-tour-constituencies-districts/articleshow/82921888.cms||Abhay Singh

The CCRAS has directed the NRS Government Ayurvedic College in Vijayawada and the Ayurvedic hospital in Tirupati to take comprehensive feedback from at least 500 patients who have consumed the preparation. Data of patients have been collected through Nellore district police and some patients have been contacted for feedback. Teams from the Vijayawada college and Tirupati hospital will interact with the patients. CCRAS has said it will complete its investigation into the drug in four stages. Analysis of the samples received from the state Ayush department has started and CCRAS is reported to have communicated that it would take at least four to five weeks for completing the comprehensive investigation. Meanwhile, chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy has directed the officials to get the eyes of those who took the Krishnapatnam herbal drops screened. Ayush commissioner Colonel V Ramulu who inspected the preparation, made a presentation to the chief minister at a review meeting on Monday. Speaking to the media, the commissioner said no harmful ingredients were found in the preparation. “Anandaiah is using about 18 herbs and leaves prescribed by Ayurveda. There are no harmful chemicals or unknown ingredients. We, however, can’t call it as Ayurvedic medicine without proper clinical trials,” said Ramulu. He added, “We can’t treat it as medicine for Covid-19. But it is certainly a useful medicine,” said Ramulu. Meanwhile, the ICMR has suspended its visit to Krishnapatnam to inspect Anandaiah’s medicine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/central-ayurvedic-body-takes-up-study-of-anandaiahs-drug/articleshow/82920269.cms||Samdani MN

He has also asked the Covid-dedicated hospital to depute doctors of the gynaecology and paediatrics departments in shifts. “The pregnant women, who have tested positive for Covid, do not need to worry because the NMCH will help them,” Agarwal said on Monday and announced that the doctors and health workers, who would provide their commendable services during Covid times, would be felicitated. While holding a meeting via videoconferencing with the hospital superintendent and other officials, the divisional commissioner said, “Newborns, who test positive, should be kept under observation in the neonatal intensive care unit.” Head of the gynaecology department, Dr Renu Rohtagi, told Agarwal, “In most cases, the babies of Covid positive mothers were not infected and tested negative.” The district administration is also identifying a few private hospitals in Patna where special labour rooms and wards can be created. “We will check if they have facilities like labour rooms, operation theatres and neonatal intensive care units and select them accordingly,” said the commissioner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/boost-facilities-for-covid-ve-pregnant-women-nmch-told/articleshow/82921343.cms||VK Tripathi
---||Business||Wadhawan bid: DHFL lenders appeal against NCLT’s order||MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India-appointed administrator for DHFL has approached the appellate tribunal against the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) order on May 19 directing the committee of creditors to consider an offer made by the jailed promoter of DHFL Kapil Wadhawan. According to banking sources, following the directions would undermine all the progress achieved towards the resolution of the case. Lenders said that there was no question of doing a one-time settlement with Wadhawan because that would involve the RBI withdrawing the case from NCLT, providing a bank guarantee for expenses incurred by administrator and 90% of the voters agreeing to a proposal that was not a valid one in the first place. “The letter written by Wadhawan is not a formal proposal. Its objective was to stymie the resolution process,” said a banker. While it would be easy for lenders to vote and reject a proposal by the former promoter, the whole process would have taken a fortnight as there are different classes of creditors, including some who dissented on the Piramal bid. The NCLT bench would also be completing its term in early June and if the matter came up before a new bench, the resolution could get further delayed. Bankers said that it was wrong to say that they had not considered Wadhawan’s letter. The letter wherein he offered principal repayment in full in seven-eight years was considered by lenders and rejected without being put up for a vote as it did not find any merit with the lenders. Bankers say that it is clear that Wadhawan intends to delay the resolution as much as possible through litigation. Given the circumstances, they felt it would be better to exhaust the avenues for appeal to ensure that new impediments do not come up in future. Section 29A of the insolvency and bankruptcy law prevents defaulting promoters from being part of the resolution process. But lenders can do a one-time settlement with the promoter after withdrawing the matter from the bankruptcy process under section 12A. In the case of DHFL, since the bankruptcy process has been initiated by the RBI, it is the central bank that will have to make an application to withdraw. The RBI had earlier informed the tribunal that it had superseded the board owing to “governance concerns and defaults by DHFL in meeting various payment obligations”, it said in a statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/wadhawan-bid-dhfl-lenders-appeal-against-nclts-order/articleshow/82923545.cms||---

Daily recoveries have been outnumbering fresh infections for the past few days. Andhra Pradesh recorded about 4.9 lakh cumulative cases in May, averaging around 20,000 daily cases. The daily case load has remained more or less the same for the past three weeks, hinting at the beginning of a downward trajectory. In tandem with the improvement in the daily case load and the case positivity rate, the ICU and oxygen bed situation has eased at designated Covid-19 hospitals. Even the recovery rate, which quickly descended by about 14 per cent from the peak 99 per cent in February, has settled at around 85 per cent for the last three weeks. The Covid-19 reproduction rate, also known as R-nought, has come down to 1.02 from the peak of 1.8 a month ago. A further decline in this value would limit the spread of the pandemic, thereby lowering the case load in the state. The number of daily calls received by the 104 call centre, the one-stop solution for Covid-related queries and information in Andhra Pradesh, has dropped to the 8,000 range from 18,000 three weeks ago. Fewer queries about Covid-19 tests and hospital admissions could be a clear indicator of the improving situation in the state. The pandemic had disproportionately burdened the state’s healthcare system during the first wave last year. However, the state managed to flatten the curve of the disease by February, before the catastrophic second wave hit in March. State health officials expect the situation to improve over the coming weeks. Principal secretary, health and family welfare department, Anil Kumar Singhal, said the overall Covid-19 situation seems to be improving if the number of daily cases or available beds are an indication. “If similar trend continues, things may soon fall under control in the state,” said Singhal. Even on the national front, India’s daily recoveries continued to outnumber daily new cases for the eleventh consecutive day on Monday. States such as Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan are already witnessing a declining trajectory in the number of new infections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/ap-sees-early-signs-of-downward-trajectory-in-infection-numbers/articleshow/82920074.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

In areas under South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), Covaxin was available at select places for people aged above 45 who had done prior registration. There are 21 centres where people aged between 18-44 are being inoculated. “Three centres giving Covaxin were not operational on Monday. Similarly, of the 18 centres giving Covishield, 11 were not operational ,” said an SDMC official. North corporation mayor Jai Prakash said 67 vaccination centres were operational in their jurisdiction. “While 19 centres have been set up in Delhi government schools, our doctors and paramedical staff are deployed there for vaccinating those aged between 18-44. In all, 35 centres were giving Covaxin, but due to lack of supply they have been temporarily closed. They will be restarted once we get fresh supplies,” he added. SDMC leader of the House Narendra Chawla said that at Tilak Nagar Hospital, people who had booked appointments returned without getting shots as vaccines were not available. “While the Centre says there is no shortage, Delhi government is talking about a crisis. The shortage of supply from the state government will automatically delay the entire vaccination process,” he added. In areas under East Delhi Municipal Corporation, there are 14 vaccination centres for people in the age group of 18-44 years. Of these, 13 centres are giving Covishield and one Covaxin. “No Covaxin is available at most of the centres. For those aged above 45, six centres are giving Covaxin. Of them, two were not operational at Swami Dayanand and Chandiwala hospitals. However, the remaining 10 where Covishield was being given were operational,” said EDMC mayor Nirmal Jain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/with-covaxin-doses-not-in-drive-halted-at-35-corpn-centres/articleshow/82922213.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Special wards set up for black fungus patients||VIJAYAWADA: With 910 cases of mucormycosis, or black fungus, registered across the state, the health department is closely monitoring the situation to provide timely treatment to patients. Black fungus has emerged as a major concern for patients who have recovered from severe complications related to Covid-19. The health department is paying attention to patients who have recently recovered and been discharged. A survey is being conducted to identify patients with black fungus and those who exhibit symptoms are being shifted to special wards arranged at government hospitals. The Krishna district administration has said it has identified 100 patients with symptoms of black fungus, of which 72 are undergoing treatment at Vijayawada GGH. Krishna district collector A Md Imtiaz said the best treatment is being provided to patients and added that a majority of them are out of danger. The collector also said the district administration will increase the number of beds at the special wards for black fungus patients if cases increase. Meanwhile, the Union government is allocating Amphotericin-B vials for the treatment of black fungus. On Sunday, Union minister for chemicals and fertilizers D V Sadananda Gowda tweeted, “After a detailed review of rising no. of cases of Mucormycosis in various states, a total of 23680 additional vials of Amphotericin-B have been allocated to all States/UTs today. The allocation has been made based on total no. of patients which is approx. 8848 across the country. (sic.)” Andhra Pradesh has received 2,310 vials of Amphotericin-B. Seventy-five per cent of the vials sanctioned to the state will soon reach while the other 25 per cent is expected to reach after state government submits patient numbers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/spl-wards-set-up-for-black-fungus-patients/articleshow/82920108.cms||Venu Lanka
---||Patna||Bihar: 101 doctors join hands to help alma mater in corona times||PATNA: At a time when the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic is wreaking havoc on the state, a group of 101 doctors has joined hands to provide free medical consultation to the staff and the students of St Michael’s High School (SMHS). Of these, 36 are ex-Michaelites and the remaining 65 are parents of the pupils studying in the premier institute at present. The initiative, as part of which 36 reputed doctors from different parts of the country have been brought together, is the brainchild of former SMHS students, Sunny Agrawal (2002 batch) and Dr Vikas Shankar (1995 batch). Christened ‘Health Connect’, it was launched last week. “A lot of parents, who could not step out for seeking medical advice amid the Covid-induced lockdown, had reached out to us, as a result of which we began this initiative,” the principal of SMHS, Father Armstrong Edison SJ, said on Monday and added that quite a few students of the school had started door-to-door lunch and dinner services for 300 families in the city. Sunny, who is a managing consultant, said, “There are not only Covid specialists, but reputed health experts from different fields. A few medical shops have also agreed to supply medicines to us on discounted rates.” Dr Rajiv Das, a senior surgeon at the L H Hiranandani Hospital in Mumbai and an alumnus of SMHS, told this reporter over the phone, “Former students usually keep in touch with each other on WhatsApp. Many of them have already consulted me.” Another ex-student of the 2002 batch, Dr Siddharth Kumar, who is now an ophthalmologist in Patna, said, “Helping the students and the staff of my alma mater is no less than an honour.” Throwing light on mucormycosis or black fungus, Delhi-based periodontal surgeon and implantologist, Dr Joohi Chandra, urged Covid-recovered patients to “get toothache checked at once because it can be one of the earliest symptoms of the deadly disease”. “Usually starting with sinusitis, the fungus severely damages the eyes and the surrounding organs. However, recent cases have shown that it can harm the jaws too,” Dr Joohi, an SMHS student of the 2002 batch, claimed. She also advised people to assess their post-recovery symptoms properly. Asked about the third wave of the pandemic, Dr Joohi replied, “Although there is no concrete evidence to prove that a large number of kids will be affected during the third wave, parents should keep tabs on their children’s health.” Dr Joohi’s batchmate, Dr Adnan Imam, who is a consultant physician and diabetologist in Patna, said, “One of my kids is an SMHS student. I, therefore, know that many parents and staff are ill. I have helped four of them and will continue to do so happily.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/101-doctors-join-hands-to-help-alma-mater-in-corona-times/articleshow/82921641.cms||---

Bhagalpur DM Subrat Kumar Sen flagged off 21 vaccination-cum-awareness vehicles on Monday. The vehicles are equipped with medical facilities and include healthcare workers and auxiliary nurses and midwives (ANMs). The DM said these vehicles would create awareness on vaccines and also ensure on-the-spot vaccination in rural areas. He also warned people not to spread any fake information or indulge in false gossiping about Covid vaccines. “The vehicles will reach out to people in rural areas and create awareness about the necessity of vaccination and motivate people to come forward and take vaccines,” Sen said. In Saran, ‘vaccination express’ will be pressed into service for different blocks in the district on Wednesday. Beneficiaries in 45+ age group will be allowed to do on-the-spot registration. Each vehicle has been given a target to inoculate at least 200 beneficiaries per day. Saran DM Dr Nilesh Ramchandra Deore said 31 such vehicles would be flagged off on Wednesday. Bhojpur district immunisation officer Dr Sanjay Kumar Sinha said ‘vaccination express’ would be rolled out in the district in a couple of days to inoculate 45+ people in rural areas.

This would enable the aspirants to enrol in this executive MBA programme without any geographical barriers or any other fears related to the spread of the Covid-19 disease in the current situation. IIM-V had inducted its first batch of this two-year weekend programme back in 2019 with participants from reputed organisations and companies. The robust response continued for the second batch in 2020. Speaking to TOI, IIM-V director, Prof M Chandrasekhar said that the programme helps participants translate their potential and passion into high performance. “Owing to the pandemic situation, all classes and exams will be held online till further notice. The programme is a big hit among the previous two batches. This time, we are allowing the students to pay their fee in 12 instalments, instead of the present six due to the prevailing conditions,” said Prof Chandrasekhar. Prof Chandrasekhar said that the seats would be allotted based on CAT, GMAT, GRE score (or) IIMV test and personal interview. “The deadline for applications is May 30, and classes will commence on July 18. The faculty brings to the table a judicious blend of academic and research expertise, and value is added through the inputs and insights from the industry. A value-added course pack (25 courses), capstone project and a weeklong international immersion programme are the salient features of this MBA programme,” said Prof Chandrasekhar. Sandeep Raja, manager at Steel Authority of India Limited and a student of PGPEx 2019-21 at IIM, said that it is a great opportunity for working professionals in and around Vizag and for those who can travel on weekends to Vizag. M Srikanth Reddy, deputy manager with Jio and a student of PGPEx 20-22, said the programme broadened his perspective on business management. “Overall, the programme has made me a more well-rounded asset to my company and has given me the ability to transfer my knowledge to various industries in the future,” said Srikanth Reddy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/amid-covid-iim-v-goes-online-for-executive-mba-prog/articleshow/82920359.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: BevQ may return to revive liquor sales & boost revenue||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: With the state incurring a revenue loss of almost Rs 1,000 crore in a month after liquor sales were halted, the government is once again exploring the possibility of reintroducing the queue management mobile application that was used last year for liquor sales. Liquor sales through Bevco outlets and bar hotels were discontinued in the wake of the second wave of the pandemic from April 27. Liquor sales had begun on a positive note in the current financial year with the government earning approximately Rs 970 crore through sales from April 1 to April 27. However, it decided to shut down Bevco outlets and bars once again from April 27. Though a proposal for delivering IMFL (Indian-made foreign liquor) to homes was also under consideration, the government decided not to take the proposal further fearing a backlash from civil society with political opponents alleging that it would promote alcohol consumption. It is at this juncture that the mobile application is under revival, even if lockdown is lifted. “Unless test positivity rate is below 10% and things are under control, opening Bevco outlets or bar counters cannot be expected. To tide over the heavy losses the exchequer will have to bear if sales don’t continue, queue management application is the next option available,” said top Bevco sources. Last financial year, the state earned a robust revenue from liquor sales. It earned Rs 11,743.99 crore through liquor sales during the last financial year, which is only 5.28% less compared to the immediate year before it. In 2019-20, liquor sales fetched the state exchequer Rs 12,398 crore, after deducting operational cost, bills of manufacturers, other costs incurred by Bevco and its profit margin. This was possible not only because sales happened after shops reopened, but the mobile application, BevQ , was introduced after the initial lockdown was lifted last year. It is reliably learnt that the government may think about reintroducing the mobile app, after making some modifications to it as the sales by Bevco outlets and bar hotels using the application had earned criticism that the latter was making more profits as Bevco was incurring a loss of Rs 3 per Rs 100 on bottles sold to bar hotels from Bevco warehouses. “A minor modification will be required in the application whereby the share of sales through Bevco outlets and bar hotels will have to be fixed,” sources added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/bevq-may-return-to-revive-liquor-sales-boost-revenue/articleshow/82920592.cms||---
---||Patna||Bihar: Symbolic Buddha Jayanti at Bodh Gaya this year, too||GAYA: The Buddha Jayanti celebrations at Bodh Gaya will be symbolic this year, too, as the world heritage site Mahabodhi Mahavihara is closed due to the lockdown till May 25 in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Other monasteries of Buddhist countries at Bodh Gaya are also planning to celebrate the day in a simple manner. Buddha Jayanti is on May 26. Mahabodhi Mahavihara chief monk Bhikkhu Chalinda said there will be no gathering on the Mahavihara campus. “Only 10 monks empanelled with the Bodh Gaya Temple Management Committee (BTMC) will visit the Mahavihara and offer kheer and civara (robe) at the statue of Lord Buddha in the sanctum sanctorum followed by chanting of ‘sutras’. The monks will also offer flowers at the sacred Bodhi Tree and hold prayers. The activities are likely to be available live on Facebook for other Buddhist devotees across the world,” he said. Monk in-charge of Chakma Buddhist Monastery, Bhikkhu Priyapal, said Buddha Jayanti is the biggest annual event for the Buddhists. “But everyone, including the Buddhist devotees, has to follow the guidelines of the government issued in the wake of the ongoing pandemic. In view of the prevailing situation, we are planning to celebrate the day in a very simple manner, which will be just symbolic,” he said. Rajiv Kumar, a Buddhist scholar, said: “During normal days, an official function used to be organized by the BTMC on the occasion of Buddha Jayanti under the Bodhi tree, where representatives of the monasteries at Bodh Gaya participated in the prayers. More than 2000 neo-Buddhists from Maharashtra, particularly Nagpur, used to arrive at Bodh Gaya on Buddha Jayanti every year. Arrangements used to be made by the BTMC for accommodation, transportation and fooding for the neo-Buddhists. But due to the pandemic, all these activities have been suspended for the second consecutive.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/symbolic-buddha-jayanti-at-bodh-gaya-this-yr-too/articleshow/82919842.cms||---

Singh, a sub-inspector, was evading arrest with his firearm. The CID traced him and made him submit his firearm for examination. The matter surfaced before the high court on May 19, when a bench of Justice Rajeev Ranjan Prasad termed the behaviour towards the accused sub-inspector as "soft treatment" and asked the ADG CID why Singh was neither taken into custody nor interrogated. The senior police officer then assured the court that the necessary steps would be taken soon. In the backdrop of this, the high court reminded the ADG that it reposed confidence in him because it expected that he will deal with the matter with seriousness without letting anyone go scot-free howsoever influential or powerful he or she may be. The high court also came to know that CID has yet not requested telecom service providers to preserve phone calls data of all officers who are likely to be investigated in the case to which the ADG assured that steps will be taken within a week. The slain boy Anurag’s father Amarnath Poddar had moved the high court urging for a CBI inquiry under its monitoring in his son’s murder in the alleged police firing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hc-highlights-cid-soft-treatment-to-cop-accused-in-munger-firing/articleshow/82921234.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Health authorities said the government had provided stock for the dispensary last year, which was not adequate as the facility catered to 120 to 150 patients in a day during lockdown.“About two years ago, a 24-year-old woman of the village died of tuberculosis and there were some cancer patients too who needed care. So we decided to form Giani Nihal Singh Sewa Society to ensure the villagers get medicines. The society is set up in the memory of Giani Nihal Singh, a local vaid who provided free medicines to people,” said Rakesh Bansal, a shopkeeper from the village and member of the society.The villagers said their adoption of the village dispensary was a unique concept in the state. “The mudla sehat kendra (government dispensary) was established in the 1970s and is perhaps the only one in the state where a society is providing medicine supply. It has adopted this health set-up and got its walls painted, instruments installed and even got the furniture. We raise funds after making announcements from gurudwara and also get contributions from NRIs and villagers. The first one to contribute for the society was Baisakha Singh who gave Rs 500 and then donations started pouring. We call this medicines langar sewa,” said Dr Harminder Singh, a homoeopath.“Earlier the dispensary would get two patients a day, but now it is getting 25 to 30. During lockdown last year, the dispensary used to get 150 patients a day. The dispensary is also catering to patients from neighbouring villages, including Boparai Khurd, Daddahoor and Gobingarh,” he added.The villagers said besides medicines for common fever, cough and cold, the dispensary also has stock for heart diseases, hypertension and diabetes. They added that they get medical stock once in a month and till now the society has contributed medicines worth more than Rs 2 lakh in the past two years.Society has more plans for the health centre. “We are planning to buy an ambulance as it is important to bring patients to the medical facility at the right time,” said society members Surinder Singh and Gurpreet Singh.The officials at the dispensary are all praise for the effort. “The last time we got medicines from the government was in May 2020 and those lasted for a month. But because of continuous supply from the society, we could treat 120-150 patients in a day during lockdown last year,” said Satbir Kaur, the pharmacist at the centre. “Even now we are getting around 30 patients a day and we have adequate stock. There are three posts at the centre, including doctor, pharmacist and class IV employee. But we don’t have a doctor,” she added.“The society is doing a great job as people get necessary medicines free of cost and only have to pay Rs 5 for dispensary slip. This is a great service to humanity and we appreciate it,” said Surjeet Singh, a villager.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/govt-unable-to-provide-required-help-villagers-adopt-dispensary/articleshow/82918807.cms||Shariq Majeed

The district administration and child welfare committee were instructed to provide them with preliminary help at the earliest. The five children include three girls and two boys. Sangeeta Beniwal, chairperson, Rajasthan State Commission for Protection of Child Rights said, “The children will be brought under the state government’s Palanhar Scheme and we will ensure that they get all the help for education, health and food. We will also find if they have an extended family willing to take care or make alternative arrangements.” The post by a Twitter user got the attention of Congress leader Rukshmani Kumari who also spoke to Beniwal. According to the post, the family is from a minority community and hails from Sareri village in Bhilwara. The government-run child helpline coordinators said they are getting calls from caregivers of children who may have lost one parent and are seeking help to look after them. The calls are also from parents who are Covid infected and while they are undergoing treatment, there is no one to look after the children. The officials have provided necessary help to such children. “In two cases we received requests to look after kids whose parents were Covid-infected. We got in touch with other family members who were willing to look after the kids while parents recovered,” said an official on the help desk in Jaipur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/child-panel-helps-5-kids-whose-dad-died-of-covid-mum-unwell/articleshow/82922204.cms||---

According to the RTI activists, no official inspection of the work is being done and despite filing complaints with authorities, no action has been taken. Arvind Sharma, secretary of Council of RTI Activists, said, “Municipal corporation (MC) has allotted the work of interlocking tiles to Ludhiana Improvement Trust (LIT). The work has been further awarded to a contractor who is not doing the work according to the norms and executing this work in substandard manner. There are many anomalies in the interlocking tiling work like using lesser quantity of sand and gravel than required. Due to this kind of wrongdoings in the execution of contract, the tiles at several places have already started to break and are uneven.” Sharma pointed out the stretch of Baba Deep Singh Gurdwara to Mintgomery Chowk Road, where the tiling work was completed just about six weeks ago. “But the interlocking tiles here have already started breaking and coming out due to improper levelling. What is even more shocking is that no inspection of these tiling works is being done and regardless of us bringing this matter to the knowledge of higher officials of MC and LIT, no action has been taken till now. The silence of officials clearly shows that there is connivance of some officials due to which no action is being taken against the contractor. Therefore, in order to ensure that justice is served in this case and to save the precious money of the taxpayers going down the drain, we have filed a complaint with the principal secretary, chief vigilance officer and others.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/substandard-work-being-done-in-laying-interlocking-tiles-in-city/articleshow/82922230.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Two suspected patients in critical condition died on Saturday evening while one died on Monday afternoon. The deceased were above 60 years of age and were suffering from diabetes. They had tested Covid-19 positive earlier. According to the health department, six cases of black fungus were confirmed in the district by Monday afternoon. Besides, lab reports of 19 suspected patients are awaited. Dr Sanjay Kala, SNMC principal, said, “Six cases of black fungus have been confirmed so far. Lab reports of 19 patients are awaited. However, we are providing them with treatment for the disease. Five patients are in a critical condition. We have planned to conduct a crucial surgery on these patients.” In view of rising cases, the hospital authorities are planning to increase the number of beds to 100 for the black fungus cases. At present, SNMC has 48 beds for treating black fungus patients. “We are constantly getting patients coming with complaints of black fungus and most of them are coming from private nursing homes in Agra and nearby districts with serious complications,” said Dr Kala. Dr RC Pandey, chief medical officer of Agra district, said, “We have an in-house facility at SNMC to conduct all the required tests for detection and drugs for treatment of black fungus patients are available with us. Most patients in early stages do not know that they have the disease but progression is very rapid. For patients with uncontrolled diabetes, black fungus is life-threatening. Early diagnosis is important for treatment and better outcomes.” Kala said, “The symptoms of the black fungus vary from person to person. For some patients, the infections can start with strong headache, fever, nasal congestion, facial pain, while for others, it can be loss of vision, toothache, swelling in cheeks or upper jaw, eyes, black crusts in the nose, and sometimes face paralysis. There is a serious chance of dying if the infection reaches the brain. If it is diagnosed at the initial stage, then the patients can be saved.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/3-suspected-black-fungus-patients-die-in-agra/articleshow/82918814.cms||---

He is sending people to our relative’s house to convince us. They are offering money to withdraw the complaint. A few days ago, a man visited my aunt and told her that he had given shelter to the accused in Amritsar. We told police about his location, but they did nothing. They are also threatening us,” he added.Raghu said his father did not have any dispute with the accused. “The son of the accused had a dispute with my aunt’s son. About two months ago, Janak Raj went to my aunt’s house and there were arguements. My aunt had approached my father and when he intervened to resolve the issue, the accused started arguing with him. On April 26, the accused came to our house when my mother was alone. He abused my mother and pushed her. The same night, we had lodged a complaint against him at Sarabha Nagar police station. The next day, the investigating officer had called the accused to join the investigation. But he did not come. The next morning, he shot at my father when he was on duty at a demolition drive in Haibowal,” he said.The family on Monday also wrote to commissioner of police Rakesh Agarwal, seeking arrest of the accused.Raghu Raj said he and his family felt unsafe as the accused could harm them also. Haibowal SHO inspector Neeraj Chaudhary said, “We are trying to trace the accused. Raids were conducted at different places. He will be arrested soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/month-after-asi-shot-at-his-brother-kin-cry-pressure-to-strike-compromise/articleshow/82918869.cms||Payal Dhawan

The city police, which carried out the raid with the help of Ajmer’s Ramganj police, claimed to have exposed the drug racket that was supposed to send the seized consignment to several places across the state, targeting youths. The move came a day after Jaipur police raided a chemist shop at Vishwakarma and seized intoxicating drugs worth Rs 5 crore. Police reportedly received clues from its seizure made in Jaipur on the stock of intoxicating drugs in Ajmer. “So far, two persons have been arrested — Mobin and Kalu — from the spot while the alleged mastermind Rahul Chauhan and warehouse owner Latif are on the run. Their residences are being searched and we found important clues which could lead to further seizures. The warehouse was taken on rent by Latif to keep his goods, for Rs 3,000 per month,” said Ajmer police. A team from Jaipur commissionerate on Monday morning reached Ajmer and they along with the team of Ramganj police, raided the godown and some shops at Vimla Market in Ajmer. “The seized drugs were found to be of three companies and also important evidence was collected from the Vimla Market shops,” said Jaipur police, which has handed over the seized drugs to Ajmer police. Police are now looking at the network that supplies these intoxicating medicines to customers. The medicines were to be supplied in several cities through the transporter. “Police are also identifying the network spread in cities and how these intoxicating drugs are being procured,” said Jaipur police. Sources said that police got the tip-off on Sunday when they seized a consignment in Jaipur from a loading tempo. Now, they are looking for the network that supplies intoxicating drugs in Rajasthan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jaipur-ajmer-police-seize-drugs-worth-rs-11-crore-2-held/articleshow/82922235.cms||---

---||Kochi||Kerala State Electricity Board readies flood management plan at hydel dams||IDUKKI: Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) has formed a flood management plan before the arrival of monsoon and decided to strictly follow rule curves in major dams to assure flood cushion. Water levels in major hydel dams remained high as repeated cyclones hit the state. The state government and KSEB called high-level meetings and reviewed the situation. Normally, the water levels in major hydel dams are below 20% in the last week of May every year. But as a result of Cyclone Tauktae and heavy summer rains, the water levels rose in hydel dams in the state. The water level in major hydel dams on Sunday was 34%, which is capable of generating 1,409.34mu power. The water level in the dams during August 2018 floods was 24.84%. In 2020, the water level was 29.87% on May 23. Supriya S, KSEB chief engineer (dam safety and DRIP), said, “KSEB called a review meeting and decided to strictly follow the rule curve at major dams in Idukki to manage the flood cushion. The rule curve is applicable for Idukki, Banasurasagar, Idamalayar and Kakki dams. Presently, the water level is very low in these dams. When water levels rise to the rule level, we will immediately release the water and assure the flood cushion.” “The reality is that only Idukki, among major dams, has the power to hold more water and prevent floods. Most small dams will reach the maximum storage level within one or two days. The rule level in Idukki on June 2 is 2,373ft. The present water level is 2,336ft, which is 37ft below the rule level,” she added. In the wake of increasing water levels, a meeting called by the chief secretary also reviewed the situation. According to officials, the water levels in major dams will be monitored every three days and a review meeting will be held every 10 days. Meanwhile, according to climate experts there is a chance that Cyclone Tauktae-type cyclones will hit the state in future. “The overheating of the Arabian Sea caused the repeated cyclones and there are chances of more such cyclones in the future. We need a review of dam management before the monsoon in the wake of such repeated cyclones,” climatologist Gopakumar Cholayil told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kseb-readies-flood-mgmt-plan-at-hydel-dams/articleshow/82920721.cms||Sandeep Thomas
---||Goa||Remote South Goa villages left powerless for over a week||MARGAO: While the rest of the state limped back to near normalcy following the devastating cyclone Tauktae, the situation is yet to be fully restored in several remote areas of South Goa. Karla, located in the Cavrem-Pirla village panchayat jurisdiction, and some areas of Netravali in Sanguem taluka had to go without electricity for the past nearly nine days, locals said. With hardly 20 houses and located in the forest area, Karla was the worst affected. The hilly terrain and bad condition of the road leading to the village meant that the hamlet received no relief from government agencies even a week after the cyclone. While hundreds of trees lay uprooted bringing down electricity lines, scores of electricity poles were damaged and the road blocked at several places. “Leave aside relief, nobody came here to inquire about us, not even our MLA,” a local said. “We made several trips to the electricity department at Sanguem, but it ignored our pleas for help.” Locals pointed out to a sizeable damage to their plantations, the sole source of livelihood for many in this hamlet. Officials from the agriculture department were yet to the visit the village to assess the losses, they said. Their plight came to light only after a chance visit to the village by former Sanguem MLA Subhash Phal Dessai. “As there was a vaccination drive under way in the nearby Cajur village on Saturday, I had gone to Karla to oversee the transport arrangement being done for the people of this hamlet to ferry them to Cajur. It was then that I realised that the village was in darkness for the past eight days,” Phal Dessai told reporters. He then contacted senior officials of electricity department, following which a team of engineers and linemen was dispatched to the village. The team worked throughout Sunday and Monday, with the locals assisting them in clearing the roads of fallen trees and branches. Power was finally restored on Monday evening. Further south, remote villages of Netravali, Verlem, Tudav, Saljini, Savri and other remote hamlets remained without power for almost seven days. Abhijit Dessai, Netravali deputy sarpanch, said that as only low tension power lines had snapped, temporary electricity connections have been provided to the affected villages by the electricity department. “Locals worked tirelessly to assist the electricity department personnel in the restoration work. They have provided temporary connections by drawing cables. It will take some more time for permanent restoration of power supply,” he said. Dessai also pointed out to the large-scale damage to areca nut plantations at Patwado, Netravali, wrought by the cyclone. He has demanded that the agriculture department assess the loss immediately and provide compensation to the affected farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/remote-s-goa-villages-left-powerless-for-over-a-week/articleshow/82922264.cms||---

However, the unregulated crowd created chaos as the health officials failed to control the gathering.“There were no regulations and a panic situation prevailed as Covid protocols were not followed,” Rameshrajan, a resident, said while waiting to take the jab.He said, “When there is an online registration facility why are the officials making it a walk-in. When the government opened the window for 18+ for vaccination on May 20, we registered online and got the slot. But the officials said they were yet to receive guidelines from the government.”“The system is not informed properly to the public. Even today, there is no proper announcement that 18+ would get their vaccination. I went to the RCTC campus after hearing from my friends but in vain,” Maheshkumar, another resident, said. He said health officials distributed only 200 tokens and dispersed the rest of the people saying that that was for the day. But, subsequently without announcement 100 more tokens were issued.“Online registration is the best way to follow,” L Krithika, another resident, said. “Is this to satisfy the minister that the officials are conducting so many vaccination camps even during the lockdown period?” she asked.However, police brought the situation under control. Deputy director of public health Dr P Balusamy said, “We haven’t started vaccination for the 18+ category yet. The launches are meant for the 17 categories of frontline workers prescribed in the government order.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/vax-camp-for-auto-van-drivers-held-in-ooty/articleshow/82922244.cms||---
---||Delhi||No bail to man held for black marketing O2 concentrators in Delhi||NEW DELHI: A man arrested for alleged black marketing of oxygen concentrators in the city by selling one such machine for over a lakh has been refused bail by a sessions court. It noted that Delhi High Court-appointed high-powered committee had kept all those accused of black marketing and hoarding of Covid-19 resources outside the purview of bail. “Because illegal hoarding and black marketing of the said life-saving drugs and medical equipment are affecting the public at large... The allegations against the applicant/accused are serious in nature,” said the order passed by additional sessions judge Jagdish Kumar. The court added that, according to the investigation so far, a huge quantity of oxygen concentrators, which were being sold at exorbitant prices, was recovered. “Some voice recordings are allegedly being recovered where the applicant/accused is saying that one piece of oxygen concentrator must not be sold below Rs 1.10 lakh,” the order stated. During the hearing, the counsel appearing for Anil Jain argued that he had been implicated in the case. Bail was sought on the ground that all the provisions of IPC, Epidemic Diseases Act and Essential Commodities Act invoked in the case were bailable, except IPC Section 420 (cheating). Jain’s lawyer contended had he had purchased the oxygen concentrators with invoices and sold some of them at a marginal profit of Rs 3,000 each. He also submitted that his client had been in judicial custody since his arrest, and no further custody was required. Moreover, a co-accused had already been granted bail, he added. The public prosecutor, on the other hand, pointed out that the FIR dated April 20, 2021, was based on a complaint of illegal hoarding of life-saving drugs and equipment by unauthorised people, including the accused, and sale of such machines on “extremely higher” rates. The information led to the arrest of co-accused Anuj Jain and Shekhar Kumar when they were trying to sell the oxygen concentrators to customers at Rs 1.10 lakh. Thereafter, another accused Keshav Chaudhary was arrested, and 60 oxygen concentrators were recovered from him. Chaudhary’s disclosure revealed that he was working with Anil Jain, and during a raid at Jain’s house, 45 such machines were recovered. The prosecution claimed that Jain used various WhatsApp groups and voice messages to sell the medical equipment. “The applicant/accused was selling the said oxygen concentrator through two-three middlemen,” it added. After considering the submissions, the court held there was no ground to grant bail at the present stage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-bail-to-man-held-for-black-marketing-o2-concentrators/articleshow/82922273.cms||Aamir Khan

The patients are doing well, but they all have high diabetes and had received steroids as part of their Covid treatment, Bandekar said. GMC has identified ward 102 to treat patients of black fungus, and Dr Carnegie D’Sa, an ENT surgeon, has been appointed officer. An expert committee comprising experts from the departments of opthalmology, skin, neurosurgery and ENT has been constituted with Dr Maria Silveira, head of pediatrics, as its chairperson, he said. D’Sa, Bandekar said, will be assisted by specialists as treatment of patients afflicted with mucormycosis requires multi-specialties. He (nodal officer) has specified the requirements such as an endoscope and some other apparatus, and they will be procured shortly. Of the 10 cases, he said that in nine, black fungus was detected after they had recovered from Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/four-more-cases-of-mucormycosis/articleshow/82924244.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Glitches mar district court online hearings, lawyers hassled||NAGPUR: Ever since online hearing commenced at the district and sessions court here, lawyers are complaining of numerous glitches. After many lawyers and litigants thronging the court premises were infected by Covid-19, online hearing was introduced last month. In fact, over 40 lawyers and a couple of retired judges have succumbed to the infection in April, say sources. According to lawyers, they are facing several glitches — like link not opening, access denied and server problems etc — right from the first day. “Even if we luckily get access, we have to wait for hours. I have a case of an accused selling Remdesivir illegally, and the high court has ordered the trial to be completed within 15 days. Chief judicial magistrate court isn’t conducting online hearing and lawyers aren’t allowed to enter the court’s premises. How are we expected to appear in the case?” asked a lawyer. Lawyer Ranjan Deshpande said there was no planning and due to sudden implementation of videoconferencing, there was chaos in the lower courts. “It’s over a year since Covid-19 pandemic has hit the country, but no infrastructure has been put in place. We all are confused on what to do now,” he said. The court administration as well as Bar Council of Maharashtra and Goa should come out with an insurance scheme for lawyers so that their families would get some relief in case of tragedy. “Many from our fraternity have lost their lives. Therefore, health insurance of Rs5 lakh should be introduced for all lawyers,” he said. Other lawyers questioned how the high court’s online hearing worked seamlessly since last year, and why the same system was not implemented in the district court. “Today we had to go to the court premises after failing to get access. But the court officials too were clueless about the glitches. The administration needs to boost the online infrastructure to make it accessible to all, just like the HC,” they said. PDJ, DBA prez meet HC judge with lawyers’ grievances Principal district judge Sanjay Mehere and District Bar Association (DBA) president Kamal Satuja met a senior judge at Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Monday to discuss the problems faced by lawyers in online hearing and requested him to allow a hybrid mode — physical hearing for those who’re unable to use online facility or couldn’t connect due to technical glitches — to attend cases. “We’ve made a request to provide four extra computers and video links at the ground floor of Nyay Mandir so that lawyers can plead their cases, if they fail to get connected. The issue would be resolved soon” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/glitches-mar-district-court-online-hearings/articleshow/82922232.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Delhi||Child’s gambit: 9-year-old from Delhi makes first move, takes Covid-19 squarely on||NEW DELHI: Adhiraaj Sejwal had been infected with the Covid-19 coronavirus as had been his entire family. When recovering from the infection, the nine-year-old saw his family members struggling for medicines, oxygen concentrators and, in particular, to get a hospital bed for his grandmother. When he finally fought back the infection, Sejwal’s one aim was to help those troubled by Covid. Because he had been learning chess for the past two years, his first resort was the sport. With the assistance of his coach, he organised an online tournament. Sejwal was able to collect Rs 51,000 through donations, and he forwarded the sum to Hemkunt Foundation, a relief organisation that has set up oxygen langars and Covid care centres. The Covid Relief Chess Tournament, played online on lichess.com on May 23, was a competition for participants in different age categories: under 7, 11 and 15 years. “There were 100 participants overall. We did not charge any entry or registration fees,” said Sejwal, a student at Amity International School in south Delhi’s Saket. “It was up to the participants to donate any sum that they wanted to. Of the 100 who took part in the tournament, 25 made such contributions.” The donations ranged from Rs 500 to Rs 10,000. In an earlier effort, the tiny do-gooder had collected over Rs 2 lakh to help poor children, mostly studying in Delhi government schools, pay their examination fees at a time when their families were facing financial constraints due to the lockdown. According to his mother, Meenakshi Sejwal, the chess tournament also became an opportunity for the child players to meet their friends online. “Due to the pandemic, kids have been confined to their homes for more than a year. They got a chance to meet old friends and make new ones through this tournament,” she said. “Every kid enjoyed it.” There were trophies for the top player in each category. “Once the lockdown is relaxed, we will send the trophies to the three winners in the different age sections,” said Sejwal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/childs-gambit-9-yr-old-makes-first-move-takes-covid-19-squarely-on/articleshow/82922368.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Students crowdfund 50 oxygen concentrators||JAIPUR: Thirteen students of Jayshree Periwal International School, through a campaign for Covid relief, have collected Rs 38.5 lakh in 16 days (as on Monday). The students donated 50 oxygen concentrators including 25 to the Chief Medical and Health Officer (CMHO), Jaipur on May 19. The campaign was started by 13 students of class XII of the school on May 8 by launching a 48-hour live streaming fund-raising campaign to collect the funds. The team produced nonstop content for two days including pre-recorded messages from Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, AIIMS director Randeep Guleria, Bollywood actor Sharman Joshi and musical presentations by students, live interviews. “The idea came to our mind when cases started surging in the country. This time, we thought to make a difference by doing something which can save lives. Keeping that in mind, most of us wanted to contribute and we decided to reach out to our near and dear ones who believe in our idea and intention,” said Krish Sharma, one of the founding members of the campaign. The team zeroed in on oxygen concentrators following the media reports on how people were dying for want of oxygen. They are still receiving funds and now would like to purchase the oxygen machines from other districts in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/city-students-crowdfund-50-oxygen-concentrators/articleshow/82922313.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Anil Deshmukh case: Statement of bar owner recorded||MUMBAI: Enforcement Directorate (ED) has recorded the statement of an Andheri-based bar owner in a money laundering case they are investigating against former state home minister Anil Deshmukh. The bar owner had been paying Rs 2.5 lakh every month to assistant police inspector Sachin Waze while he was in service, sources said. Waze was arrested in March. He was subsequently dismissed. Waze was directly reporting to then Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh, who had alleged in his letter to the chief minister that Deshmukh had asked Waze and two other police officials to collect Rs 100 crore every month from bar owners and other sources illegally for him. The ED has summoned five other bar-restaurant owners to record their statements as they were also reportedly paying Waze a similar amount every month. The ED is investigating how much money Waze had illegally collected while heading the Mumbai police’s Crime Intelligence Unit (CIU), and where he has parked it. ED is examining the financial dealings of those connected with Waze, Deshmukh and companies associated with them. They are also examining the financial transactions of Singh and his kin. The state government had shunted Singh from the post of Mumbai police commissioner in March. After Singh’s letter, the Bombay high court had asked the CBI to inquire into the allegations against Deshmukh, who subsequently resigned from the post of home minister. Last week, the ED recorded the statement of advocate Jaishri Patil, one of the four petitioners in court, on whose petition the court has ordered the CBI inquiry, which led to the registration of a corruption case against Deshmukh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/deshmukh-case-statement-of-bar-owner-recorded-in-mumbai/articleshow/82924335.cms||Vijay V Singh

---||Ludhiana||Clubbing e-way bill, FASTag: Fears of legal hassles grow||Ludhiana: The integration of e-way bill with FASTag and RFID (radio frequency identification) is drawing mixed reactions from tax professionals and assessees of the city. The step is aimed at curbing incidents of bogus billing by tracking real-time movement of goods. Some say the integration may cause unnecessary harassment to the genuine tax-payers and the authorities should ensure that due to the fault of the transporters—who may use long or alternative routes to save toll—the businessmen are not penalised. NK Thamman, a tax professional of the city, says, “The government has integrated FASTag with the e-way bill system. An additional feature has also been added to e-way bill mobile application of GST officers. Now, the mobile wings or other staff of the GST departments can get real-time tracking details of e-way bills and vehicles, and they can select consignments to be checked. By this integration, the government has taken steps to ensure tax compliances and track fraudulent activities by use of technology.”However, Thamman says the step may create litigation for the genuine buyer if the transporter avoids any toll plaza to save tax or if the supplier or transporter has forgotten to issue an e-way bill due to mistake. “Besides, it will not curb cases where substituted material is supplied along with invoice and e-way bill. Such cases will not be traced by this integration and the businessmen will suffer.” According to Ankur Gupta, a chartered accountant from the city, “The integration will help GST officers to undertake live vigilance of e-way bill compliance and aid in preventive leakage of revenue. GST officers can detect cases where the same e-way bill has been used multiple times and where consignment has crossed the toll without generation of e-way bills. This will help in curbing fake billing cases where goods do not move but only invoices are issued. But at the same time there is a high chance that the tax-payers might get into legal tangles due to the fault of the transporters.” Harish Kairpal, finance secretary of Knitwear Club, says, “We understand that this step has been taken to curb bogus billing and other malpractices of tax evasion like transfer of goods without bills. But at the same time we also request the government and the GST department to ensure that due to the new change, innocent businessmen are not penalised for human errors like a mistake in an e-way bills.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/clubbing-e-way-bill-fastag-fears-of-legal-hassles-grow/articleshow/82918932.cms||Mohit Behl

He also expressed concern over public attitude towards concerns of weaker sections of society and alleged that registration of FIR was being delayed because of pressure from senior officials. IGP Y Puran emailed an advance copy to NCSC chairman; secretary, ministry of home affairs (MHA), Government of India; additional secretary, police, MHA; directors, police-I & II, MHA and director, NCSC, with the subject, “non registration of FIR against Shri Manoj Yadava, IPS (1988 Hry) DGP Haryana under sections of SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act 1989 as amended (through ACS, Home, Haryana).” On May 19, IGP Y Puran Kumar lodged a complaint against DGP Yadava with senior superintendent of police (SSP) Hamid Akhtar, seeking registration of a case against him under the SC/ST Act for allegedly “obstructing him (Puran) from entering a place of worship and intentionally insulting in public view, as he belonged to the SC community.” The IGP also informed ACS home, Haryana about the complaint to NCSC. The developments are related to IGP Y Puran’s visit to a temple in Ambala district on August 3, 2020. IGP Y Puran Kumar claimed that the matter of non-registration of FIR was also taken up with ADGP, administration A S Chawla, ADGP, law and order Navdeep Virk, ADGP headquarters and Kala Ramachandran of Crime Against Women’s Cell (CAW). When Ambala police did not lodge complaint against the DGP, the IGP escalated the matter with Haryana chief secretary (CS) Vijai Vardhan, ACS home, Haryana Rajiv Arora, ADGP CID Alok Mittal, and secretary home 1 Haryana T L Satyaprakash. In his complaint to the NCSC, the IGP said a case had not been registered even after five days. “It seems that Shri Hamid Akhtar, SSP Ambala is being pressurised by higher authorities / senior officer(s) in the police hierarchy due to which FIR has not been registered despite a lapse of five days on the complaint submitted on May 19, 2021….The attitude of all officers concerned on the complaint submitted by a fellow IPS officer who has put in 20 years of service, speaks volumes about their attitude towards the concerns of weaker sections of society, which may be placed on their respective personal records permanently,” stated IGP Y Puran Kumar to NCSC. “Since the complaint is against incumbent DGP Haryana, this could be major reason for non-registration of the said FIR till date….The investigation of the said case, subsequently would also be influenced and hampered by concerned. It is my apprehension that Shri Manoj Yadava, (IPS) being in position of authority, may try to harm me personally and professionally, and all mentioned concerned officials of Haryana shall be personally responsible,” the IGP alleged. Calling for justice, the IGP stated, “MHA is the cadre controlling authority of the IPS officers, that matter is brought to the kind notice for immediate intervention so that rule of law prevails and justice is done. It is requested that CS Haryana, ACS home Haryana, ADGP CID and secretary home 1 Haryana may be directed to ensure that FIR is registered on my complaint immediately without further delay as per the provisions of the SC/ST Act”, said IGP Y Puran. IGP also requested the NCSC to bring the matter to the notice of the director, intelligence bureau, New Delhi. Ambala police lodged a daily dairy report (DDR) in the matter on May 19. Recently, IGP Y Puran Kumar moved Punjab and Haryana high court to bar DGP, Haryana Yadava from writing his appraisal report. On May 18, the high court directed ACS, Haryana to decide on Puran’s complaints within three months of the date of receipt. Despite repeated attempts, DGP Haryana and SSP Ambala did not answer calls for their comments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/haryana-igp-moves-national-sc-body-against-dgp/articleshow/82924387.cms||---

Organisations have demanded stringent action against the authorities responsible for the cattle deaths. Udaipur Municipal Corporation catches stray cattle found on roads that create problems for commuters as well as dirty the roads. Such animals are taken to the enclosure at Balicha. Cattle owners who turn up to get back their animals have to pay a fine of Rs 5,000 and Rs 200 per day charge for fodder fed to the animal during the period it was kept at the house. According to sources, generally only owners of milch animals turn up to claim them while others become a liability for the corporation. Over 250 bovines had been accumulated at the shelter house and hence the corporation authorities released them in the sanctuary area where large number of cows fell prey to wild animals like leopards. Many died of starvation. Villagers reported carcasses and foul smell emanating from the area that made life miserable for them. UMC commissioner Himmat Singh Barhat said, “As per the provisions, stray animals can be kept at the shelter for a fortnight, but cows were kept for almost a year. Bidders were not interested in buying them so we contacted gaushalas, too, but none came ahead to claim.” The officer said the cows were released in pasture land as per the norms, but if mass mortality is reported, they would not be released. Gaurav Nagda, district president of Shiv Sena, said the authorities concerned should be prosecuted under provisions of The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act and Cows Conservation Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/umc-responsible-for-cattle-deaths/articleshow/82922385.cms||---

As per the guidelines, just as individual work, only 10 persons should be employed for working in groups at a worksite. The guidelines, issued by rural development secretary K K Pathak, stated that if 20 persons are required to be employed for a particular work, they should be made to work in two groups so that they don’t come in contact with each other. It also stated that they shouldn’t come in contact with each other even during lunch break or recess. It has also been stated that, in absence of mates, village development officers (VDO) should carry out the measurement work and finally do its verification. Else, the measurement done by the mate must be verified by the VDO. However, the measurement done by the mates and the VDOs must be verified by the junior technical assistants (JTAs). “Due to an increase in the number of worksites (with just 10 workers employed at a single worksite), there will be a shortage of JTAs. Hence, JTAs can get the measurement work done by mates and VDOs. But the final measurement will be done by the JTA himself,” said an official. The in-charges, employed at the work sites, must ensure that Covid appropriate behaviour is followed by all NREGA workers. These include: while working in groups, the workers should maintain a distance of two yards while performing their individual works; one should not share his/her tool or use somebody else’s tool; during lunch breaks, they shouldn’t sit in groups or share each other’s food items; a Covid suspect should not be made to work at the site; their family members should be given work maintaining sufficient distance from other workers and nobody should be allowed to come to worksite without masks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/nrega-10-labourers-can-be-engaged-at-a-worksite/articleshow/82922365.cms||---

The piles of sand removed from the Ganga has helped create a sand island that could be used to host various activities, including events like the famous Rann Mahotsava held in Kutch, Gujarat. The Rs 11.95 crore project is likely to be completed by June 15. “We had started this project worth Rs 11.95 crores in March. Maximum work of creating a new channel of Ganga stream on the right bank has been completed and the project will be over by June 15. The work done so far has turned the sandbanks between the two channels in an island shape,” said irrigation department’s executive engineer Pankaj Verma, who is supervising the project, while talking to TOI on Monday. “This multipurpose project is reducing the velocity of water flow which was eroding ghat steps and threat to historical buildings was increasing. While creating a new channel we have ensured the actual stream does not shift away from the ghats,” he said. “The work has been done in such a way that when the project is fully complete, 60% river water will pass through the old stream on the left bank and the remaining 40% will be through the new channel towards the right bank,” Verma added. The average depth of river on the ghat side is 10 metre while the depth of the new channel is 7-8 metre, he said adding, the cargo vessels on National Waterway-I will also pass through the new channel. About 12 lakh cubic metres of sand was removed by the dredging machine to create a 45 metre wide new channel towards the right bank. The sand dredged from the river has created a sand island. Divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal said, “The increased area of sand ghats will be an attraction for picnickers and can also be used to organize mega cultural events like the famous Rann Mahotsava of Gujarat.” No dredging had been done since 1989 when the stretch had been notified as a tortoise sanctuary, and as a result there had been massive sedimentation along the right bank which increased the velocity of river flow near the ghats and had started eroding them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/ganga-dredging-project-to-stop-ghats-erosion-nears-completion/articleshow/82922364.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

The Kandla SEZ houses two units — one each of Everest Kanto Cylinder Limited and Rama Cylinders — that manufacture seamless cylinders, including oxygen cylinders. “These two units supplied over 98,000 empty oxygen cylinders to the domestic tariff area (domestic supply area) by consenting to stop exports voluntarily from April 19,2021,” said KASEZ. These empty oxygen cylinders were supplied to hospitals in Gujarat and other states across the country. According to KASEZ, 1,200 cylinders were airlifted to Nagaland for supply to the Nagaland health and family welfare department through the Nagaland Disaster Management Authority. In fact, these two units had to shut their plants, and manufacturing of empty medical oxygen cylinders was completely stopped for almost about 8 days after the government’s decision to suspend the supply of liquid oxygen for industrial use in the wake of skyrocketing demand of the life-saving gas at hospitals. As an industrial application, liquid oxygen is used as an input to generate high temperature for making bottoms and necks of the empty cylinders. The supply was later resumed after the development commissioner office of KASEZ raised this issue at different levels.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/kasez-units-supply-about-98000-oxygen-cylinders/articleshow/82920744.cms||---

A case under relevant sections of IPC, and Disaster Management Act 2005 and Epidemic Disease Act 1897 has been registered against the management of the hospital on the complaint of Sagar Verma, a resident of Yamuna Nagar in Haryana. Verma had filed a complaint with deputy commissioner (DC) Varinder Kumar Sharma against the hospital for overcharging regarding the Covid treatment of his father who later died in another hospital. The DC had ordered a probe against the hospital and a committee headed by additional DC Sandeep Kumar, deputy director Dr Hatinder Kaur and assistant civil surgeon Dr Vivek Kataria to complete the inquiry within 48 hours. “The inquiry has reported that according to the government’s rates fixed for the Covid treatment, the actual bill of Verma’s father was to be charged at Rs 2,35,450 only and hospital earlier asked to the complainant to pay Rs 8,45,062. Later in the probe, the hospital termed it clerical mistake and said the bill was Rs 4,86,010, which was too more than 106% against government’s guidelines. The report also blamed that due to malpractice of over billing by the hospital, the complainant shifted his father to another health institution where he succumbed later, district administration statement said. DC Sharma said the district administration has been keeping a close vigil on the functioning of hospitals and no one will be allowed to get away with any kind of malpractice. He said anyone can file a complaint on 104 helpline number of health department and his office regarding unethical practice in this hour of crisis. Sharma said in this hour of distress, it is the duty of administration to take strict action against those violating the guidelines of the health department regarding the capped charges of Covid treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/fir-against-pvt-hosp-for-overcharging-covid-patient-by-106/articleshow/82922468.cms||---

Accessible at www.umeedbysonusood.com, the chatbot allows patients to provide details and register for an oxygen concentrator, which, after due verification, is then delivered to their doorstep free of cost. SCF plans to extend this service across India. “Scarcity of oxygen was evident during the second wave of Covid infections in India, and the capital was one of the worst-affected cities,” said Sood. “With our initiative, we hope to ensure that no one loses his or her life due to oxygen deficit. We have many other national initiatives in the pipeline, such as getting oxygen plants set up across the country and an initiative to educate children who have lost their parents to Covid. We will be launching these soon.” Sood said that SCF’s mission was to transform lives and create a progressive community and making efforts to inculcate this culture in the entire society to lift up the lives of poor people and provide them the means to a healthy and happy life. SCF started in 2020 by making transport arrangements for migrants hit by the national lockdown to return to their villages. The foundation then launched Pravasi Rojgar to enable 3,00,000 workers to earn a livelihood and introduced the Saroj Sood Scholarships for students to pursue higher studies irrespective of their financial background. It also started the Ruk Jaana Nahi programme for the elderly to get quality knee transplants. ILAAJ India, a platform supporting paediatric surgeries and treatment, is another SCF initiative. It recently launched the Sonu for You app to connect donors and recipients in India’s largest blood bank. Other activities include free Covid help, free Covid Tests at home, telemedicine, oxygen concentrators and cylinders, hospital beds, emergency surgeries and medicine support across India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/actor-launches-chatbot-for-free-delivery-of-o2-concentrators/articleshow/82922444.cms||Pankhuri Yadav

In just one month of the second wave, nine children in Telangana have lost both their parents to Covid-19. Another 17 have lost one parent – the primary bread winner of the family in most cases. All of these cases have been reported to the child helpline set up by the department of women and child welfare, Telangana government, between April 19 and May 18. Most of these children are presently staying with their immediate relatives, some are awaiting a transfer to the child care institutions after they get through the initial trauma. Most of the orphans and half orphans fall in the age group of 10 to 18 years. “Of the nine orphans, four are with child care institutions. Rest of the five are with their immediate relatives. In one case, relatives sought some time to finish the 11-day mourning period before taking a decision on sending the kid to the institutions,” said special secretary and commissioner, women and child welfare department, Divya Devarajan. She added that such cases were unheard of during the first wave. “With more middle-aged people getting affected during the second wave, we have started seeing these cases,” she said. Apart from the cases reported on the child helpline, a few cases were also reported from hospitals and NGOs. “We had one child who was left behind after both parents succumbed. The child was later taken by relatives,” said superintendent, Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences and Research (TIMS), Dr Ehsan Ahmed Khan. In a similar incident, an orphaned child who was sitting in the reception area of a corporate hospital was also shifted to the child welfare authorities. Before the helpline was set up, some districts had reported one or two such cases. Hyderabad, for instance, has three cases, while Warangal Rural has recorded two cases. In almost all these cases verified by child welfare officials, the kids are taken in by their immediate relatives. “Whenever we get such an information from social media or news and information from our anganwadi teachers, we verify facts visiting the children. In the two cases that we saw, the children are being taken care of by their immediate blood relatives,” said Gade Mahender Reddy, district child protection officer, Warangal Rural.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pandemics-orphans-9-t-kids-lose-both-parents-to-2nd-wave/articleshow/82924471.cms||Amrita Didyala

MahaGenco first converted the ozonation plant meant to be commissioned at the Parli thermal station for generating medical oxygen at Ambajogai in April. After the experiment proved successful, a similar model of producing oxygen from air has been started at Parbhani. The medical oxygen is beign supplied to the Swami Ramanand Teerth Rural Government Medical College and Hospital at Ambajogai in Beed district and a Covid Care Centre at Parbhani. It is benefiting 200 patients at Parbhani. Mohan Avhad, chief engineer with MahaGenco on Monday said around 84,000 litre oxygen per hour is being produced from an ozonation plant installed in Parbhani. MahaGenco authorities said ozonation plants are used at thermal power plants to prevent development of moss in water utilized for the purpose of power generation. “The ozonation plant basically produces ozone, which is required to prevent formation of moss in water available at our plants. The plant has been modified using compressor and molecular sieves among other equipment to produce oxygen from air. The method of such oxygen generation has eased out the demand of oxygen during the current pandemic situation,” Avhad said, adding that oxygen produced has over 95% purity. The ozonation plant commissioned at Ambajogai on April 27 is also catering to nearly 200 beds, with around 288 jumbo cylinders of oxygen being produced per day. MahaGenco PRO Mahesh Aphale said the state power utility has plans to produce around 1,454 jumbo cylinders of oxygen per day using some of the identified sites in different parts of Maharashtra. “A special allocation of Rs 18 crore has been made to achieve the target of oxygen production, which will help the state in dealing with any eventualities,” he said. Notably, Congress president Sonia Gandhi has showered praise upon Maharashtra energy minister Nitin Raut for taking concerted efforts in the production of medial oxygen through MahaGenco during the current pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/mahagenco-supplies-o-to-parbhani-ambajogai-hosps/articleshow/82916027.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Goa||Defer digital meter fitment: Taximen||Calangute: Members of the North Goa Tourist Taxi Owners’ Association (NGTTOA) have urged the government to extend the time limit for fitment of digital taxi meters. Speaking to TOI, NGTTOA vice-president Ravindra Vengurlekar said forcing tourist taxi owners to fit digital meters during the Covid pandemic is inappropriate by the government. “There's no business as there are no tourists. And because of the Covid pandemic, we don’t even step out of our homes,” he said. He pointed out that the transport department was supposed to revise the taxi fare chart after discussing the rates with the taxi unions, but the meeting did not take place owing to the pandemic. “They have started the process to fit the meters, warning that if taxi owners do not not comply then their permits will be cancelled. We're not against fitting of meters, but taxi owners should be given more time. We do not know when the tourists will start coming again. The meters are costing more than Rs 11,000, which many can't afford now,” Vengurlekar said, pointing out that many taxi owners have defaulted on payment of their loan amounts. “They should not force us to do this, rather they should extend the time limit for a few more months,” he said. The transport department has begun fitment of digital meters from May 20 and has warned that permits of taxi operators will not be renewed if the meters are not installed||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/defer-digital-meter-fitment-taximen/articleshow/82922448.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Division bench comprising Justice Sandeep Mehta and Justice Devendra Kachhavaha sought reply from the respondents in two weeks. Petitioner Arpit Gupta, an advocate, said in his petition that it was the right of every person to watch court proceedings live with special emphasis on hearings pertaining to Covid. Seeking directions from the court, Gupta argued, “The arguments pertaining to the issue of corona virus in the court and replies by the state government about its efforts have a direct bearing on a common man as a matter of collective concern and it is the right of a common man to witness the proceedings on these matters live in the court.” He further argued that even prior to the pandemic, the court had provisioned to reserve some chairs in the court room for the common people to enable them to watch court proceedings. While advocating the adoption of technology, he said it would help bring some accountability in the functioning of the government. Allowing the petition, the court issued notices to the registrar general of the high court and principal secretary (law) of state government seeking reply in two weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/allow-people-to-hear-covid-related-pleas/articleshow/82922450.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||Small orders leading to longer wait for vax in Nagpur private hospitals||Nagpur: Privatized leg of Covid-19 vaccination is most likely to start in Nagpur from June 1. At least two hospitals will be getting vaccines by then. Many hospitals under Vidarbha Hospital Association (VHA) have applied and placed their orders, mostly to Serum Institute of India for Covishield. One leading heart hospital is in talks with Dr Reddy’s Labs, the Indian company which will manufacture Sputnik V vaccine. Vaccination in private set-up has already started in Mumbai, Thane and Pune. The hospitals include Apollo Hospital, Reliance Hospital, mostly chain corporate hospitals who have placed bulk orders. In Pune too, hospitals got vaccines from SII are big names like Ruby Hall, Sahyadri and Dinananth Mangeshkar. Sources said they too haven’t received the complete order yet, but just one fourth of their order. However, it was enough for these hospitals to distribute doses among their branches and start vaccination. The Covishield vaccine costs Rs850, while Sputnik V costs about Rs1,200 in private set-up. Hospitals in Nagpur are taking cautious steps as they are still not sure whether people will pay this much for vaccines in Vidarbha. “Some hospitals have tied up with corporate companies for mass vaccination. This has ensured 100% utilization of the procured doses. We are also in search of such tie-ups,” said Dr Pinak Dande of Dande Hospitals. Dr Rajkumar Khandelwal of Kingsway Hospitals said their order has already been placed and they are waiting for it to be fulfilled. “We are likely to get the first part of our order by next week. There is no problem to start vaccination once we get the doses. We are constantly in touch with SII officials,” said Dr Khandelwal. Dr Harshwardhan Mardikar of Spandan Hospital told TOI they had invited expression of interest from some companies in Nagpur to check how many of them are interested in getting Sputnik V. “We have received good response. Our talks are under process. But, I can’t reveal the date when vaccines will reach,” said Dr Mardikar. Dr Anup Marar, convener of VHA, said hospitals in Nagpur are small and they can’t place bulk orders like those in Mumbai and Pune. “During vaccination for senior citizens and above 45 phase, we used to get doses from NMC. Similar kind of system should have been in place so that private hospitals can buy doses as per their capacity,” he said. Why delay in Nagpur City hospitals have approached vaccine manufacturers in individual capacity Due to this, orders placed by these hospitals individually are very small in quantity Unlike it, many chain corporate hospitals have placed bulk orders As orders are considerably large, makers are fulfilling a part of it on priority As a result, corporate or chain hospitals have received doses, started vaccination In Nagpur, some hospitals are still waiting for doses; many are yet to approach companies Vaccine prices in private set-up is between Rs850-Rs1,200, so hospitals are sceptical whether they would get buyers in city||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/small-orders-leading-to-longer-wait-for-vax-in-nagpur-private-hospitals/articleshow/82922395.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Speaking to reporters after reviewing Covid treatment and relief arrangements in Azamgarh, the CM said, “Our government is committed to the well-being of every citizen. For us, every life matters. Officials must ensure adequate medical aid and food is provided to every person in need. We never discriminate unlike others and do not believe in serving people selectively.” A couple of days after visiting Saifai, the CM reviewed arrangements in the parliamentary constituency of Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav. The CM said, “We adopted strategy of testing and treatment and have brought down cases from 38,055 in a single day in April to 3,955 today, when people were claiming there would be over one lakh new cases per day after April 25.” “We have been increasing our testing capacity to above 3.26 samples per day from 2.25 lakh till April. Our efforts succeeded in reducing the number of active cases to 76,000 now,” said Yogi. Free Covid vaccination of all above 18 years will begin in all the 75 districts from June 1 and our government is trying to ensure availability of vaccines for the drive, he added.

We created facilities and 4.67 crore people have been tested till now in the state,” the CM added. The positivity rate in the second wave has come down and we have intensified preparations for anticipated third wave. All medical colleges and government hospitals are being equipped to meet challenges, he said.

However, later in the day the allegations were refuted by BJP’s officer bearer in SMC during the general body meeting. Earlier in the morning, AAP put up huge banners at Varachha and Udhna Darwaja against the proposed sale of government land. The banners forced the police and SMC teams to swing into action. The banners were removed and at least five members of AAP were later detained by police in Salabatpura police station. Meanwhile, Dharmesh Bhanderi, leader of opposition in SMC, alleged that the ruling faction has failed in managing the affairs of the corporation. “If SMC is facing a financial crisis they should accept that the officials and officer bearers have failed to manage the corporation effectively. Government land should not be sold to earn money, rather it should be utilized for developing health centres, libraries, gardens or sports complexes,” Bhandari, an AAP leader, said during a press briefing held before the general board meeting of SMC. “We came to know that SMC is preparing to sell five plots, four in the Vesu area and one in Mota Varachha locality. Due to our protest SMC’s elected office bearers clarified in the general board meeting that there is no such plan,” Bhanderi told TOI. Later, SMC’s standing committee chairman Paresh Patel issued a clarification. “The allegations are baseless. There is no such process undertaken by the standing committee till now. Before levelling allegations AAP should produce documentary evidence.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/aap-protests-against-smcs-move-to-sell-government-land/articleshow/82919044.cms||---

A writ petition has been filed by the students seeking directions to be issued to the varsity to upload answer books, score sheets and answer keys of all examinations on the website of the university, ensuring privacy for the benefit of students. The petitioners, BAMS students from the batches of 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016, submitted before the court that they had failed in certain subjects and had to appear for supplementary examinations. The students requested the court to order a revaluation of the answer sheets. “The petitioners have strong apprehension of malafides as far as the conduct of these examinations is concerned and the petitioners believe that if a revaluation is conducted, the scenario may totally be different from what is now and many students will pass papers which they have failed,” said the petition filed through advocate Raghul Sudheesh. The court chaired by Justice Anu Sivaraman heard the petition on May 18 when KUHS, through its counsel P Sreekumar opposed the petition stating that there was no provision for revaluation, and the evaluation was done adhering to the university rules. “KUHS rule does not allow revaluation as they follow a double-valuation policy. Also, a third valuation is there in case there is much variation in marks in double valuation. Students can access the score cards using the available statutory provisions. Uploading all answer sheets, of more than 45,000 students totalling more than 8 lakh papers, is not practical and also involves threat to privacy and secrecy of answer sheets. A detailed statement will be filed before the court soon,” said Sreekumar. The court has decided to post the case for next hearing after two weeks, but the date is not scheduled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/bams-students-allege-irregularities/articleshow/82920785.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Durgadas Kamat, who filed the letter petition, has submitted an additional affidavit before the court and stated that it is the duty of the government under Article 21 of the Constitution to ensure and take steps to maintain uninterrupted supply of oxygen to Covid patients. Kamat said the state government must pay the compensation as the oxygen shortage was directly and solely attributable to the state government. “Thus, on account of such gross remiss, in its duty, the state government is liable to make payment of compensation to all such affected families of Covid patients who died for want of and or shortage of oxygen at GMC.” He also pointed out an order dated May 13 passed by the Karnataka HC on a similar issue.TOI had reported that several patients died due to shortage of oxygen at GMC.

---||Meerut||242 electricity department employees die of Covid-19 in just 2 months in UP, union demands compensation & vaccination||Meerut: A union representing Uttar Pradesh’s electricity department workers on Monday said that at least 242 employees, among them three chief engineers and 12 superintendent engineers, have died due to Covid-19 in the last two months.UP Rajya Vidyut Parishad Abhiyanta Sangh (UPRVPAS) has demanded a compensation of Rs 50lakh for the family members of all the deceased apart from cashless insurance and vaccination of the employees. The union also demanded a halt to the transfer of its general secretary Prabhat Kumar who was “pooling resources” to help the employees of Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Ltd (UPPCL).Union’s president VP Singh told TOI, “Our repeated appeals to the management fell on deaf ears. We do not even have proper medical insurance. And when the association pooled its own resources to help our workers in need, our chairman transferred the main facilitator, the general secretary of the Sangh. We have also asked the energy minister Shrikant Sharma to intervene.” There are 28,000 regular employees in UPPCL and around 40,000 contractual. In the last two months, 2,954 employees contracted the infection.The union also demanded that power corporation employees should be declared frontline workers because they have been maintaining regular power supply during lockdown and were continuously working in the field.Press secretary of the UPRVPAS, Alok Srivastava, said, “We are in public dealing and there is a huge amount of field work involved. Due to this we are highly vulnerable to the ongoing pandemic. In all, 242 deaths have taken place and 1,647 are still Covid-19 positive. Considering the situation we have made certain demands like declaration of all workers and officers of UPPCL as frontline workers, priority in getting vaccination, a compensation of Rs 50lakh to the immediate kin of the dead and cashless medical insurance for all. We also want the transfer of the general secretary of the UPRVPAS to be put on hold at this critical juncture when we all are fighting the pandemic.”When asked about the plan of the strike, Kapil Tewatia, senior vice president of the union, said, “We do not want any inconvenience to people. Hence all work related to maintenance of power supply will continue. We will not be involved in the disconnection process and there will be no revenue collection.“We have given several requests and ultimatums to the management and chairman but nothing has been done yet. We had thought of starting the strike from June 2. But it seems management is in confrontational mode. It has transferred UPRVPAS general secretary Prabhat Kumar who was instrumental in providing much needed help to Covid-19 struck employees through pooling our resources. So we will start the strike from Tuesday.”When contacted, M Devraj, chairman of UPPCL, refuted all the charges. “We are not an autonomous body and work under the state government. We cannot take decisions independently. The state government will take a call on the policy matters, like declaration of employees as frontline Covid-19 workers or cashless medical insurance or compensation in case of death. We have sent the proposal to the state government for it.“Now, as far as the transfer is concerned, the general secretary of the union is not a DISCOM post. He is an employee of UPPCL so he has to get a post and work. You cannot say that you are holding a union post and will not work. For the last one year he has not been given any post. How far is it justified?” the chairman asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/242-electricity-department-employees-die-of-covid-19-in-just-2-months-in-up-union-demands-compensation-vaccination/articleshow/82919046.cms||Sandeep Rai

---||Goa||Goa: Colva beach beautification work bears brunt of Tauktae||COLVA: While cyclone Tauktae inflicted wide-spread damage across the state, at Colva beach, the recent beautification and developmental work undertaken has fallen victim to its rage. Several electrical poles are lying uprooted, while lamps on many of the poles have disappeared. The gazebos placed on the beach too have suffered damage. While these ornamental poles tend to get ripped up in stormy weather every year, this time around, the damage has been caused even before the monsoon begins. The beautification work commenced in 2018 and till date, nearly Rs 11.7 crore has been spent on works such as beautification of the road and the existing island, landscaping, illumination and construction of pathways, drainage systems, toilet blocks with changing rooms, four-wheeler parking facility for 80 vehicles and two-wheeler parking provision for 327 vehicles, 54 parking slots for public vehicles and play equipment for the children’s play area. The entire project is funded jointly by the state and central government under the Swadesh Darshan Scheme on 40:60 basis. In 2020, seven gazebos made of steel and fibre reinforced plastic (FRP) were installed, six at Colva and one at Sernabatim beach. Claiming that the gazebos were ideally suited to Goan weather conditions, GTDC officials had at that time claimed that they could withstand all weather conditions. However, in August itself the lone gazebo at Sernabatim beach and four at Colva beach were damaged due to inclement weather after which they were dismantled for repairs. The one at Sernabatim beach was never re-installed and at Colva, from a total of six, only four gazebos remained. Stating that man is helpless before nature, Goa Tourism Development Corporation managing director Nikhil Desai said that a detailed report of the damage has already been submitted to the government. Further, he said repairs will be undertaken in the due course of time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/colva-beach-beautification-work-bears-brunt-of-tauktae/articleshow/82922462.cms||---

According to police, one Mehmood was gunned down by unidentified assailants in Saharanpur district on February 22. In the absence of clear motive and suspects, a baffled local police struggled to get leads for some time before they made a breakthrough and arrested three suspects, including Inaam Ali, the victim’s son, for the murder. The murder was a fallout of an ongoing property dispute in the family. “Inaam, inspired by crime shows on TV, along with his cousin and uncle made two or three abortive attempts before succeeding to kill his father,” said a police officer. Inaam even tried to mislead the police by telling his relatives that he had lost his mobile phone and was out of the city when the murder took place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/son-held-for-mans-murder-in-saharanpur/articleshow/82919050.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Congress stalls BDD chawls’ survey||MUMBAI: It was Shiv Sena-BJP on one side and Congress on the other, as Mhada, along with the deputy collector (encroachment), with a huge posse of policemen set out to carry an eligibility survey at Naigaum BDD chawls on Monday. Sena MP (south central Mumbai) Rahul Shewale and BJP MLA Kalidas Kolambhkar arrived to ensure it was carried out. After nearly three years an eligibility survey was being attempted there. Mhada’s failure to carry out the survey, shift tenants and hand over land to its contractor, Larsen & Toubro, for construction had resulted in the company withdrawing from the project, but it was convinced to stay on. A senior Mhada official said local Congress has been opposing the redevelopment, demanding that the GR allowing redevelopment under section 33(9)(b) of Development Control and Promotion Regulations (2034) be first amended to allow permanent resident agreements for eligible tenants. Congress leader Raju Waghmare said it was wrong of Mhada to carry out the survey during lockdown. “I told Shewale every building has 500-700 residents. They would have to line up outside for the survey and interact with officials and police. It could turn into a Covid super spreader. Shewale agreed, and it was decided not to have the survey,” he said. Mhada had planned to do the survey on May 24-25. Shewale said the CM agreed to the permanent agreement and a revised GR will be issued soon. “PWD has the documents. It will carry out the survey. Mhada and the collector’s department are not required to do it now,” he said. Kolambhkar said Congress was keen to hand over redevelopment to a private contractor but BJP is firm it must be done by government under Mhada’s supervision. Waghmare said government must decide on eligibility of those who purchased the tenements post-1996 and have no proof prior.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cong-stalls-bdd-chawls-survey/articleshow/82922637.cms||Clara Lewis
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan high court quashes single bench order on cop recruitment||JAIPUR: The division bench of the high court has quashed the single bench order asking the police to make a state-wise merit list instead of separate merit lists for different districts for recruitment of constables, 2019. The government had appealed against the single bench order. The division bench of the court now quashed and set aside the single bench order, clearing the way for constable recruitment. Advocate general M S Singhvi appearing for the government argued that each district is treated as a unit for the service of constable and it is nota state-level service. The appointment authority in each district is the district superintendent of police (SP). He argued that the state-level exam was held for the convenience of the candidates and for maintaining some uniformity. He said in the application form also, the candidates were asked for their choice of district for postings. Singhvi pointed out that the Supreme Court had also held that the constables and head constables appointment be made at the district level and the single bench order is contrary to the apex court order. The single bench of the court had issued the order of district-wise merit list and appointment based on a single merit list on a petition by Jaheer Ahamad. The petitioner said the selection for the post of constable is done by issuing a common advertisement for all districts. The vacancies for various districts are also mentioned in the advertisement and a common test was conducted for all the candidates. But when the merit list is prepared, the same is prepared district-wise resulting in discrimination between the similarly situated candidates as the cut-off marks for various categories are given differently for different districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/hc-quashes-single-bench-order-on-cop-recruitment/articleshow/82922475.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Three vessels rescued from Cyclone Tauktae fury||AHMEDABAD: Averting a P-305-like tragedy in which 75 lives were lost after it capsized in the Arabian Sea hours after cyclone Tauktae hit the Mumbai coast on May 17, the Indian Navy, Coast Guard and ONGC successfully rescued three vessels that had drifted off Mumbai and reached Gulf of Khambhat. There were about 330 crew members on board drilling ship Sagar Bhushan, barge Support Station 3, and storage tanker Desh Bhakt. Sagar Bhushan was drifting in the northern direction with speed of four knots. ONGC’s self-propelled rig, carrying 101 personnel, had been anchored off Mumbai shore. However, strong winds caused by cyclone Tauktae broke the vessel loose from its eight anchors, and also damaged the rudder. “Sagar Bhushan was dangerously close to land. A flat-bottomed ship, it had no power to propel and could have broken in two had it been grounded. It was a dramatic moment with the sea getting rough and the area engulfed in darkness. In the nick of time, we controlled the operations and brought her to the safety of Mumbai harbour,” said a senior defence official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The option of taking the ship to nearby Pipavav Port was ruled out as the area was badly hit by the cyclone. He said that unlike in the case of Barge P-305, where a collision had ripped a hole, the three vessels in Gujarat were in a much safer position. Gujarat Maritime Board was also a part of the rescue operation with Captain Ashwin Solanki, the chief nautical officer, tracking the vessels from the control room and co-ordinating with the concerned agencies. Tugboat Triton Liberty from Mumbai High was towing accommodation barge Support Station 3 (SS03). The cyclone led to flooding in the steering gear platform of Triton Liberty even as SS03, with 202 personnel on board, continued to drift towards Gulf of Khambhat. In all, ONGC dispatched about eight crafts to carry out rescue operations in Gujarat. On May 18, INS Talwar reached SS03 and tried to transfer crew members using a life raft. However strong winds and rough seas prevented this. Eventually, tugboats were used to tow it to Mumbai. Both the vessels passed through Tapti oil field and any major accident could have led to oil spill in the area, said a GMB official. The crafts dispatched by ONGC included tugboats Cheel, Great Ship Anjali, SCI Urja, Ababeel and MSV Samudra Sevak, among others. “ONGC vessels, along with the Indian Navy, were part of the search-and-rescue operations till the end,” said an ONGC official. Another vessel Desh Bhakt, a storage tanker by Shipping Corporation of India (SCI) at Panna Oilfield off Mumbai, had parted from the anchor chains and was drifting towards Gulf of Khambhat on May 17. It lost all communications with SCI. The vessel reached Mumbai safely on May 18 with the assistance from the GMB and Indian Coast Guard. “There were times when these ships were in danger of capsizing mid-sea. It felt that abandoning the vessel was the only way to save the crew members. But the Indian Navy felt it would be premature to do so,” said the defence personnel. ONGC has 342 offshore installations with 243 of them being fixed, unmanned platforms that can’t move but can be secured. The 99 manned installations include barges, vessels and rigs, among others. Of these, 94 had moved to safer shelters after advisory from the government about the approaching storm. Of the 7,665 people working offshore, 6,700 had moved to safer zones and were safe except for those on 3-4 barges and tugboats,” said sources in ONGC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/3-vessels-rescued-from-tauktae-fury/articleshow/82920800.cms||Maulik Pathak

The toll increased to 117 by May 24. In the past one week, 59 Covid patients succumbed to the infection and the toll in the past 48 hours was 18. The number of Covid-19 positive cases started increasing in the district on April 1. In the first 15 days of the month, only six deaths of Covid-19 patients were reported. In the second half of April, the toll increased to 84. The records show that on April 30, a maximum number of people at 893 had tested Covid-19 positive in the district. The maximum number of deaths in a span of 24 hours was recorded on April 27 and May 23 respectively at 11. On May 1, a total of 649 people tested Covid-19 positive in the district. After this, the sample positivity rate started decreasing in the district with just 49 cases reported on Sunday and 30 on Monday. However, the period has seen the number of fatalities increasing. On May 20, the district health department reported the death of 10 Covid-19 patients. Nine deaths were recorded on May 21, and the same number on May 22, 11 on May 23 and seven on May 24. As compared to 91 deaths reported in the month of April, the number of fatalities in the first 24 days of May reached 117. Prior to the second wave of Covid-19, 117 people had died of the infection in about 12 months from March 3, 2020 to March 30, 2021, health officials said. Dr RC Pandey, chief medical officer of Agra district, said, “The fatality rate in the second wave of Covid-19 has been higher as compared to the first wave. A majority of the Covid-19 patients who died were suffering from comorbidity. In several cases, patients reported late and were in a critical condition by the time they were admitted to hospital. We have all the required arrangements to ensure patients get adequate treatment. More than 95% of Covid-19 patients have recovered from the infection.” While it may not be easy to officially account for all the Covid-related deaths, there has been a whopping 11-time increase in the number of death certificates issued by the civic body in Agra city alone. Last year, 86 death certificates were issued in April. In the corresponding period this year, 995 certificates were issued. Besides, at the birth and death registration office in Agra, around 35 applications are being received daily. According to the Tajganj crematorium management, at least 1,700 cremations were conducted in April, which is over three times the average.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/in-24-days-covid-cases-dip-fatality-rate-increases-in-agra-district/articleshow/82919030.cms||---

The police have arrested Jammu and Kashmir-based Mukhtar Shaikh along with one Shankar Gowda from Beed and Pune, respectively. The police have also recovered liquor bottles worth Rs 23.33 lakh out of 26.8 lakh-worth bottles that were allegedly stolen on May 9 from the Rajasthan Liquors godown at Shinde village, in the Nashik Road area. “Both our crime units worked together to solve the case and arrested Shaikh — a convicted criminal from Jammu and Kashmir — along with another person. There were no clues about who was behind the dacoity, yet our teams recovered the materials. Moreover, the police teams spent four hours time-checking more than 200 vehicles between Beed and Ahmednagar to catch Shaikh, whose identity was initially not known,” commissioner of police Deepak Pandey said. Vasant Khatile, the assistant police inspector of crime unit 1 who led the investigations, said: “A very unclear image of a truck and a vehicle in a CCTV footage from the Jaigaon village, off Nashik-Pune highway, at odd times, possibly to avoid the toll plaza, led us to the toll plaza near Sangamner where we finally spotted the vehicle.” The police then tracked the vehicle to the agriculture produce market committee in Navi Mumbai. The driver of the vehicle said that his truck, booked for bringing goods from Nashik, was taken to Male village in Mulshi taluka after which, it was released. The police reached the village where they set a trap to arrest Shankar Gowda, a person with criminal background who hails from Karnataka. The police learnt that the goods were taken to Beed to be disposed. The crime unit 2 sleuths were then alerted. They then rushed to the town. “We relied on mobile number and technical support to track down the accused whose face was not known to us. When we were just about to reach Beed, we were told that the suspect was on the move — possibly to Aurangabad or even to Mumbai via Ahmednagar. We tracked the mobile that was switched on and off at regular intervals. We also stopped over 200 vehicles including cars, trucks and buses to look for the suspect,” Mahesh Kulkarni, an assistant police inspector, said. “We dialed our phone number from the phone of every passenger on a tourist bus and finally one matched our search. We caught the accused, who eventually revealed his plans. We took him to Beed and recovered the liquor bottles, along with the truck and two private cars, used in the case, from him,” the police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/cops-crack-liquor-dacoity-case-recover-bottles-worth-rs-23l/articleshow/82916096.cms||Abhilash Botekar

The cyclone left many boats damaged. The jetty faced losses due to stormy weather in the past few days,” D’Souza said. He said the fishing business in Vasco was already affected due to the pandemic, and towards the end, it was hit by the cyclone. D’Souza said the fishing season ends on June 1, but due to the weather conditions and damages to the boats, the boat operators had to end the season early. “This is the time we can earn profit, but unfortunately we had wind up. Also, the boat owners send their workforce to their native states by arranging special buses,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/give-financial-aid-to-vasco-fishing-boat-operators/articleshow/82922543.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The barge sank around 70 km off Mumbai on May 17 in the wake of cyclone Tauktae. On Monday, INS Makar, along with INS Tarasa, returned to the harbour while INS Subhadra will continue patrolling. The Navy has now handed over the search operation to the Coast Guard. The diving team of INS Makar did not find any personnel stuck inside the four-storey accommodation barge P-305 and also did not find anyone on the tugboat on Monday before the ship sailed to the harbour. As per the missing persons record, the Navy has recovered 70 bodies of P-305 personnel. They are still trying to find out how eight bodies floated towards the southern direction and were located in Raigad district while eight were spotted at Valsad, to the north. A body found in Daman was identified as that of Saddam Hussain Ejaz Ahmed (29), a crew member of Varaprada. Ahmed’s brother identified the body. Most of the seven bodies found in Valsad could be of Varaprada’s crew. “According to the 86 missing personnel record (75 from P-305 and 11 from tugboat), many have been identified despite some bodies being recovered in a decomposed state. There are many yet to be identified, and a DNA test will be an option,” said a Navy official. The official said officially they have not concluded the operation as INS Subhadra is patrolling the area. The Gujarat police informed their counterparts in Mumbai that the relatives were approaching them and were in the process of identifying the bodies. “The bodies will be handed over to relatives, once identified in Gujarat. Three bodies of Varaprada crew members have been identified, and identification of eight is underway. The tug had 13 crew members when it sank. While two were saved by INS Kolkata, 11 others went missing,” said the police. Yellow Gate police senior inspector Suhas Hemade said at JJ Hospital, 70 bodies of P305 had been brought till Monday evening. While 49 bodies were identified and handed over to families, 21 are still unidentified. Meanwhile, three youths from Nadia who were part of the catering crew on board P-305 are among those missing. Their kin are on way to Mumbai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-6-navy-ships-back-cg-to-continue-search/articleshow/82922650.cms||Mateen Hafeez

The idols were removed from the temples with "full honour", officials said. But, Bairagi seers condemned the action and asked the government to restore the temples. A few days ago, a temple and residential structures of Bairagi seers were demolished. These temples were reportedly constructed in 2010 during the Kumbh Mela by Bairagi akhadas, but an order came from court to remove these structures. However, the district administration requested to give some time as Kumbh was going on. Bairagi akhadas made Sant Niwas during the Kumbh Mela despite restriction, but after the end of Kumbh Mela 2021, the administration started a drive against "illegal encroachment". SDM Gopal Singh Chauhan told TOI, “Three temple structures were removed from the Bairagi camps with the consent of seers along with the other illegal structures.” President of Nirmohi akhada Sri Mahant Rajendra Das said, “The removal of temples in the name of encroachment is unacceptable and the government should restore them as soon as possible. The district administration did not take any action against other encroachments in the camp due to political pressure.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/anti-encroachment-drive-3-temples-removed-from-bairagi-camp/articleshow/82919139.cms||MS Nawaz

The cyclonic winds at 90kmph on May 15-16 had destroyed 40 poles in the jurisdiction of the Benaulim sub-station and 38 in Carmona. Power was temporarily restored in the coastal villages of Salcete within 48 hours. Engineers of both the sub-stations had earlier said that the fragile condition of the temporary system will not be able to withstand the winds during the monsoon and hence new poles have to be erected and cables drawn. On Monday, men and machinery were seen at work on a war-footing in these villages to complete the work before the monsoon starts. Junior engineer Govind Bhat said that new poles have been placed wherever the old ones need to be changed and the department has provided an additional workforce of 35 men and machinery to carry out the work. Bhat said that he is confident that they will complete it before the onset of monsoon. Officials had said the priority is to replace poles and transmission lines in low-lying areas and fields.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/work-to-replace-salcetes-damaged-power-infra-begins/articleshow/82922510.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Sanjai Kumar, chief human resources officer at VPS Healthcare, said the group has selected eligible candidates through a special interview conducted recently. “We have given special consideration to eligible healthcare workers who have been trapped for a long time and facing financial issues. Forty-one health workers who have completed the process have already joined the hospitals under VPS Healthcare,” he said. The healthcare workers who do not have a valid medical licence will be joining as patient aide/service assistant.

One such noble step has been taken by the Maharishi Patanjali Vidya Mandir (MPVM) group of institutions of the city. The school management, which runs four eminent schools in the city having an overall strength of over 7,000 students, have decided that the fee of such students would be waived off for the entire study period. “What has happened with such a student is unfortunate. We can’t be insensitive at a time when some families have lost their earning member. We have decided that the fee of any student, enrolled in any of the four schools of the group and losing the only earning member of the family, shall be waived off for the entire duration of his or her studies in our schools,” said secretary of MPVM group, Krishna Mishra. Likewise, another noted English medium school of the city, St Joseph Schools and College has decided to waive off the fee of students who have lost the earning member of the family in the coronavirus pandemic. The school administration said, “In order to lessen the damage done to the families of our students due to Covid deaths, the college will waive off for one year the entire fees of the students who have lost either their mother or father this year. And if any student has lost both the parents this year, the college will waive off his/her entire tuition fees for the next three academic years in our college. Thereafter, the situation will be reviewed for continuing assistance, so that his studies in our college are not affected.” Moving a step further, the Jaiswal Group of educational institutions, having schools and colleges in rural areas of the district, has decided that the entire education of such kids, from kindergarten (KG) to Post Graduation (PG), would be free. The group has two colleges affiliated to Prof Rajendra Singh (Rajju Bhaiya) State University of Prayagraj. Students helped by the group would complete the studies at Ramdulari Bachhu Lal Jaiswal College at Nawabganj and Mevallal Jaiswal PG College at Nindura, Lalgopalganj. Manager Laxmi Narayan Jaiswal and founder Rakesh Jaiswal said, “Many people have died in the Corona pandemic and our hearts go out for such families. We cannot bring back those who have left the families, but at least our meagre help would ensure that studies of kids of the affected families are not hindered because of financial issues.” “It was then decided that children who lost their parents from Corona would be given free education, from KG to PG,” they added. This group has been doing social service for the past several years and providing free education to poor female students is one such service.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/schools-offer-free-education-to-students-losing-parents-to-covid/articleshow/82922612.cms||---

In case of LMO tankers unable to reach us due to uprooting of trees, a full tank will last us about three days. But we have also have kept our manifold system via jumbo cylinders ready as an exigency plan,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. Even as super cyclone Amphan had caused major power and transport disruption last May, hospitals at that time did not have half of the number of Covid patients they currently have. And 80 to 90% of patients are on oxygen support in hospitals. “Two LMO tanks amounting to 12000 KL will be full as usual which will last us for 48 hours based on the current consumption. Oxygen vendors have also assured of supply. Medical oxygen control room organised by the state government will also be functional 24x7 for any assistance,” said R Venkatesh, zonal director (east) of Narayana Health. The state health department during a meeting on Monday told all hospitals to remain prepared with its exigency plans. “We have arranged sufficient supply of oxygen particularly for Covid wards in our three units in the city,” Rupak Barua, group CEO of AMRI Hospitals. “Due to high consumption, our LMO tanker will see us through one and half day. But we have been told that an LMO tanker will be in the vicinity,” said Simmardeep Gill, COO of CK Birla Hospitals. “Our LMO tank can store 2800 cubic metres against our daily requirement of 750 cubic metres. But we have kept all our 30 D-type cylinders filled up and have requisitioned for 15 more,” said Rupali Basu, MD and CEO Woodlands Hospitals. Since the LMO is delivered through pipelines for which power supply is required all hospitals have kept their power generators ready.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/o2-tanks-full-cylinders-in-stock-cov-hosps-try-to-keep-supply-flowing-during-cyclone/articleshow/82920836.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Records show that at the time of the accident, the deceased was working as sales representative. The judge observed that the insurance policy premium was paid only for the paid driver. The appellant was fully aware of the fact had permitted him to drive, which amounted to violation of policy conditions. The judge said that the tribunal has correctly come to the conclusion that the insurance company is not liable to pay the compensation.

He was not just compelled to dig into his savings but also sold off two of his cars to meet operating expenditures. “Over the past 14-15 months, business has hardly been there and meeting with expenses of driver salaries, car insurance and maintenance and others is not possible. So I opened a grocery store and so far it has been a decent start,” said Paresh. Barely 1% of the cab owners’ fleets are currently utilized, according to estimates by the Gujarat Luxury Cab Owners’ Association (GLCOA), and consequently. With lack of business due to travel and tourism getting hampered after the second wave, and an extremely slow recovery in the first half, rental cab company owners are grappling for revenues amid piling overhead costs. This has compelled many to foray into other businesses. Most are getting into the business of essential commodities so that there is a guaranteed income and few losses. Pinkal Shah, a city-based travel company owner has sold off 30 cars out of a fleet of 75 as he is unable to meet operating costs. “I joined as a partner with a friend at an organic Ayurvedic store some three months ago and recently I also started a workshop for servicing four wheelers. With business of car rentals taking a hit for 15 months straight and a lot of uncertainty over its revival in months to come, I decided to foray into a business which will give me sure shot returns,” Shah said. The situation is so bad for some of the players that they’re unable to repay gold loans they’d taken to meet operating expenditures. Most people are preferring businesses that are not capital-intensive and in segments where a sustained demand will prevail. Amit Shah, owner of a cab and car rental company, already had a franchise of a baby products store alongside his business. He decided to focus his resources on the new business and expanded there. “We took up two more franchises. Baby products will not go out of demand irrespective of the time and therefore, I decided to focus more on this business. Our drivers are out of work but we’re managing to pay them so far. We also deploy them for ferrying goods for our store. We don’t know when the tourism business will recover and as a consequence, we chose avenues where margins may be less but the business is not capital intensive.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rough-ride-cab-rental-companies-downsize-fleets-turn-to-other-businesses/articleshow/82922747.cms||Niyati Parikh

The case involved the death of a woman after the two-wheeler on which she rode pillion with her husband skidded in Thanjavur district in August 2013.Selvam and his wife Pushpalatha were travelling on the bike near Poonayiruppu village when a cow crossed the road. When he applied the brake, the vehicle skidded and they fell down. While both of them sustained injuries, Pushpalatha died at the hospital the same day. Selvam and his daughters moved the Thanjavur motor accidents claims tribunal seeking compensation. The tribunal passed an order in 2015 directing the insurance company to pay Rs 8.02lakh compensation holding that there was no negligence on the part of Selvam who rode the two-wheeler. Challenging the order, the insurance company filed the present civil miscellaneous appeal before HC Madurai bench.Justice K Murali Shankar observed that in a claim under Section 166 of the Act, it is compulsory to show that someone is guilty of negligent driving and then only, the owner of the offending vehicle can be made liable. In the case on hand, there is no evidence to show that the negligent driving of the offending vehicle was responsible for the accident. The insurance company had submitted before the tribunal that Selvam did not have a driving licence and paid a fine for the same before the trial court. The judge observed as to what more evidence or materials are necessary to show that the insurance policy condition has been violated. The judge observed that the claimants are only entitled to get compensation under Section 140 of the Act which says that in the event of death or permanent disablement of any person resulting from motor vehicle accidents, the owner of the vehicle is liable to pay Rs 50,000 in case of deaths and Rs 25,000 in case of permanent disability. Thus, the judge set aside the tribunal award and directed the insurer to pay Rs 50,000 to the family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-cuts-accident-relief-from-rs-8l-to-rs-50000/articleshow/82922659.cms||Kaushik Kannan

For the last couple of days, the supply line worked overnight to build a reasonable stock in each grocery shop to sustain a couple of days in case of emergency. “Last year, after the city was hit by Amphan, the supply line got affected in some parts of the city with the civic body taking more than 24 hours to clear roads off the uprooted trees,” said Animesh Dasgupta, a manager with a FMCG distribution network. The state administration also allowed the supply line to work round the clock. “We spoke to local police authorities and opened shops just to stock up things as and when the supply came to our doorsteps. This will definitely help us to tide over a supply crisis, if the cyclone hits us badly,” said Himanshu Roy, secretary, South Suburban Grocery Traders’ Association. Potatoes, onions, candles, eggs, bread and biscuits sold like hot cake across city markets and grocery stores on Monday as people scrambled to stock up for the next three to four days, fearing the cyclone Yaas may throw life out of gear. Markets and grocery stores as well as superstores remained crowded during the permitted hours in the morning. Online delivery too buzzed throughout the day. Fifty four year old Akash Bhatia, a resident of Gariahat went to Gariahat Market to stock up for rice, flour, biscuits, onions, potatoes, vegetables and fruits for the next one week. Since the nearby EC Market in Salt Lake was shut, Luna Bhowmick, resident of the same block, got her vegetable stocks from Muchibazar. Jadu Babu Bazar teemed with people in the morning. There were many who returned home looking at the crowd and then sent retainers to bring the items home. “I have completed my monthly shopping in advance. At other times I would have waited for the month to end but one doesn’t know what kind of disruptions we are in for,” said Vineeta Agrawal, an investment banker and resident of Gulmohar Apartments at Chakraberia Lane. Soumi Sinha, a PR executive who lives in Phoolbagan was slightly late in reaching the market and found that candles had stocked out. Fashion designer Sumona Koner found stocks of her favourire koi maach over at Lansdowne Market and had to stay content with magur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/retail-markets-store-essentials-to-preempt-post-cyclone-crisis/articleshow/82920845.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Surat||Gujarat: Man ties wife, her ‘paramour’ to pole; thrashes them||SURAT: A video of a man believed to be from an interior village of Valsad district beating his wife and her alleged paramour was widely circulated on social media on Sunday. The man, a casual labourer, was detained as a preventive measure after his wife complained to police and was later released on bail by an executive magistrate. Police said that the man had suspicion that his wife was having an extra-marital affair due to which she went to live with her mother at Kajli village. However, before leaving she had challenged her husband that if he had suspicion then he should be able to prove it by catching her red-handed. Since then, the labourer was keeping an eye on his wife. On Sunday, when his wife called her alleged paramour to meet her, her husband reached there and found them in a ‘compromising position. The angered husband dragged his wife and the paramour out of the house and tied them to a pole. He mercilessly beat them until villagers intervened. A few locals recorded the video of the violence on their mobile phones and circulated it on WhatsApp. When police learnt about the video, they called the woman’s paramour to the police station and asked him to lodge a complaint. “We asked the man to lodge a complaint so that we can take an action, but he refused saying that he had made a mistake by going to meet the woman,” said sub-inspector R J Gamit of Nanapondha police station. The woman gave an application to the police but insisted on not lodging an FIR. “She gave the complaint before we got to know about the video, so we detained him as a preventive measure,” Gamit said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/man-ties-wife-her-paramour-to-pole-thrashes-them/articleshow/82919270.cms||---

At present, a chunk of the term-end marks are contributed by the semester examination and even in courses with a practical component, the marks attributed to practicals are mostly less than theory. SPPU may look at using the continuous comprehensive evaluation pattern where students will be marked based on the homework, projects or assignments with just 10-20% marks attributed to the semester examinations. “In the last Board of Examination meeting, a committee was set up by the university to look into the merits and demerits of this system and the best way forward to implement the pattern for the university. Once the feasibility and recommendations of the report are checked, the plan will be considered. I am also looking at various assessment systems adopted by institutions in India and abroad and talking to experts and educators globally to understand the nuances of such a system,” vice-chancellor Nitin Karmalkar said. Karmalkar said after their experience of online exams, they have realised the need for something more to analyse the cognitive and critical thinking capacity of a student. Thousands of pupils pursuing various courses in the university have been taking exams online this year .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/online-exam-kindles-ideas-on-continuous-assessment/articleshow/82920865.cms||Ardhra Nair

Only those into essential services, construction activities and to industries which were exempted besides those who wanted to be vaccinated came out. Police teams deployed at important junctions and stretches checked unnecessary movement. While a few vehicles were seen out in the morning, most roads were deserted in the afternoon. Trichy city police impounded more than 450 vehicles of those who ventured out without any genuine reason. Around 100 people who were spotted violating social distancing norms and commuting without face masks were booked. The police have established checkpoints at 50 spots across the city to screen people moving on roads. Residential roads and commercial streets in Big Bazaar street saw movement of two-wheelers. NGOs continued their free food distribution drive for the homeless after obtaining permission from the authorities. A police officer from Anna Nagar range in Madurai said, “Only those going to funerals are allowed. People involved in essential works are allowed after showing their identity card or permission letter.” DCP (traffic) Madurai city K Sugumaran said cases are being registered against those violating lockdown rules. DCP (law and order), R Shiva Prasad started aerial survey of vehicular movements using a drone at Palanganatham roundabout.

Crime branch officers said that accused Amar Solanki, 34, resident of Lakshminiwas Flats in Narol, was caught from his native village Chanpar in Muli taluka of Surendranagar district. Officers said that Solanki had approached various traders on behalf of the accused police inspector Geeta Pathan when those traders came at Women’s (east) police station in Ahmedabad city where the gang members used to file fake rape complaints. Solanki used to scare the traders saying that they would be sent behind bars for their entire life and if they wanted to avoid any legal action, then they should pay money to Pathan. Many traders scared with Solanki’s remarks paid money to Pathan. Solanki was earlier caught in two cases of cheating and extortion in Vatva GIDC police in 2014 and was slapped with PASA (prevention of anti-social activities) act and sent to Vadoadara jail in 2014. The case came to surface when at least five traders approached crime branch last year alleging that Pathan and four others were running an extortion racket where they scare people with false rape complaints and then extort money. Crime branch on May 13 arrested Pathan, who was serving in Patan district. Pathan used to serve as an inspector at Sabarmati riverfront (east) and women’s police stations in Ahmedabad. A crime branch officer said that when she was serving in the city earlier this year, Pathan had allegedly helped the gang extort at least Rs 26.55 lakh from five traders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/honey-trap-case-former-female-pis-aide-nabbed/articleshow/82922739.cms||---

---||Madurai||Child protection officers call for longer contracts||Madurai: District Child Protection Officers (DCPO) on contract and team working under the District Child Protection Unit (DCPU) have urged the government to execute longer contracts as specified by Integrated Child Protection Scheme (ICPS) under the ministry of women and child development.According to the ICPS guidelines, DCPOs and teams working under the officials have to be appointed on a three-year contract, which can be extended by two years on satisfactory completion of tenure. In all, 16 districts have DCPOs on contract, while the posts in other districts are handled by government officials. Each DCPO has a team of 11 employees — three protection officers, two each social workers and outreach workers, a counsellor, data entry operator, data analyst and an accountant. The monthly salary of the employees ranges between Rs 8,000 and 21,000, without PF or leave benefits.DCPOs and other employees say they are engaged in contracts for only six months or one year in violation of the guidelines. This leaves them at the mercy of their higher officials every time the contract period ends, affecting their focus on job. R Raju, 40, a protection officer in Theni district DCPU since 2012, ended his life on Friday allegedly because his contract was not renewed. The district administration had called for fresh applications. He approached the high court and got directions to stop the recruitment. However, colleagues claimed he took the extreme step as he was not given an extension. An official of Madurai DCPU said that many others like Raju have put in several years of work and crossed 40 years. It would be difficult for them to look for other jobs after this age. A DCPO on contract, who didn’t want to be identified, said, “Renewal of contract is completely the discretion of the officials and there is no proper evaluation. While we are relentlessly working during the Covid times risking our lives, our family will not get a pie if something happens to us.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/child-protection-officers-call-for-longer-contracts/articleshow/82922701.cms||V Devanathan
---||Mumbai||Citizens replant fallen trees as BMC struggles to clear debris||MUMBAI: With the BMC still struggling to remove the fallen trees and branches blocking city roads a week after Cyclone Tauktae, a few Mumbaikars have decided to save the city’s green cover. They are either transplanting the trees on the same spot if the roots are intact or translocating them. “There are challenges involved in planting a tree back, like ensuring that it is pruned and balanced well,” said Andheri resident Marc Francis of Vata Foundation. “And if a tree is translocated, care has to be taken to ensure it survives.” Last week, Francis transplanted three trees in Goregaon and translocated one on an open ground. On Monday, he tried to transplant a from 15th Road in Bandra to the Reclamation area. “Everything is done with BMC permission. But hiring hydraulic machines is costly, so we have requested locals to adopt trees and help in translocation,” Francis said. In Juhu, corporator Renu Hansraj and her society members decided to save a 50-year-old tree that had fallen on the premises on finding the tertiary roots intact. “We approached a specialist who helped transplant the tree. We used adequate manure and fertiliser for it to survive,” she added. Sanjiv Valsan from Save Aarey Movement said: “Our biggest challenge is to first ens-ure that the BMC does not chop up the fallen trees. In Aarey, the maximum trees that crashed were non-native, so our focus now is to plant native trees.” However, several bylanes in the suburbs, especially Bandra, Chembur and Goregaon, are littered with tree debris. A senior BMC official said that an unprecedented number of trees were rooted out in a single day by the cyclone. “While major roads have been cleared, we will try and clear internal roads in the next two days. There was a difficulty in getting labourers to pick up the debris,” the official said. In Bandra (W), tree debris continue to block roads, including Carter Road, Chimbai Road, St John the Baptist Road, Kantwadi Road and Perry Road. Bandra resident Reema Gehi said it has been a week since she lodged a complaint with the BMC about the uprooted trees outside her building by dialling ‘1916’. “Initially, I assumed the BMC must be stretched given the pandemic situation, but it’s been a week now. It has become a dumping spot now,” she said. But local corporator Asif Zakeria said the BMC is facing practical difficulties. “The quantum of green cover lost is so huge that the BMC is struggling. In Bandra, other civic departments, like maintenance and the solid waste, are helping the garden department work through the nights clearing the roads,” he said. In Goregaon, corporator Srikala Pillai complained that the road near Siddhartha Municipal General Hospital is still blocked by uprooted trees. Similar scenes are seen on road numbers 6, 7 and D K Sandu Marg in Chembur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-citizens-replant-fallen-trees-as-bmc-struggles-to-clear-debris/articleshow/82924695.cms||Richa Pinto

More than 250 volunteers were roped in to distribute the vegetables in Madurai.The civic body struck a deal with the traders from Paravai vegetable market and came up with an assorted vegetable bag worth Rs100 each. Each bag has 10 varieties of vegetables such as onion, tomato, chili, broad beans, chow chow, ladies finger, coconut, potato, brinjal and curry leaves. Corporation commissioner S Visakan inspected the delivery at a few places. He said 125 vehicles have been engaged in selling vegetables. The number of vehicles will be increased according to the demand. As the officials need more volunteers, those interested can send a message to 8428425000, he said.P Vijayan, a resident of Melamadai said many would want to buy fruits and the civic body should take measures to sell affordable fruits like papaya, mangoes and sweet lime. The horticulture department also distributed vegetables in rural areas. Madurai district collector Aneesh Sekhar inspected the distribution.In Trichy, the horticulture department has fixed a uniform price list to be followed by the retail traders in the district. There were adequate vehicles to cover the residential streets in Trichy city, but in the suburban and rural areas the numbers were low. “As we have bought vegetables in bulk on Sunday, we are in no immediate need of vegetables. But we have not seen any sellers in our vicinity. Officials should take care of panchayats and municipalities too,” P Aiyarappan, a resident of Allur, said. The sales in Trichy will be coordinated by stakeholders including horticulture, agriculture business and Trichy Corporation. In the city, five vehicles were allowed to each of the 65 wards. Officials said that the residents can collect the contact number of the vendors, and can contact them in case. Official sources said that a total of 800 vehicles were given permission for the sales across the district. “We will sanction travel passes for additional vehicles if there is a need. Vegetable sellers in Kodaikanal were contacted to procure hill vegetables for a cheap price,” P Vimala, deputy director, horticulture department, said. Officials said they have planned to add more vehicles between 6 am and 12 pm. Trichy Corporation has also planned to arrange coordinators for every ward to support groceries through home delivery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/doorstep-vegetable-sales-on-in-cities/articleshow/82922744.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Van Rawats, a tribe in U’khand hills virtually cut off from society, have no means to get vaccinated||Pithoragarh: Members of Van Rawat, regarded as Uttarakhand’s smallest Himalayan tribe, are yet to get benefits of the vaccination drive. The Van Rawat tribe has a total population of 650 and all of them are below poverty level. The small primitive tribe is based in three development blocks of Pithoragarh district - Dharchula, Didihat and Kanalichina. According to NGOs working for their welfare, 95% of the Van Rawat population do not own cell phones and not a single member owns a smart phone. Van Rawats speak a language of their own, which is different from both Kumaoni and Hindi. According to Khema Jethi, a volunteer of Arpan NGO, which works for upliftment of the Van Rawat tribals, they have a faint idea of “a disease that has closed all shops down and reduced their employment opportunities, but they have no idea of what the coronavirus or the pandemic is”. Most Van Rawat children do not go to school, as they don’t have the means and cannot fit in with children from outside the tribe. “The tribals have no knowledge of the coronavirus pandemic, let alone the know-how of how to go about vaccination. With no smartphones, they cannot register on CoWin for vaccination. Walk-in vaccination centres are also not an option as the nearest centres area 15 to 25 km away and the vehicles are running at 50% capacity and charging double,” Jethi told TOI. The livelihood of Van Rawats depends on working as daily wagers in nearby villages. “The pandemic has robbed them of their work opportunities. Van Rawats do get rice, wheat and lentils from the public distribution system but are not able to buy oil, vegetables and other daily needs. Also, Van Rawats do not hoard eatables, so the families often do not have basic ration to get by,” said Sanjay Pant, a resident of Didihat. “Jethi said that being virtually disconnected from society, no Van Rawat has contracted the coronavirus yet. However, the administration needs to reach out to them as it is not possible for them to get vaccinated without assistance,” Jethi added. When queried on the issue, Pithoragarh chief medical officer (CMO) HC Pant said, “Neither central nor state government has issued any special instruction to vaccinate Van Rawat members so there is no separate programme for that as yet. Right now, we are focusing on inoculating frontline workers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/van-rawats-a-tribe-in-ukhand-hills-virtually-cut-off-from-society-have-no-means-to-get-vaccinated/articleshow/82919382.cms||Prem Punetha
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Pregnant women could take jab with gynaec letter, own consent||MUMBAI: Despite the Centre not giving the go-ahead for vaccination of pregnant women, the BMC on Monday issued an order stating that pregnant women can get vaccinated by submitting a letter from a gynaecologist and their own consent in writing. Lactating women don’t need any of the above and can simply walk into vaccination centres and get their Covid shot, though they have to carry medical documents containing details of date and place of delivery. The BMC’s order said if pregnant women wish to receive the vaccine, they will need a written go-ahead from the treating gynaecologist on their letterhead, in addition to their own consent letter. Both documents must be submitted to the vaccination centre at the time of taking the vaccine. Pregnant as well as lactating women can walk in between Monday and Wednesday to get their shots. AMC Suresh Kakani said lactating women can come even six months after delivery. “We haven’t kept a minimum or a stringent timeline since it’s difficult for many to step out of their homes soon after delivery,” he said. Mumbai sees an average of 1.5 lakh deliveries every year, which had dropped to 1.20 lakh in 2020. The inclusion wouldn’t push number of beneficiaries as they were counted in the adult population of nearly 9 million that qualifies to get jabbed in Mumbai, he said. Civic officials didn’t comment on how their arrived at a decision of vaccinating pregnant women. The National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) had recommended to Centre that pregnant and lactating women should be offered the choice to get vaccinated. The Centre, however, okayed vaccination of lactating women on May 19, while maintaining silence on vaccination of pregnant women. The Centre had said the matter was being deliberated upon. NTAGI had said adequate scientific material should be prepared for pregnant women, explaining risks and benefits. Dr Jayaprakash Muliyil, an epidemiologist and member of NTAGI, told TOI vaccinating a pregnant woman involves two lives, so they must be given every tool to make an informed choice. “Pregnancy per se is not a risk factor, but a woman may have factors that predisposes her to complications such as clotting (seen in rare cases of Covishield). So a gynaecologist’s opinion is recommended,” he said. As for lactating women, he said it was alright for them to get vaccinated after 42 days of delivery. The Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India (FOGSI) too had spoken in favour of vaccination of pregnant and lactating women. Although none of the vaccine trials have been done on pregnant women, data gathered from real-world vaccination of pregnant women has shown it’s largely safe, added Dr Muliyil. Countries like the US, the UK, Belgium and Israel have been vaccinating pregnant women. The city on Monday saw 25,211 vaccinations as the drive opened after a one-day break.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-pregnant-women-could-take-jab-with-gynaec-letter-own-consent/articleshow/82922911.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The medicines would be dispatched soon,” said a senior official. “As on Monday evening, Civil Hospital has 370 patients of mucormycosis. We have adequate stock of medicines for them.” Civil Hospital has carried out 231 surgeries on mucormycosis patients in past month. “The trend of new patients is on decline. On Monday, 14 new patients got admitted compared to 25-30 daily patients a fortnight ago,” said the official. Queues were not seen for injections as relatives of patients were told that the injections would only be given to hospitals putting in formal requests. Hospitals however were not happy when they came to know that it was lyophilized instead of liposomal injections. Meanwhile, Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) approached the state health department over allocated injections of liposomal amphotericin B. “We had requests from 35 city hospitals for 900 injections.

The former chief minister also said that the last academic year 2020-21 had been really challenging for all — students, parents as well as teachers. “The students, despite all these odds, have studied on whatever mode was available,” he said.  Meanwhile, calling the decision an injustice on scholar students, BJP state president Sadanand Shet Tanavade said that it was nonetheless the decision taken by the Union government. When asked about Parsekar’s reaction, Tanavade reiterated that it wasn’t a decision taken by chief minister Pramod Sawant. Tanavade said that if the state government goes against the Centre’s decision and conducts the exams, and if students then test positive for Covid, the people will criticise the state government. “We have to accept the Centre’s decision,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ssc-students-lost-opportunity-to-test-themselves-parsekar/articleshow/82924683.cms||---
---||Pune||SPPU plans provisional degree certs for pupils||Pune: A host of delays in conducting the 118th convocation ceremony by Savitribai Phule Pune University due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdowns has led to the university offering provisional degree certificates online. Vice-chancellor Nitin Karmalkar said they will be distributed soon. The convocation ceremony can be conducted online like last year, but, Karmalkar said, many students hope to be awarded their medals in a physical ceremony as it is a once-in-a-lifetime event for them. The university will wait for 15 days and check for any changes in the lockdown guidelines to decide whether to announce a completely online process like last year or adopt a physical process where students or at least the gold medallists can be called in batches, to be awarded the medals and the certificates. The convocation ceremony for students who graduated in October 2020 was scheduled in April 2021, but due to the surge in Covid-19 cases, the event had to be postponed indefinitely. “The Board of Examination that met recently discussed all this. The university cannot conduct the convocation at a new date without getting approval from the governor. Due to the lockdown, a physical ceremony cannot be conducted at the moment. Hence, we decided to give away the provisional certificates so that students can use them for whatever purpose they want,” Karmalkar said. Many private universities held online convocations and sent the degree certicates to their students’ homes via the department of posts. But the Maharashtra Public Universities Act is binding and all state universities must hold an official convocation ceremony to award the degree.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/sppu-plans-provisional-degree-certs-for-pupils/articleshow/82920935.cms||Ardhra Nair

The ministry also formed a committee to ensure proper coordination and resolve the implementation issues. It said the decisions were taken at a meeting called by the ministry with various associations of the bullion trade, hallmarking centers, jewellers, trade and export bodies and officials. Under the Hallmarking scheme of Bureau of Indian Standards, jewellers are registered for selling hallmarked jewellery. The Hallmarking will enable consumers or jewellery buyers to make the right choice and save them from any unnecessary confusion while buying gold. At present, only 30% of Indian gold jewellery is hallmarked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hallmarking-of-gold-jewellery-from-june-15/articleshow/82927038.cms||---

Speaking at Kolhapur, Patil said that flooding occurs due to consistent heavy rainfall in the catchment areas of Koyna and other dams from the region and causes damages to the lives and properties as witnessed in 2019 floods. The local representatives, who attended the meeting on Monday, demanded that a comprehensive plan be worked out to mitigate the flood and avoid loss of life and property. Patil said a meeting will be arranged on May 31. “The IMD has forecast 98% monsoon this time. The catchment areas of dams in our region get very heavy rainfall. This causes floods to the rivers downstream. The public representatives and officials of all three districts will meet online on May 31. They will discuss how to coordinate with each other to avoid loss of lives as well as economic losses,” said Patil. The officials of irrigation department said that the management of the dam water levels will be done in real time mode. The department has already decided to bring down dam water level to their dead stock levels by July 15 so that space can be made to accommodate excess rainfall occurring between July 15 to August 15. Slams opposition Patil slammed leaders of opposition Devendra Fadnavis and Pravin Darekar for criticising chief minister Uddhav Thackeray over Covid management. “We do not need their certificate. Even PM Narendra Modi has appreciated the work done by MVA government,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-satara-sangli-mlas-mps-officials-to-meet-on-flood-preparedness/articleshow/82916485.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Covid-19: Positivity rate in Ahmedabad falls from 36% to 7%||AHMEDABAD: The number of Covid cases came down from 5,700 on April 25 to below 500 on Monday. The positivity rate plunged from 36% in the last week of April to 7% on Monday. The number of active cases too fell to 22,200 on Monday from 65,000 in April-end. AMC officials said the experiences of the first phase of the pandemic were harnessed to deal with the second wave. The AMC had faced a rebuke from the high court over its handling of the Covid situation. In the end, the city managed to bring down cases from the peak in less than a month. “Lockdowns are devastating for the marginalized and for people with low and precarious incomes,” said a senior AMC officer. “Based on the previous experiences, the AMC had taken a series of initiatives keeping in mind common citizens’ interests. A new strategy was planned to address the problem areas.” The officials said that if the third wave strikes, as it is projected to around August, the AMC has a detailed plan ready. Insights gleaned from the second wave will be incorporated into the plan. The officials said that 7,000 to 8,000 tests, on average, were conducted daily from March-end up to the current period of May in the city. But during the Covid peak in the last fortnight of April, the AMC was able to conduct 40,000 tests a day of which 25,000 were RT-PCR tests. The officials said that during the peak, the AMC was running 145 mobile OPD units such as Dhanvantari Raths. Now the number is 127. The Dhanvantari Raths have served 2.6 million people so far. The officials said that the 104 helpline was able to attend to 3,500 calls a day in a time-bound manner during the height of the crisis. The officials said as Covid cases rose, the AMC realized that secondary-care hospitals needed to increase oxygen beds. Thus, the AMC requisitioned about 240 nursing homes where more than 1,500 oxygen beds were swiftly made ready. With 20 Portacryo tanks, 500 B-type cylinders procured from Gandhidham, and 850 jumbo cylinders, the AMC and private hospitals have been able to more than double the number of oxygen and ICU beds. The number of such beds was 3,200 on April 11; it shot up to over 6,400 as on May 11. The AMC said that Quick Response Teams (QRTs) were formed in all the seven zones of the corporation and each team had 20-25 cylinders to supplement the oxygen supply of hospitals in dire need. The stocks were delivered within 10 minutes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/positivity-rate-in-city-falls-from-36-to-7/articleshow/82922869.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

On Monday afternoon, a 50-year-old man, identified as Sushil Saini, met with an accident in the Chidderwala area. Subsequently, a few passers-by called the 108 ambulance service. Within minutes, EMT (emergency medical technician) Amit Bhatt and ambulance driver Jaidev rushed to the spot. "With the help of a few Good Samaritans, Jaidev and I put the victim into the emergency vehicle. Thereafter, we administered him first aid before rushing him to AIIMS Rishikesh. When the pockets of the victim were checked for his mobile phone so that his family members could be intimated of the accident, we found Rs 50,000 cash with him," Bhatt told TOI. Chitranjan Kumar, Sushil Saini's nephew, told TOI that his uncle succumbed to his injuries during treatment at AIIMS-R. "The ambulance staffers were honest and returned the money. This will certainly help my uncle's family." He added, “He was in Dehradun to attend the last rites of one of his relatives. He is survived by his wife and a teenage son.” Meanwhile, Anil Sharma, the general manager of 108 Emergency Services (Project), said that the honesty of both the employees is worth appreciating. “We will give them a cash award along with a certificate of appreciation.

---||Pune||Ambulance charges increase by Rs 100||Pune: The Pune regional transport office has increased the charges for hiring an ambulance by up to Rs100 for different categories of vehicles, an official said on Monday. “We looked at the rates in other cities of different states and increased the rates accordingly. The ambulance owners had also been demanding an increase in the rates, so it was at par with other cities. The increase in rates is nominal and we don’t think it will bother people much,” an official from the regional transport office (RTO) said, adding that the increased rates were for Pune, Pimpri Chinchwad areas and Baramati. Last year, the RTO had fixed the charges of ambulances after many complaints of overcharging had come to the fore. For a Maruti van ambulance, the rate for a 25km or 2-hour ride was fixed at Rs600 instead of Rs500 earlier and Rs12 would be charged for every km after that. The waiting charge would be Rs100 for every hour. Similarly, for bigger vehicles such as SUVs, among others, the rate for a 25km or 2-hour ride would be Rs700 instead of Rs600 and Rs13 would be charged per km after that. The waiting charge would be Rs125 per hour. For even bigger ambulances such as a mini van, the rate for a 25km or 2-hour ride would be Rs950 from the earlier Rs900 and Rs14 would be charged for every km after that , the official said. “If an ambulance driver overcharges, the information regarding the same with proof should immediately be given to the RTO and strict action, which will include suspension of licence and permit and a heavy fine, will follow after an investigation,” the RTO official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ambulance-charges-increase-by-rs-100/articleshow/82920966.cms||Joy Sengupta

Residents alleged that power supply was disrupted around 11 pm on Sunday and could only be restored till 2.30 pm on Monday. SK Malik, a resident of the sector, said, “I have recently recovered from Covid, but I still need to use an oxygen concentrator every three hours. “Sunday night was difficult as I was not able to use the equipment due to the outage. I managed with oxygen cans and breathing exercise.” Not just Malik, many other patients who are at home had a dreadful experience. “The summer is not even in its peak, but we are facing long hours of power cuts, voltage fluctuations. I don’t know what will happen when people start consuming more electricity during peak summer,” said another resident. Residents complained that the disruption in power supply has also affected water supply in the area during the morning and in some places, inverters have run out of charge. Malkhan Singh Yadav, RWA president Sector 23 A said, “Ever since the electricity department laid underground HT cable, we have been witnessing problems every other day. The cables are of inferior quality, which is causing a lot of problems. Many poles inare in bad condition and may fall anytime and we have already written to the department about this but nothing has been done.” Dharam Singh, SDO, Maruti, Gurgaon said, “The underground cable got damaged around 3 pm on Sunday but we managed to restore supply in two hours.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: MM drug availability depends on central allocation||AHMEDABAD: The state government on Monday told the Gujarat high court that it is taking all necessary steps to deal with mucormycosis but declared that the availability of medicines will be dependent entirely on the central government’s allocation. In response to the high court’s query on what the mechanism is by which the state government intends to deal with the black fungus disease, the state government stated that it has declared the disease a notifiable disease under the Epidemic Diseases Act at the request of the Centre. The state government has also stated that it has started special wards for mucormycosis patients in government hospitals. It informed the court about the disease, and advisories and protocols issued by the governments. During the last hearing, the government had informed the court that it had placed an order for procurement of 1.14 lakh vials of Amphoterecin B. However, after placing these orders, supply and distribution of Amphoterecin B to states has been taken over and controlled by the government of India just as is in the case of remdesivir injections. “Therefore, supply will be based on allocation from the government of India,” the principal health secretary submitted. The state government also listed the names of public hospitals which have been notified as nodal agencies for distribution of Amphoterecin B to private hospitals. The state government asserted that it is taking all necessary steps to face the new challenges and threats posed by the latest surge of this pandemic. “The government is conscious that this battle cannot be fought without the confidence and cooperation of the public and therefore, all measures are being undertaken and implemented in a systematic and organized manner,” the government said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/mm-drug-availability-depends-on-central-allocation/articleshow/82922840.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Traders take a cue from last year’s Amphan loss, shift goods to safety||KOLKATA: Several traders opened their establishments on Sunday and Monday but not to do business. They were busy shifting their stock to safety before cyclone Yaas makes landfall on Wednesday. The preventive measure was taken in view of the damage Super Cyclone Amphna had caused to business in May last year. During last year’s cyclone, goods worth crores were ruined when water gushed into the shops and stores and markets were damaged badly with trees and electrical poles falling on them. This year traders and market committees are not taking any chances and shifting their goods and furniture to safer places, plugging leaks and safeguarding against other threats. Super Cyclone Amphan had hit on May 20 when a full lockdown was in place due to the pandemic and traders and market committees could not take any safety measures. This year there are restrictions in place owing to surge in Covid cases in the second wave but most businessmen have decided to take steps to prevent a repeat of last year’s damage. Eyewear worth Rs 1 lakh was damaged in Jamal Shamsi’s shop on the Canning Street. There was knee deep water inside his shop when he reached there the following morning. It took him one whole day to drain out the water, but several spectacles and contact lenses were already damaged. “I am shifting half of the stock to my residence on Mission Row,” said Jamal, 48. Power connection will also be turned off on Wednesday to prevent any mishap. Security guards staying inside have been told to keep a vigil if any tree falls on any shop or they spot any blaze. “The business has been very bad anyway since the past 15months due to the pandemic. Last thing we want is to suffer losses due to the cyclone. The local police station and civic administration have given us the permission to take preventive measures,” said Gaurav Harlalka, a member of the traders’ body in New Market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/traders-take-a-cue-from-last-years-amphan-loss-shift-goods-to-safety/articleshow/82920965.cms||Zeeshan Javed

Adequate financial provisions have been made in the budget for the two new proposed hospitals, which will come up in the Panchavati and Satpur divisions of the civic body. In February, NMC commissioner Kailas Jadhav had presented the Rs 2,361.56 crore draft budget of the civic body for the financial year 2021-22 to the standing committee of NMC. Standing committee chairman Ganesh Gite, made an additional hike of Rs 402.25 crore, taking the total budget of NMC to Rs 2,763.81 crore. Gite presented the draft budget incorporating some projects at the general body meeting of NMC on Monday for its approval. City mayor Satish Kulkarni approved the Rs 2,763.81 crore budget presented by the standing committee chairman Ganesh Gite. Presenting the budget, Gite said he has made a hike of Rs 400 crore in the draft budget of the civic body. “I have given priority to increasing the health infrastructure of the city and have proposed two new hospitals as part of measures to strengthen the health infrastructure in the city. Moreover, the focus has been given to developing the major city roads,” said Ganesh Gite. After the outbreak of Covid in April last year, the NMC administration had converted its two civic hospitals — Bytco hospital and Zakir Hussain hospital — into Covid hospitals. NMC had faced a shortage of beds during the period and had set up Covid care centres at private and government properties. Meanwhile, Shiv Sena corporator Santosh Gaikwad staged a demonstration on Monday to protest against the negligence of the civic body in conducting a probe into Zakir Hussain hospital oxygen leakage case. He staged the demonstration during the GB meeting outside the meeting hall in Rajiv Gandhi Bhavan, from where the mayor Satish Kulkarni conducted the meeting online. Twenty-two patients had died at the hospital due to disruption of oxygen supply following leakages in the oxygen tank in April. Gaikwad said the mayor had ordered a probe into the incident through a committee. But nothing happened thereafter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/two-new-hospitals-to-come-up-in-nashik-city/articleshow/83121912.cms||Tushar Pawar

According to police sources, the deceased woman, identified as Anju Devi, wife of one Rudal Yadav of Saidalli village under the Rahui police station area and her paramour Luv Yadav, resident of neighbouring village Mai Farida under the same police station area were brought to Rahui police station around 10:30pm on Sunday after they were arrested at Patna junction.

---||Pune||State to take a call on extension for property registration soon: Kareer||Pune: Additional chief secretary (revenue) Nitin Kareer on Wednesday said the state government would soon decide on the issue of extending registration of property documents executed in December last year. Credai Maharashtra has sought four-month extension from the state government for such property documents, which were to be registered by April-end. “The state government, after the HC orders, has sought some documents from the state developers’ body. We should take a decision on the issue soon,” he told TOI.The state developers’ body had written to the Inspector General of Registration and Stamps regarding the extension, which was forwarded to the state government. As per section 24 of the Registration Act of 1908, all documents need to be registered within four months of the date of the agreement signing, failing which a fine, not exceeding 10 times the registration fee, is to be levied each month in different slabs. The developers’ body has approached the state government to be considerate towards property buyers and not charge a fine in view of the pandemic.Sources from the revenue department said the government could consider the request by making necessary amendments to the rules as well as levying a nominal charge for late registration.Senior officials from the department said the state might consider the extension of one or two months with a nominal fee. “Considering the pandemic situation, it is unlikely that there will be registrations. So, people who executed their property documents between January and March may also seek extension,” the officials said, adding that the final order in this regard was awaited.The state government had given a stamp duty waiver of 3% till December 31 last year to provide the much-needed boost to the realty sector.Shantilal Kataria, national vice-president, Credai, said with Maharashtra reeling under the second wave of Covid, it had not been possible for many home buyers to meet the four-month deadline.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/state-to-take-a-call-on-extension-for-property-registration-soon-kareer/articleshow/82920996.cms||Nisha Nambiar

We decided the least we can do is provide one meal a day to these people.” Puri added that devotees and saints associated with the Trust had also donated considerably to CM’s relief fund, given two ambulances to local hospitals and donated several thousand kilos of rice and lentils to others organizing camps for beggars or assisting Covid-hit families in Haridwar. “We have also donated several oxygen cylinders and other medical equipment to the administration as a contribution to the fight against Covid. We have asked saints and devotees to help as many people as possible,” Puri added. Meanwhile, devotees associated with Nainital’s Kainchi Dham offer fresh meals for free to attendees and family members of patients at Sushila Tiwari Hospital (STH) in Haldwani. Devesh Agarwal, one of the devotees and volunteers of the initiative, said that because of the lockdown, shops would close early and family members would have to eat biscuits and sleep on the road. “Covid-19 patients and their families come to STH from far-off places like Almora and Pithoragarh. Although some shops are open in the morning, almost all of them down shutters by noon due to the lockdown. After that, people waiting for their family members are forced to survive on snacks. We devotees of Neem Karoli Baba decided to offer them proper food. In our camps, free meals are provided from 6pm to 8 pm. In the last one week, the number of people taking our meals has increased from 200 to nearly 800 now,” Agarwal said. Smaller temples and ashrams across districts like Almora, Uttarkashi and Dehradun have also been helping out. The Yogoda Satsanga Sakha Ashram in Almora’s Dwarahat has donated hundreds of masks, sanitizer bottles and other medical equipment to the local administration and the MLA to be distributed among people. “We received the equipment from our office in Ranchi and were instructed to distribute it in the hills as medical facilities are scarce here. So, we contacted the local officials and offered out help. If needed, we will continue to offer help in the future,” said a representative of the ashram who did not wish to be named.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/in-uttarakhand-ashrams-and-devotees-open-doors-to-covid-hit-residents/articleshow/82919413.cms||Prashant Jha

The 30-year-old woman from Nagla Salaru village said that she had approached Irfan Ali, who runs a medical store at Pathanpura locality in Manglaur, for medicines to treat her mother’s fever. Irfan said that her mother had Covid-19 and would have to be admitted at a Covid facility. He then told her that the medical store doubled as a Covid ward and offered to treat the woman’s mother. The woman said that for the treatment, Ali had charged Rs 2 lakh in installments and her mother’s condition had only worsened. She said that she later admitted her Manglaur-based Covid Care Centre, where she recovered. She has filed a complaint with police but it has not yet been registered, as police believe her to be pressing false charges because of “personal enmity”. "The woman provided us with ambiguous details. We know that the accused is a quack and runs a clinic but it is not a hospital or Covid facility. Moreover, the woman and the pharmacist belong to rival political parties so it could be a case of personal enmity as well. We are probing all angles. If the charges are found to be true, a case will be registered,” said inspector Yaspal Singh Bisht, in-charge Manglaur police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/pharmacy-owner-dupes-woman-of-rs-2l-for-corona-treatment/articleshow/82919424.cms||Tapan Susheel

Narnepati, according to the prosecution, also claimed that he had received the paper through a messaging service application from the Colonel, heading the question paper printing panel at the Army Recruitment Office in Secunderabad. The Pune police had arrested Narnepati on May 14 and produced him before the court of additional sessions judge A Y Thatte on Monday at the end of his initial custodial remand. They moved a fresh report through the prosecutor seeking another four days of police custody of Narnepati on the grounds that they wanted to verify his claims related to exchange of money.“We also brought to the court’s notice that the initial cellphone number, which Narnepati gave to the police claiming that it was used for circulating the leaked paper, turned out to be a bogus claim as the call data record established the same. As such, the police wanted sufficient time to interrogate Narnepati about the actual phone used and to seize the same,” Agarwal told TOI. The court allowed the police’s plea and extended Narnepati’s custodial remand till May 28. The arrested Colonel would be produced before the court on Tuesday, when the term of his initial custodial remand ends. Nine persons, including the Colonel and two serving majors, have been arrested so far in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/co-accused-gave-col-rs-3l-in-paper-leak-case-police/articleshow/82921049.cms||Vishwas Kothari

The visitations by inmates and relatives/ lawyers were stopped following the outbreak of Covid-19. In case of legal assistance, a lawyer will be required to send an email to the jail authorities for securing a time slot for the call. Since April 15, physical production of convicts/ undertrial prisoners before the courts for bail, remand or trial hearings has been suspended and all such proceedings are now being conducted through videoconferencing. “We have procured 149 smartphones and installed 77 coinboxes to enable inmates make video calls/phone calls to their family members once a week. The calls are made free of cost for 10 minutes in the presence of jail officials. A register is maintained in which details of the inmates and relatives etc are written,” additional director general (prisons) Sunil Ramanand told TOI on Monday. He said, “In pre-Covid situation, we had mechanisms for inmates to converse with people in the outside world viz mulaqat (meeting) with family members and lawyers and using the coin box facility launched last year after the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. If an inmate wishes to converse with close friends, then we insist on conducting his/her police verification. After receiving police report we take a call on whether the facility spost hould be extended to a new person as their names are not mentioned in official records.” The prisons chief said, “After the pandemic broke out, we suspended physical meetings with family members and lawyers and closed down the meeting rooms in all central, district and sub jails to contain the spread of the virus among the inmates but the coin box facility continued. We later took a call to launch the video call facility after the second wave so that the inmates can converse and see their near and dear ones in the presence of jail officials.” “We have also extended the video call facility to 42 temporary jails and 11 Covid care centres in the state. As per prison rules, an undertrial prisoner and convict can interact with their family members/ lawyers once a week and fortnight, respectively. In case of medical emergency or if an inmate has tested positive, the jail authorities will make an emergency phone call to his/her family,” he added. “The jail staffers will make calls to inmates’ family members whose numbers are enrolled in the official records. Instructions have been issued not to dial new numbers. We have instructed our officials to take all possible care to prevent misuse of the facility. The video call facility is running smoothly. We have not received any complaint in this regard,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/video-calls-replace-physical-visits-in-jails/articleshow/82921012.cms||Asseem Shaikh
---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad gets 3 sweeper vehicles||Aurangabad: A total of three sweeper vehicles procured under the Smart City Mission of the Centre for the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) were deployed into service on Monday. Civic administrator Astik Kumar Pandey said each vehicle costs Rs 32 lakh and has been procured from a manufacturer based in Ahmedabad. “The machines have a sweeping width of 5.25 feet and can sweep the road at a speed of two to three kilometers per hour. The machines have a dust container capacity of 1.4 cubic metre and tipping angle of 45 degrees. Each machine has a capacity to sweep 10 to 15 kilometer of the road every day,” he said. The mechanical sweepers are single-engine vehicles that use power of the vehicle engine for operation of sweeping brushes and generation of vacuum. The brushes mounted on side and centre gather the dust that is then absorbed into the pipe through vacuum. The AMC had one big sweeping truck for major roads, but it was not suitable for narrow roads. Understanding the need, the Aurangabad Smart City Development Corporation Limited (ASCDCL) has procured these dust sweeping machines. Launched in 2015, the Smart City Mission is an urban renewal and retrofitting programme of the Centre with an aim to develop smart cities across the country, making them citizen-friendly and sustainable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-gets-3-sweeper-vehicles/articleshow/82916659.cms||---

Following the clash, police lodged FIR against 2,000 people, including 47 who have been named, for attempt to murder and rioting. According to the police, the clash broke out at Nava Bandar village after an altercation over collision of two fishing boats at the village jetty. “While parking the fishing boat at the jetty, boats of Mukesh Solanki and Altaf collided and a heated exchange ensued between the two. The quarrel escalated and took a communal turn,” said police. About 1,500-2,000 people belonging to two different communities attacked each other with empty glass bottles, sticks, swords, iron and stones. “When police tried to pacify them, members of both the groups attacked policemen and hurled stones and empty glass bottles at them, injuring seven cops who had to be hospitalised,” police said. The injured cops include police sub-inspector (PSI) Ketan Parmar, PSI H V Chudasama, assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Kanchan Bhanji, constables Sandeep Solanki, Prakash Chavda and Raju Gadhia.

---||Dehradun||Working without masks and gloves, anganwadi workers refuse to conduct Covid-19 survey in U’khand hills||DEHRADUN: Anganwadi workers -- considered to be the prime source of getting health updates from remote areas of Uttarakhand -- have come out against the government’s decision to continue conducting field surveys for Covid-19 without any protective gear. They are upset that they are not provided gloves, face masks and sanitizers and that the government is forcing them to step out for surveys and to distribute medicines. While anganwadi workers have been doing Covid duty since the start of the pandemic, it’s only in the past few weeks since the surge in the hill districts started that they have been exposed more to the infection, making their work risky. “We are 45,000 anganwadi workers in the state out of which around 25,000 go out in the field, and our government can’t even give PPE and safety kits to these frontline workers - who are mostly single women, divorcee or single parent? We are upset with the latest performa shared by the government on Sunday in which we are supposed to take signatures from people who have been given Covid kits. Many of them will be Covid-positive, making us easy targets for transmission. The workers have threatened to refuse work without safety basics in place,” said Rekha Negi, president, Anganwadi Workers’ Association. Two Covid-positive Anganwadi workers have shared videos from Bageshwar and Champawat, in which they say the government should “take the onus of their death” as they are being asked to work sans any basic safety measures. In a video released by Bhagwati Joshi, a Covid-positive anganwadi worker from Garudh block of Bageshwar, she can be seen saying, “My job is to go door-to-door to know the health condition of everyone in the village and to also check that each migrant worker stays in isolation as per the guidelines. We are most vulnerable to contracting this virus as we meet so many people. The government has left us on the field without any safety gear. Today I am Covid-positive and I have small kids at home. If something happens to me, this government should take onus of my death.” The situation in the remote hills of Uttarakhand remains serious, more than 1.25 lakh migrants have returned to Uttarakhand in the past two months. More than 30% of all the cases are from the nine hill districts. Another anganwadi worker, Anita Devi, tested positive for Covid on May 10 and now both her sons -- Ayush Kumar (10) and Aaryan Kumar (14) -- have also tested positive. She is responsible for scanning the far-lying villages in Barakot block of Champawat district. She released a video on May 23 in which she can be seen saying, “We are responsible to conduct survey of those returning from outside to the villages and put them under home quarantine. And to go door-to-door to survey if anyone is showing symptoms like fever, cold and difficulty in breathing. After doing my Covid-19 duty for three months now I am also struck by this deadly infection and I am responsible for taking care of my children all alone under home isolation.” Anita Devi was administered oxygen for nearly four days. Minister of the department of women and child development, Rekha Arya, told TOI that PPE kits can’t be given to anganwadi workers. “The district magistrates in all the districts have been told long back to provide all the basic facilities to these anganwadi workers because they are not just doing the survey but also involved in giving the Take Home Ration (THR). The district programme officers too have been given orders to ensure these basics are given to the anganwadi workers although giving PPE kits is not practically feasible and it is basically required by the hospital staff and the staff at the sampling centres,” said Arya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/working-without-masks-and-gloves-anganwadi-workers-refuse-to-conduct-covid-19-survey-in-ukhand-hills/articleshow/82919420.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Mumbai||Zinc overuse driving black fungus epidemic within pandemic? Doctors want study||MUMBAI: The mucormycosis or black fungus crisis in India may not be driven only by the improper use of steroids among diabetic Covid patients, but also by the overuse of medicines ranging from antibiotics to zinc supplements and iron tablets, say doctors. “While the primary reason is the use of steroids and diabetes, there has been a lot of debate in the last two days in the medical community on the use of zinc by crores of Indians for months on end. Other hypotheses suggest the use of iron and the failure to use sterile water in oxygen concentrators,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, senior endocrinologist from Lilavati Hospital, Bandra, who is working on a research paper on the sudden rise. Though India is the mucor capital of the world, with a pre-Covid incidence that was nearly 70 times higher than the global data, the 8,000 cases in less than two months have shocked the medical community. Doctors have called on the Indian Council of Medical Research to study the reasons for the ‘outbreak’ of mucormycosis, which is a rare but serious fungal infection caused by molds called mucormycetes. Research over the decades has shown that metal zinc acts as a growth factor for fungus, especially mucormycetes. Studies have also shown that removing zinc makes it difficult for the fungus to survive. In March 2020, when the pandemic began in India, zinc supplements emerged as the chosen ‘immunity boosters’, rising to become one of the country’s highest selling drugs in 2020. Doctors have been putting out old research papers, theories and numbers on social media sites in the last 48 hours to show that zinc could be one of the culprits. “In the first wave, we had little knowledge about the SARS-CoV-2 virus, resulting in many medicines and combinations being tried to inhibit it,” said Kochi-based Dr Rajeev Jayadevan. He, along with several other doctors from across the country, believes the mucor crisis is a multifactorial entity. For one, while the combination of the virus, diabetes and steroids is common across the world, it is only in India that mucormycosis has emerged as an epidemic within the pandemic. “There is clearly a hidden variable at play in India,” said Jayadevan. Also, the most common drug for 80% of Covid patients in the West is paracetamol to control the temperature, but the prescription for a mild Covid patient in India includes five to seven medicines. “We have paracetamol along with vitamin supplements, an antibiotic such as doxycycline and an anti-parasitic such as ivermectin,” said Jayadevan. Then there is one or two home remedies as well as steam inhalation. Canada-based epidemiologist Dr Madhukar Pai from McGill University said there is a need for an urgent investigation by ICMR or NCDC (National Centre for Disease Control) about the zinc theory. “Also, there are theories about tap water rather than distilled water used in humidifiers, and re-use of masks and cannulas,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-zinc-overuse-driving-mucor-epidemic-within-pandemic-docs-want-study/articleshow/82922957.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Bareilly||Meat-seller thrashed by locals for transporting ‘buffalo meat’ in Uttar Pradesh's Moradabad||BAREILLY: A man who is in the business of selling meat was stopped and almost lynched by a few locals in Uttar Pradesh's Moradabad on Sunday. They found 50kg of “buffalo meat” with him as he was transporting it on his scooter. The man, identified as Mohammed Shakir, is a resident of Mudhapandey area of the district and runs a licensed meat shop. When Shakir reached Katghar to sell the meat, a local, named Manoj Thakur, along with his aides stopped him. They alleged that he was selling “cow meat”. Later, police found that it was buffalo meat but Shakir was booked under section 11 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act along with section 429 (mischief by killing cattle) as he failed to produce the meat procurement document. He was given bail from the police station and sent back home. Later on Sunday evening, videos of the incident went viral and thereafter Shakir’s brother Zakir registered an FIR against 10 people at Katghar police station. Zakir claimed that the accused were demanding Rs 50,000 as ransom from his brother. Four accused were picked on Monday, but the main accused Manoj was still on a run. Six identified and four unidentified persons were mentioned in the FIR. The men were booked under sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting with deadly weapons), 149 (unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 389 (extortion by putting any person in fear of accusation), 386 (extortion), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of IPC. Sources said the initial report suggests that the injuries are not “internal” but further medical scans need to be done. Recently, there was public outrage after a 19-year-old Muslim vegetable seller had died when he was mercilessly beaten by police for “flouting Covid guidelines” in Unnao district. Shakir remained tight-lipped on this issue as he was scared after the incident. Moradabad SSP Prabhakar Chaudhary said, “Our experts had checked the flesh recovered from Shakir and it was not cow meat. Shakir was booked by us on Sunday evening after he failed to show us the procurement document of buffalo meat which he had brought from neighbouring Rampur district.” “Later we got videos in which one Manoj Thakur along with a few others could be seen thrashing Shakir. Manoj claims himself to be a cow vigilante but he isn’t associated with any group. We had encouraged Shakir’s brother Zakir to register an FIR against Manoj and his men as they were attempting to extort money and misleading police as well,” said the SSP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/meat-seller-thrashed-by-locals-for-transporting-buffalo-meat-in-ups-moradabad-10-booked-after-video-goes-viral/articleshow/82919427.cms||---

The Pimpri Chinchwad police also arrested the victim’s 29-year-old son for helping his wife to destroy the evidence. Assistant inspector Narayan Patil of the Talegaon Dabhade police said, “After strangling the mother-in-law to death, the woman had put her body inside a gunny bag and kept it on the terrace of their house.” Patil said the woman had informed her husband about the murder. “After foul smell started emanating from the body after two days, the couple decided to shift it from the terrace,” Patil said.

These farmers were from Bazpur, Kashipur, Jaspur, Nanakmatta and Sitarganj towns of Udham Singh Nagar district. The development comes after the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of over 40 farm unions, announced to observe May 26 as Black Day to mark six months of their agitation against the three agriculture reform laws notified last year. Talking to TOI over the phone from the Ghazipur border, Jagtar Singh Bajwa, spokesperson of SKM, said that farmers all across the country supporting the agitation will hoist black flags on their houses and vehicles on May 26 to register their protest. At the Ghazipur border, the farmers will burn the effigy of the central government. Notably, SKM, an umbrella body of over 40 farm unions, has announced to observe May 26 as Black Day to mark six months of their agitation. “We held a meeting on Monday with other farmer leaders to strategise our protest. It was decided that we will offer prayers to Lord Buddha in the morning as the Buddha Purnima is falling on May 26 this year. Subsequently, we will carry on with our protest,” Bajwa added. In a similar vein, Karm Singh Padda, state president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, said, “We have been agitating for six months at several Delhi borders but our demand of repealing the farm laws has fallen on deaf ears. As the harvesting of wheat has been completed and the transplantation of paddy is to start from June 15, we are ensuring a huge gathering of farmers at the Ghazipur border on May 26.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/terai-farmers-to-mark-six-months-of-agitation-against-agri-reform-laws-as-black-day-move-to-ghazipur-border-for-may-26/articleshow/82919431.cms||Aakash Ahuja

---||Mumbai||BMC again picks ‘inept’ desilting, transport companies to trim trees in Mumbai||MUMBAI: The BMC’s tree authority on Monday cleared tree-trimming contracts for the city’s 24 wards and once again picked desilting and transport companies despite “arbitrary pruning” complaints by activists and the Opposition. The selected companies have bid around 40% below the BMC’s estimate of Rs 62 crore for the one-year contract for the entire city. The existing contracts end on June 3. Times ViewUprooting of over 2,000 trees in a single day was a major loss to the city’s green cover. The fact that despite the lockdown, two persons died due to tree falls shows trimming is a very important exercise to ensure people don’t get injured. At the same time, trees must not be hacked in the guise of trimming. The BMC must carry out trimming work in a scientific manner through experienced agencies instead of deploying transport and desilting contractors. It should be made mandatory to have an arborist or horticulturist on site.The BJP alleged that the BMC-appointed desilting and transport firms have no expertise in tree pruning, while activists complained that trees are hacked in an unscientific manner which weakens and causes them to fall in a downpour. BJP corporator and party leader in the BMC Vinod Mishra had recently written to additional municipal commissioner Ashwini Bhide demanding that the tenders be scrapped. “Not a single one of the 24 contractors has an arborist on board to scientifically identify weak branches and dead trees. The botanists are only on paper; they don’t make any actual reports,” Mishra claimed. “More than 2,000 trees fell in a single day owing to the cyclone, and two people died. This means that the tree-trimming work was not done properly,” he said. “And now on the pretext of the cyclone, more trees will be hacked arbitrarily. This must stop. There must be a scientific risk assessment of trees.” Arborist Vaibhav Raje who runs Treecotech, an arboriculture firm, concurred, “We need more pro-active mechanisms to save trees...The BMC needs to put in place a proper risk assessment plan for trees. If this goes on, then the city’s green cover will not last very long.” Civic officials said having an arborist or tree expert on board was included as a special condition, not mandatory, in the tender. “The tender condition required the contractors to have a horticulturist or botanist for each ward for technical supervision and oversight. They will ensure that tree-cutting is scientific,” said Jitendra Pardeshi, superintendent of gardens.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bmc-again-picks-inept-desilting-transport-cos-to-trim-trees-in-mumbai-city/articleshow/82924805.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Now, with cases going down relatively, 30% of the 45-tonne oxygen supply in the district will be set aside for the brass industry every day. “The Covid-19 situation is under control in rural and urban areas. Nearly one-third of the ICU beds in Covid hospitals are vacant. The demand for medical oxygen, which had peaked at 40 tonnes a day at one point, is now down to 18-20 tonnes,” Moradabad district magistrate Rakesh Kumar Singh told TOI. “Since we had reserves in our storage units and oxygen tankers needed to be emptied, we decided to resume supply to brass units. Livelihoods of many depend on them.” There are about 24,000 registered firms associated with the brass industry and nearly 1,400 export units in Moradabad that support lakhs. The decision has come as a revival for an industry pegged at an annual turnover of Rs 15,000 crore. “A Rs 20-lakh consignment has been pending for over a month. But it was a medical crisis and we didn’t place any demands for oxygen. We are happy that we can start our work again,” said Salman Atiq, a brass items manufacturing unit owner. General secretary of Moradabad Handicraft Export Association Avdhesh Agarwal added, “We understood when the government decided to stop oxygen supply. Saving lives was more important than anything else. Then, we approached the state government about restoring oxygen supply to manufacturing units. We are happy our request was considered.” The need for industrial oxygen in brass units comes in at the welding stage. “For instance, we manufacture prayer items. Two of the things we make — havan spoon and Aladdin ka chirag (lamp) can’t be made without industrial oxygen. Intricate welding has to be done, for which we need oxygen,” Atiq explained. The administration said it is moving ahead with cautious optimism. DM Singh said, “We have ensured all our oxygen storage units are at capacity to meet any emergency that may arise.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/green-shoots-o2-situation-better-moradabads-dormant-brass-units-get-fresh-lease-on-life/articleshow/82919433.cms||---

Ashok Choudhary, also known as ‘Bihar’s Mango Man’, told this newspaper that the farms in Bhagalpur and Banka had yielded plenty of mangoes this year. “However, we apprehend a fall in sales due to low demand amid the lockdown,” he added. Known for developing more than 100 varieties of mangoes at his farm in Maheshi-Tilakpur village under Sultanganj block, Choudhary has now formed a cluster of farmers, who can send their harvest to Jharkhand, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Karnataka and other parts of the country. M Feza Ahmad, a professor at Bihar Agricultural University, also pointed out that the lockdown was likely to hit the sale of different varieties of mangoes like ‘Jardalu’, ‘Malda’ and ‘Bambaiya’ grown in the Bhagalpur region. He added, “These popular mangoes are not just sold in different parts of India, but also exported to Bangladesh and Nepal. The state and central governments should, therefore, come forward to help the farmers.” SDO (agriculture) Dilip Kumar Singh, who is also the officiating district agriculture officer, said, “We are working on a strategy for the sale of mangoes grown in the Bhagalpur region.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bhagalpur-mango-farmers-stare-at-poor-sales-losses/articleshow/82921132.cms||Kumar Rajesh

Due to pandemic conditions, steps that were being taken by municipal corporations and government to contain such infestation have taken a back seat. You need to pull up your socks,” a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh said, while initiating a PIL on the matter. The high court said if the situation was not controlled immediately, the rise in vector-borne diseases could lead to more problems. “The situation is very bad because of mosquito infestation. With the onset of monsoon, looking at the pandemic, we may end up with a major problem. If mosquito infestation is not contained urgently, with the ongoing pandemic, the rise in vector-borne diseases could lead to problems and complexities,” it pointed out. The court directed Delhi government, three MCDs, Delhi Cantonment and New Delhi Municipal Council to file their status reports on the steps already taken and to be undertaken on mosquito infestation by Thursday. The high court initiated a PIL, on its own, on the issue and listed the case for hearing on May 28 before a bench headed by the Chief Justice who deals with PILs. It said every year during and after monsoon, one sees a surge in cases of chikungunya and dengue. “All of us are seeing the mosquito problem. Let's be aware of it. If people get dengue or something and they need to be hospitalised in Covid times, it will multiply the problem manifold,” the bench said. In 2017-2018, the court had taken up a batch of PILs on the menace posed by dengue and chikungunya in the wake of limited outbreaks in some parts of the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cant-afford-malaria-dengue-crisis-now-hc/articleshow/82921228.cms||---

Nitin Kedar (24) of Katraj, driver of the three-wheeler, lodged an FIR with the Bhosari police on Sunday night. This was the third such incident in this area, involving robbers riding triple seat on a motorcycle, since Friday. A couple of hours before Kedar was robbed, a truck driver was robbed of a cellphone and cash at the same spot. The following day, a cellphone was snatched from a senior citizen. “We suspect involvement of the same trio of local residents in all cases and have stepped up patrol,” an officer from the Pimpri Chinchwad crime branch said. “Kedar was on his way to drop off a consignment of vegetables at the Pimpri market, when, at 5.30, the suspects — brandishing a sharp weapon — forced him to stop,” inspector Kalyan Ghadge of the Bhosari police said. The armed suspect demanded money from Kedar. “When he refused, the trio abused and hit him. They snatched Rs4,000 from him when he fell on the road,” Ghadge said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/goods-carrier-driver-robbed-of-rs-4000/articleshow/82921128.cms||---

But fatalities continued to be high, with 361 deaths reported in the last 24 hours and 231 previous deaths added to the toll, taking the total to 89,212. The caseload rose to 56 lakh. Officials attributed the drop in daily caseload to the dip in testing over the weekend. In the last 24 hours, the state ran 2.6 lakh tests, lower than the average 2.8 lakh it had conducted last week. However, the daily positivity rate in the state dropped to 8.3% on Monday. The city on Monday registered 1,057 cases detected from 21,947 tests on Sunday. The positivity rate has stayed under 5% for the last four days, and the overall growth rate between May 17 and 23 was 0.2%. Further, the recovery rate in the city is 93% and the doubling rate has climbed to 334 days after plunging to a tenth a month ago. But deaths continued to be high at 48, taking the pandemic toll to 14,671 so far. “There are 2,335 ICU patients in the city. If there is an unfortunate outcome in even 2% of these patients, the toll would be over 40 deaths. This is a high number. Clearly, we still need to be cautious,” said a doctor from a BMC hospital. Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state government’s Covid task force, said cases are still too high in both Mumbai and Maharashtra to completely ease the restrictions placed in the last week of April. “The burden on hospitals across the state is still high. We still need to take steps to check the disease spread and ensure that people follow Covid-appropriate behaviour,” he said. The number of active cases in the state stands at 3.3 lakh, including 28,299 in Mumbai, but thankfully, the rate of recovery is over 92%. The daily caseload in Maharashtra had barely crossed 25,000 during the first wave in 2020, but the tally was over 30,000 on most days during the second wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-cases-lowest-in-69-days-expert-says-nos-still-too-high-to-lift-all-curbs/articleshow/82923006.cms||Bhavika Jain

According to the order issued by chief secretary Om Prakash, transfers of all state government employees would remain suspended in the state till next financial year. The letter addressed to all senior state officials, including additional chief secretaries, principal secretaries and head of departments, mentions that there is a Covid Curfew in the state and all financial activities have come to almost a standstill. Under such circumstances, travelling of employees from one location to another could increase the possibilities of the spread of the Covid-19 virus. Notably, the last financial year was also a zero session for transfers in Uttarakhand. While the bureaucrats and senior police officials can be given new transfers and posting, other state government employees can't be shifted this financial year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-govt-announces-fy-2021-22-as-zero-transfer-session-for-employees/articleshow/82919448.cms||Kautilya Singh

This is a fall of 57% in four days, one of the fastest during the pandemic. For the city, it was also the fifth consecutive day of less than 10 mortalities due to Covid-19. On Monday, against 3,187 new cases, 9,305 patients were discharged – about three times more than new patients. With this update, the state’s recovery rate again reached 90% after over one and a half months. Analysis of Covid cases in the eight municipal corporations reveals that the share of the cities currently hovers around 43% — one of the lowest of all time. To put the figure in perspective, in March, this figure was 70% to 75%. Likewise, with 17 deaths on Monday, the share of cities was 38%, again one of the lowest of the pandemic. Experts said the figures show the spread of Covid in almost all districts. “The share of cities has fallen, which is welcome news, but the focus area for some time will be rural areas,” said a city-based epidemiologist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/citys-daily-case-tally-at-64-day-low/articleshow/82922985.cms||---

A section of the staff on the duty who heard the noise likened it to the release of gas under pressure. The immediately called up the police, the authorities of the civil hospital and even the fire brigade, Eventually, it was revealed that the pipe of a suction machine used for suction aspiration in case of pregnancies had been damaged. “It was a timely alert sounded by the staff on duty. However, there was no issue with the oxygen supply tank, nor was there any problem that could have threatened the life of any of the employees or patients admitted to the hospital,” additional civil surgeon Dr Kishor Shriwas said. The officer rushed to the spot along with other officials, technicians and the police and fire brigade teams especially against the backdrop of the unfortunate incident in the Nashik Municipal Corporation’s Zakir Hussain hospital where oxygen tank leakage had lead to 24 Covid patients on oxygen and ventilator beds losing their lives. The fire brigade officials said since the was pipe linked to the suction machine was supposed to create vacuum, burst triggered a loud noise.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra says no to Centre order to send oxygen to Karnataka||The state government and the Union health ministry seem to be on a course of confrontation over supplying oxygen to BJP-ruled Karnataka from Maharashtra. A day after the Centre passed a unilateral order to some oxygen-manufacturing firms in Maharashtra to provide 240MT oxygen to Karnataka, the state government on Monday expressed its inability to oblige on the grounds that Maharashtra is already facing acute shortage of oxygen. State medical education secretary Saurabh Vijay, FDA commissioner Parimal Singh and transport commissioner Avinash Dhakne held a video conference with senior health officials from Delhi on Sunday, said a senior official. “We made it clear that as of now, it will not be possible for the oxygen firms to supply oxygen to Karnataka. Our daily requirement ranges from 1,400 to 1,500MT, while the availability of oxygen is less than 1250MT. We have requested MOHWF to reconsider its proposal,” he added. The state has already committed 60MT to Tamil Nadu, 12MT to Goa and 10MT to MP, he pointed out. “We require oxygen for 55,000 to 60,000 patients. Under such circumstances, it was not possible to divert oxygen to Karnataka,” he said. As per the health ministry order issued on May 23, Dolvi-based JSW was to supply 40MT, 90MT from Chakan, 50MT from Murbad and 60MT from Taloja. Maharashtra itself is securing 125MT from Gujarat, 130MT from Bhilai and a few MT from Bellary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-says-no-to-centre-order-to-send-o2-to-ktaka/articleshow/82923048.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: 47 dead so far as low wages, neglect stalk community health workers||MUMBAI: Having served her community for 14 years as an ASHA worker in Nandurbar, Anjana Narbhavar’s family didn’t think they would face hurdles in getting her a Covid test or a hospital bed. But when the 50-year-old showed symptoms days after visiting a patient, they had to scramble even as her oxygen levels dipped. She succumbed to Covid on April 10, 48 hours after her family managed to get a bed in the district hospital. Narbhavar is among 47 accredited social health activists (ASHAs) suspected to have died of Covid in Maharashtra, according to the union. Data from unions in the state reveal nearly 600 cases among them till April 30. On Monday, thousands of ASHAs in Maharashtra joined an all-India stir to draw attention to their plight— they work 10-12 hours daily for a meagre Rs 2,500-5,000 per month. A second crucial demand is more consideration in Covid treatment. As Anjana Narbhavar’s daughter Vidya said, they couldn’t find a bed for days for her mother despite her exemplary record. “She worked during the pandemic, visiting homes of patients, measuring oxygen levels and temperature. All she got was cloth masks and sanitizers occasionally. Would a doctor enter a ward without gloves, N95 or PPE kits,” she asked. ASHAs are known as the backbone of the public health system in rural parts, where they don multiple hats; from doing contact tracing to motivating people to get vaccinated. They also conduct surveys, report cases, get help to the infected, monitor patients. “Centre is giving a meagre Rs 1,000 for Covid work, while the state and corporations are giving little,” said Anandi Avaghade, head of Maharashtra ASHA Gatpravartka Federation, adding they want to be paid at least Rs 300 per day. Despite the workload, the state has not added posts or filled up all vacancies. Data accessed by TOI thro-ugh RTIs show the state has 71,137 sanctioned posts of wh-ich 68,269 (96%) are filled up. But even the 4% vacancy tr-anslates into nearly 3,000 vac-ant posts. While in rural areas, 95% of 61,215 posts are filled up, the shortage is acute in municipal council areas where 13% posts are vacant and further in civic councils where 30% posts are awaiting recruitment. Within corporations, Pune has highest vacancies (75%), Jalgaon 51%, Thane 29%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-47-dead-so-far-as-low-wages-neglect-stalk-community-health-workers/articleshow/82923117.cms||Sumitra Debroy

This year, 25 dengue and four chikungunya cases have been reported so far. While the overall number of cases still remains low, the initial trends show that cases are on a higher side than last three years. When compared to the same period last year, Delhi has registered 39% more dengue cases. Last year, by this time, 18 dengue cases were reported, 11 cases in 2019 and 15 cases in 2018. Many of sentinel surveillance hospitals that send the dengue data to civic bodies are running as Covid-only facilities, which may have also impacted the data collection process. There are 36 hospitals in the sentinel surveillance system of civic bodies and these healthcare facilities share weekly data with the malaria headquarters. The report also indicated a high presence of mosquito breeding in the city.

In a letter to chief secretary, Patna Meteorological Centre said rainfall would start in the northern parts of the state from Tuesday and intensify into widespread rainfall across the state on Wednesday and Thursday. Patna Meteorological Centre has issued a yellow warning for thunderstorm with lightning across the state along with gusty winds at the speed of 40-50kmph on Wednesday and Thursday. The Met office has cautioned the state government that uprooting of trees, disruption of power supply line and flooding or waterlogging in low-lying areas are also expected. Poor visibility and low-cloud ceiling may also cause temporary disruption of flights in the state, it said. Railways has already temporarily cancelled services of at least 10 pairs of special passenger trains either originating from or passing the jurisdiction of East Central Railway between May 25 and 29 owing to the cyclone. Patna Metrological Centre’s director Vivek Sinha, in the letter to the chief secretary and principal secretary of disaster management department, wrote, “A deep depression, which had formed over Bay of Bengal, intensified into cyclonic storm on Monday and was situated over east-central Bay of Bengal. It is likely to intensify into a very severe cyclonic storm and cross north Odisha-West Bengal coast between Paradip and Sagar islands around noon on May 26 (Wednesday).” “The impact of the cyclone will be seen in Bihar in terms of thunderstorm, lightning, gusty winds and moderate rain with isolated heavy spell in many districts between May 27 and 30. The impact will be seen more in the southern and central parts of the state, where sky will remain overcast with clouds and steady rainfall of moderate to heavy intensity will persist for over 24 to 48 hours,” it said. The IMD, in a special bulletin issued at 8.30pm on Monday, forecast light to moderate rainfall at most places in Bihar with heavy to very heavy rainfall and extremely heavy falls at isolated places on May 27 and isolated heavy to very heavy rain on May 28. Shailendra Kumar Patel, a meteorologist at Patna Meteorological Centre, said partly cloudy skies were observed at most places in the state in the last 24 hours. “As moderate to heavy rainfall is expected at many places in the state May 27 onwards, farmers are advised to shift their harvested crops from open areas,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cyclone-yaas-imd-puts-bihar-govt-on-alert/articleshow/82921829.cms||Piyush Tripathi

The civic administration has issued a circular in this regard, allowing exemption in property tax from the current financial year. The general body of the NMC had already given its approval for the proposal to waive property tax of the freedom fighters and their widows around one-and-a-half years ago. The standing committee of the NMC had also given its approval to the proposal. However, the implementation was delayed due to the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic last year in March. Meanwhile, the civic administration has collected property tax amounting to Rs 11 crore since April 1 this year. As part of increasing its revenue the civic body introduced 5% rebate to those paying their property tax for the financial year 2021-22 in one go. As per the scheme, the taxpayers who pay complete annual property tax by May 31 will get 5% rebate in property tax. The rebate will be three per cent if paid by June 30 and two per cent if paid by July 31.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-waives-property-tax-for-freedom-fighters-their-widows/articleshow/82916949.cms||Tushar Pawar

Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at India Meteorological Department, said, “Due to the impact of Cyclone Yaas, the wind direction is expected to change to easterly either on Wednesday night or Thursday. There may be cloudy sky on Thursday and Friday in Delhi and temperatures are predicted to drop by two degrees Celsius.” However, no rain under the influence of Cyclone Yaas is likely in Delhi-NCR. On Monday, the maximum temperature recorded at Safdarjung observatory was 36 degrees Celsius, four degrees below normal, while the minimum temperature was 21.2 degrees Celsius, five degrees below normal. The day temperature may be around 37 degrees Celsius on Tuesday. The observatory had recorded 119.3mm of rainfall between 8:30 am on May 19 and 8:30 am on May 20, which was the highest rainfall recorded in 24 hours in May due to the impact of Cyclone Tauktae.

Sources say the railway ministry has issued necessary instructions to Northern Railway after New Delhi Municipal Council repatriated the wrestler to his parent department on the basis of an FIR filed by Delhi Police. His suspension from railway service is a mere formality and will happen soon, say sources. Kumar was hired as a commercial manager (international wrestler) by the railways and in 2015, he was transferred to NDMC on deputation. From there, he was attached to the Delhi government’s education department as officer on special duty (OSD) at the Chhatrasal Stadium. “We received a file from the principal secretary, education department of the Delhi government last week along with the copy of the FIR filed by Delhi Police that linked Kumar’s name with the murder of 23-year-old wrestler during a brawl on May 4 at Chhatrasal Stadium. After that, we wrote to the railways for repatriation of the wrestler to the parent department and for necessary action,” said a senior NDMC official. The official added: “Kumar was appointed on deputation as OSD to the NDMC education department and later shifted to the Delhi government’s stadium for training of the athletes and development of sports at school level. But he was withdrawing salary from NDMC only.” Sources said Delhi government also rejected Kumar’s application for extending his deputation by a year. Kumar, who was working on deputation with Delhi government since 2015, had already got an extension for 2020 and was trying to get it for 2021 too. The Olympian wrestler’s job at the parent department is also at stake after the arrest. The star wrestler was on Sunday arrested from Mundka for his alleged involvement in the murder of former international wrestler Sagar Dhankar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/northern-railway-set-to-suspend-olympian-following-his-arrest/articleshow/82921202.cms||Vibha Sharma

CPM’s Sitaram Yechury said it was “shameful” that the government’s priority, instead of providing healthcare and vaccines to all, was on unleashing Delhi Police on a social media platform.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/congress-cpm-slam-raids-on-twitter/articleshow/82927357.cms||Swati Mathur

On Saturday, TOI had reported about how a majority of students were facing financial hardships as their parents have either lost jobs or their pay reduced or suffered losses in business due to Covid-19 induced restrictions. Senate members, mostly the elected representatives, requested the pro-VC to take action against colleges, particularly those offering professional courses like engineering and law, that weren’t allowing students to fill up the NU examination forms without paying fees. Citing the AICTE guidelines, the members appealed to the NU administration to direct colleges to charge only the tuition fees as full-time classes were not held in the academic year 2020-21. The senators included Vishnu Changde, Samay Bansod, Tarzan Gaikwad, Waman Turke, Pravin Udapure, Sameer Parate and others. They met Dudhe as according to them, VC Subhash Chaudhari wasn’t keeping well and believed to be in home isolation since last one week or so. According to the members, Dudhe has assured to table the issue of reduction in NU exam fees and college charges before the forthcoming Management Council meeting. They said Dudhe also agreed to the demand to constitute a panel for waiving the exam and college tuition fees of students who were either infected by Covid-19 or have lost their parents to it. The panel would comprise Senate members along with NU officials. The NU administration also responded positively to Senate members’ demand to introduce an insurance scheme for the students and NU staffers. The members demanded that NU should bear entire expenses for the insurance amount for students at least for this year considering the pandemic situation. The members told TOI that NU must refund the fees as it didn’t have to conduct manual evaluation and moderation of answer sheets papers for the last two exams. “Moreover, NU would also be saving on holding papers at the exam centres and appointing invigilators and other staff there, besides transportation. Additionally, it didn’t have to print lakhs of questions papers and answer sheets, thus saving on printing. Since last many years, it has been earning crores in exam fees and now the time has come to help the aggrieved students,” the members told TOI||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nu-senate-members-meet-pro-vc-demand-exam-tuition-fee-cut/articleshow/82938919.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Delhi||How Delhi can turn the tide in see-saw battle||NEW DELHI: As Delhi prepares to relax the Covid-19 lockdown amid a vaccine shortage, mask compliance will become even more important in keeping another wave of infections at bay. However, action in this regard must be quickly initiated. Studies across the world have shown a combination of measures can be taken to increase mask compliance and induce behavioural change among the citizens of the capital. With the vaccine as a weapon against Covid highly unlikely due to its unavailability in numbers needed for mass protection of people of all ages, experts told TOI that the state government’s thrust after reopening must be on mask awareness campaigns accompanied by distribution of free masks. The prevailing fine of Rs 2,000 for ignoring masks can continue but shouldn’t be considered the primary tool of social change. Times ViewThe coronavirus has been around in India for over 14 months. Yet as a nationwide study shows, only 14% are wearing the mask properly. This is both alarming and exasperating. We all know that masks are important in preventing infection. Apart from strong punitive measures against the errant, more awareness campaigns by celebrities underlining their benefits and the perils of not using them should be launched. There should be no let-up either in enforcement of rules or raising awareness, if the city wants to defeat a potential third waveYale researcher Mushfiq Mobarak, who tested over 20 different strategies to popularise mask usage in Bangladesh, identified four interventions that tripled mask usage over time. Giving the four the acronym NORM, Mobarak cited these as No-cost mask distribution, Offering information and spreading awareness, Reinforcement and Modelling information through community leaders. The researcher told TOI that Delhi could implement a mix of strategies depending on the population base, including the large number of migrants. “Besides research in rural setups, we are studying cities such as Lahore, Dhaka and one in Telangana,” Mobarak said. “Of the strategies we tried there, we discovered that penalising people wasn’t as effective as making them aware and distributing free masks. However, this did not work until we appointed people to regularly go to neighbourhoods and reinforce the belief in the safety offered by masks.” The Yale study also found that while a lockdown was four times more effective in reducing transmission of the virus than mask adoption, the cost benefit of mass distribution of surgical masks outweighed the economic cost of a lockdown. Epidemiologist Chandrakant Lahariya, however, pointed out free mask distribution would come with its own challenges, but RWAs could prove to be of assistance. Dr Lahariya also suggested spreading awareness through sustained campaigns over the next few weeks. “We mustn’t forget that many of the migrant workers will return when the city reopens and so stricter enforcement of public health measures would be needed,” Lahariya said. “While I am not big on punitive action, involving community leaders is the need of the hour. One other approach could be to ask construction companies to ensure masks for their labourers. NGOs can similarly be requested to distribute masks in slum areas.” Parvinder Singh of the World Food Programme said the city needed to devise a more thorough strategy to drive a change in social behaviour, not by criminalising aberrant behaviour and mask ignorance, but by empowering people. Singh added that while masks were visible indicators of change in social behaviour, improving hygiene and enforcing social distancing should also be simultaneously encouraged. Rakesh Mehta, who formerly served as municipal commissioner of the undivided Municipal Corporation of Delhi and later as Delhi’s chief secretary, concurred. "We need to intensely carry out a campaign to spread the message that double masking is our only protection till the vaccine is freely available,” said Mehta. “Unless people realise that they are themselves the first line of defence against the coronavirus, no meaningful progress can be made in this regard.” With his experience of having created a groundswell against pollution in the capital, Mehta also suggested that Delhi’s residents should be made constantly aware, uncomfortably so, of the danger the coronavirus posed, using, if need be, colour coding and visual indicators to send urgent subliminal messages. Mehta also advised localising relevant information. “Put up boards and light markers that inform residents in colonies and localities of the number of Covid cases and the level of danger in their vicinity. Instead of releasing city-level data, put up boards telling people about the number of cases in their district, locality or street," he suggested. Mehta said that the changing graphs put up at street corners showing cases going up or down would create positive and negative feedback to encourage good behaviour. K S Mehra, former commissioner of the undivided MCD and author of “State of the Capital”, advocated targeted behaviour change campaigns. “Use social media and television to target sections of people. With so many deaths and destruction having taken place, people may be more receptive to precautionary measures,” said Mehra. Never having faced such a challenge earlier, Delhi needed to think of and use novel methods, said Mehra. He also pointed out that the usual street plays and munaadis organised by the municipal corporations wouldn’t work when people were home-bound. “The best way to reach them will, therefore, be through media that has access to homes, television and mobile phones,” he said. Both the former commissioners felt that the experience of the Bhagidari movement could be recalled to ensure that RWAs propelled the anti-Covid messages. Amid this, a civic official pointed out that while the unified MCD had officers especially designated for public health communication, these posts were currently vacant. Given the importance of their role, the official remarked, “Hopefully, the administration will learn from the earlier experience with the pandemic and urgently fill the vacancies.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-delhi-can-turn-the-tide-in-see-saw-battle/articleshow/82956960.cms||Paras Singh
---||Nagpur||Nagpur’s Centre Point school group partners with Lighthouse Learning||Nagpur: Centre Point Group of Schools has entered into a strategic partnership with education services firm Lighthouse Learning (formerly known as EuroKids International). Lighthouse Learning is backed by global investment giant KKR, which has over $250 billion in assets under management. Apart from academic integration, the two groups are eyeing expansion of CPS group by starting new branches. The announcement, which was made through a joint public statement, does not mention the extent of dilution in holdings of CPS group. A source however confirmed that nominees from Lighthouse Learning (LL) will be part of the group’s registered society. Regardless, both made it clear that all CPS and Mothers Pet Kindergarten branches will continue to be helmed by the original management, which is the Upadhyaya family. The school was founded in the late 80s by Aruna Upadhyaya, daughter of the late Union minister NKP Salve. Since 2011, the group has been actively managed by her elder daughter Radhika Rajwade along with husband Jaisingh. It was under Radhika that the school expanded to include the Cambridge board in its portfolio. Radhika, director of CPS group, said, “I came back from the USA in 2011 with a vision to grow the Centre Point Group of Schools beyond Nagpur and implement best practices, curriculum and learnings I gained through my education and work experience abroad. I am very excited that this partnership will ensure the same.” Prajodh Rajan, co-founder and group CEO Lighthouse Learning, said, “We welcome The Centre Point Group of Schools, including Mother’s Pet Kindergarten, to the Lighthouse Learning family. This partnership will enable us to provide world-class, outcome-based education to students in Nagpur and expand our presence in the city. Our mission is to provide a holistic and well-rounded educational foundation to Pre-School and K-12 students that will instil a love for learning in their academic journey and beyond.” Rajan’s statement went on to add that under this new partnership, Centre Point Group will retain its original brand. “We will be delighted to continue the legacy of Aruna Upadhyaya and work alongside Radhika Rajwade, who will continue to manage the Centre Point Group of Schools,” said Rajan. Lighthouse Learning’s portfolio includes 38 K-12 schools and 1,200+ preschools across India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nagpurs-centre-point-school-group-partners-with-lighthouse-learning/articleshow/82950165.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Delhi||Nothing wrong in Delhi govt order putting all docs in one category:HC||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Monday said there was nothing wrong in the decision of Delhi government directing all doctors and medical staff to function in a single category, irrespective of the differences in their seniority and specialisation, in treatment of Covid patients, saying there should not be any “ego issue”. Justice Rekha Palli said that “prima facie” there was nothing wrong with the May 16 notification, which appeared to be dealing only with Covid management duties of doctors and they should not come to court with such pleas. “What is the problem with this? What is your ego issue in this? I don’t see anything wrong in this. I am sorry a doctor is coming to court like this. Prima facie I see nothing wrong with the order. It is only with regard to Covid management,” Justice Palli said at the start of the hearing of the petition, which challenged the notification contending that it was arbitrary and issued without the approval of the LG. The petitioner-doctor, represented by advocate Payal Bahl, was aggrieved by the notification as it put allopathic and non-allopathic doctors as well as junior and senior residents in one category for treating Covid patients, claiming that this could put patients’ lives at risk. Delhi government, represented by additional standing counsel Anuj Aggarwal said he needs time to get proper clarification and the court listed the matter for hearing on May 27.

The formula is yet to get the final nod but it is expected that the UBSE will decide a Class X student’s marks on the basis of five pointers — including performance in the pre-board and half-yearly exams, performance in the internal assessment, attendance record (since November 2020 when schools reopened for offline classes), marks obtained in the project work, and performance of the student in Class IX. The assessment criterion is yet to be approved by the state education department and a government order is yet to be released in this regard. Meanwhile, the SCERT (State Council for Educational Research and Training) has decided to conduct a training session for the principals of the schools set to be converted into Atal Utkrisht Schools. The session will be held from May 26-28. The SCERT has already issued an order to all the Chief Education Officers (CEO) in this regard. These English-medium schools will be affiliated with the CBSE.

Once ready, it will be a major point of industrial goods offload, officials said. “We have proposed the logistics and warehousing hub in Tappal Bajna Urban Centre under the Master Plan Phase-II. We have appointed Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India for preparing the feasibility study-cum-DPR of the proposed logistics and warehousing hub in the area,” said Monika Rani, additional CEO of YEIDA .While the inception report has been submitted by the consultant, it has also recommended that the logistics and warehousing hub be well connected via road and rail. The report suggests connecting this hub with the Delhi-Palwal rail road, with 16km of track laid for the purpose. “There is Chola railway station near Tappal. But specific proposals for rail connectivity shall be made by the consultant with justified recommendations in the draft DPR, which is yet to be submitted,” she said.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Deceased field worker’s kin seeks more support||ASHA worker Surekha Gurav (49), a resident of Satara’s Khatav taluka, was a familiar face to many. She would visit Covid-19 patients in home quarantine, distribute medicines and take updates, apart from alerting the primary health centre (PHC) if someone infected showed signs of deterioration. In May, she herself tested positive. Gurav’s elder daughter Mayuri who lives in Thane, said, “The doctor in the PHC referred her for an oxygen bed as her saturation was low.” But it was not easy to locate one. Gurav’s son drove her to a government hospital 10 km away from the PHC, but it had no oxygen beds. He then drove her another 10 km to a Covid-19 facility where she was admitted and given oxygen support. “A day later, doctors there said she needed an HRCT, but they did not have it. So, they referred her to the jumbo Covid centre in Satara, 60 km away,” said Mayuri. Her mother eventually succumbed on May 22. Gurav was the main breadwinner for her family. They have been assured compensation but Mayuri said for ASHA workers, who put their lives at risk for the community, the state must provide better health facilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-deceased-field-workers-kin-seeks-more-support/articleshow/82923154.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Patriarchy blocks women’s access to healthcare||AHMEDABAD: Nirmala (name changed to protect identity), a 33-year-old living in Patadi village of Gujarat contracted Covid five days after her husband got the infection. She looked after her husband, prepared his meals, washed his clothes and utensils while he rested and recuperated. She had no choice. However, when she was in need of care, her father-in-law called her parents, and asked them what must be done about it. Another woman in the village, Kokila (not her real name), was nearly starving since her father-in-law died of Covid. When an ASHA worker in Patadi checked her oxygen levels, they were plunging to 90. Despite complaining, Kokila’s symptoms were ignored by her family and today she’s battling for life against Covid. The accounts of Kokila and Nirmala are among the few documented in an ongoing study by a Gujarat-based NGO, Society for Women’s Action and Training Initiative (SWATI). The aim is to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on girls and women in rural areas. “The study is being undertaken across villages in three districts of Gujarat — Patan, Surendranagar, and Mahisagar,” said Poonam Kathuria, director, SWATI. “We have interviewed a cross-section of people including ASHA workers, Covid survivors, and women in villages. Distressing stories of gender discrimination have come to the fore.” Gender discrimination and suppression have viscerally existed in the state. Adding a pandemic to the imbalanced equation is forcing women like Nirmala to literally fight for survival, according to the study. “The plight of daughters-in-law in village families is even worse as they’re stigmatized for risking the entire household,” reveal the findings. Women often do not get tested despite symptoms. “They are instead made to drink hot water and herbal concoctions, and to take medicines and continue with their chores,” said Jashodaben Bhil, a resident of Radhanpur village who works as a counsellor with SWATI and is aiding the study. “They are made to do all the household work, not allowed to rest, and are stigmatized,” Jashodaben said. “That worsens their health.” Jashodaben went on to say: “We have come across cases in which women, whose husbands are Covid positive, are made to stay with them and clean after them.” She added: “In turn, the women are often at risk of infection but their need for treatment will not be taken care of.” According to ASHA workers, nutrition and food intake of families have suffered, the study says. “There have been increased complaints of anaemia, malnutrition and miscarriages over the past year,” the study says. “In a family with an infected member, the needs of a pregnant woman too are neglected.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/patriarchy-blocks-womens-access-to-healthcare/articleshow/82923195.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Kolkata||Kolkata Police hospital, Barrackpore stadium facilities boost Covid care numbers||KOLKATA/BARRACKPORE: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday inaugurated two Covid care facilities, the 300-bed Medica Kolkata Police Hospital in Bhowanipore and a 100-bed facility at Barrackpore stadium. The Bhowanipore facility, housed in the same building as the old Kolkata Police hospital-—will have 40 HDU beds. For the rest general beds, 150 will be set aside for police and110 will cater to other residents. The hospital, upgraded in 18 days, will be managed by the Medica group of hospitals and has been built on a PPP model, with support from Bandhan Bank and donation from the German consulate. Besides commissioner Soumen Mitra, Bandhan bank CEO managing director Chandra Sekhar Ghosh and Medica Hospital chairman and MD Alok Roy were present at the inauguration. The CM thanked all the stakeholders—Kolkata Police, Medica, Bandhan Bank and the state health department—for the effort. “The hospital lacked certain facilities and it is heartening to see it being transformed into a Covid care unit in such a short time,” Banerjee said. The hospital worked as a satellite unit of SSKM. “Now that this is a Covid care facility, we believe the best treatment will be available. The state takes this opportunity to thank you all,” she said, even as she reminded police to continue to serve food to the needy, especially the marginalized. “We have started vaccination of rickshaw pullers, bus drivers, auto drivers, small grocers, those who interact with hundreds of people. We will ensure they get priority vaccination,” Banerjee said. Commissioner Mitra pointed out that the day Banerjee took oath as the chief minister for the third term on May 5, she visited the hospital and urged them to make it a Covid care facility on a PPP model. “We followed her instructions,” Mitra said. “I am pleased to see the inauguration of this additional Covid facility at the old Kolkata Police Hospital, financed with a contribution of almost 1.88 million Euros from the German government and the rest 2.9 million Euros from PPP initiatives. Germany’s solidarity thus reaches out to all parts of India affected by the pandemic. The partnership with Medica has proved to be effective during last year’s relief efforts,” said German consul general Manfred Auster. The Barrackpore facility was inaugurated by MLA Raj Chakraborty, who was accompanied by Barrackpore police commissioner Manoj Kumar Verma. The100-bed facility has been set up with the collaborated efforts of the state and Barrackpore Techno Global Hospital. “Instructed and inspired by Banerjee, we have converted what was a safe home into a Covid hospital in Barrackpore stadium. We were struggling hard to hospitalize Covid patients in the Barrackpore area. This new facility will help in the treatment of more patients. We got support from Barrackpore Techno Global Hospital, which will supervise the medical emergency services. We are trying to increase the number of beds and set up more such facilities,” said Chakraborty, a director. Prasanta Chowdhury, chief administrator of Titagarh municipality, said some safe homes, with oxygen parlours, had been up in Barrackpore and Titagarh. “Now that the 20-bed safe home in Barrackpore Stadium has been turned into a Covid hospital, 100 patients can be treated there at a time,” he said. Critical patients will be sent to Barrackpore Techno Global hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/police-hosp-barrackpore-stadium-facilities-boost-cov-care-numbers/articleshow/82921310.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

After hearing arguments from both sides, the bench of Justices Rajiv Sahai Endlaw and C Hari Shankar said it saw no ground for an urgent hearing. Seeking the adjournment, SG Tushar Mehta had said the court was hearing only extremely urgent cases while law officers were busy handling Covid-related and other matters. “Nobody is dying due to not having marriage certificates,” he said. Senior advocate Saurabh Kirpal, appearing for the petitioners, argued for the matter to be taken up expeditiously, possibly next week. He said members of the LGBT community being forced to suppress their feelings and desire to get married to partners of their choice was discriminatory. The Centre’s position is that marriage between two individuals of the same gender was neither recognised nor accepted in any uncodified personal laws or codified statutory laws.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-one-dying-for-not-having-marriage-certificate-government-tells-court/articleshow/82927366.cms||---

The state met with a blank, but BMC received three bids for supply of the Russian-made Sputnik V at a rate of about Rs 1,500 for both doses. It is likely to extend the bid by a week at least as the scrutiny process is not complete. “We have had talks with all three companies, but so far, they are yet to submit the authorisation letter from the original manufacturer stating they are authorised and capable of supplying the vaccines to BMC. So if we don’t get these documents, we will extend the EOI for another week,” said a senior civic official. BMC is also unsure whether the bidders can provide the vaccines within three weeks as it wants. So, municipal commissioner I S Chahal has written to Kirill Dimitriev, CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), for supply of 1 crore vaccine doses directly. RDIF, Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, is marketing it. Maharashtra had floated a global bid seeking 50 million vaccines approved by WHO and USFDA, and asked the bidders to get central approval. “We have not received any response. A decision on extension of the EOI will be taken on Tuesday,” said state health minister Rajesh Tope. He added that supply from Indian vaccine manufacturers has not been as per schedule. “Though we have been promised 1 crore doses from June onwards by Serum Institute, there has not been any written communication regarding the stocks and the delivery timeline,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-draws-blank-to-vaccine-global-tender-bmc-likely-to-extend-time-for-three-bidders/articleshow/82923189.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Abraham was among the lucky few who were rescued from the rough sea. He was floating in the rough sea for almost 14 hours before he was rescued by the crew of INS Kochi. Recounting the horrific experience, Abraham told TOI that he held the hands of his colleague Vinod Wagh, a Maharashtra native, throughout to ensure that they stay together in the sea so that the rescue team could spot them easily. “We were informed about the weather report earlier itself and all the other ships in the region left for shore. By May 16, weather started changing and winds turned stronger. The next day the anchor of the barge, which was working on a project of ONGC, broke and since then it was self-floating,” said Abraham. “The crew members were ready to take on any emergency and were ready wearing their life jackets. Weather was furious and the floating barge went and smashed against the platform of the rig,” he said. A big hole formed on the barge and water started gushing in. “We did not have time to think twice and we all jumped into the sea wearing our life jackets,” he added. He said that before jumping into the sea they all had decided to hold their hands and try to stay together maximum so that those coming to rescue them would find them easily. But things did not go as they wished due to the high waves. “It was not possible for all of us to stay together. Some were taken away by the waves and were lost from the group. Soon, groups turned small in numbers. We held on to those who came our way,” he said. He also said that during the long hours in the sea, they tried to reassure each other saying that the rescue mission will soon happen. After being in the sea for over 14 hours, Abraham and others were relived to sea INS Kochi arriving to rescue them. However, the ship could not sail towards them as there was a risk of the bottom of the ship hitting against the barge which had already sunk. Finally, Abraham and Wagh were able to move towards the ship and they were rescued. They stayed in the ship till May 20, after which they sailed to Mumbai harbour. He had joined duty in the barge on November 4, 2020. Now, he wants to spend time with family members to leave those horrific memories behind.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/mebin-floated-in-the-rough-sea-for-14-hrs-before-being-rescued/articleshow/82919509.cms||Jaikrishnan Nair

Police told the court that Matrix can get released its goods awaiting customs clearance at Indira Gandhi International Airport, send some of the samples for testing and can sell its products in the market, but if any of its imported items is found to be defective or if the company is selling them by making false representations or at prices which are not legally permissible, then it will seize such goods. The company told the high court that it was agreeable to the terms set by police as it wanted its goods to be taken out of customs to avoid payment of any further demurrage charges. In view of the submissions by both sides, Justice Asha Menon disposed of the plea moved by the company to restrain police from taking any coercive measures like seizure of its oxygen concentrators or other related products it would be importing or has imported in connection with Covid-19 treatment.

Her petition said she incurs monthly expenses of over Rs 1.4 lakh towards treatment, including nursing staff, physiotherapy, medicines etc, and over Rs 70,000 on household expenses. She also has to spend on the education of her children. The husband suffered a cardiac arrest followed by a hypoxic/ischemic brain injury in November 2017. He was on ventilator support at Global Hospital, Parel. He was slowly weaned off the ventilator. The hospital’s medical certificate dated April 5, 2021 states he has been in a vegetative state since January 2018 and he is under its care and observation at his home. “The patient is not in a condition to communicate and has been bed-ridden since three and a half years. The patient’s neurological condition has not improved in this duration… At present he cannot perform any kind of day-to-day activities,” it said. State’s advocate Jyoti Chavan said a team of JJ Hospital doctors may be directed to visit the patient and submit a report. To the court’s query, the woman’s advocate Tejas Dande said the couple’s oldest son has begun working in Canada, but his income is barely enough to meet his needs. “It’s an unfortunate case,” said Justice Kathawalla, recalling passing an order in a similar case. The judges directed the JJ Hospital dean to constitute the team to visit and examine the petitioner’s husband and “submit their report as to his present condition”. They posted the hearing for June 9 before the regular court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/guardianship-plea-hc-directs-docs-to-visit-comatose-man-in-mumbai/articleshow/82924936.cms||Rosy Sequeira

Sambhajiraje, a descendant of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, is a leading figure in the demand for reservation to the Marathas. Recently, the Supreme Court turned down the law passed by the state legislature to grant reservations to the Marathas in education and government jobs. While, many Maratha organisations have declared to start fresh rounds of agitations, Sambhajiraje said there is no need for agitations when 58 silent rallies have already been held across the state that forced the state government to pass the law. “There is no need to utter the word unrest among the community or start an agitation. Once I wrap my state-wide tour, I will meet chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and other prominent leaders,” Sambhajiraje said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/sambhajiraje-starts-tour-for-maratha-quota/articleshow/82917258.cms||---

The Kozhikode native, who has been working as a supervisor for Mumbai-based firm Mathew Associates for 17 years, displayed resilience and grit to stay afloat for 11 hours despite being tossed by huge waves. Back in the safety of his home at Poothampara in Kavilumpara panchayat, Balachandran said there were moments when he felt that he wouldn’t make it. But, he didn’t lose hope. Recounting the moments when the cyclone wrecked the barge, Balachandran said there was a general feeling among occupants that the eight, strong anchors would hold the vessel intact even if it had to face winds of 60 knots. “We were hit by cyclone with winds reaching speeds of 120 knots. By 7am we understood that things have gone out of hand as the barge was shaking violently. By 9.30am we came to know that six of the eight anchors had snapped making it unstable. We were worried that the vessel would sway and hit Heera platform that had a lot of pipes containing gas and oil. It could have led to an explosion,” he said. Balachandran said that with no anchors holding it firm, the vessel swayed with the wind and hit an unmanned platform. “The impact created a hole in the base of the vessel, water gushed inside and the barge started sinking slowly tilting to the starboard side. Massive waves started lashing the deck and soon the captain gave ‘abandon ship’ call,” he said. Steps were taken to deploy life rafts; but 18 on the starboard side were inaccessible. Of the 12 on the port side, except three all were damaged. Two rafts were launched; one developed a puncture after people boarded it and people wearing lifejackets were thrown into the sea. The other raft, which had 12 persons, hit a huge wave and they vanished, he said. Balachandran said naval ships couldn’t come closer as the sea was rough and the barge was adrift. They were stationed two nautical miles away. “We clung on to the barge till 5pm and then jumped into the violent sea, one by one. Some had climbed to the helideck which was the highest point on the barge thinking that they will be able to hold on for some more time. They were tossed into the sea when the barge finally turned upside down and sank,” he said. Balachandran said that he and others held hands to form a chain of 18 persons. Staying afloat in the violent waves was a herculean task. Salt water entered our eyes and waves were so violent that it sent jets of water inside our noses and ears. I ingested water and started vomiting. It was pitch dark and light in my lifejacket stopped working, he said “It gave me hope when the waves tossed me high to the crest from where I could see the lights of rescue ships stationed at a distance. But the next movement, they buried me in turbulent waters,” he added. Balachandran said that when they reached near INS Kochi, waves split the group into two and he was then part of a six-member group. “The scramble net dropped from the ship was within my reach. But, I was so exhausted that I couldn’t even lift my hand to grab it. Then the waves lifted me and helped me climb the step of the climbing net. I fell down thrice while trying to climb up the net and managed to make it,” he said. Balachandran said he was the oldest among the 261 occupants and the other two, aged 58 and 57, couldn’t make it to safety.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/resilience-and-grit-kept-him-alive/articleshow/82919520.cms||---

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Celebrity candidates lose in polls, but go on with pandemic relief work||KOLKATA: Some of the celebrity candidates—Trinamool’s Saayoni Ghosh and Sayantika Banerjee, Left’s Debdut Ghosh and BJP’s Parno Mittra—may have lost the assembly elections but they have been helping people in their constituencies and beyond tackle the Covid crisis. Saayani on Thursday went to Korapara and Kakardanga in Kalipahari under Asansol South to distribute food, masks, soap and umbrellas among 400 children. “During the election campaign, I saw most children wore ill-fitted, big masks. So, we gave them customized masks,” she said. She also visited Jamdoba Santhal village in Damra, met kids from Booths 267 and 268 in Basra and those from the Bauri community in Satagram to distribute relief. “After Amphan last year, I had floated the Bengal Above All project and had given relief to the dhaaki, a transgender community in South 24 Parganas and Nadia. Working for the people isn’t poll-centric. A win helps work with a lot of authority. But there are alternatives,” she said. Debdut lost his sister-inlaw to Covid a couple of weeks ago. But personal loss and his defeat in the polls couldn’t stop him from working with 12 volunteers and their coordinator. “We run a patient rescue van in Tollygunge,” he said. On Saturday, he went to collect five oxygen cylinders donated by producer Sandip Basu. “It’s a pandemic and I see no political colour while working for the people. . A doctor has donated Rs 20,000, which will be used for the funding of Priyanath Manna Bustee Community Kitchen,” he said. With Sayantika’s father now recovering from Covid-19, she couldn’t make it to Bankura. “I have built a safe home there and I am organizing distribution of essentials. I have started Duare Oxygen in Bankura. With support from DM Radhika Aiyar, a triage centre has been set up in a minibus outside Bankura Sammilani Medical College. I have two ambulances,” she said. Parno is using her social media reach to amplify verified Covid resource messages for medicines, bed and oxygen cylinders. She has also been retweeting content on vaccines. But Rudranil’s social media profile has been silent ever since his defeat. Occasional glamorous photos, Akshay Tritya greetings or promotional posts now populate tweets of BJP’s Yash, Srabanti, Tanusree and Paayel. But Yash and Tanusree claimed social media was not an index for measuring work. “My Covid helpine in Shyampur is operational and I am calling my karyakartas to help the infected,” Tanusree said. Yash said he was in touch with his Mandal presidents in Chanditala. “Not everyone needs to show what they are doing on social media,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/celeb-candidates-lose-in-polls-but-go-on-with-pandemic-relief-work/articleshow/82921345.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

The state will also be sending a detailed memorandum seeking compensation to the affected residents. “We have sought a tour of the affected areas by a central team. Once that is done, we will send a detailed memorandum seeking compensation for the losses as per the National Disaster Relief Fund norms,” said Vijay Wadettiwar, minister of relief and rehabilitation. Officials said that the major losses have been reported from the coastal districts of Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg. “Raigad district has reported the most damage. However, other districts like Pune, Thane have reported some damage as well,” said an official. Between the three coastal districts a total of 12,000 hectares of farmland have been damaged and nearly 10,000 structures were damaged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-writes-to-centre-seeking-compensation-for-cyclone-hit/articleshow/82925042.cms||---
---||Goa||HC to Goa government: Make more vaccines available to 18-44s||PANAJI: The high court of Bombay at Goa on Monday asked the state government to make more vaccines available to the 18-44 age group, as well as to submit a policy decision, if any, on its plan to procure the shots from sources other than the Union government. It said that Goa, with a population of barely 15 lakh, could set an example for the rest of the country by getting its entire population vaccinated. “It is fairly clear that success in containing this pandemic lies very much in a vaccination drive, that is proven the world over,” a bench comprising justices SC Gupte and MS Sonak said. The court took note of the fact that the state has over 2 lakh doses for the 45+ category, and suggested that the government announce a date by which this age group should be vaccinated. “Otherwise, make them available for the lower (18-44) age group,” the bench said, adding that there shouldn’t be a situation where vaccines are available but the state is unable to administer them. Advocate general Devidas Pangam told the court that the government has a plan for this. Meanwhile, assistant solicitor general of India Pravin Faldessai told the court that the Centre is focusing on delivering vaccines to 97,000 identified villages in India where ambulances won’t be able to reach in the event of a Covid outbreak, and added that even larger states like Arunachal Pradesh have been allotted only 5,000 doses of the vaccine. “Supply will gradually increase,” he said. However, the Centre agreed to file an affidavit on Covid doses to be issued to the state for both the present and long-term, so as to take care of second doses to be administered to priority age groups, as well as for the vaccination of other age groups. The court stated that it didn’t mean Goa should be given priority over other states, but asked the government whether it is exclusively relying on the Union government for the vaccines. Pangam stated that two foreign companies stated that they would not deal with individual states. The court then asked the government to consider requesting other states that are inviting global tenders to consider including Goa’s requirement as well. TOI reported on Monday that Pfizer and Moderna said they would deal only with the Union government. The petitioners in the writ petition presented a slew of suggestions to the court, from recommending a government drive in villages to eliminate the issue of mobility, to suggesting that the state consider a door-to-door campaign to vaccinate senior citizens. Meanwhile, the bench asked the state to make all beds in Goa Medical College’s (GMC) new super-specialty block operational “irrespective” of today’s (Monday) position. The court also asked for more clarity on the increase of manpower to handle the additional medical infrastructure that the state has proposed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hc-to-govt-make-more-vax-available-to-18-44s/articleshow/82923257.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Delhi||Covid further drains out Delhi corporations’ coffers||NEW DELHI: This year’s pandemic has already started impacting the revenue collection of corporations from the major sources. The collection from property tax, licensing fees, etc has come down to one third or even less forcing municipalities to approach the state government to issue relief packages to improve their financial situation. East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) has collected only about Rs 1.6 crore till date as property tax from 2,400 taxpayers in comparison to Rs 50 crore last year. In 2019-20, the collection was Rs 30 crore till May 31 and 11,232 people submitted the tax. In North Delhi Municipal Corporation, the collection from property tax has been Rs 15 lakh so far in comparison to zero collection in 2020-21 till this time and Rs 175 crore in 2019-20. Mayor Jai Prakash said that they have demanded a relief package of Rs 1,000 crore to meet the basis requirement. Due to Covid pandemic, civic bodies are also facing issues in holding camps in residential and commercial areas unlike previous years when teams were sent to different places to collect property tax cheques in large numbers. South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) has collected Rs 42 crore in 2021-22 till May 21. In comparison, the collection in the first quarter (till June 30) was Rs 275.5 crore in 2020-21, Rs 315 crore in 2019-20 and Rs 332.6 crore in 2018-19. SDMC leader of house Narendra Chawla said that the situation was extremely disappointing this time. “We managed to cope with the situation last year but things don’t look promising so far this time. We are motivating people to submit tax by giving a 3% rebate on residential properties after they give an affidavit of vaccination. We have even introduced a mobile app for submitting tax online. There is also a plan to increase the deadline for giving rebates on submitting advance tax by a month,” he said further. The civic body is considering making some policies to augment its revenue collection. “With the next year being an election year, we need to speed up the process so that the projects, which have already been approved, can take off. SDMC has targeted to collect Rs 950 crore from property tax this year and we really need to work hard to achieve it,” said Chawla. The pandemic has resulted in a sharp decline in the number of health trade licences renewed too. In EDMC, 2,678 health trade licences were renewed in 2018, 2,615 in 2019, 725 in 2020 and 702 till May 21, 2021. “People have no money to meet their household requirement, forget about renewing licences. We are waiting for the lockdown to get over after which meetings will be called with various department heads to finalise future plans,” said EDMC mayor Nirmal Jain. In North Corporation, 2,592 health trade licences were renewed in 2018 and only 769 in 2021. In South Corporation, the number of licences renewed was 3,750 in 2018, 3,673 in 2019, 568 in 2020 and 778 in 2021. There has been a sharp decline in the number of general trade licence renewals too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-further-drains-out-corpns-coffers/articleshow/82957113.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Kochi||Naming new state police chief not an easy task||Thiruvananthapuram: As DGP Loknath Behera’s tenure as the state police chief ends on June 30, those in the state’s police ranks are keeping their fingers crossed as they await the next police chief. Ever since Centre revised the rules, making it the prerogative of the Union public service commission (UPSC) to pick the final three from the names eligible for the post, the predictions have become uncertain as the criteria for shortlisting eligible names also include competence and integrity of the contenders that would be assessed on the basis of the reports from agencies like IB, CVC, department of personnel and training and also their service records. As per police sources, all ADGPs who have completed 30 years in service are eligible to become DGPs. From Kerala, there are 12 officers whose names have been shortlisted and forwarded to the Centre, beginning with Arun Kumar Sinha from the 1987 batch to Sanjeeb Kumar Patjoshi of the 1991 batch. “UPSC would consider each officer, according to seniority, on the basis of their merit. But the frontrunners are likely to be ADGPs Tomin J Thachankary and vigilance director K Sudesh Kumar as the senior-most among the lot, Arun Kumar Sinha is unlikely to return to the state,” said home department sources. Though DGP (prisons and correctional services) Rishi Raj Singh from the 1985 batch is the senior-most officer after Loknath Behera, he is unlikely to be considered as he would retire from service on July 31. While Thachankary (presently CMD of Kerala Financial Corporation) will be in service till July 31, 2023, Kumar’s service ends on October 31, 2022. If Thachankary – being the senior among the two – is picked for the post, Kumar (presently director of VACB) will not get a term as the state police chief. Among the shortlisted names, Arun Kumar Sinha (director, special protection group), Nitin Agarwal (IG, Sashastra Seema Bal), Harinath Mishra (additional director, IB), Ravada A Chandrasekhar (additional director, IB) and Sanjeeb Kumar Patjoshi (joint secretary, ministry of Panchayati Raj) are on central deputation. UPSC would consider only those who are willing to return to Kerala from central deputation. But there have been instances where state governments have found loopholes to overcome rules, including handing over the post of police chief as an additional charge to another DGP-ranking officer (holding some other post), to circumvent the law and avoid appointment of eligible officers who are not in the good books of the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/naming-new-state-police-chief-not-an-easy-task/articleshow/82919564.cms||KP Saikiran
---||Delhi||‘Drastic steps must to get black fungus drug’||New Delhi: The Centre needs to take some “drastic steps” to procure Amphotericin B — used for treating black fungus — as the gap is “too wide to bridge”, Delhi High Court said on Monday. “Proportions are humongous and gap is too wide, there have to be drastic measures since there is a huge shortfall despite your efforts,” a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh observed, adding that the gap between the demand and supply is more than one-third and it cannot work at this pace. “It appears the present production and supply and their projections may fall well short of the requirement of the medicine to treat black fungus patients not only in Delhi but across India,” the bench pointed out, after the Centre indicated a jump in expected supply of the medicine stock in May and June, early delivery of its import and ramping up of production. Central government standing counsels Kirtiman Singh and Amit Mahajan informed the court that expected supply in May is 1.36 lakh vials, in June it will be 2.55 lakh vials. To meet the demand it is also being imported and alternative medicines for the disease are being explored. The Centre said the import order of the drug is 7.05 lakh vials and the government has also set up a portal for real time data where the states have to update the number of black fungus patients, admissions and discharges from hospitals and the deaths. The court directed the Centre to file a further status report with all the relevant details and listed the matter for hearing on May 27. Appearing for the AAP government, senior advocate Rahul Mehra said the Centre must augment supply else there will be a repeat of the oxygen crisis. But the court said this situation is very different from the oxygen crisis and “if there is very limited supply, everyone will have to take a cut across states. How do we pass any order that Centre should give it to you?” Mehra told the court that while on Friday there were around 200 cases of black fungus in the national capital, the number has increased to 475 as on Monday. The bench asked the Centre to find out if there can be more licensees, apart from the existing five firms, to manufacture the medicine. “Point is Delhi government may have asked for one lakh... The question is how you are planning to meet the demand of Delhi and of all over India. Even your projections are not sufficient to meet the demand,” it noted. Meanwhile, the court stepped in after a lawyer said her 80-year-old grandfather, who is admitted at Ganga Ram Hospital and fighting black fungus, hasn’t received a single vial of the medicine for the last five days due to which he has undergone two surgeries and possibly the third one might take place on Tuesday. The court issued notices to the two governments and the hospital and asked the authorities to try if the patient could be shifted to AIIMS, where the vials are reportedly available or arrange for medicines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/drastic-steps-must-to-get-black-fungus-drug/articleshow/82921457.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Goa||Residents struggle with work from home as Tauktae takes Goa offline||PANAJI: With work from home being the new normal, working professionals in the state largely dependent on internet connectivity have been left handicapped in the aftermath of Cyclone Tauktae. While power has been restored, the ‘high speed’ internet and fiber optics service providers have failed to restore connectivity even a week later. “I have been left without Wi-Fi now for nine days, and there is no word when services will resume. I’ve been exchanging emails since Friday, but now I can’t even get to speak to the customer care centre despite calling them 25 times in a span of five days,” said Santa Cruz resident, Anthony M, who subscribes to DNA internet service. A family in Merces had a similar experience with the service provider wherein calls to customer care would drop after a wait-time of six minutes, despite being next in line to speak to the representative. A media professional from Porvorim wrote four back-to-back emails over the course of the week requesting DNA to restore the internet service only to receive a standard apology in what seemed like a pre-drafted response. “Even electricity dept has completed its job of restoring power supply across Goa, but DNA, which has presence in only a few pockets of the state, can’t do its job efficiently. So much for professionalism. I’m regretting hiring the service,” she wrote in her last mail to the provider. Besides working professionals, the failure to restore internet services has left school and college students groping in the dark, as well. Assagao-based Mona Nalovalia’s seven-year-old daughter, who studies at Ardee’s school, is one such student whose online classes were affected after Ethernet Express failed to restore services in their area. “The school finished their online exams prior to the cyclone, however, we had signed her up for some classes. We have had to reschedule those classes,” she said. Miramar resident Steve Dias and his wife have been resorting to their mobile phone service provider’s data to make Zoom calls and complete office-related work every day. “There is a lot of damage due to trees and electric poles crashing due to the storm. They said it would be resolved soon, but it is taking longer than anticipated,” he said. Reis Magos-based filmmaker Ashvin Kumar, who hasn’t had G-wave internet service restored since the day of the storm, however, chose to be understanding about the matter. “I don’t want to discourage the service provider because they must be trying their level best. It was an overwhelming situation and already due to the pandemic their staff had depleted. Even though it’s been 10 days, and a lot of our work has stopped, I’m trying not to put more pressure on them than they must be already under,” he said. Luck, however, seems to have smiled upon a few. Claude Pinto, a hospitality professional living in Santa Cruz had his internet service restored soon after electricity was restored after the cyclonic storm. “I have been facing issues with the internet speed. It is not as up to the mark as it was prior to the storm,” he told TOI. Despite repeated attempts, TOI received no response from the service providers for the Net blackout.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/residents-struggle-with-wfh-as-tauktae-takes-goa-offline/articleshow/82923288.cms||Nida Sayed

---||Rajkot||Gujarat: Cyclone Tauktae-hit parrots get healing touch from cops||RAJKOT: Two enormous banyan trees in the Amreli police headquarters not just enhanced the campus’ greenery, but were also homes to thousands of parrots whose constant squawking was a music to cops’ ears throughout the day. But cyclone Tauktae, which hammered Amreli on May 17 and 18, uprooted both these decades-old trees. If losing these trees was a heartbreak, the sweet sound of parrots too fell silent as nearly 1,000 died and others got injured. But cops, despite their cyclone-aftermath duties, took time out to ensure that every injured parrot got treatment and started chirping in their natural environment again. What’s more, the hospital for these parrots was set up in the training centre of the police headquarters where members of a non-government organization (NGO) and veterinary doctors were roped in. Talking to TOI, Amreli superintendent of police, Nirlipt Rai, said, “There were around 3,000 parrots on trees and policemen rescued around 2,000 which could survive the injuries. They were brought to the training centre and we called a veterinary doctor to treat these birds. After ensuring they were fit to fly, all were released.” The injured birds were first spotted by Harun Rais, an assistant sub-inspector who also lives in the headquarters campus with his family. Rais and two trainee policemen had gone out to see the extent of damage on the second day of the cyclone. "It was routine for me and my children to hear the chirping of the birds. It was heartbreaking for me to see dead and injured birds. I called other trainee policemen and we all rescued the birds and took them to the training centre,” Rais said. “The sight of so many parrots and doves lying injured, some crushed beneath branches, was tragic. We took help from bird lovers and volunteers who worked hard for their treatment,” said another official in the headquarters. Besides policemen, several people used to flock near the banyan trees only to see the birds and listen to their chirping in the mornings and evenings. In fact, locals of Amreli town regularly visited the headquarters with corn to feed the injured birds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/tauktae-hit-parrots-get-healing-touch-from-cops/articleshow/82919621.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

The CBI's special leave petition said be it Narada scam or the Saradha scam, the chief minister had always attempted to create law and order situations with the help of party cadre and unsocial elements to impede the central probe agency officials from carrying out their law-mandated duties with regard to investigation and arrest of the accused. It recalled how the CM had launched a violent protest against arrest of Madan Mitra in connection with Saradha scam in 2014 and also sat on a dharna when the agency officials had in 2019 gone to Bidhannagar commissioner of police Rajeev Kumar's house for questioning him. Giving a detailed chronological narration of unfolding of events after May 17 arrest of TMC leaders Firhad Hakil, Subrata Mukherjee, Madan Mitra and Sovan Chatterjee by the CBI, the agency said, CM Mamata Banerjee in an unprecedented manner rushed to the CBI Office at 10.50 AM on May 17 and went straight to the room where the arrested persons were sitting. On entering the CBI office, the CM started shouting “You also arrest me” and forcefully demanded from CBI officials to unconditionally release the arrested accused, the CBI said in its special leave petition before the SC, It also alleged that she and her supporters actively resisted production of accused persons before the competent court in accordance with law. "The CM also made several derogatory and defamatory comments on the CBI and threatened the CBI officers present there at that time, of registering cases against them under the Disaster Management Act, 2005 and Epidemic Diseases Act, amongst others," it alleged. The CBI informed the SC that acting on the basis of the CMs threat, the Kolkata Police have now registered a case against CBI officials, who were discharging their lawful duties. However, the city police ignored to take cognisance of violent protests organised by party leaders, ministers, MPs and MLAs in violation of National Disaster Management Act during lockdown. The CBI informed the SC that given the extremely hostile atmosphere created by the CM, TMC leaders and workers, it is virtually impossible to carry out a free and fair investigation and trial in the present case. The HC had erred by releasing the arrested accused from judicial custody and allowing them to be confined in house-arrest, it said. The CBI said allowing the accused persons, who are influential TMC leaders, to remain under house-arrest would mean there was no restraint on them from tampering with the evidence and influencing the witnesses. It said the nature of accusations in the present case, the gravity of the offence, especially in light of the serious economic offence which primarily entails the present case, needs to be analysed. In the instant case, considering the aforesaid in light of the peculiar facts and circumstances of the present matter, allowing the accused to be put under house arrest serves no good purpose as it still leaves enough room for them to manipulate and alter the facts and tamper with the evidence and witnesses considering their influence and ability to abuse power.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/narada-case-cbi-challenges-house-arrest-order-in-supreme-court/articleshow/82927388.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Two deaths in a private hospital have been confirmed as cases of black fungus by the state health department. As a preparatory measure to tackle black fungus cases, the state health department has identified IPGMER (SSKM Hospital) as Bengal’s apex hospital to treat the infected patients while two other hospitals, Bankura Sammilani Medical College and North Bengal Medical College, have been designated as the regional hubs. “There are 12 confirmed cases of mucormycosis in the state so far, out of which 4 were from Bihar and 1 from Jharkhand. No new case was reported on Monday. Out of the five suspect cases, one died at Sambhunath Pandit Hospital, though the cause of the death is yet to be confirmed by an expert committee,” said state director of health services, Ajay Chakraborty. “Of the12 confirmed cases, only six are related to Covid or post Covid complication while the rest have no relation with Covid. But almost all patients have uncontrolled diabetes,” said Chakraborty Bankura Sammilani Medical College (BSMC) already has two confirmed cases. “We have a dedicated team to look after the patients infected by mucormycosis. Designating such centres is quite justifiable in case the number rises so that patients don’t have to rush all the way to Kolkata,” said Parthapratim Pradhan, principal BSMC. According to sources, SSKM Hospital has already formed a team to treat the patients coming with the symptoms of black fungus. The hospital has also conducted surgery on a 64-year-old woman who had all clinical symptoms of the infection. However, her confirmatory reports are awaited. A state level technical advisory committee has also been formed with tropical medicine head, Bibhuti Saha of School of Tropical Medicine being the chairperson. The committee has several specialist doctors across private and public healthcare facilities. The health department has also asked all other medical colleges and district hospitals to have their own mucormycosis teams so that they can manage patients without referring them to other hospitals. North Bengal Medical College also has at least two patients admitted with clinical symptoms of the infection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/5-new-black-fungus-cases-found-total-12-in-state-so-far/articleshow/82921443.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

While Rahul is in class 5, Rashmi is in class 4. They had scored above 90 per cent in their last exam. Their grandmother had a crèche and three children would come there. “I made around Rs 9,000 a month. My son worked at a private firm and my daughter-in-law was a private school teacher. So we did not have a crisis. Now, the school has agreed not to charge fees for the kids. But what will we do after that? I hope the lockdown ends soon and I am able to reopen the crèche,” she said, adding that their monthly house rent is Rs 9,000. “But whatever happens, I will not part with them,” she said.Aastha (7) and Ashima (6) whose family is from Jammu and Kashmir, lost their parents and grandparents recently. Now, they are with their aunt in Bareilly. The girls still don’t know that their parents have passed away. Their uncle Rajiv, a father of two, who runs a coaching centre, said: “We will take care of them. If the government helps, it should continue for some time.”For children with special needs, the problem is more acute. Sagar (17), Samira (14) and Saira (11) recently lost their father, the only earning member in the family. Their uncle Anuj says Sagar has special needs and he could not clear his Class 8 exams last year. “I am worried about him,” Anuj said, adding that he hopes they get some assistance.Manoj Rai, director, ministry of women and child development, said the government will launch a scheme soon. “It will include financial assistance for children below 18 years. Children who have lost one or both parents would be covered by it,” he said, adding that the details are being finalised.Experts, however, said the real challenge will be to monitor how the money is utilised. Former Supreme Court judge Madan B Lokur said the Union cabinet has approved a change in the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, that authorises district collectors/magistrates to approve adoptions. “The burden will now be with the executive to approve adoptions. But how will the state know if the money is reaching the child?” he asked.Satya Prakash, manager, FXB India Suraksha, an NGO that runs Childline in Noida, said states have not been able to utilise funds under Integrated Child Protection Scheme. “Kids have to be brought under existing schemes for their overall development,” he said.(Names of the children have been changed)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/families-want-to-keep-kids-but-plead-for-aid/articleshow/82923294.cms||Shikha Salaria
---||Nashik||Nashik city markets reopen, no significant crowding||Nashik: The city markets did not witness overcrowding of people on Monday even though the grocery markets and milk outlets reopened after 12 days of closure due to the severe restrictions imposed by the district administration. In markets like Raviwar Karanja, Main Road and M G Road, some people had stepped out to buy groceries but there was no rush. This is in contrast to the scenario when these shops used to reopen on Monday after weekend closure that was in place since last month. According to the civic and district officials, there is an increase in awareness among people about the need to observe Covid appropriate behaviour as Nashik was adversely affected in the second wave of Covid. According to the traders, before the severe restrictions from May 12, a large section of people had already stocked essential items like rice, wheat, etc. Hence fewer people stepped out to buy the essentials. “Most of the people had already purchased a stock of groceries a month or two before the severe restrictions were announced. We have also appealed to people not to overcrowd the markets,” said Prafulla Sancheti, the president of Nashik grocery traders’ association. Bapusaheb Nagargoje, the medical superintendent of Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC), said the infectivity of the coronavirus has reduced. “Apart from this, severe restrictions by the state government and authorities also put a curb on the crowding of people in public. This overall led to a drop in the number of active cases from 28,000 to 5,200 so far in the last one month,” he said. Amol Kulkarni, a city resident, said it is a positive development that the district authorities have eased severe restrictions in the district following a drop in Covid cases. “Although the grocery shops opened from Monday, I decided not to go to the markets immediately as part of precautionary measures,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-city-markets-reopen-no-significant-crowding/articleshow/82917391.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Volunteers help Covid families fight grief, pain and death, fall prey to depression||KOLKATA: A number of young students and professionals — working in the forefront as Covid volunteers providing services like arranging oxygen, medicines, ambulance, hearse and even accompanying patients and their relatives from hospitals to crematoriums are facing mental health issues with the constant exposure to grief, pain and death. The volunteers — many of them from well to do familiespointed out that at times they become numb and depressed and some have even developed ailments like lack of appetite and insomnia. “I had never witnessed death from so close before. A middle-aged Covid patient whom I was taking to a hospital in a car died in my lap and I could do nothing. The next few days I couldn’t eat, sleep or even concentrate on my work. I had stopped surfing social media and even switched off my phone before I realised I should rather focus on saving someone else’s life than grieving over someone who is gone,” said Tanumoy Naskar, a post-graduate student of Jadavpur University. Amrita Biswas, a 21-year-old college student from Garia, who has also been sharing verified oxygen and hospital leads on social media and arranging emergency medical support also broke down when the mother of aclose friend died. “We had even arranged for a hospital bed but it was too late. For two days I couldn’t concentrate on anything and needed help of a psychiatrist,” said Biswas. Addressing the situation, several voluntary groups are also organising sessions with psychologists and psychiatrists. “Our volunteers have been working 24x7 sharing necessary leads. Along with physical exhaustion, many of them were also mentally bogged down and hence we have been arranging regular sessions with psychologists,” said Debrishi Brahma, a public health specialist and a moderator of the West Bengal Covid Aid Network (WBCAN), a group of 250-plus volunteers. “There are some volunteers, who prior to this situation, hadn’t even been to a crematorium. My advice to them is to avoid personal bonding with patients so that it doesn’t affect in case something happens. The volunteers need to work like doctors and healthcare workers,” said psychologist Devika De Ghosh. Psychiatrist Siladitya Roy who has been treating Covid patients as well as volunteers stressed on the need to eat, sleep and take small breaks in between work. “I am still handling volunteers who are stressed out and heartbroken to witness deaths. A mass awareness about keeping ourselves safe and strong is needed,” said Roy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/volunteers-help-cov-families-fight-grief-pain-and-death-fall-prey-to-depression/articleshow/82921459.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Dunlop flyover shut as curbs on oxygen use hit work||KOLKATA: The curbs on industrial use of oxygen to ensure that there is no shortage on the medical front forced the shutdown of the rightturn flyover across the busy Dunlop intersection on BT Road on Monday morning. A damaged height bar of the flyover required a gas cutter to be dismantled. But since the cutter cannot function in the absence of oxygen, a critical composition in the oxyacetylene that is used to slice through metal, the bridge had to be shut down as a safety measure. The height barrier installed to prevent trucks from using the flyover had broken three days ago. Barrackpore city traffic police alerted the PWD department about the matter. But the repair work could not commence due to the oxygen crisis. “The entire height bar needs to be removed by using a gas cutter. But the shortage of oxygen for industrial use due to the pandemic situation has thrown up a challenge for the work,” said a PWD engineer. Sensing trouble, Barrackpore commissionerate traffic police stopped all vehicles from using the flyover from Monday morning. Though the traffic is less due to Covid restrictions, it still led to some chaos at the Dunlop crossing as well as on BT Road in the morning. “We had to stop the plying of all vehicles on Dunlop flyover to avoid any accident. The closure of the flyover will continue till the height bar is repaired. The traffic condition at Dunlop crossing is now under control due to the restrictions,” Ramprasad Mondal, an officer-in-charge of Dunlop traffic guard told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dunlop-flyover-shut-as-curbs-on-o2-use-hit-work/articleshow/82921461.cms||Sanjib Chakraborty
---||Delhi||Delhi: Fighting for own life, he is saving hundreds||NEW DELHI: Vikrant Vig was diagnosed with stage 4 Hodgkin's lymphoma, or cancer of the lymphatic system, earlier this year. When he began his treatment at Safdarjung Hospital, over the numerous visits for chemotherapy, the 41-year-old carried lunch packets for fellow cancer patients and their kin who attended on them. On one such visit, Vig idly looked around and was struck by the number of patients and their attendants. He wondered how they managed their meals amid the crush at the hospital. The lunch packets he carried, he knew, wouldn’t feed so many of them. Vig shared his thoughts with his family. His younger brother, Abhishek, recalled for TOI, “Our father suggested we should start an NGO to help the miserable attendants. However, because of Covid and the restrictions due to it, we put off the idea till the situation normalised.” And yet, as Abhishek himself conceded, “Who knew what God had intended for us. On April 12, our father passed away of a cardiac arrest. As the NGO was the last wish he expressed to us, his kids, we decided to start work without further delay.” Apurva Charitable Organisation — the Helping Hand, thus, came into being, the NGO named after Vig’s daughter, Apurva, for whom the cancer-stricken single father wanted to do something knowing fully well how uncertain his life was. Abhishek’s wife, Nitu Vig, said, “We kicked off the feeding programme with donations collected within the family. When we posted information about the activities on social media, we started getting donations from others and we felt encouraged to do more.” Under the guidance of Vikrant, the group now has six people, all of them professionals, some with multinationals and others in retail and e-commerce, to handle the feeding scheme. Nitu takes care of the planning for meals and ensuring hygienic preparation of food, while the younger brother himself is in charge of social media alongside managing the finances. Sachin Kumar, Rajkamal Kumawat and Rishabh Channa oversee the distribution operations and procure equipment like PPE suits, hand sanitisers and face masks for both the volunteers and the hospital patients and their attendants. “We are now able to feed over 300 people twice a week. On Wednesdays, we provide dinner and on Sundays, lunch,” informed Abhishek, fully living up to the group’s motto of “Deh Siva bar mohe eh, hey subh karman te kabhu na taro”, or ‘God, grant that I may never deviate from doing good’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fighting-for-own-life-he-is-saving-hundreds/articleshow/82957189.cms||---

The district administration started the exercise last weekend and has been calling up patients in whose name remdesivir injections were taken by hospitals. According to the system devised by the state government, remdesivir was not being sold in the open market. All private hospitals needing it had to procure it from designated places after sending a requisition with details of patients for whom it was sought. A man treated in Godhra at a private hospital claimed that he had been discharged on May 18 and injections were taken for him on May 22. The issue was brought to the notice of officials who are inquiring about the matter. “I have asked the chief district health officer to look into the matter. We are already contacting all patients and private hospitals to ascertain that there were no irregularities,” said Panchmahal district collector Amit Arora. The hospital, sources said, has told officials that the patient had been given injections. It has claimed that the name had figured in the list as the hospital had not got the full quota meant for the patient till then.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/probe-on-over-alleged-irregularity-in-remdesivir-supply/articleshow/82919642.cms||---
---||Delhi||As black fungus cases in Delhi top 500, Amphotericin B scarcity deepens crisis||NEW DELHI: Reminiscent of the oxygen scarcity recently, Amphotericin B, the drug used to treat mucormycosis, or black fungus, is now a burden for city hospitals. According to doctors, seven vials a day of the drug are required to be administered to a patient for at least 10 days. But the drug’s shortage is creating problems for patients and medical experts. Dr Anoop Mishra, chairman of Fortis Centre for Diabetes, Obesity and Cholesterol, pointed out that the treatment of black fungus was prolonged and difficult. “For the past 40 years, Amphotericin B has been the best drug to counter mucormycosis. The chances of a patient recovering with a second-line drug is low,” cautioned Mishra. According to Delhi government records, there were 197 black fungus patients on May 21. By Monday, however, the figure had risen to 500. Sir Ganga Ram Hospital had 74 infected patients on Monday following the death of two. Manipal Hospital in Dwarka had 16 mucormycosis patients, Lok Nayak 41, Aakash Healthcare 3, Max Healthcare 70, Guru Tegh Bahadur 51 patients and Apollo Hospitals 20 patients after two deaths plus 12 suspected cases. Fortis Hospital declined to divulge the numbers there. Dr Sandeep Budhiraja, group medical director, Max Healthcare, said, “If you don’t treat the disease or identify it, black fungus infection has a 100% mortality rate. I feel these cases will also reduce, like Covid cases, but probably only after June first week.” As for the scarcity of Amphotericin B, Budhiraja said, “We are taking it one day at a time. For a person weighing 70kg, we need seven 50mg vials of the drug every day and the treatment must continue for at least three weeks. So you can calculate our requirements. But we are being forced to use alternatives. The drug is needed to cure the infection.” Dr Abhinit Kumar, senior ENT consultant at Aakash Healthcare, Dwarka, said the hospital had been getting a case of mucormycosis every day for the last 7-10 days. “We received referral patients of black fungus in advanced stages and operated on them,” said Kumar. “In some cases, we had to remove the eye, and clean up the facial bones, maxilla and mandible endoscopically. Since the infection was in an advanced stage and Amphotericin B wasn’t available, one of the patients died after surgery. The liposomal Amphotericin B has fewer side-effects than other drugs, but its production is controlled, causing a shortage in the market. With the surge of mucormycosis cases, they are rarer to find.” Kumar said that since the first four days after infection were critical, normal Amphotericin B was being administered to those without a pre-existing kidney problem, and liposomal Amphotericin B to patients with renal problems.” He added that Aakash Healthcare had so far treated 15 mucormycosis patients and currently had four undergoing treatment. At Manipal Hospital, Dr Ashish Vashisth, ENT consultant, was happy that people had now started coming to hospital on seeing black fungus symptoms. “Two patients lost their eyesight, but they reached us only after loss of vision. And yes, Amphotericin is not enough to meet the demand.” Delhi government has set up medical hubs for black fungus treatment at Lok Nayak, Guru Tegh Bahadur and Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty hospitals. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, however, claimed Amphotericin wasn’t available. “We did not receive the medicine yesterday, so how can we treat the patients without the drug? The injection has to be administered 4 to 5 times a day. If we aren’t supplied the vials of injection, is it possible to treat the patients?” asked Kejriwal. The CM calculated that with 4-5 injections needed daily per patient and with around 500 patients, the requirement was for a minimum of 2,000 vials daily. But Delhi was getting just 400-500 injections, he claimed. “This illness has suddenly emerged and the medicine to treat it is in short supply. Because of this, the central government has taken over the distribution of the drug in all the states. Given the extreme shortage of Amphotericin, its production should be significantly increased.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/as-black-fungus-cases-in-delhi-top-500-amphotericin-b-scarcity-deepens-crisis/articleshow/82921522.cms||Sakshi Chand
---||Aurangabad||Maharashtra: Beed district first to use own technology to ease vaccination process||Aurangabad: The Beed health authorities are using technology to inform citizens about availability of doses at centres, a move that is helping ease the chaos during the Covid vaccination process. On Monday, the vaccination sites in the district saw a well-regulated turnout of beneficiaries thanks to the use of online customized information collection forms (ezee.live/Beed-Covid19-Registration). People fill basic details in the form and get an SMS about the availability of vaccine at a centre. At the centre, they can complete the CoWin registration and other formalities. Beed district health officer Radhakrishna Pawar told TOI, “Many from the rural areas were finding it difficult to book vaccination slots through the CoWin portal. Besides, the option of direct walk-ins for people above 45 years would result in unwanted crowding. The online tool collects personal details of beneficiaries and issues token numbers before sending out an intimation about vaccine availability.” As part of the streamlined procedure, the staff at the vaccination sites enter details of beneficiaries in the CoWin portal on the spot and help them get official SMSes about the first or second dose along with the vaccination certificate. “We are not collecting any sensitive data such as details of Aadhaar, PAN or EPIC cards. Therefore, there is no issue related to data breach. A dedicated team handling CoWin is only looking after the process related to these forms,” Pawar said. Stating that the Covid vaccination has been creating law and order issues in many rural areas, Beed district collector Ravindra Jagtap said the streamlined system adopted by the health authorities across 76 vaccination sites was proving beneficial. “We recently witnessed an incident of a policeman being manhandled at the vaccination site. The chaos associated with the vaccination, including trouble faced by many in booking slots, is now being taken care of,” he said. Beed resident Shreeprasad Deshmukh welcomed the online intervention by health authorities in the vaccination programme. “I had faced lot of trouble in vaccinating my elderly parents. I hope I won’t face the same trouble when my vaccination comes up,” said the 30-year-old private professional. Beed district has witnessed over 3.42 lakh vaccinations till Monday afternoon, which includes 2,65,077 first doses and 77,018 second doses, official data shows.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/beed-dist-first-to-use-own-tech-to-ease-vax-process/articleshow/82917458.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Campuses help students bridge e-divide||KOLKATA: Colleges and universities are appealing to their alumni, current students and faculty members to lend a helping hand to the underprivileged so that the digital divide could be bridged and everyone could attend online classes while campuses remained shut. Several institutes have requested their former students to donate their old gadgets, which were in working condition, such as laptops, mobiles, tablets and desktops. Many colleges and universities have already started distributing the devices and recharging data of those who have smart devices. “The pandemic has impacted everybody. Many children, who are not financially resourceful, have been facing problems attending online classes. Our endeavour is to ensure that nobody misses out on their education,” said Deepali Singhee, principal at J D Birla Institute. “We have made an appeal and hoping that everybody will come forward to help.” After lessons shifted online last march, institutes took stock of those who could not attend classes regularly for want of smart devices or internet. To help out such students, Jadavpur University distributed over 800 mobiles among its students and it has also been recharging data since August last year. “We have again made appeal to our alumni and current students for financial help so that we can help more students. Even those settled abroad have shown keen interest,” said a JU official. Other colleges, like Lady Brabourne, Scottish Church, Bethune, St Xavier’s and The Bhawanipore Education Society, have been helping their students. Students of Ramakrishna Mission Vidyamandira are offering online tuition to school students in need. “Many of our students come from poor families. The pandemic has dealt a further blow. We have observed that in these circumstances many students discontinue their studies to lessen the financial burden on their families. But we are ensuring all help to our students so that they can continue with their studies,” said a professor at Loreto College.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/campuses-help-students-bridge-e-divide/articleshow/82921505.cms||Zeeshan Javed

We need to study the measures and, if required, a team can visit Delhi. Nothing wrong in adopting some good practices from other states in our state,” KCR said. The CM said the state government has been able to control the surge in Covid-19 cases and expressed satisfaction over lockdown implementation in the state. “We will become successful if the positivity rate goes below 5%. Measures should be taken to achieve this,” the chief minister said on Monday during a review meeting with health and police officials on Covid 19 and black fungus cases, lockdown implementation and vaccination. Asking officials to adopt twin strategies - continuing fever survey in the state, giving medical kits to the needy and increasing number of tests from tomorrow. “Whoever comes to government hospitals and primary health centres for testing, they should not be denied for tests as most of them are poor. The department should procure 50 lakh rapid antigen testing kits and supply them to all the PHCs and testing centres by speaking to manufacturers,” KCR said. The CM directed the officials to speed up recruitment of staff, doctors and other manpower at the district collectors and other health officials. The CM directed the director of health Srinivas Rao to hold tele-conference with district medical and health officers and prepare a report on availability of infrastructure, medicines and manpower from their respective districts. Given the intensity of the second wave of Covid-19, the chief minister said, budget allocations to some departments such as health and police is likely to go up in the current financial year. Some departments may see a drop in expenditure in pandemic time. KCR asked finance minister T Harish Rao to hold a meeting and identify departments in which budget allocations can be downsized. Asking the officials to be ready to face a third wave if at all it comes, KCR directed industries minister KT Rama Rao to speak to vaccine manufacturers and get vaccines for those waiting for second doses. The CM also said liquid medical oxygen production should be enhanced to 600 MTs and all beds should be provided with oxygen facility. KCR enquired about black fungus cases, availability of medicines and beds in the government hospitals. Officials informed 150 beds in Gandhi hospital, 250 beds in ENT hospital, total 400 beds have been allocated for black fungus cases. “Another 200 beds in Sarojinidevi Eye hospital, 160 more in Gandhi hospital should be provided. We have to ensure 1,500 beds for black fungus including 1,100 in Hyderabad and 400 in districts. Required medicines should also be procured,” the chief minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/study-del-maha-models-to-fight-covid-cm-to-officials/articleshow/82922940.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Hyderabad||Telangana draws up battle plan for third Covid-19 wave||HYDERABAD: With experts hinting at the possibility of a third Covid-19 wave hitting the nation by December 2021, the Telangana health department has started drafting a plan to tackle the virus. According to sources, the government is focusing on two primary areas — beds and oxygen supply. Though there is still no substantial data about children being most affected in the third wave, the state has instructed all government hospitals to ramp up their paediatric wards with more beds. The total bed capacity too is expected to be increased with Hyderabad set to get 300 additional beds. During the first wave, the total bed capacity across the government sector stood at 18,000 which was increased to 53,000 during the second wave. “Going by the trend of the virus, experts feel that there is a possibility of a third wave...they say the current wave will come under control by the end of June,” said an official adding that a decision on drugs — ensuring its availability — will, however, be taken on depending on the nature of the wave. “During the second wave we realised that the infection type was unexpected and many treatments had to be changed. So, we have to take a decision on drugs based on the infection spread,” the official added. Further, with transporting oxygen from distant states like West Bengal and Odisha becoming a Herculean task, a detailed oxygen supply plan is also being chalked out. According to it, oxygen plants with 16 tonnes capacity in five major hospitals and 23 plants with eight tonnes capacity in 23 district hospitals will be set up. Apart from this, the Centre too will supply 53 oxygen generators to private hospitals. “Considering all this, we are hoping that there will be no shortage of oxygen in about 100 hospitals,” a government source said. Also on the state’s agenda is to continue the fever survey till the second way completely recedes and tracking symptomatic people. On the vaccination front, Telangana is hopeful of getting 70% of the population vaccinated by the end of December with an expected supply of one crore doses over and above the free doses given by Centre. The jab notwithstanding, experts suggest that people continue to follow all Covid-19 protocols. “If 70% of the population gets vaccinated, the infection can be brought under control. But it is extremely important that in between the second wave and the possible third wave, people follow a restricted lifestyle so that the virus does not mutate,” said former director of the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Rakesh Mishra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/telangana-draws-up-battle-plan-for-third-wave/articleshow/82922101.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Mumbai||Rehabilitate two educated youths gone astray: Bombay HC||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court has batted for the rehabilitation of two well-educated youths who allegedly went astray after they came under the influence of an astrologer. “In order to save their career from being further destroyed, the court ought to consider lending all necessary assistance for the purpose of rehabilitating them,” said a vacation bench of Justices Shahrukh Kathawalla and Surendra Tavade in its May 19 order. The fathers of the cousins—a chemical engineer (27) and a chartered accountant (26)—moved HC to transfer them to a rehabilitation centre by providing police protection and grant them temporary bail. They urged HC’s intervention to admit their sons for rehabilitation “so that they would be treated for their addiction, complete detoxification and counselling”. The petition said their parents were in contact with the woman (43) who posed as an astrologer, conducted yoga sessions and imparted spiritual knowledge. They introduced their sons to her so that with her spiritual preaching, they would be more focused on education and work. Taking undue advantage of her close relations with the family, the woman took huge loans from them and their friends. While their parents severed ties with her, the cousins remained under her control, fought with them and left home to stay with her. The petitioners learnt there were more youths under her control, who lived with her, chain-smoked and consumed narcotics such as ganja. The petition said the woman’s family had published a public notice disowning her. The Wadala police station did not take action on a complaint that was signed by her brother, it said. The parents were not allowed to meet their sons even after the woman shifted to Thane with them. They complained to additional CP (crime), Thane, on February 1. Wagle Estate crime branch unit raided the flat and arrested the three on April 6. After NDPS court refused them bail on May 12, they moved HC. The petitioners’ advocate, Suresh Sabrad, argued the woman had trapped their sons by her black magic and hypnotising tricks and ruined their lives. Also, seizure of 14.9gm ganja is much below smaller quantity as defined under NDPS Act. The judges noted the youth are “very well educated young boys” and their bail application must be heard and disposed of at the earliest. They made a “request” to the single HC judge to do so “but strictly on merits”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/rehabilitate-two-educated-youths-gone-astray-bombay-hc/articleshow/82917485.cms||Rosy Sequeira

For instance, in a single day, Suryapet police booked cases against 949 people for violating the lockdown and seized 190 vehicles on May 23. In some districts like Medak and Nalgonda, cops used drones to enforce the lockdown. Since lockdown was imposed in the state on May 12 to prevent spread of Covid-19, the Jagtial police have registered cases against 4,231 people for various violations. Another 3,965 people were booked for not wearing masks. A total of 919 vehicles — 751 two-wheelers, 54 three-wheelers and 114 four-wheelers — were seized. Karimnagar range IG Pramod Kumar, district SP Sindhu Sharma and DSP Venkataramana themselves were on the field to enforce the lockdown, particularly at checkposts. At the inter-state border at Vadapalli in Damarcharla mandal in Nalgonda district, police did not permit anyone coming from Andhra Pradesh without an e-pass even during the lockdown relaxation time between 6 am and 10 am. Nalgonda DIG and SP AV Ranganath on Monday urged the people of Andhra Pradesh not to put themselves to hardship by reaching the border with the hope that they would be allowed into Telangana. Police also booked a case against a chicken shop owner who was moving around in his car with a ‘press’ sticker on his car. When he was asked to produce his identity card, the man could not do so and a case was booked against him. Siddipet district SP Joel Davis said people wre making unnecessary visits to their relatives or coming out on some work which was not urgent. “Despite the Covid-19 situation, a large number of people were seen in front of chicken and mutton shops on Sunday even after 9.30 am. Lockdown is for the benefit of the people and everyone should realise it,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/thousands-booked-in-districts-for-violating-lockdown/articleshow/82923282.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

The mortality rate among Covid patients has also reduced to 2.18%,” said resident deputy collector Anant Gavhane, while addressing a meeting of public representatives. Stating that the district administration was effectively waging battle against the second wave of Covid, Gavhane added that efforts were on to deal with the possible third wave in the near future as predicted by a section of experts. Speaking on the occasion, Aurangabad zilla parishad CEO Dr Mangesh Gondawale said the use of audio-visual content was made to spread public awareness about the ill-effects of Covid-19 on children during the possible third wave.  “As vaccination is the key in battling with future stages of Covid-19 outbreak, the mass immunisation programme is being executed in a planned manner as per availability of doses,” he said. Addressing the meeting, local BJP MLA Atul Save said hospitals with more than 50-bed capacity should try and set up their oxygen plants. “The district administration should also prepare well to deal with black fungus infection. The drug availability for the same can be ensured by keeping a proper check on active cases,” he said. Meanwhile, Aurangabad MP Imtiaz Jaleel boycotted the meeting alleging that the district administration and the government were not paying heed to the needs of poor people during the current lockdown like situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/recovery-rate-reaches-93-6-in-aurangabad/articleshow/82917482.cms||---

Telangana’s active cases were around 39,000 as on Monday and experts said that the current infection ratio should have lower, around 5 active cases per 100 infections. “The infected ratio will change every 10 to 15 days depending on the number of cases reported and recoveries, but for any region or state the ideal would be if this number is below 5 or around five,” former Centre for Cellular & Molecular Biology (CCMB) director Rakesh Mishra said. On the raging second wave of coronavirus sweeping across the country, Mishra said whatever may be the current numbers, the situation will be more stable in a month, and guard should be stronger from authorities. “The recoveries are far ahead of the number of infected people for a long time, but the numbers of currently infected people will keep on coming,” he added. Telangana has been reporting an average of 3,500 daily caseload and the average growth rate last week stood at 0.7 per cent. The number of currently infected people per 100 cases stands at 20 for Karnataka, 13 for Kerala, 13 for Andhra Pradesh and 16 for Tamil Nadu. All these states have a higher active caseload than Telangana. The state health department has asked authorities to set up more isolation centres across the state, especially in villages and towns when the active cases are high. “We will be doing another round of fever survey in the state to find out more symptomatic people and this will improve the situation over a period,” said a senior official from the state health department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ts-current-covid-infection-ratio-per-100-cases-still-high/articleshow/82923215.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

This is the third extension of the statewide lockdown. The state government imposed the first one on May 5 for 11 days, after an unprecedented spurt in the Covid-19 positive cases and fatalities. Later, it was extended up to May 25. Announcing the lockdown extension through his Twitter handle, CM Nitish Kumar said, “The lockdown was imposed for three weeks since May 5, 2021, in the wake of the covid-19 infection. Today, the situation was reviewed again with cabinet colleagues and senior officials.” He added, in a second tweet posted in Hindi, “The lockdown has had a good effect, and a declining trend is being witnessed in the Covid-19 infection in the state. Therefore, it has been decided to continue the lockdown for a week beyond May 25, that is until June 1, 2021." Earlier in the day, the CM held a meeting of the state’s crisis management group (CMG) via videoconferencing and reviewed the current status of Covid-19 infection vis-à-vis lockdown. At the CMG meeting, Nitish said, opinion of all DMs on the Covid-19 situation and the extension of lockdown was taken, and all DMs suggested extending the lockdown. “There has been a remarkable decline in the rate of infection. Earlier, the lockdown was continued for three weeks, and it has given very positive results. It has been decided to extend the lockdown from May 26 to June 1 based on a thorough review of the situation with the ministers and senior officials,” Nitish said. The CMG meet was also attended by both deputy CMs Tar Kishore Prasad and Renu Devi, education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary and health minister Mangal Pandey, through video conferencing. Beginning his address at the meet, Nitish said, “Every day I collect updates about the covid-19 infection in the state, and give necessary instructions to the health department and other concerned authorities based on the updates. We are taking all necessary steps to save our people from the pandemic.” The CM also said an average of 1.27 lakh samples were being tested daily. The numbers would be taken up to an average of 1.50 lakh per day. “We are making all possible efforts to ensure vaccination of all people in the state,” Nitish added. The CM further said the closest dependent of a person who died of Covid-19 was being given financial assistance of Rs 4 lakh from the CM relief fund. All DMs have been asked to collect necessary information about the persons who died of Covid-19 and ensure early payment of Rs 4 lakh to their next kin. Nitish also said the state recently introduced mobile testing vans for speeding up Covid-19 testing in rural areas. “Around 1,000 suspected cases will be tested per day through the mobile testing vans and people will get their test reports within 24 hours,” Nitish said. “Now, the community kitchens are being started at all the block headquarters across the state to provide both meals free-of-the-cost to the poor and needy people,” the CM said. Nitish also said interested people were being employed during the lockdown. “The ministers in charge of each district are regularly taking feedback from the people about the situation of Covid-19 infection and the steps taken by the government for the safety of the people. The health department is taking necessary steps based on the feedback provided by the ministers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-govt-extends-lockdown-till-june-1-no-change-in-curbs/articleshow/82921807.cms||Madan Kumar
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Rules for ‘frail’ seniors may be eased||PUNE: Guidelines for the vaccination of “frail” elderly citizens and the differently abled who are unable to reach vaccination centres in urban and rural settings are expected soon from the Union health ministry as the focus will be on their immunization in June and July. Dr N K Arora, chairman of India’s technical advisory group on Covid-19, told TOI several local bodies have initiated vaccination of senior citizens in urban settings in housing societies or at a common place. This practice will be encouraged, provided the organisers take due care in tie-ups with healthcare centres and check for any adverse event following immunization (AEFI). The norms would have a clear definition of the “frail” elderly, Dr Arora added. Several states have told the Centre that senior citizens were afraid to visit vaccination centres due to surging crowds. “These guidelines would help them,” Dr Arora said. The Centre has not yet planned a door-to-door vaccination programme because of likely AEFI events, he added. While urban local authorities have started vaccination drives in schools, common places and workplaces, proper monitoring of any AEFI events, including allergic reactions or anaphylaxis, is necessary, Arora cautioned. “Every vaccinated person must be monitored for half an hour after taking the jab,” he said. Local authorities in rural areas would have to set up more centres to encompass a larger population. “In many urban areas, residents’ welfare associations, colonies and workplaces are arranging for vaccination of the elderly, but in rural areas they find it difficult to travel to the centres to get their shots. The health department and local authorities should set up additional centres among a cluster of villages to enable vaccination for them,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-rules-for-frail-seniors-may-be-eased/articleshow/82917232.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Rathod was held after his office assistant, Arvind Tiwari, was arrested while allegedly accepting the sum on his behalf. The ACB’s Mumbai unit booked them under the Prevention of Corruption Act. The post of the CEO is of Class I rank, on par with an assistant collector. According to the ACB, the complainant has a house near Unit 32 inside Aarey Colony in Goregaon (East). He had sought permission to repair it before monsoon. Any repair or reconstruction in Aarey requires sanction from the CEO’s office. ACB sources said Rathod asked the complainant to meet Tiwari, who allegedly demanded Rs 50,000. Police said on May 14, the complainant, who did not wish to pay the bribe, approached the ACB’s office to lodge a complaint. On Monday, the complainant went along with ACB officials in mufti who laid a trap for Tiwari. They took him to Rathod’s Worli office and questioned them together. Tiwari said he took the bribe at Rathod’s behest. Later, ACB officials carried out a search of both their houses, said sources.  Environmentalist Stalin D said, “A thorough investigation must be done.” In 2011, the then CEO L R Bhosale was caught by ACB while allegedly accepting a bribe of Rs 1 lakh to award a contract to a private contractor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-aarey-ceo-asst-held-for-taking-rs-50k-bribe-from-slumdweller/articleshow/82918204.cms||Ahmed Ali

---||Hyderabad||Experts: Keep health infra for kids ready||Hyderabad: With a third wave of Covid-19 infections anticipated, experts have alerted that more children are likely to be affected in this wave. In the first wave, it was mostly elderly and persons with co-morbidities who contracted severe disease due to the virus but with more family members getting affected, infections among children are increasing. In the current wave, a large number of people in the younger age group of 30-45 years have developed severe disease along with many others who do not have co-morbidities. “After the second wave if we do not continue following Covid appropriate behaviour and a third wave occurs, it is likely to infect the remaining non-immune individuals, which may include children as well. Children are as susceptible as adults and older individuals to develop infection but not severe disease. It is unlikely that the third wave will predominantly or exclusively affect children but it is hard to predict,” said Dr Ravindra Reddy Parigi, Woman and Child Hospitals, Madhapur. While severe disease can occur in children, there is no evidence indicating that most children with Covid-19 infection will have severe disease in the third wave. Children have so far not been hit severely by the virus. In most cases, it is a mild to moderate infection with symptoms not lasting for more than a few days. However, there is a need to be prepared with more in-patient beds and intensive care beds for children, say experts. Experts also suggest that administering influenza vaccines would help curb the incidence of flu, which in turn will help decongest hospitals and prevent unnecessary testing as symptoms are similar. “There is no clear evidence as of now but some studies in Brazil have shown that Covid-19 infections have been less among children who have taken flu vaccines. However we recommend flu shots for all children now, as it will prevent the onslaught of flu cases which could further increase the stress on health infrastructure,” said president of Indian Academy of Paediatrics (Telangana) and paediatrician at Challa Hospital, Dr M Surendranath.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/experts-keep-health-infra-for-kids-ready/articleshow/82922806.cms||Amrita Didyala

Comparing the Covid parameters of the day the restrictions started and the day they ended reveal that the curbs dis not have as big an impact as the authorities had hoped for. The strict curbs were effected due to high mortality and positivity rates along with high number of active patients. Also, oxygen shortage was a factor. The number of daily cases remained about same — 1,761 on May 16 and 1,774 on May 23. However, the daily death count dropped from 62 (May 16) to 46 (May 23). The positivity rate improved slightly from May 16’s 22.3% to May 23’s 18.6%. The mortality rate also rolled back from 3.5% (the highest so far) then to 2.6% now. District health officer Yogesh Sale said: “We have increased testings. The figures show that the curve has started to decline and the effect will be seen in coming days.” However, with the restrictions easing, streets have again become crowded raising fears that the marginal improvements in mortality and positivity rates will be negated. District guardian minister Satej Patil has appealed to the citizens to observe restrain to help the number of new cases and deaths fall. “We have adequate stock of oxygen now. There is no shortage of medicines and beds either. Citizens have stayed indoors during the 8-days restrictions. They must now ensure social distancing norms are they should wear masks.

There was crowding observed in popular marketplaces like Laxmipuri, Shahupuri, Mirajkar Tikti, Rajarampuri, Bindu chowk, Kasba Bawda etc. where people were stocking up on vegetables and other essentials. Covid norms were largely ignored. Police and Kolhapur Municipal Corporation personnel were deployed in the market areas to ensure that only essential shops remain open between 7am and 11 am across the city on Monday. Superintendent of police Shailesh Balkawade said, “Citizens should not forget that the janata curfew restrictions, as per state guidelines, are in force till June 1. Strict action will be taken against the rule violators. On Monday, 409 people without masks were collectively fined Rs 94,800. Another 1,686 cases under the Motor Vehicle Act were registered. While 79 vehicles were seized, a total fine of Rs 2,49,600 was collected. This apart, 77 establishments were found violating the rules and Rs 82,500 was collected as fine from them. Rs 22,100 was collected from 53 morning walkers who violated the norms.”Atul Khade, a vada pav seller in the Papachi Tikti area, said, “There is a huge rush everywhere. We ask the customers to stand in a queue to take parcels, but very few people listen to us. But the KMC fines us.”Ranjit Patil, an MIDC worker who was seen in a queue outside a grain store in Laxmipuri, said, “Our vegetable and grain supplies have ended. We have come to the market only to stock up. We have followed all restrictions seriously, but if the stores are open for only four hours, then thousands like me will have to come out and make the purchases. A longer time window should have been given to avoid crowding.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/covid-norms-go-for-a-toss-in-kolhapur-as-shops-reopen/articleshow/82917532.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

In 11 days, their world had completely changed. The two sisters lost their grandfather to Covid on April 27, and by May 8, their parents and grandmother. In UP, there are more than 100 children like them who the pandemic has orphaned, numbers with the government show. So far, 555 children living in the state have lost one or both parents to Covid, leaving them in the hands of their nearest relatives. Manoj Rai, director of the state’s women and child development department, told TOI that of the 555, 101 children had lost both parents. In Noida (Gautam Budh Nagar), the number of children who have lost a parent or been orphaned is 26, district probation officer (DPO) Atul Soni said. Four of these children have lost both parents. In Ghaziabad, eight among 12 children who saw the worst of the pandemic lost both parents, DPO Vikas Chandra said. Some of these kids are with their grandparents now, some with next of kin like an uncle or an aunt. Some are too young to comprehend the scale of the tragedy to have struck them while some are not aware about their parents’ demise. Astha and Ashima (just six and seven years old) are believed to be with their aunt in Bareilly. Their parents contracted Covid while taking care of their grandfather and were admitted to Sharda hospital in Greater Noida. Their father passed away on May 4. In the early hours of May 5, their grandmother breathed her last. Raj Kumar, RWA president of Panchsheel Wellington at Crossings Republik, said the girls’ mother died on May 8. “There was no family left to conduct the last rites of their mother. The children could have been traumatised. Their paternal aunt took them with them to Bareilly after their grandmother’s death even as their mother was in hospital,” he said. A similar tragedy struck a family in Greater Noida’s Alpha II. The parents of a 10-year-old boy and his eight-year-old sister passed away within three days of each other. Their father had Covid-like symptoms (he could not be tested) and died on April 22. Their mother, who had tested positive, died on April 24. “The children are too young to realise what has happened to them. Our world has turned upside down,” their grandmother told this correspondent. Many families are in dire straits because the pandemic has claimed the main earning member. In Greater Noida, Sagar (17), Samira (14) and Saira (11) lost their father. Their uncle Anuj Kumar told TOI the kids’ parents had been working in private companies but had lost their jobs. “For the past few months, my brother had been riding a bike with Ola as a driver partner. Now, there is no earning member in the family. Some days back, the family was given some food items, including atta, rice, etc but how long will that last?” he said. Raman (7) and Roshni (6) face a similar predicament. Their father, who worked at a mall in Delhi, died on Covid. Their mother is a housewife. The kids’ grandfather, who retired from the Jal Board, said apart from some food items that included half a kilo of dal, and 2 kilos of rice, they have not received any other assistance. “My son was the only earning member. The younger one does not earn yet. The kids are studying in a private school. I have my pension but how long will I survive?” he asked.

---||Delhi||Delhi HC orders probe into how politicians got drugs in bulk||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court on Monday asked the city’s drug controller to investigate how BJP MP Gautam Gambhir and AAP MLAs Priti Tomar and Praveen Kumar bought drugs and medical oxygen in bulk when there was acute shortage. The court observed that “Gambhir may have the best of intentions while picking up over 2,600 strips of FabiFlu last month to distribute, but has done a disservice, maybe unintentionally.” “In their best of intentions, they crossed a line. It is a malpractice,” the court said and ordered the drug controller to look into the allegations against the three politicians and file a report. “Gautam Gambhir has been a national player, a cricketer. Let’s be clear about one thing, he might have done it with the best intention but our issue is – is it responsible behaviour when you know that medicine is in short supply? Should he have not realised that it is in short supply? If he wanted to render help, he could have provided funds,” the bench orally remarked. The court’s observations came while hearing a PIL seeking lodging of an FIR on the allegations that politicians were able to procure in huge quantities and distribute Covid-19 medicines even as patients were running from pillar to post to get them. The bench passed the order after studying the status report of Delhi Police, which said that Gambhir had purchased 2,628 strips of Fabiflu, used for treating Covid-19 patients, on the prescription of Dr Manish of Garg Hospital. While 2,343 strips were distributed to patients, remaining 285 strips were deposited with Delhi government’s director general of health services for distribution. “The aspect, which needs to be examined, is how such a large quantity of Fabiflu was authorised to be purchased in retail as the medicine was in grave short supply at the relevant time. We can take judicial notice of this fact as we have been hearing this matter for a considerable time now. It also needs examination as to how these medicines were distributed to several patients or attendants by Dr Manish of Garg Hospital,” the bench said. It asked police to hand over documents to the drug controller. “Here there is a very clear case made out. Tell us under what provisions, action is required to be taken and against whom. All this has to be done by the drug controller and not Delhi Police, as per the Supreme Court’s order,” the bench said. The court had earlier expressed dissatisfaction over a report filed by Delhi Police on the allegations against politicians hoarding and distributing medicines in the city and directed further probe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-orders-probe-into-how-politicians-got-drugs-in-bulk/articleshow/82921631.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Delhi||Delhi: Shifting gears, from road safety to finding oxygen||NEW DELHI: Between April 23 and May 3, there were over 500 distress calls made by Delhi hospitals to the government about the lack of oxygen that left the lives of Covid patients on the edge. Citizens in the hundreds, if not thousands, also desperately searched for oxygen cylinders or oxygen-equipped hospital beds. Into this chaotic situation stepped Save Life Foundation, which is traditionally considered a leader in road safety and emergency medical response. Even as Delhi residents and serious Covid patients from the neighbouring states continue to swarm Delhi hospitals, SLF has rallied donors and mobilised its emergency procurement system to address the capital’s desperate need for oxygen. The foundation has ordered 891 oxygen concentrators, of which 541 have arrived and have been deployed at the Burari field hospital, Ambedkar Nagar Hospital, Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital, Indira Gandhi Hospital Dwarka and the Chhatarpur Covid Care Centre. Apart from this, of the 1,510 big oxygen cylinders it ordered, SLF has deployed 1,010 at Indira Gandhi Hospital, Janakpuri Super Specialty Hospital, Satyawadi Raja Harish Chandra Hospital, Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Hospital, Acharya Shri Bhikshu Hospital, Commonwealth Games field hospital and at the district magistrates’ Covid step-down facilities in North-East, Central, South and Shahdara districts. A hundred invasive ventilators have also been ordered to boost the number of Covid ICU beds in the city. Of these, 40 have been delivered to Guru Tegh Bahadur Hospital's ancillary ICU facility. The remaining are expected to arrive and get deployed this week. Additionally, 109 ICU 5-para ICU monitors have been ordered for deployment at Guru Tegh Bahadur Hospital’s ancillary ICU facility. An official of SLF said that based on the indication provided by the central government, a third wave of coronavirus infections is imminent in Delhi. “SLF is, therefore, making all efforts to continue assisting the state in building the oxygen and critical-care capacity of the city. Oxygen plants, oxygen storage solutions and increasing the number of ICU beds are the top priorities,” said the official. The official added that SLF was also continuing to oversee the ambulance response in Delhi through its data-science team. “We plan to build a software platform and institute a dedicated team to integrate and track all ambulances in the capital,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/shifting-gears-from-road-safety-to-finding-o2/articleshow/82957221.cms||Pankhuri Yadav

According to the data provided by the district administration, the number of cases, number of active patients and Covid death figures have significantly dropped in the last three weeks. The district reported 3,677 Covid cases per day on average between May 2 and 8, which has now reduced by 60% to 1,441 cases per day on average between May 16 and 21. Moreover, the number of Covid tests conducted daily are almost the same in the past three weeks. Both the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) and Nashik zilla parishad are conducting over 14,000 tests per day on average. While the positivity rate has also declined from 23.71% in the first week of May to 10.44% during the third week of May. According to health officials of the Nashik Municipal Coporation, the infectivity of Covid has significantly reduced, which has led to the drop in the positivity rate. The number of Covid deaths, which were 41 deaths per day on an average in the first week of May, has reduced to 38 deaths per day during the third week of May. It has declined by 7.31% The number of active cases has dropped from 34,681 in the first week of May to 17,605 active cases by the third week of May. District collector Suraj Mandhare said the strict lockdown has given the desired results by providing a further push to the receding numbers. “But we need to maintain this momentum and get rid of the disease completely at the earliest. People need to maintain Covid appropriate behaviour to prevent the Covid pandemic,” said Nashik district collector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/covid-19-scenario-further-improves-in-nashik-district/articleshow/82917546.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Chandigarh||CSIO transfers virus disinfection tech||Chandigarh: The Central Scientific Instruments Organisation (CSIO) has transferred the UV disinfection technology to combat coronavirus to 28 indigenous manufacturers. The disinfection system can be used in auditoriums, conference rooms, classrooms and malls. It provides a relatively safer environment for indoor activities in the pandemic. The technology has been developed according to the requirements for deactivation of SARS COV-2 virus contained in an aerosol with necessary ventilation measures, safety and user guidelines and tested bio-safety standards, officials said. The CSIO said UV-C deactivates over 99% of viruses, bacteria, fungus and other bio-aerosols with appropriate dosages using 254nm UV light. The CSIO product is tested for more than 99% disinfection and could be used as a retrofit solution to air handling units (AHUs) of buildings, transport vehicles and other spinoff applications. Research carried out by CSIR constituent labs, Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CSIR-CCMB) and CSIR-Institute of Microbial Technology (CSIR-IMTECH) in September 2020 had demonstrated experimentally that SARS-CoV-2 viral particles could be detected in air even after two hours of exit of infected persons from a room and at distances much greater than a few metre as well, strengthening evidence of airborne transmission. Based on these studies and recognizing the need for effective solutions of viral disinfection, the challenge was to develop an effective fail-proof retro-fit device with high intensities to handle fast airflows to be fitted with minimal intervention in air-ducts of existing HVAC systems that are widely used in indoors in industrial and commercial environment, according to officials, leading the CSIO to develop an UV-C air duct disinfection system. WHAT IT DOES UV-C is an energy-efficient disinfection system It improves airflow through coils, enhances indoor air quality Requires less maintenance, is easy to retrofit with any system having AHU ducts Has low initial set-up cost||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/csio-transfers-virus-disinfection-tech/articleshow/82889321.cms||---

The directive was given after the state bought over 10 lakh doses of Covishield directly from manufacturers between May 11 and May 21. “We had to procure a substantial number of doses before we could start the vaccination of 18-44 age group. We did not want the drive to stop abruptly. We are going to procure more vials regularly,” said a health department official. All state centres have started forming teams for the third phase but most said the drive was likely to start only after cyclone Yaas passed. “Had it not been for the impending cyclone, we could have started the drive from Tuesday,” said a source at RG Kar. The Union health ministry had told states that the vials being supplied to states through the Government of India channel had to be used for the priority group aged above 45. For inoculating the 18-44 age group, states have to invest in their own procurement. While the state did start vaccinating the 18-44 category, it was being administered on state-designated priority groups, such as government staff, journalists, transport workers, hawkers, vendors, sex workers and transgender members. Now, to roll the drive out for all residents, government centres have started chalking out their plans.“So far, we had been vaccinating the 45+ category with supply from the GoI channel. Now with the introduction of vaccines bought by the state for the 18-44 category, we need to form teams as we can’t mix up the two stocks,” said a source at MCH. Hospitals also said they needed to authenticate recipients in the 18-44 category.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/10l-doses-in-kitty-govt-keen-to-roll-out-18-vax/articleshow/82921599.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Delhi reported the third highest increment in PM10 on Diwali day after Lucknow and Bhopal in the country. The report says arsenic crossed the prescribed annual concentration limit on Diwali day in Delhi, Agra, Lucknow, Kolkata and Bhopal. CPCB conducted monitoring in eight cities—Delhi, Agra, Bhopal, Bengaluru, Kolkata, Lucknow, Shillong and Vadodara—for pre-Diwali (November 7 to November 14), Diwali (November 14) and post-Diwali period (November 15 to November 21). According to the report, highest PM2.5 was recorded in Delhi (82.9%) followed by Bhopal (81.3%), Lucknow (67.6%), Kolkata (53.6%), Shillong (30.5%) and Vadodara (26%) on Diwali day as compared to pre-Diwali day. Highest increase in PM10 on Diwali day was reported in Lucknow (114%) followed by Bhopal (86.2%), Delhi (67.1%), Shillong (53.7%) and Kolkata (22.6%). “During the entire Diwali monitoring period, 24-hourly averages of both PM10 and PM2.5 were found above the National Ambient Air Quality Standard—100 µg/m3 (PM10) and 60 µg/m3 (PM2.5)—in all cities, except Bengaluru and Shillong,” stated the report. Sulphur dioxide (SO2) was found always within the prescribed 24-hourly limit of 80µg/m3 throughout the monitoring period, including Diwali day, but an increase in SO2 concentration was observed on Diwali day in cities like Delhi, Lucknow, Bhopal and Vadodara. “Increase on Diwali day may be attributed to oxidation of sulphur due to bursting of crackers. Bengaluru and Shillong reported SO2 at Below Detection Limit (4 µg/m3),” said the report. Nitrogen dioxide was reported within the prescribed 24-hourly limit (80µg/m3) in all the cities, except Delhi during pre-Diwali, Diwali and post Diwali days. Similarly, arsenic crossed the prescribed annual concentration limit on Diwali day in Agra, Delhi, Lucknow, Kolkata and Bhopal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pm2-5-spike-on-diwali-was-highest-in-delhi/articleshow/82957267.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

Other APMCs, including the Nashik APMC, a major wholesale vegetable market, also started operations.  The average wholesale onion price increased by 15% to touch Rs 1,400 per quintal on Monday — up from Rs 1,200 per quintal on May 12 (the last working day) — as demand exceeded supply. The Lasalgaon APMC had made pre-registration mandatory for the farmers and had allowed auction of only 500 vehicle-loads of onions. The decision was taken to avoid overcrowding, said the officials. Traders, however, have opposed the 500-vehicle limit and want the APMC administration to remove this condition. They also said that farmers should be allowed to bring their produce, without pre-registration, in two sessions. “The average wholesale onion price increased by Rs 200 per quintal due to limited auction. The APMC needs to remove the limitations,” said Manoj Jain, an onion trader. Roughly 10,337 quintal of onions brought in by the farmers on 493 vehicles were auctioned at Lasalgaon on Monday. The minimum and maximum wholesale onion prices were recorded at Rs 700 and Rs 1,632 per quintal, respectively. Before the severe restrictions were imposed, around 20-25,000 quintal of onions used to be auctioned every day at Lasalgaon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/lasalgaon-other-apmcs-restart-after-12-days/articleshow/82917691.cms||Tushar Pawar

---||Nashik||Nashik region registers 576 black fungus cases, 23 deaths||NASHIK: The Nashik division, comprising five districts, has so far registered 576 cases of mucormycosis (black fungus) along with 23 deaths related to the infection. The region’s two most densely populated districts of Nashik and Ahmednagar — the two worst affected during the second wave of the pandemic — has registered maximum number of mucormycosis cases. Also, the highest number of deaths due to this ailment so far has been reported from Nashik followed by Ahmednagar. Dhule, Jalgaon and Nandurbar have also reported cases of mucormycosis, but Nandurbar is yet to report a death due to the black fungus infection. Deputy director of state health department (Nashik division) P B Gandal told TOI most of the patients who are suffering from mucormycosis had recovered from Covid-19. “Our feedback is that most of these patients with mucormycosis have a history of diabetes and were administered steroids while undergoing treatment for Covid,” he said. According to him, the state health department has directed the health authorities to constantly update the data on mucormycosis so that the drug could be made available based on the number of patients undergoing treatment. Health officials of some of the districts have not ruled out the possibility of further surge in mucormycosis cases. “Mucormycosis can affect Covid patients, especially those with history of diabetes and were administered steroids during Covid treatment, within three months after their recovery. So there is a need to be alert and detect patients having symptoms of mucormycosis,” a health official from Nashik region said. However, like other districts in the state, the Nashik region is facing acute shortage of Amphotericin B Injections — a key drug to treat patients suffering from this infection. “In my district the available stock of Amphotericin B at present is 20 and since one patient needs six injections per day, it would meet the requirement for just three patients for one day. But the total number of patients in the district is much higher,” civil surgeon of a district said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-region-registers-576-black-fungus-cases-23-deaths/articleshow/82917747.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

The 100th flight was from Russia that brought 10 metric tonnes of relief materials on Tuesday morning. With this feat, IGI has recorded the highest movements of Covid relief aid among all Indian airports. The biggest aircraft handled by the airport included Antonov-124 and C-130 Globemaster. After Customs clearance, all Covid-19 relief materials are brought to the 3,500 sqm dedicated interim storage and logistic facility, Jeevoday warehouse, where they are sorted and distributed to other parts of the country. The relief materials were received by Indian Red Cross Society at Delhi. In terms of airside infrastructure, IGI is the first and only airport in the country to have 12 dedicated freighter parking bays and ample capacity for the airlines to move cargo. Some of the largest military and commercial aircraft handled at the airport included C-5, C-17 and IL-76, among other freighters. These planes brought in consignments like oxygen generating plants, oxygen concentrators and cylinders, masks, ventilators, remdesivir injections, patient beds and medicines like veklury, tocilizumab, etc. Videh Kumar Jaipuriar, DIAL CEO, said, “IGI Airport plays a critical role as a transshipment hub to connect underserved countries/regions to the rest of the world. Our teams are working 24x7 to provide uninterrupted services and ensure consignments are processed and cleared in the least possible time.” Between April 27 and May 25, the airport handled 1,750 metric tonnes of relief material that arrived from countries like the US, the UK, Canada, Ireland, Germany, France, Austria, Belgium, Russia, Spain, Italy, Ireland, Denmark, Switzerland, The Netherlands, Australia, Czech Republic, Romania, Singapore, Mauritius, Hong Kong, Japan, Uzbekistan, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Oman, Doha, Kazakhstan, China, Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar, Taiwan, Kuwait and UAE (Dubai). Last year, the cargo facility was operational even during the two-month lockdown when the airport was closed for commercial operations. It successfully handled distribution of relief materials by participating in the government’s initiatives “Lifeline Udaan” and “Krishi Udaan”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-airport-handles-100-relief-flights-in-a-month/articleshow/82957285.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Tika Utsav 2.0 to refocus on 45+ still hesitant about jab||PANAJI: With many in the 45+ age group still reluctant to get their Covid-19 vaccine, the government has decided to launch another 10-day vaccination drive from Wednesday onwards for this category. Announcing the programme on Monday, chief minister Pramod Sawant said the Tika Utsav 2.0 will be held in villages and municipal areas. “This vaccination drive is for those who have not yet taken their first dose. The second dose will not be administered at Tika Utsav 2.0,” Sawant said In panchayat areas, the vaccination will be held at one location, while in municipal areas there will be two sites. Public representatives and NGOs will help in the drive. “Vaccination is the only option to make Goa Covid-free. We have not been able to achieve 100% vaccination in the 45+ category, but we are trying all possible ways to achieve this target,” the chief minister said. Secretary health Ravi Dhawan said Tika Utsav 2.0 will cover all panchayats and municipal areas. “We have a balance of 2.8 lakh doses for people in the 45+ age group. We would like to cover each of them, except those who have recovered from Covid-19 recently or are nearing recovery,” Dhawan said. As per government of India guidelines, patients who have recovered from Covid-19 should get vaccinated 90 days from the date of recovery. District immunisation officer Dr Rajendra Bokar said vaccination is the only hope for getting away from the disease and death and that people should cooperate. Head of the department of preventive and social medicine at Goa Medical College (GMC) Dr Jagadish Kakodkar said that over 12,000 people have been vaccinated so far at GMC’s vaccination centre and that at each government vaccination centre, thousands of people have been inoculated. “Even though vaccination offers the greatest hope against the disease and helps in reducing deaths, people are just not coming in desired numbers. It has been seen in countries, whether the UK, Australia or the USA, the more the population is vaccinated, the less severe are the cases and fewer mortalities,” Kakodkar said. He further said people should not believe in rumours about the vaccine, and that if they have doubts, they should consult a doctor. “To reach herd immunity, 60% of state’s population needs to be immunised. Currently, we are far from that figure,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tika-utsav-2-0-to-refocus-on-45-still-hesitant-about-jab/articleshow/82923489.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Siphon wells like maternity wards for tigers, bears: Vet||NAGPUR: The irrigation department has decided to close all siphon wells of Tekepar-Shrinagar lift irrigation project near Bhandara after the death of two tiger cubs in one of these wells. However, some experts believe instead of closing these wells, ramps should be constructed so wild animals can come out when needed. On May 12, 2021, two female tiger cubs drowned in one of the wells adjoining protected forests in Garada. The Tekepar canal is 10.5km long and cuts through the forest area. There are 32 such open siphon wells, which will be covered now as part of mitigation steps. However, raising a note of caution, Dr Gunwant Bhadke, a government veterinarian who examined several wild animals in the region rescued in conflict, said, “These siphon wells act as maternity wards for wild animals and hence should not be closed permanently. These wells are dry all round the year barring during rains, and animals use them to hide their young ones from various dangers.” “It is common for such man-made structures near forest areas to be used by wild animals. In Paoni range, where one of the two tiger cubs died the same day, the cubs were delivered in a canal crevice by the tigress. The spot was used as a safe shelter,” said wildlife conservationist Prafulla Bhamburkar. Dr Bhadke differed from wildlife experts on the death of the two tiger cubs, and said the cubs were inside the well and drowned as water accumulated during heavy rains on May 11 and 12. The tigress must have been away to hunt when the tragedy took place. Arguing his point, Dr Bhadke said, “A slope or ramp should be constructed for animals to come out in case water gushes in. Closing these wells will shut doors for animals permanently. As it is, animals from nearby forests must be using the wells for the last 25 years, when the canal was constructed.” However, Kishor Rithe, member of the expert committee constituted by State Wildlife Board (SWBL) to suggest mitigation measures, disagrees. He says, “These wells act as death traps. A tigress will never deliver cubs at such a risky spot and the cubs might have slipped inside when mother was away.” Dr Bhadke says, “During summers, these siphon wells are preferred as safe shelters by animals as the temperature inside is cooler compared to hot weather outside. On several occasions, cubs of leopard and bear have been rescued from such wells and canal pipes. Last year, a sloth bear cub was rescued from a canal well in Sitapur near Bhandara and reunited with the mother.” Rithe says even if the ramp is built the wells will still remain open and small animals like civets and porcupines can die in it. Such wells are considered traps and can invite action under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. Such wells should be covered with parapet walls. Rithe asks, “Many times sloth bears breed in abandoned and dilapidated quarters near a residential area. So should we continue these structures?” Ravi Parate, SE (minor irrigation), Bhandara, told TOI, “We have proposed to install precast grills with an opening of 2x2 feet to clean the wells. No animals will be able to enter the wells after these grills are installed. Ramp or slope will choke the wells and is not a good solution. However, Bhandara honorary wildlife warden Pervez Shahid Khan says, “During initial talks, half domes, ramps, and precast grills were some of the suggested mitigation steps. However, as the canal structure is old, irrigation officials are not keen to construct ramps. But any design should be first approved by experts and forest department before implementing.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/siphon-wells-like-maternity-wards-for-tigers-bears-vet/articleshow/82921698.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The court’s reminder came after the state government sought more time to place the status of completion of the 1,241-bedded Indira Gandhi Hospital in Dwarka where it has claimed 250 beds are operational for mild to moderate Covid patients. “Endeavour is to get it on its legs immediately. Our premium is on time and saving lives. If the government is having a problem in sorting out bottlenecks, please tell us, we will sort it out for you,” a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh told senior advocate Rahul Mehra. But Mehra said that all departments were cooperating, and the government would place a comprehensive report next week. “You are willing to have a temporary structure at Ramlila Grounds but not this permanent one? If Centre is not giving you beds then all the more reason to fast track this project,” the bench told Mehra when he alleged discriminatory treatment by the Centre. It had last week asked the government to file an affidavit giving the timelines that were initially set for completion of the hospital, the reason for not completing it within that and the subsequent new time frame set for finishing the project. Meanwhile, the high court also directed the refillers, providing oxygen cylinders to hospitals treating Covid-19, to regularly update the data on the Delhi government’s portal without fail. “This has to continue. It is not that when we issue notice then only the data has to be filled up by the refillers. We don’t want to make it unpleasant. You are part of the infrastructure system which is serving the society,” the court told 15 refillers, who were present in the hearing. They have been asked to provide information on opening stock of oxygen, quantity received and the time the quantity is further supplied by them to the hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-rap-for-govt-after-it-seeks-more-time-to-complete-1241-bed-hospital-in-dwarka/articleshow/82921843.cms||Abhinav Garg

Party mouthpiece Saamna on Monday wondered whether the posts are being held back to accommodate those who could help to topple the Maha Vikas Aghadi government and termed the delay in clearing the file ‘against the Constitution’. MP Sanjay Raut taunted whether someone is “doing a PhD”. “After studying the issue, PM Modi had conducted a surgical strike on Balakot within 24 hours. Now what research is going on, on the 12 nominations? Someone wants to do a PhD?” he said. Referring to an RTI reply received by activist Anil Galgali from Raj Bhavan saying it did not have the file with the recommendation by the MVA government, he said: “If it is true, it’s shocking and serious. Has the file been blown away by the cyclone winds or stolen by the ghost?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-doing-phd-on-12-nominated-mlcs-raut-taunts-guv/articleshow/82925458.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

As many as 17 more patients are under treatment in various hospitals. All three black fungus victims were under treatment at KGMU. They had defeated Covid-19 but contracted black fungus infection during the course of treatment and were referred to the university from other districts. KGMU spokesperson Dr Sudhir Singh said the three patients died due to septicemia as fungal infection has reached their brain via sinus area. “While a 40-year-old male patient was referred from Bihar, two women, aged 53 and 70 years, were sent to KGMU from hospitals in Deoria and Rae Bareli,” he added. Black fungus inflicts mainly those who have low immunity. Meanwhile, 17 more mucormycosis patients, including 14 at KGMU and three at RMLIMS, were reported on Monday. The number of patients under treatment rose to 195 in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/black-fungus-kills-3-more/articleshow/82923437.cms||---

He said there is vaccine hesitancy among the people because they have heard several rumours. “Most people are not on social media. But here what someone else says becomes the belief for most people. This is the reason that some people started saying the vaccination is unhealthy, people die and the vaccine causes dangerous incurable diseases,” he said. Pawar said various measures have been taken to raise awareness among the people but those have benefited the areas that are not remote. The vaccine drive is lacking particularly in the remote areas and this is the reason that the scheme has been announced, he said.“Superstition and fears of the vaccine fallout are the biggest obstacles in our achievement. Such announcement could bring about a change,” the MLA said. Sudhir Patil, the taluka’s medical officer said the vaccination achieved was just 28 % when it should have above 35% by this time. “The total beneficiaries expected in out taluka is about 68,000 for the people above the age of 45 years and so far about 20,000 have been vaccinated. We were expected to have crossed the 25,000- mark by this time and this is lagging only because people in the remote areas are not willing to take the shot,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/kalwan-mla-offers-incentive-for-100-vaccination/articleshow/82917801.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Lucknow||Lives on brink, key drug eludes patients||Lucknow: The shortage of life-saving drug Amphotericin B, used in the treatment of dreaded black fungus or mucormycosis, has aggravated in the city’s private hospitals. On Monday, the Indian Red Cross Society-Lucknow (IRCS-L) was not able to provide even a single shot to attendants of about 40 critically ill patients. “My wife (45) has recovered from Covid-19 but has got infected with black fungus and is under treatment in a private hospital. On Sunday, I was sent back saying the injectable drug will be available on Monday, but today too, IRCS-L said it can do nothing as the health department has not provided them with any vial of the medicine,” said Shreyas Bajpai. The drug is not available in the open market as pharmacists say all their stocks are sold out because of the rise in demand and fresh supplies are not coming. While government hospitals have enough supplies, patients admitted in private hospitals are forced to bear the brunt of the crisis. In view of this, the state health department had announced that it will provide a three-day dose of the drug to patients in private hospitals through IRCS-L. To get the drug, a patient has to get approval from the divisional commissioner who gets the demand verified by a panel of experts before directing IRCS-L to provide injections. All attendants who came to IRCS-L on Monday had approval from the commissioner. IRCS-L chairperson Om Prakash Pathak said, “We did not receive any vial of Amphotericin B from the office of the chief medical officer. We could not even provide the drug to eight patients who were given a day’s dose on Sunday. We have informed the CMO office and UP Medical Supply Corporation Limited (UPMSCL) about the crisis several times in writing.” President of Association of Otolaryngologists of India, Lucknow chapter, Dr Rakesh Srivastava said that seven patients are under him in a private hospital. “Due to the crisis, we are managing them with alternative drugs which are not as effective as Amphotericin B and have side-effects on kidneys and other organs,” he added. Divisional commissioner Ranjan Kumar said, “Whatever supply of Amphotericin B injection is supplied to us by state authorities is distributed after the patient’s application is verified by a committee. For further details, the state administration can be contacted about the difference between supply and demand.” The CMO and managing director of UPMSCL were not available for comments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lives-on-brink-key-drug-eludes-patients/articleshow/82923482.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

Started as a Covid care centre in May 2020, the hospital was converted into a dedicated Covid health centre (DCHC) with the setting up of another 100-bed Covid care centre nearby. “Currently, the number of patients is low and there are a few patients in the Covid care centre. The situation is improving and this is a good sign,” Ajay Kumar said. Former vice-president of the cantonment board Bhagwan Kataria, meanwhile, said: “I have written to the CBD drawing its attention to the possible third wave of Covid and the rise in the number of mucormycosis cases so that the people could be treated on time.”Talking about the preparations at the hospital for the new wave, Ajay Kumar said the hospital was getting a special ward ready for children. “Out of the 90 beds, 10 beds would be reserved for children,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/more-covid-beds-now-available-in-deolali-cantonment-boards-hosp/articleshow/82917814.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Lucknow||Amid crisis & saving lives, Covid warrior pours feelings in poetry for healing touch||Don’t know what hurts them more, the dropping saturation or the nasal bridge that’s now tender and sore... Once they enjoyed their homemade food, now depend on strangers to fill their feeding tube... They are a name, not a bed number, they will soon be up from their deepest slumber... As they hold my hand asking me not to leave, I become their partner in joy and grief... Even as the sweat trickles beneath my protective wear, I walk through the ICU aisle listening to their unsaid prayers... Dark are the eyes, darker the times, Will continue to work in conjunction with your prayers, believing to come out of it fine... LUCKNOW: These lines that flowed impromptu from the pen of a corona warrior on seeing the miseries and sorrows of patients are a glimpse of how healthcare professionals—exhausted physically trying to save lives—are also emotionally overwhelmed. While many chose to bury emotions in their hearts, Squadron Leader Dr Agrima Bhatia has let them out in the form of poetry. Posted in ICU of the DRDO-run makeshift Covid hospital in Lucknow, the 29-year doctor has penned two poems so far in the brief stint here to reflect on her experiences. “I’m not a professional writer, but the two poems which I wrote are my day to day experience as a medical professional as well as a human. It helps me to vent out my emotions and prepare better for challenges. Further, the writing helps express the pain and agony of patients who have hope that doctors and nurses will help them reunite with their loved ones. I become my patient’s partner in their joy and grief,” said the resident ophthalmologist, who is pursuing her PG from Command Hospital Air Force Bengaluru. Her husband Sqn Ldr (resident surgeon) Dr Swarup Prabhu is posted in the Ahmedabad DRDO makeshift hospital for Covid duty. “We are living in extraordinary times where humanity is facing one of the biggest crises. We all keep reminding ourselves that we cannot give up. It pains us to see patients gasping for breath. We are strangers to our patient but over time, we develop a bond even though the patient sees us in a PPE suit,” said Agrima, who has also served in the DRDO Delhi hospital. Like her, joint secretary of Lucknow Development Authority Ritu Suhas, who has been continuously involved in logistics for Covid-19 patients, also uses poetry to share her experiences. “I don’t write anything, but share passages of poems and writings such as ‘Everyone’s Losing Something’ by Odette Katrak or ‘A Franciscan Benediction’. It helps me express my experiences of dealing with patients. This pandemic has made us realize how tiny we are before the almighty. We need to be empathetic with patients and families,” she said. “These writings inspire me to help those who are in desperate need,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/amid-crisis-saving-lives-covid-warrior-pours-feelings-in-poetry-for-healing-touch/articleshow/82923569.cms||Arvind Chauhan

---||Goa||Manchester City determined to win Champions League: Raheem Sterling||Raheem Sterling hasn’t had the best of seasons. He knows it. Admits as well. The Manchester City winger, though, remains an integral part of Pep Guardiola’s side and is now one win away from winning a historic treble with the club. In this exclusive interview with TOI on a video call, the England star explained what the UEFA Champions League trophy means to him and the club. Excerpts… Having won three Premier League titles in the last four years, how important is it now for Manchester City to win the UEFA Champions League? Coming into the season, the Premier League was always our focus, the main aim, and we have achieved that. Now we have a chance to win the most glamorous prize in club football. Yes, it’s a big target for us and hopefully we can do that. Is the Champions League trophy an obsession? City is a club that is looking to build on its history. In recent times, we are doing that. Of late, the Champions League is something that we want as a club. We are really determined. It’s a competition that I set sight on ever since I came to this club. One of the ambitions was to win the Champions League and now we have an opportunity to do that. You have missed some big games in the Champions League, notably the quarterfinals and semis. Does that worry you ahead of the final? The manager decides who plays and who doesn’t and sadly, I was one of the players (who didn’t play). At the end of the day, the team is in the final and we have a chance of winning it. Are you happy with your form this season? I could be better in a lot of aspects, but a lot of things come into play in a football season, lot of things that fans and you guys (media) do not see. You would never understand. At the same time, everyone has their opinion on my season. At the end of the day, if you look at the team, even in the last couple of months with the games that I have missed out, I am still (among the) top two/three goal scorers in the team. Missed out on some vital games which as a player is disappointing. But at the same time, I am nowhere near the level I know I can be. At the same time, in our season I am (the) one who is still producing the most goals. How do you look at Chelsea FC, a team that defeated City twice this season? Will those results have any bearing on the final? We were disappointed to lose those two games. But this is a final. Things are completely different. You don't need any motivation than being in the final and being able to get your hands on the Champions League. Those two games go out of the window. We focus on getting the job done. If City emerge champions, it will be the third trophy this season. That would be incredible. But did the players think of a historic quadruple? Yes, of course, it’s something you hear but the most important is not to read too much into it. We have a chance of winning (another) trophy. It’s the Champions League final and we will get three. That will be an amazing season. City did not have the best of starts in the Premier League and were struggling till December. How did the turnaround happen? Like every season, there are ups and downs. As a team, you come together to try and overcome that. We have done that as a group. We grinded out results and we are now in the position where we are. Can you explain the role that Guardiola has played in making City the best team in the world. The structure at a football club never works without a good manager. He's a manager who wants to win (games), wants to win trophies. Winning one in a season is not good enough, he wants to win another one and that's the mentality you need. Sergio Aguero will leave City at the end of the season. How difficult will it be for anyone to step into his boots? He's a club legend. He’s done so much for this football club, won so many important games. The amount of trophies he has won in the last couple of years for this football club is truly remarkable. He is one of those players who will go down in history at this football club, and in years to come people will talk about him, like they are today. He’s a legend. (For someone) To come in and try to replace him and fill into his shoes will be quite a big one. Personally, what would a Champions League triumph mean to you? To win a Champions League will be a great accomplishment. As a kid you watch the league, and to be involved in one and have the possibility of winning one, you don’t need any more motivation than that. The Champions League is something that is missing from my time at City. That's something me and the whole team would want to get hold of. How would you sum up your last five years at City? Trophies, trophies, trophies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/manchester-city-determined-to-win-champions-league-raheem-sterling/articleshow/82945851.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Patna||Bihar: Digital divide hits vaccination drive in rural areas||ARA/BHAGALPUR/GAYA: The Covid vaccination drive is receiving mixed response in the rural areas of the state. While youths seem to be more proactive in villages, the requirement of smartphones for registration on CoWIN portal is acting as a deterrent as the rural people are not much tech-savvy. Hesitancy, apprehension and false rumours about vaccines have marred the vaccination drive in rural and suburban areas in Bhagalpur district. Doctors and healthcare workers associated with primary health centres (PHCs) and other facilities at block levels said they are confronted with negative mindset of a section of rural populace about the vaccines. District immunisation officer (DIO) Dr Manoj Choudhary said major cause of resistance from rural population is false information, negative mindset and preconceived notion about vaccines. “As per our surveys, it is apparent that the majority of households own at least one or two smartphones and have access to government portals to register for vaccination. Therefore, there is not much problem in registration. We are also trying to disseminate correct information through ASHA workers and PHC level health workers in rural areas besides offering assistance in registration through our healthcare team,” the DIO said. He added around 88,700 rural people in 60-plus age group have taken the first dose of vaccine so far and 17,800 have received their second dose in Bhagalpur district. “Similarly, 49,400 people have received their first dose and 11,900 second dose in 45-60 age group in the rural areas. At least 48,100 people in 18-45 age group have so far received their first vaccine dose in the rural areas of the district,” the DIO said. In Bhojpur district, despite issues like many people being not so tech-savvy, lack of vaccination centres and fear of post-vaccination effects, youths are helping the vaccination drive in gaining momentum in rural areas. For instance, of the 468 people who were vaccinated at Sahpur referral hospital on Sunday, 388 were from of 18-44 age group. At Udwantnagar community health centre, 445 people of 18-plus age group got the jab compared to mere 70 of 45-plus age group. Bhojpur DIO Dr Sanjay Kumar Sinha said, “Though we cannot afford to be complacent, the trend is encouraging as far as vaccination of 18-plus people is concerned. The youths, in rural as well as in urban areas, are self-motivated for getting vaccinated. They are motivating others too.” However, one of the obstacles in vaccination in some villages is lack of vaccination centres. Ashok Ram, Bhojpur zila parishad member from Shahpur (east) said there is no vaccination centre or camp in his village, Gaura. “Many rural youths either do not have smartphone or they are unaware of how to get themselves registered for the vaccination. Some sugar patients have died at the village after inoculation. The villagers, therefor, are hesitant in getting the jab,” he said. But Sahil Kumar Singh, a youth from Mathwaliya village, said, “The youths in my village are just itching to get themselves vaccinated. Almost all people above 45 years of age have been vaccinated in our village.” In Gaya district, a large population in rural areas does not have access to smartphones. These people are finding it difficult to book their slot for vaccination. For such people, the district administration has started the facility of registration at the RTPS counter of their respective block headquarters. A press communiqué said vaccines for 18+ people have been made available in the district. Meanwhile, BJP’s Gaya district vice-president Rajendra Prasad and secretary Satnosh Thakur have demanded that the vaccination process for 18+ people should be eased. The duo said like 45+ people, 18+ people should also be allowed to receive their vaccine shots by producing Aadhaar card after online registration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/digital-divide-hits-vax-drive-in-rural-areas/articleshow/82919909.cms||Kumar Rajesh
---||Mumbai||Leagues Apart: Nothing interrupts play in fantasy cricket, not even Covid||Prague, the Czech city in which the T10 European Cricket Series is being played, sounds like the name of a homespun saree brand every time it rolls off the earthy tongue of Ludhiana-based law student Piyush Arora. For Arora’s 2-lakh-odd online followers, though, his diction doesn’t matter so much as his prediction. “Ravi Tomar is a very important player,” pronounces the unironic voice of this 24-year-old introvert even as a red onscreen circle engulfs the name of the all-rounder whose jersey introduces him as ‘The Tank’, a nickname he has earned owing to his proclivity for big sixes and fours. In the same video, Arora promises in a mutual-funds-disclaimer-meets-Hindi-commentator tone, “Stary bhaiyya might just prove to be a star,” while referring to Czech batsman Mikulas Stary, the player whom he foresees replacing the wicket-keeper in the day’s match: VCC against PCK. “Who needs Royal Challengers and Knight Riders when there are Barbarian Vandals and Spartans Vanguards?” seems to be the mantra driving the boom of fantasy cricket in the face of the recent suspension of a major cricket league. For those wondering what fantasy cricket is all about, it is an online game which requires you to select 11 real-life players from between the two teams playing in a real, on-ground tournament that day and makes you gain or lose points based on the individual performance of the players in the match. “As a nation, we believe that we are armchair experts when it comes to cricket. And fantasy sport allows us the opportunity to test that theory,” says Suhail Chandhok, a TV spo-rts presenter and brand ambassador for a fantasy cricket platform, citing tourneys such as Pakistan vs South Africa, Sri Lanka vs West Indies or other leagues to remind us that the sport has “resumed and come back stronger in other countries”. This, in turn, means that the virtual universe—which is composed mainly of working men, chiefly engineers and mofussil influencers whose prophecies have not only won them nicknames such as ‘captain’ —is not starving. So, e-sport gurus have now trained their clairvoyant gaze on distant tournaments such as Caribbean Premier League and the ongoing European Cricket Series, which is being sponsored by a major fantasy cricket platform. For long the poster child of online gaming industry in India, fantasy cricket has witnessed a “pandemic-led boom”, says Parth Chadha, founder and CEO of an e-sports platform that noticed “a massive 4 to 5x growth” in their user base during the lockdown last year. While emerging players have gravitated towards other games on his platform such as quiz, rummy and chess, “true” fantasy cricket players, he says, are still continuing to play in the international leagues—some of which have prize pools running into crores. Malad’s Amit Gada, a 35-year-old shopkeeper who plays around 100 fantasy cricket contests a day (“not for profit, just for fun”) and has made Rs 7-8 lakh since he started playing it in 2017, spends close to one hour every day doing homework. “Big league tournaments like the IPL see a lot of novice players so it’s easy to win those big tournaments online,” says Gada, who looks up the pitch conditions and player statistics of smaller tournaments on their official website. Piyush Arora—who started analysing women’s cricket matches of Qatar and Uganda as a 19-year-old fantasy cricket enthusiast—takes delight in predicting the fortunes of the series of lesser-known, all-year tournaments even though it has been expanding his waistline more than his bank account. “They are difficult to analyse and less rewarding for us as influencers but it’s my passion. Besides, my people win money,” says Arora, who still earns an average of Rs 2.5 lakh per month through his channel. Recently, in fact, he bagged a cool Rs 7 lakh during the India versus England test series. “I plan to invest it in shares,” says the law student with a CA degree. If recent videos of bona-fide fantasy cricket gurus—which are full of warnings about online scams and fr-audsters—speak obliquely for the e-sport’s soaring popularity, a report by the Indian Federation of Sports Gaming shows that over 50% of online fantasy sports traffic comes from tier II and III cities and around 70% of the players from smaller cities engage on fantasy operator platforms more than four times every week. This is probably why despite having spent quite a bit on beta-testing and marketing, a fantasy gaming platform whose launch was postponed because of the IPL suspension, Namay Kedia remains bullish. “We’ve seen a lot of youngsters, especially those between 18 to 22 years and fr-om tier II and III cities, taking to fantasy cricket due to their competitive spirit among their friends and family,” says Kedia, whose platform will now have to look at other tournam-ents like the Euros in Football, global T20 leagues, the likes of The Hundred and CPL. But Gada doesn’t seem to miss the IPL so much as fantasy kabaddi. “Kabaddi is only played in India and, thanks to Covid, there have been no on-ground kabaddi tournaments for a year now,” he says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/leagues-apart-nothing-interrupts-play-in-fantasy-cricket-not-even-covid/articleshow/82923621.cms||Sharmila Ganesan Ram
---||Delhi||Delhi: Firing on all cylinders to combat next Covid wave||NEW DELHI: With the current Covid-19 wave on the wane, Delhi government has already started preparation for a possible resurgence in the coming months. The Aam Aadmi Party government, stung by the oxygen crisis that even caused deaths in hospitals, has imported 6,000 oxygen cylinders from China. These can either be used by individuals or used to equip 3,000 hospital beds in case of a resurgence in infections. On Monday, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal visited an oxygen depot in Mayapuri, which is being set up to store the consignment of oxygen cylinders from China. Kejriwal told reporters that though Covid cases were on the decline in the city, Delhi government would not become lax and had, in fact, started preparations for another possible wave of infections. Times ViewIt is great news that the positivity rate and the number of Covid-19 cases are down in the city. But we know that the coronavirus is shape-shifting and vicious. We also know that the only long-term solution is vaccination, which is currently happening at a snail’s pace. Which means that there’s no such thing as being over prepared to face a possible third wave.“We are preparing depots in three places to hold 2,000 cylinders each. These cylinders can be given to individuals in need and if another wave emerges and cases rise again, then with these 6,000 cylinders we can equip 3,000 oxygen beds, with two cylinders for each bed,” he told reporters after the visit. He disclosed that 4,400 oxygen cylinders have already been received, and the remaining 1,600 cylinders would reach the city in two to three days. Kejriwal said Delhi government faced a lot of challenges in importing the 6,000 oxygen cylinders from China because a consignment this big hadn’t been imported across India during the coronavirus pandemic. “Both HCL and Give India Foundation have donated for this and we are very grateful to them for doing so much for the people,” Kejriwal said. “I would like to especially thank the Indian embassy in Beijing. They helped us a lot. The external affairs ministry too helped us a. If it hadn’t, I don’t know whether we’d have been able to bring the consignment to Delhi.” Delhi government has also started an oxygen concentrator bank for the benefit of patients recovering in home isolation or who need post-recovery oxygen. The 11 revenue districts of Delhi were each given 200 oxygen concentrators to be delivered within two hours to needy individuals. The total stock of oxygen concentrators has now grown to 2,814, with the highest number of these — 350 — in North-West district, followed by North-East (294) and South-West (270) s. While East has 200 oxygen concentrators, South and South-East have 228 each. “Right now, the concentrators of are of 5-litre capacity,” the CM said. “But we are procuring 5,000 concentrators of 10 litres. We are also going to buy oxygen tanks and are creating storage space for the gas. The problems we faced recently are now being resolved.” He added that if there was a need, the government would create Covid care facilities with oxygen beds like the present ones at Chhatarpur and Burari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/firing-on-all-cylinders-to-combat-next-wave/articleshow/82919906.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Chennai||How contrarian ideas can catalyse scientific debate in medicine||By M KalyanaramanDr C V Krishnaswamy, a leading diabetologist of Chennai who passed away on Friday, was a lifelong contrarian. He advocated alternative healing therapies, warning that the side effects of allopathic drugs often outweighed their benefits. Just as one would expect, CVK, ever suspicious of drug companies and wary of side effects, had reservations about the Covid vaccine. He told his patients he wouldn’t recommend them.CVK denied that there was a diabetes epidemic in Tamil Nadu, arguing that the thresholds values for blood sugar had been lowered deliberately so drug companies could sell more of their anti-diabetes drugs. Such decisions are typically made after much data crunching, debate and discussion within and outside the global healthcare community. And CVK was no conspiracy theory spouting YouTuber but a man of science and medicine. Yet he stuck his neck out and risked his professional reputation to forcefully advocate his considered view that diabetic drugs were being over-prescribed causing more harm than good to patients. CVK was a dissonant voice against the consensus in the healthcare world regarding standards on blood sugar levels.Consensus based on peer reviews drives scientific progress. Mistakes are not rare and U-turns happen. But the basis of the consensus and that of any U-turns is peer review and wide debate and discussion. Scientists and researchers with impeccable credentials have often fallen out of the direction that the consensus takes. A famous case is that of Albert Einstein sneering at quantum mechanics. Einstein, by then a senior figure in the physics community, was dismissive of using probability concepts to describe fundamental particles of the universe. God created exact things, he believed. Niels Bohr, a younger colleague, admonished him saying Einstein should stop telling God what to do. While physics continued with probabilistic explanations for what animates all existence, Einstein remained a sceptic until the very end, keeping the door open for a U-turn later on.Covid has made scepticism towards modern medicine surge among common folk. Though leading in health indices and healthcare awareness, Tamil Nadu is also leading in Covid vaccine sceptics. Reports that film actor Vivek died after taking the first shot didn’t help.In the past, vaccine fears were largely due to the fear of the unknown whereas now it is triggered by a distrust of modern medicine itself. Covid has amped up public scepticism of modern medicine, which has been associated, rightly in-part, with the western world — one in which Indians and Indian knowledge systems play a marginal role.Science and scientific research is once again being debated in the public domain although the discussion is often not based on a thorough understanding of how a drug is tested in evidence-based medicine. Doctors’ eagerness in prescribing medicines and expensive tests have made people suspect commercial motives.CVK’s life indicates how scientific dissonance and nay-saying serves a purpose. His colleagues in the profession, many of whom respected his expertise and considered him their teacher, said his reluctance towards prescribing medicines for sugar was dangerous for patients’ health and demanded proof that his alternative healing worked. Not long after a TOI article echoed their reservations, CVK produced a study that sought to prove that the methods worked.If one were to go beyond its origins and the dominance of the west in its business aspect, modern medicine’s bedrock is its insistence on evidence and its well worked out methods of research and drug trials. The Tamil Nadu government has administered a Siddha medicine for Covid treatment and claimed moderate success. When corona passes, there may well be more minds open towards evidence-based acceptance of alternative therapies.

---||Pune||Pune municipal corporation, PCMC areas show decline in daily Covid cases & positivity rate||PUNE: The municipal corporations of Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad have reported a decline in daily Covid-19 cases and positivity rate over the past 10 days. Pune Municipal Corporation has recorded cases in three digits for the past five days — a first since the cases started soaring in early March. The positivity rate too has stayed under 10% on these days. In Pimpri Chinchwad municipal limits, the positivity rate is around 10-11%, while the caseload has hovered between 600 and 700, as against 900 around 10 days ago. Pune civic health officials said this was a significant improvement in the situation and urged citizens to get tested in case they develop one or more symptoms. “We have reported a continuous drop in cases and positivity rate; it was over 20% around mid-April when the cases had peaked. Our stringent measures are showing results. Testing centres are operational in every ward,” Sanjeev Wavre, assistant health chief of PMC, said. On May 15, PMC had added 1,693 patients, while the positivity rate stood at 13.7%. On May 24, PMC reported 494 cases at a positivity rate of 6.5%. PCMC, which had recorded 959 cases (11.8%) on May 15, added 423 patients (6%) on Monday. “The decline indicates that the spread of the infection has been contained to an extent. This has also reduced the active cases to around the 10,000-mark; it was over 50,000 mid-April. People however should continue to follow Covid-19 norms,” a PMC official said. Pune mayor Muralidhar Mohol said the administration has already started preparing for a potential third wave by boosting health infrastructure with additional beds. Officials from the district health office said they were making every effort to arrest the spread in the rural parts, where positivity rate has been around 18%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-pcmc-areas-show-decline-in-daily-covid-cases-positivity-rate/articleshow/82921761.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Lucknow||BJP’s counter: SP chief not aware of people’s problems||Lucknow: Cabinet minister and government spokesperson Sidharth Nath Singh slammed Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav for criticising chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s tours to districts for taking stock of Covid situation and said the SP leader is no longer aware of the problems of people and should step out of his comfort zone to see reality and accept it. Reacting sharply to Yadav’s remark saying the CM has embarked on tours which was a waste of government resources and time, Singh said SP’s politics is now only based on lies. “The CM even visited Saifai, the Yadav clan’s village, and Azamgarh, the parliamentary constituency of Akhilesh, to take first-hand account of arrangements and ensure all facilities are being provided without any discrimination,” he said. “It is historic that any CM has crisscrossed the state in a fortnight to ensure proper health facilities for people. The problem of Akhilesh Yadav is that his politics is confined to Twitter, away from people and their issues. It is high time he steps out of his comfort zone to see reality and accept it,” he added. Singh also questioned Yadav’s silence on the improvement of Covid situation in UP, saying he has not given any credit to the Yogi government for bringing down Covid cases from 3.10 lakh on April 30 to 76,000 within 23 days. “He has spoken about deaths in some villages. I challenge him to tell their location. A leader who has never stepped out of his drawing room is questioning Yogi ji, who has been on ground all through,” Singh said. It is ridiculous for him to question Yogi Adityanath about the Team 9 meetings without even knowing that the team meets every day. “In fact, it is the efficiency of Team 9 which has helped in lowering the number of Covid cases,” Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjps-counter-sp-chief-not-aware-of-peoples-problems/articleshow/82923609.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

A Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) official said 80% of the beds in each of these hospitals for paediatric care, if the situation demanded. “No reservation has to be done immediately. As a first step of the precautions, we are checking data about the hospital beds and their availability for children. The data collection and analysis are being done for future needs. We have started with 97 hospitals. More hospitals will be involved for the initiative,” PMC assistant medical officer Manisha Naik said. The PMC has also decided to set up dedicated wings for children at the hospitals treating Covid patients. Such facilities will also come up at the jumbo Covid care facilities. The PMC’s plan includes setting up facilities at its hospitals in Shivajinagar and Yerawada. An official said, “Nearly 100 beds would be available for the initiative. Besides, we have sought private hospitals’ participation to boost the Covid-19 mitigation infrastructure.” Rajeev Joshi, a paediatrician, said the civic body should ensure availability of trained staffers and medicines for children. “The infrastructure should be backed with trained manpower and paediatricians. Children’s treatment is a specialised work. Those with experience and knowledge of it should be available at the civic medical facilities,” he said. Another PMC official said the civic body had planned to take over 50% of the beds in all hospitals by the end of February following the spike in Covid-19 cases. In March, the civic body decided to raise the reservation to up to 80%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-eyes-up-to-80-hosp-bed-reservation-for-child-covid-care/articleshow/82921772.cms||---

We have already started preparing for the next wave,” he added. Kejriwal later tweeted: “Second wave in control, started preparation for third wave. Imported 6,000 oxygen cylinders. Can set up 3,000 oxygen beds with these. Grateful to HCL, Give India and central govt (especially Indian embassy in Beijing) for helping us get these cylinders to Delhi. Many more preps underway (sic).” With 4,375 patients recovering from Covid-19 in the last 24 hours, the number of active cases on Monday stood at 24,578, one-fourth of what it was on April 28, when the figure reached an all-time high of 99,725 active cases. In the past 26 days, Delhi has seen the number of active cases dip by 75.3% with the number of Covid patients recovering far outnumbering the number of fresh cases.

---||Mumbai||BEST fleet at its lowest for 1st time, citizens hassled||MUMBAI: For the first time, BEST’s own fleet of buses has shrunk to 1,999 against the 3,337 buses it needs to maintain to cater to city commuters. As a result of the shortage, commuters are having to wait longer at bus stops since the present government notification allows only 50% passengers to board buses and no standing passengers, said BEST panel members. The latest fleet statistics shared on Monday showed that BEST has 1,999 own buses while it had procured 1,243 buses additionally on wet lease from private agencies. But the total fleet strength is still at a low of 3,242 buses — a reduction of 277 buses in just three months. This strength was at 3,519 in February this year. BEST had announced that it will compulsorily maintain its own fleet at 3,337, and will purchase new buses to replace old/scrapped ones with funding from the BMC. “However, far from this, the fleet size has dipped considerably,” pointed out senior BEST committee member Sunil Ganacharya. “As per its own budget, 896 buses were scrapped in 2020-21, which included 726 single-decker diesel buses, 98 single-decker CNG buses and 72 double deckers,” he said. “The promise to introduce 100 brand new double deckers has also not been fulfilled till now. We demand that this should be expedited,” said BJP panel member Prakash Gangadhare. BEST spokesperson Manoj Varade said 206 electric buses are already part of the fleet, and the remaining 134 are yet to arrive. BEST workers union leader Shashank Rao said,"The management has reneged on its clause in the MoU signed with unions that it will maintain the BEST-owned fleet at 3,337 buses. We will take up this issue with them in our next meeting."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-best-fleet-at-its-lowest-for-1st-time-citizens-hassled/articleshow/82925562.cms||Somit Sen
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology develops a chullah that reduce pollution & fuel use||NAGPUR: The Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology (VNIT) has developed environmental friendly chullahs for rural areas, which emit minimal pollution in comparison to traditional ones. Developed under the supervision of professor Vilas Kalamkar from the department of mechanical engineering, the three chullahs, referred to as ‘biomass cook stoves’, would enable rural residents to cook cleanly with traditional fuels, while using less quantity and posing fewer health risks. “We’ve been working on them for the last eight years. We tested them in various villages and found the results satisfactory. Since it emits fewer gases like carbon dioxide and monoxide, it’s not harmful for women, who cook food in rural areas. There are many health benefits for the entire household,” Kalamkar told TOI. The professor and his team, including three PhD students, have developed three models of this product, which can be used under different conditions. The team included St Vincent Pallotti College of Engineering and Technology assistant professor MP Kshirsagar, Surat-based SVNIT teacher Rohan Pande, and Suraj Ghiwe from VNIT. Their work so far has led to two patents (published), copyright, and 14 research publications in internationally reputed journals. VNIT director Pramod Padole and professor SB Thombre provided support to the entire team in their research. Kalamkar said they would be sending their products for testing in the tribal areas of Vidarbha region and seek feedback before finalising it for customers. “We will further improve the product as per their requirements. Our products consumes less fuel, like wood, and emits minimal smoke. In rural areas, people have gone back to chullah model, as they couldn’t afford the LPG cylinder provided to them under the Ujjwala scheme.” He added that all these cook stoves are capable of burning solid biomass fuels in their original form, unlike the existing ones in the market, which require pre-processed fuels. “We’re now working on the final product development of the hybrid draft biomass cook stove. It would be intensively tested to fulfil energy and pollution standards set by the government. All the stove models are based on a novel user-centric design approach, which takes into account the use of different pot diameters by the same user, and the range of cooking power required at the user end,” Kalamkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vnit-develops-ecofriendly-chullahs-that-reduce-pollution-fuel-use/articleshow/82921784.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||India||Will Sushil Kumar lose his Padma? Government to take time to decide||NEW DELHI: With no clarity offered by Padma Awards scheme regarding grounds for cancellation of a Padma award and there being no precedent of an awardee being arrested subsequently for a heinous offence, the government is unlikely to rush into a decision on whether or not to recommend taking back the Padma Shri awarded to wrestler Sushil Kumar, in view of his murder taint. Kumar was arrested on Sunday for allegedly murdering fellow wrestler Sagar Dhankar in a clash at Delhi’s Chhatrasal wrestling academy. He faces charges of murder, abduction and criminal conspiracy. The Padma Awards scheme states: “The President may cancel and annul the award of the decoration to any person and thereupon his name shall be erased from the Register and he shall be required to surrender the decoration and the Sanad. But it shall be competent for the President to restore the decoration and the Sanad and to withdraw the orders of cancellation and annulment.” Kumar, who has won two Olympic medals – a bronze in 2008 games at Beijing and silver medal at London in 2012 – was awarded the Padma Shri in 2011. A source said the home ministry was seized of the issue and would take an appropriate decision at the right time. Former home secretary N Gopalaswami said that while the home ministry was competent to discuss a review of his Padma award suo motu, it may like to wait for a court order – even if it is at the chargesheet stage – before recommending to the President of India to cancel and annul the award. “After a chargesheet is filed, the award may be cancelled by the President. If at all he is acquitted later, the orders cancelling the award can always be withdrawn,” Gopalaswami told TOI on Monday. The general sense is that even if the Padma Awards does not spell out grounds for withdrawal of an awarded Padma, it is a given that anybody seen worthy of the one of the country’s highest civilian honours should maintain a certain decorum and high moral standards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/will-sushil-kumar-lose-his-padma-government-to-take-time-to-decide/articleshow/82927437.cms||Bharti Jain

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Cyclone Yaas measures with Amphan lessons||KOLKATA: Taking lessons from Amphan, a central unified command war room has been set up at the Kolkata Police headquarters for cyclone Yaas, which will work to ensure cutting down response time. Along with state agencies, the Army has deputed four columns for this purpose in the city. The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) will be using nine teams for their rescue operations with 30 members in each. The state’s disaster management group (DMG) has increased its manpower for the job and formed 44 teams to be spread across police divisions and boroughs — especially in areas of Ballygunge, Kalighat, Haridevpur and Behala. The Army units will be stationed at Fort William, the Ballygunge campus and Behala. “We had to deploy NDRF and DMG centrally during Amphan. With hundreds of requests pouring in from the corners of the city, we wasted a lot of time travelling. This time, we want to respond quickly and have spread our teams across the areas that may be affected worst. The experience from last year is dictating our decisions,” said an officer. The KMC buildings department on Monday identified highly insecure buildings in areas like Burrabazar, Posta, Rabindra Sarani, Cossipore, Bidhan Sarani, APC Roy Road, Ripon Street, Taltala and Elliot Road and asked residents to temporarily move out. KMC has arranged for their stay at civic primary schools and community halls. The drainage department has prepared a central group of civic workers to clean clogged manholes and KMC will engage expert tree cutters across boroughs to remove uprooted trees. They will be given electric saws to cut and remove logs faster to clear major thoroughfares. A 24-hour control room has been set up by NKDA in New Town and the authorities have arranged for cleaning of drains and water channels, trimming of branches and lowering of high-mast lights. The authorities have kept diesel generators and operators ready at water pumping stations and set up cranes at strategic positions. The water level at Bagjola canal will also be monitored. At Salt Lake, BMC authorities are trimming branches and checking up on drainage pumps apart from clearing sewerage lines. There will be a control room and all ward coordinators will monitor the situation from their offices. A quick action team comprising over 100 civic officials is being kept ready. Some school buildings in Rajarhat and Gopalpur are being prepared to shelter people if needed. In case the city loses connectivity, a 22-member HAM radio team will help cops take stock of the situation. A HAM station has been created at the wireless wing on Ripon Street. Traffic guards have been asked to remove high-mast lights and billboards by Tuesday morning. “The work is almost over. All leaves — except those due to reasons of health — will stand cancelled in the force,” said a traffic ACP.. The armed forces and Indian Coast Guard are expected to play a crucial role in the coastal areas. The Air Force has airlifted 950 NDRF personnel and 70 tonnes of load from Jamnagar, Varanasi, Patna and Arakonnam to Kolkata, along with Bhubaneswar and Port Blair, and16 transport aircraft and 26 helicopters are on standby for immediate deployment. The Navy has moved five pallets to Kolkata from where they will be assigned to different zones in the state. The state has been allotted a few of the four diving and 10 flood-relief columns and 31 Coast Guard Disaster Relief Teams with inflatable boats, lifebuoys and life jackets are on standby for Bengal and Odisha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-states-disaster-mgmt-group-get-army-navy-air-force-help/articleshow/82920013.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Hyderabad||Telangana stares at shortage of black fungus drug||HYDERABAD: Even as Covid-associated mucormycosis or black fungus cases are rising, Telangana requires at least 54,000 liposomal amphotericin B injections while the number of amphotericin B vials allotted to Telangana by the Centre is insufficient to treat the number of patients, health experts said. In a data collected from both private and government hospitals where the patients are undergoing treatment, health activists said the number of patients suffering from black fungus is over 900 whereas the number of vials required would be around 54,000 at the rate of 60 injections per patient. However, director of public health Dr G Srinivasa Rao tried to downplay the growing worries over black fungus cases in the state. Ch Sai Mani Varun Reddy, a health activist who filed PILs in Telangana High Court on Covid-19 treatment and other issues, told TOI, “We have collected data from the private hospitals. There are around 400 active cases of black fungus in private hospitals alone.” An independent check by TOI found that AIG Hospitals has 55 patients, Apollo has 75 cases in which 50 have been operated, Yashoda has 17 cases, Medicover has 16 cases, Care has 10 patients and KIMS has 26 cases of mucormycosis. If black fungus cases in two government hospitals — Gandhi and ENT Koti — are added, the number would easily cross 900, health activists said. Varun Reddy said the state government has constituted a committee to allocate the drug based on reports from the hospitals. “There are more than 900 applications from private hospitals in the last four days requesting for the anti-fungal medicine, which has emerged as a lifesaver for many,” he said. Experts, however, said there is a big mismatch between supply and demand of the drug. “The Telangana government instead of trying to hide the numbers should inform the Centre about the total number of black fungus cases from the private sector, from the districts and demand allotment of the vials from the Centre,” a health expert said. The vials cost anywhere between Rs 6,000 and Rs 8,000 each. According to health officials, a total of 400 black fungus patients are undergoing treatment on 150 beds in Gandhi and 250 beds in ENT Hospital. But, not sounding alarmist, Dr Srinivasa Rao told TOI, “When compared to the number of Covid-19 cases, black fungus cases are negligble. We need not panic about mucormycosis. We have to provide courage to the patients instead of exaggerating the issue.” On the other hand, doctors treating the black fungus cases warned against any complacency. Dr T Krishna Kishore, HoD, Rangaraya Medical College, Kakinada, said amphotericin B has to be given before surgery. “Otherwise, a surgery alone with amphotericin will not help. The mortality rate may increase by 90 per cent,” he said. Echoing the concerns, Dr Laxmi Narayana Buddharaju of University of Nebraska said: “Unfortunately, there are no other medicines for black fungus other than the three prescribed. There is lack of evidence on other agents. In case of non-availability of liposomal amphotericin B, one could consider amphotericin deoxycholate and monitor renal function closely.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/state-stares-at-shortage-of-black-fungus-drug/articleshow/82921805.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Lucknow||Akhilesh: UP has become a ‘bimaru’ state under BJP rule||Lucknow: Charging the ruling BJP of grossly mishandling the Covid care management, Samajwadi Party national president Akhilesh Yadav on Monday said the compound effect of government apathy is that Uttar Pradesh has been reduced to a Bimaru state in ways more than one. Describing the recent visits of chief minister Yogi Adityanath to districts across the state to take stock of Covid care management and health paraphernalia as an eyewash, the former UP CM claimed that 50 people had died of Covid-19 at Amraigaon village on the outskirts of the state capital. When this could happen near the state capital one can imagine the situation in other districts and the rural belt, he added. “It’s not only about Covid-19 management. The ruling BJP has promised to vaccinate everyone by Diwali, while only 35 lakh people have got the second dose of vaccine till now. Now reports of vaccine shortage have also started pouring in from different parts,’ Akhilesh said. “The truth is that the ruling BJP has turned Uttar Pradesh into a Bimaru state and there is an acute shortage of medicines and lack of testing facilities particularly in the rural. There are reports that most medical facilities don’t have common medicines like paracetamol. At Amraigaon in Chinhat area of the state capital as many as 50 people have died, including Dr Hariram Yadav and three other members of his family,” Akhilesh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/akhilesh-up-has-become-a-bimaru-state-under-bjp-rule/articleshow/82923666.cms||Pervez Siddiqui
---||Chennai||Hand-holding the ailing till the end||Chennai: Beethoven’s ‘Moonlight Sonata’ wafted softly into the front yard of an old bungalow located in Chennai’s Egmore. Such music was unusual for residents in the area. But for 98-year-old Saranya, who tested positive for Covid-19, it soothed her over-wrought nerves . Her hands went up in the air as if conducting an orchestra. The Beethoven symphony and live video calls with family members helped her through the last moments. Her family swore she died with a smile on her face. But few among the old and dying, who tested positive for Covid, were so blessed. A couple of weeks ago, when 90-year-old Vasudevan tested positive for Covid and was admitted to a city hospital, it had been a nightmare. "The unfamiliar surroundings, the groans of pain and screams of terror from patients around him finally got to him. He refused to eat. He was shouting during video calls with us, asking us to take him out of ‘this graveyard’," said a family member. Nurses tied his hands to force medicines down his throat. He died two days later. In April last year, when the novel coronavirus pandemic flung its morbid shroud across India, it was the elderly, who suffered most. "Currently there is a paradox in low-middle income countries like India: facilities like artificial ventilation of the lungs are made available to some, while even basic pain relief fails to reach the vast majority," Dr M R Rajagopal, palliative care physician and founder-chairman of Pallium India, a NGO based in Kerala, had stated then in an article he co-authored in the British Medical Journal. "If people are brave enough to think about it and have the agency to take the decision, many may opt for withdrawal of life support systems and to receive compassionate care and a compassionate death," he said in the article. He believed then that all dying people need not be and should not be subjected to aggressive life support systems, including artificial ventilation of the lungs. With the Covid numbers soaring in the current wave, the debate over palliative care in a benign home environment versus hospitalisation has picked up heat. Palliative care, an interdisciplinary medical caregiving approach, is rather nascent in India. The Covid pandemic has made it worse, stretching hospital resources thin. But despite the medical fraternity being overworked and fatigued, home physicians, hospices and palliative care-dedicated hospitals are hand holding a small number of the dying Covid-positive elderly to their graves. "Dying without dignity, in unfamiliar surroundings, makes us sad. We need to explain to the family that this is end-of-life care," said Scotland-based family physician Akash Devendra. Helping a Covid-19 patient in India through her last days on the request of a family, Devendra, who works in the Covid Hub of Raigmore Hospital, NHS (Highland), said the priority was to make her comfortable. "I asked the family to play soft music in low lighting and a calm atmosphere. The pet dog barking is a sign of normalcy." The nurses were instructed to keep talking to the patient. "Just hearing voices gives them a sense of comfort," he said. If the Covid patient is admitted to some government hospital, there are no plug points to even charge phones, said Dr Rajagopal. "The next thing you hear, the patient is dead. Family members don’t even get to touch the body. This causes pathological grief and it takes a form of mental illness from which a person may not easily get out," he said. He regretted that neither the Centre nor the Kerala government included palliative care in their strategy. "Kerala boasts of low death numbers. This is something to be proud about. But the people who die are dying cruel deaths with intolerable symptoms which could easily have been alleviated by palliative care," said Dr Rajagopal. His Pallium India has started grief counselling for bereaved family members. Palliative care experts have no access to hospitals. Patients reach out to them. But the Covid situation is overwhelming, unprecedented and in hospitals, doctors have too much on their hands. "At this moment, our priority (in hospitals) is for those gasping for oxygen," said director of public health T S Selvavinayagam. While the government encourages families to take care of their aged members, who are Covid positive, at home, their health parameters have to be under control. Peaceful death is the dictum. But the raging Covid pandemic has thrown systems out of gear. "Families have no access to their dear ones in hospitals and when they die, it is a long wait for space in crematoriums," said Dr Republica Sridhar, founder and managing trustee of RMD Care Hospitals and Trust. In Kattur village in Salem district, family members of 70-year-old Sushila are still recovering from grief. Sushila, who tested positive for Covid, fell off her son’s bike. Terrified villagers fled the spot when the man sought help to get his unconscious mother back on his bike. A young woman finally helped. Sushila died in hospital. Palliative care experts are now urging people to rethink human mortality in the context of Covid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/hand-holding-the-ailing-till-the-end/articleshow/82921789.cms||Jaya Menon
---||Pune||Police restrain farmhouses near Khadakwasla, Ghera Sinhagad from hosting parties||Pune: About 800 farmhouses around the Khadakwasla dam and Ghera Sinhagad have been served notices by the Haveli police, restraining them from hosting parties in violation of the prevailing Covid restrictions. The move comes close on the heels of Friday’s raid on a farmhouse at the foothills of Sinhagad fort to bust an illegal dance party involving 12 men and four women. Inspector Sadashiv Shelar of the Haveli police said, “We had earlier asked the farmhouse owners and operators not to indulge in activities involving gathering of a large number of people owing to the Covid restrictions. Still, a party was organised at the raided farmhouse. Now, we have issued written notices to all such facilities in the backwaters of Khadakwasla dam, Ghera Sinhagad and other villages, restraining such parties.” A similar illegal party was busted by the Uttamnagar police on the other side of the dam. The police had raided a farmhouse located at Kudje village on the NDA-Nilkantheshwar road late on the night of April 28, where a “dance party” was organised. Nine persons, residents of different parts of Pune city and Mumbai, were arrested. The Pune police conducted an exercise in the jurisdiction of Warje, Kothrud, Sinhagad Road and Uttamnagar police stations and asked the farmhouse owners not to allow such illegal parties on their premises. “Now, we have issued written preventive notices to all the farmhouses located in the backwaters of Khadakwasla dam, Ghera Sinhagad and other villages in the vicinity, asking them to refrain from allowing such parties on their premises. There are many farmhouses and other establishments in the area and people from Pune city regularly visit them,” Shelar said. “There are over 1,000 farmhouses in these villages and we have covered over 800 of them so far. We want to avert such incidents during the weekend lockdown,” he said. “The owners can go to their farmhouses to water the plants, other agriculture-related work or repair works, but they should refrain from calling a large number of people for parties,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/police-restrain-farmhouses-near-khadakwasla-ghera-sinhagad-from-hosting-parties/articleshow/82921826.cms||Gitesh Shelke
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: CESC battle-ready, supply to safe homes a worry||KOLKATA: All Covid hospitals that have back-up generators have been asked to keep them ready with reserve fuel for deployment in case of power supply disruption. At other mid-scale units that do not have back-up, CESC will position gensets to tide over the exigency. But concerns remain over supply at safe homes and oxygen centres that have sprung up in localities over the past three weeks. “The local facilities with less than 20 Covid beds are not mapped in our system. We have sought information about them from local police stations,” a CESC official said. While such facilities located in Kolkata proper should not face any problem as 80% of the utility's network is underground and will not be affected by the cyclonic storm, those along the city's southern periphery and south-western part, particularly the Behala-Thakurpukur belt, can face disruption if overhead power lines snap due to uprooting of trees. Even then, CESC vice-president (distribution services) Avijit Ghosh said he was confident of a much improved response than Amphan when the utility was handicapped due to low manpower availability owing to the lockdown. Against under 1,000 repairmen that could be deployed last May, CESC will have 2,500 men on the ground on Wednesday. Most of them took up position in the 50-plus vulnerable wards in added areas by Monday evening, ready to act after the storm subsides on Wednesday-Thursday. Ghosh said supply could be shut down in areas with overhead supply when the storm is blowing as well as underground supply if there is severe inundation. Apart from the usual list of hospitals, drainage pumping stations, waterworks, booster pumping stations and vital installations like Lalbazar, Bhawani Bhawan and Raj Bhavan, it has added over 100 new centres consisting of Covid facilities, vaccination centres and cold chains for uninterrupted supply during the cyclonic storm. “Kolkata may not bear as much destruction and damage during cyclone Yaas as it did during Amphan. But we have prepared for the worst while hoping for the best,” Ghosh added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cesc-battle-ready-supply-to-safe-homes-a-worry/articleshow/82920033.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Lucknow||Ayodhya Masjid Trust submits maps of Dhannipur project for approval||AYODHYA: The Ayodhya Masjid Trust — Indo Islamic Cultural Foundation — submitted the drawings of the proposed project at Dhannipur to the Ayodhya Development Authority on Monday. A mosque and other facilities are to be developed on the five acre land awarded by Supreme Court in the Ayodhya title suit verdict. Trustee Captain Afzaal Ahmad Khan met Ayodhya Development Authority vice-chairman Vishal Singh and other officials and held discussions about the project that includes a 300-bed super specialty hospital, a community kitchen that will feed about 1,000 people daily, a research centre dedicated to freedom fighter Maulvi Ahmadullah Shah besides a mosque big enough to accommodate 2,000 namazis at a time. The maps were submitted in 11 sets to the development authority. The Trust also deposited Rs 89,000 as processing fees for approval of the maps. Captain Afzaal said the map of the project is very big in size and quite different from normal maps, so the Trust could not apply online and requested the Ayodhya Development Authority to accept physical copies and grant approval after due deliberations. He also expressed his deep concern over the Income Tax department not granting 80G certification to Indo Islamic Cultural Foundation due to which donations are not eligible for tax exemption and are hence held up and this is hampering the project. Captain Afzaal urged the Union government and finance ministry to intervene for expediting the process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/masjid-trust-submits-maps-of-dhannipur-project-for-approval/articleshow/82923701.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan
---||Pune||No response yet to Maharashtra’s global tender for vaccines||PUNE: State health minister Rajesh Tope on Monday said the Maharashtra government had got no response to its global tender for vaccines yet, urging the Centre to take a similar initiative and let the respective states pay for the quantum of doses they needed. The doses should be allocated to states according to the population at a price fixed by the Centre, he said. The imported vaccines would be used for the inoculation of beneficiaries aged 18-44 years, Tope said. As on date, there is no response from global vaccine suppliers to the state government’s Expression of Interest (EoI). “The government of India needs to formulate a vaccine import policy at the national-level and ensure that there isn’t any unhealthy competition among the states,” said a state health official. Many states across the country have floated global tenders for procuring vaccines. But they have not yielded any results because of shortage of doses and other licences required, said another health official. Many states have now turned to the Centre to float global tender for procuring vaccines, which would benefit the states in turn. The central health officials stressed that the poor vaccine availability was an area of concern. Interestingly, one of the vaccine manufacturers told a state that it would only deal with the Centre and not with any state governments or private parties for supplying vaccines to India. A senior official from the Union health ministry said, “The initiative of different states contacting the vaccine manufacturers individually and bargaining for price would create inter-state inequities. The poorer states will stand to suffer because of poor bargaining power, with many ending up paying higher rates.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/no-response-yet-to-states-global-tender-for-vaccines/articleshow/82921811.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Pune||Massive turnouts prompt Pune private hospitals to scale up vaccine drives||PUNE: Private hospitals in the city offering paid jabs for the 18-44 group saw large turnouts on Monday. Slots for this group are now completely booked at some hospitals for the next five days, CoWIN data showed. Sahyadri Hospital (Hadapsar) and Symbiosis Hospital reported full slot bookings for the 18-44 group for the next five days. Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital and Ruby Hall Clinic’s slots for the next three days are booked, CoWIN indicated. Vaccination for the 18-44 group was paused for a week at civic sites to divert more doses for the 45-plus. Sources from private hospitals said this was a key reason for the large crowds on Monday. Principal director of Symbiosis Society, Vidya Yeravdekar, said they had opened slots for an estimated 1,200 beneficiaries per day till June 5. But all the slots were booked within two minutes, she said. Tushanka Nair, a resident of Kalyaninagar who got her first jab on Monday at the Symbiosis University Hospital and Research Centre, Lavale, said her vaccination experience “was good”. “It was for the 18-plus group. They are giving over 1,000 shots per day,” she said. Dhananjay Kelkar, medical director of Deenanath Mangeshkar, said their drive on Monday aimed at 1,000 beneficiaries and response was “stupendous”. “From Tuesday, we will be increasing capacity to 2,000 doses per day. Our site will run from 9am to 7pm,” Kelkar said. Ashwin Porwal, founder of Healing Hands Clinic, said their Dhole Patil Road branch is set to start 24x7 vaccinations from Tuesday. “We are hoping to get 10,000 Covishield doses on Tuesday. We have ordered nearly 1 lakh doses. We will run three shifts for the 24x7 vaccine drive,” Porwal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/massive-turnouts-prompt-private-hospitals-to-scale-up-vax-drives/articleshow/82921820.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra government’s Rs 1,500 relief remains elusive for auto drivers||NAGPUR: Maharashtra government’s one-time relief of Rs1,500 to each autorickshaw driver remains a non-starter in the city. A technical snag has prevented autorickshaw drivers from uploading documents like permit, Aadhaar card linked with bank account, driving licence since May 22. Secondly, the regional transport offices (city and east) are yet to be authorized to approve the claims. The state government had announced a relief package of Rs107 crore for the 7.5 lakh permit holder autorickshaw drivers in April when the lockdown-like restrictions were imposed to curb the spread of Covid-19. TOI had recently reported that there were no signs of the autorickshaw drivers getting the “meager” relief even a month after the announcement. After this, a website was created for enrolling the drivers. The government also roped in a private bank (ICICI Bank) to disburse the money and a training session was held for autorickshaw drivers’ union on May 21 on filling the online forms. The procedure started on May 22 but not a single autorickshaw driver has been able to submit the form. The system is consistently down since Saturday when the portal was launched, said autorickshaw drivers. Officials from the regional transport offices (both city and east RTO) confirmed that no autorickshaw driver has received the relief so far though the proces was launched on Saturday. “The transport commissioner office has not yet given regional offices the rights to approve the online applications. Unless the rights are given, we cannot process the request any further,” said an official requesting anonymity. The drivers termed the Rs1,500 one-time relief as ‘Unt ke muh mein jeera’ (as insignificant as a drop in the ocean). Instead, they are demanding tax rebate and waiver of monthly instalments of three-wheelers loans for the lockdown-like period. In June 2020, the Vidarbha Autorickshaw Federation with over 75,000 members from 11 districts of the region had moved the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court seeking a direction to state government to pay them a monthly allowance of Rs5,000 as most of them were on “the verge of starvation” following the lockdown last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/states-rs1500-relief-remains-elusive-for-autorickshaw-drivers/articleshow/82921814.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Lucknow||Univ replies to Guv after row over selection of min’s bro as asst prof||Lucknow: The vice-chancellor of Siddharth University, Kapilvastu, Prof Surendra Dubey on Monday sent a reply to the Raj Bhawan clarifying the university’s stand on the controversy over appointment of Arun Dwivedi, brother of basic education minister Satish Dwivedi, as associate professor of psychology under the economically weaker section (EWS) quota. In its reply, the vice-chancellor shared the details of the appointment process and said the recruitment has been done according to rules. “In response to a WhatsApp query by Raj Bhawan, we have furnished a reply,” Prof Dubey said. Sources said that Raj Bhawan took cognizance of media reports and sought clarification from the university regarding Dwivedi’s appointment. Former IPS officer, Amitabh Thakur, had on Sunday lodged a complaint with Governor Anandiben Patel, who is also the chancellor of state universities. The university said the appointment process for vacancies in 22 departments were initiated in November 2019. Screening of candidates was done in July 2020 and on the basis of academic performance, 10 applicants out of 150 were shortlisted. Interviews for selection on two posts (one under EWS quota and the other in OBC category) in psychology department were conducted on February 27 this year. The committee, comprising two experts nominated by Raj Bhawan, and department’s dean, shortlisted 10 candidates for interview. “He (Arun Dwivedi) secured second position in the interview. His overall performance, inclusive of academic score (where he scored 40 out of 50), was best as he ranked first among all candidates. We verify all documents submitted by candidates. So far as EWS certificate is concerned, it is issued by the administration,” Prof Dubey said. “The entire process was transparent and interviews were videographed. If one wishes to go through it, one may do so,” he said. Senior professors said almost all universities follow the routine process of verification of documents to ensure that a candidate fulfils requisite qualifications. District magistrate, Siddharthnagar, Deepak Meena said, “EWS certificate was issued to Arun Dwivedi on November 29, 2019. Before issuing the certificate, due verification and documentation was done where he fulfilled the criteria.” Basic education minister Satish Dwivedi told TOI, “I did not interfere in the recruitment process of the university. If anyone has a problem, I am ready for a probe.” The university’s website shows that the advertisement was published in a national Hindi daily on November 17, 19 and 24 (in 2019) and in a national English daily on November 20, 27 and December 4 (in 2019). Prior to his appointment in Siddharth University, Dwivedi was an assistant professor in Banasthali Vidyapeeth, Rajasthan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/univ-replies-to-guv-after-row-over-selection-of-mins-bro-as-asst-prof/articleshow/82923737.cms||Isha Jain
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Skyscrapers ready for wind tunnel test||Kolkata: When cyclone Amphan struck the city last May, Kolkata’s tallest skyscraper ‘The 42’ experienced the highest wind velocity. Towering 250m above ground, the wind speed at that height gains even more ferocity in the absence of obstacles and friction at lower levels. This Wednesday-Thursday, too, this building and other skyscrapers will be put to test. “At a height of 250m, the wind velocity is at least 3%-4% higher. Other buildings that are140m-160m tall will also experience strong currents, necessitating greater precautions than buildings that is 30m-50m tall,” said met scientist Devendra Pradhan. On Monday, developers in Kolkata ensure the checklists prepared prior to Amphan had been ticked again.“The 42 is complete and has got the clearance certificate. So there are no scaffoldings or lose material anywhere,” said Alcove Realty executive director Yashaswi Shroff. In buildings under construction, tower cranes used to lift materials have either been dismantled or the arm made free-moving so that they rotate in the wind. Aluminium shutterings have been reinforced to ensure they don't fly off. Loose material has been stowed in sheds. “Labourers who live in temporary quarters on the construction site have been shifted into the building for safety,” said Confederation of Real Estate Developers' Association of India (Credai) Bengal chapter president Nandu Belani. At Urbana and South City where people reside, all windows and doors to refuge areas and roofs are being shut. At Altius in Tangra, where a cladding had flown off during Amphan, checks have been carried out to ensure there is no repeat. In Atmosphere, palm trees atop Deya, the hanging club at 150m, are harnessed. “The Deya with Swiss bearings and friction bolts is designed to withstand such calamities,” said Forum Projects director Vidyut Saraf. “Other than external cladding in some buildings, there was no damage of consequence during the Amphan. Modern buildings are tested to withstand winds beyond 300km/ hr.

Airlines are keen that the decision is taken soon thereafter, so that they get time to inform flyers who would otherwise be braving restrictions and inclement weather to land up at the airport and find themselves stranded. The indecision by the Airports Authority of India till late on Monday evening appears to have been influenced by the possibility of the cyclone skirting Kolkata. Airline operators said that even if the city experienced consistent cyclonic winds of 60-80kmph with the possibility of gusts at 90kmph, operations will not be possible. “An early decision will help everyone, particularly passengers who can then reschedule their journey. Airlines will also need to fly out smaller ATR and Q400 aircraft weighing around 20-22 tonne,” an airline official said. There are around 10 small aircraft stationed in Kolkata. There is no such issue with the Boeing B737 and Airbus A320 aircraft that weigh 45-50 tonnes. They just need to be secured with chocks to prevent them from rolling. With the cyclone set to make landfall at noon on Wednesday, the impact on Kolkata should be between 2pm and 6pm. If the cyclone’s trajectory and timeline remains constant, airlines want to wind up operations by maximum10am so that they have a lead time to clear out the operational area and secure tractors, luggage carts, step ladders and other ground equipment. Sources said that unless the course of the cyclone shifted further west and moved farther from Kolkata, the airport is likely to suspend operations from early Wednesday morning and resume operations on Thursday. “We have issued warnings for Kolkata, Durgapur, Bhubaneswar and Jharsuguda airports,” said airport met office in-charge GC Debnath. Radars that track planes and help air traffic controllers guide them may also have to be switched off and unlocked to allow it to move freely with the wind to prevent damage. “The radar at Berhampur will definitely be switched off. We will have to see the speed of winds at Jharsuguda and Kolkata to decide on it,” an official of the communication, navigation and surveillance maintenance wing of AAI said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/airport-waits-before-taking-service-suspension-call/articleshow/82920068.cms||Subhro Niyogi

Many are against the idea of conducting the examination amid Covid-19 spike, while others want the government to conduct the exam, considering the importance it holds for higher studies. From suggesting an alternate mode and pattern of examination to vaccination for children in Telangana, students have highlighted several options the government could consider before holding the board exams amid the pandemic. “I am not for or against holding the examination. I just believe that the government should explore other options such as an online proctored examination, objective-type questions or an open book format in order to ease the pressure on us,” Devansh Agarwal, an Intermediate student of Little Flower Junior College, Uppal, said. With many entrance examinations doing away with the weightage for class 12 marks, students believe that cancelling the exams would be a better option. “Due to the pandemic, the weightage for class 12 exam marks has been removed from entrance exams such as Eamcet. In this case, the government should just evaluate us the way they did for class 10 and class 11 students,” said Shaik Sayeed Amoudi, another intermediate student, Vivekananda Junior College, Sirpur Kagaznagar, Asifabad district. As the Telangana government is in favour of conducting the examination between July and September, parents believe it wouldn’t be fair to cancel the exam at once. “Cancellation of the examination will be an injustice to those who have worked hard throughout the year. Students who have sacrificed their personal lives and spent hours preparing may feel betrayed,” said Subrahmanyam, parent of a class 12 student. Meanwhile, the Telangana government has submitted its option to the Union ministry of education on conducting the class 12 exams. Though Central Board of Secondary Education has proposed two options on conduct of the exam, a final decision might to be announced by June 1.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/intermediate-students-in-dilemma-over-final-exams-urge-govt-to-explore-options/articleshow/82921831.cms||Preeti Biswas

Doctors said although the incidence is very rare among home isolated cases, some young patients — who were mild cases — too are reporting thrombosis in different parts of the body. Consultant interventional cardiologist Dr Shoeb Nadeem said last week he treated a rare case of renal clotting in a Covid recovered 41-year-old man. “These rare patients are otherwise healthy and don’t have any comorbidity. The incidence is more in diabetic and cardiac patients. Usually, such cases surface either during hospitalization or within one month of discharge,” Dr Nadeem said. Pulmonologist Dr Ravindra Sarnaik said it depends on evaluation and mostly there is possibility of other reasons, such as inflammatory markers and patches showing up in later phase of infection. “80% Covid patients recover at home. If any of them deteriorate due to dynamics of the novel coronavirus and their SPO2 goes down or D-Dimer increases, they turn mild to moderate. In post-Covid, moderate to severe category patients are at greater risk of thrombosis because they needed more oxygen and received more medicines,” he said. Read AlsoPost-Covid issues need to be addressed: AIIMS chiefNEW DELHI: Even as Covid-19 cases have once again started declining and recovery rate is improving, there is post-Covid sequelae (after-effect of a disease) that needs to be addressed, AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria said, highlighting opportunities for post-Covid care clinics and rehabilitationDr Sarnaik added that such patients have to remain alert for 28 days after discharge. Cardiologist Dr Jaspal Arneja said they have been seeing a lot of patients with clotting issues. “We have patients with acute blockage of arteries in the lungs, abdomen as well as cases of heart attacks in post-Covid. So it is important Covid patients who were hospitalized and had lung involvement to be on anticoagulants to prevent vascular complications,” he said. However, cardio-surgeon Dr Prashant Jagtap said they had been getting patients with chest pain because of sheer anxiety while their ECG is normal. “Unlike previous summers, we find fewer cases of heart attacks. There were some deaths due to cardiac complications in few Covid patients, but they were mainly elderly.” Read AlsoMost symptoms of PIMS associated with Covid resolved after six monthsA study in UK shows most symptoms of rare paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIMS-TS), associated with SARS-CoV-2 are resolved after six months. Though the study, published in The Lancet Child &amp; Adolescent Health, was conducted on a small group of paediatric patients, it shows someChest physicians said they are now prescribing low dose blood thinner ecospirin to even home isolated patients for a minimum two weeks. Dr Syed Tarique, a chest physician, said patients need to seek the opinion of cardiologists as it is more important. “In first wave, we saw some patients who had cardio issues despite their CT scan being normal,” he said. Chest physician Dr Vikrant Deshmukh said even among young patients, if the D-Dimer score is higher, anticoagulants or blood thinners are prescribed. “It depends on case to case basis. The incidence is same as it was during first wave,” he said. Urologist Dr Sadashiv Bhole said, “We would need some time to pool data from different centres before we can confidently say if it is really a post-Covid complication or just normal statistical change. At our hospital, we give anti-coagulants and anti-platetets to prevent thrombotic complications,” he said. Neurologist Dr Chandrashekhar Meshram said as the number of Covid patients was more in second wave, thrombosis cases too have increased. “But stroke is not fatal,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/heart-attack-stroke-lung-renal-clotting-on-the-rise-post-covid/articleshow/82920071.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Pune||Norms soon for inoculation of ‘frail’ senior citizens at nearest centre||Pune: Guidelines for the vaccination of ‘frail’ elderly citizens and the differently abled who are unable to reach vaccination centres in urban and rural settings are expected soon from the Union health ministry as the focus will be on their immunisation in June and July. Chairman of India’s technical advisory group on Covid-19 Dr NK Arora told TOI that many local bodies have initiated vaccination for senior citizens in urban settings in housing societies or at a common place.This practice will be encouraged, provided the organisers take due care in tie-ups with healthcare centres and check for any Adverse Event Following Immunization (AEFI). The norms would have a clear definition of the ‘frail’ elderly, Dr Arora added. Many states have told the Centre that the elderly were afraid to come to the vaccination centres because of the surging crowds. “ These guidelines would help them,” Dr Arora said. The Centre has not yet planned a door-to-door vaccination programme because of likely AEFI events, he added.The differently abled have also been feeling left out of the vaccine programme and have sought door-to-door immunisation .Urban local authorities have started vaccination drives in schools, common places and work places, but proper monitoring of any AEFI events, including allergic reactions or anaphylaxis is necessary, Arora cautioned. “Every vaccinated person must be monitored for half an hour after taking the jab,” he said. Local authorities in rural areas would have to set up more centres to encompass a larger population. “ In many urban areas, residents welfare associations, colonies and workplaces are arranging for vaccination for the elderly, but in rural areas they find it difficult to travel to the centres to get their shots. The health department and local authorities should set up additional centres among a cluster of villages to enable vaccination for them,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/norms-soon-for-inoculation-of-frail-senior-citizens-at-nearest-centre/articleshow/82921824.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Chennai||Chennai: EPS, OPS work individually, rift widens||CHENNAI: The political estrangement between AIADMK coordinator O Panneerselvam and co-coordinator Edappadi K Palaniswami has taken a new turn. The two leaders have been issuing their individual statements. This has been evident, more so after EPS was made the leader of opposition. On Monday, Panneerselvam demanded that chief minister M K Stalin act against DMK partymen, who allegedly intimidated the civic staff in Chennai asking them to remove the Covid field staff and appoint their men. Hours later, the former deputy CM took to his official Twitter handle to thank Stalin after an assurance was made by Greater Chennai Corporation commissioner Gagandeep Sigh Bedi that existing staff would not be removed. “I thank the chief minister,” OPS tweeted. Palaniswami's statements in his capacity as leader of the opposition, be it to seek Covid relief for unorganised workers or to demand action against Cuddalore GH staff for lapses, came from the party headquarters and was uploaded on AIADMK's official Twitter handle. EPS shot off letters to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Panneerselvam’s statements don’t carry the name of co-coordinator (EPS), instead it comes from his office or uploaded on his Twitter handle. They urge action against fleecing ambulances, condole bereaved families of health workers, welcome the state’s decision to shut down Tasmac outlets or seek availability of drugs for mucormycosis, the black fungal infection and demand adequate vaccines. The leaders had issued joint statements only to expel former minister Nilofer Kafeel from the primary membership of the party, and to warn partymen against anti-party activities. “As party leaders, OPS and EPS are supposed to take stock of the poll debacle and call for reports from the district secretaries and take corrective action. Amma would have taken such steps. Now both leaders prefer sending statements on their own, seeking the limelight,” said a senior leader. Most of the elected MLAs followed Palaniswami after the oath taking event at Kalaivanar Arangam on May 11. Panneerselavam found a lone supporter in Paul Manoj Pandian, the Alangulam MLA. Lack of support of his own partymen and the huge clout of the former ministers-cum-district secretaries has left Panneerselvam isolated. Senior leaders say that none of his former supporters are on good terms with him since he did not campaign much outside his home turf, Theni district, where he was the lone winner. “OPS has built a defensive wall around him ever since he lost the posts of chief ministerial candidate and the leader of opposition to Palaniswami,” said an associate. Panneerselvam, along with former speaker P Dhanapal, represented the AIADMK during the swearing-in ceremony of the 34-member Stalin’s cabinet on May 7, and shared a table with Stalin later.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/eps-ops-work-individually-rift-widens/articleshow/82921825.cms||Julie Mariappan

The crime branch (Unit 7) on Sunday arrested Johrabai Akbar Ali Shaikh (75) and Kishore Gawali (57) and recovered 4kg of charas procured from Himachal Pradesh worth Rs 1.18 crores from their house at Waterfield Road in Bandra. Preliminary probe revealed that Johrabai was into this business since her sister died a decade ago for whom Gawali used to work. Since her death, Gawali had been staying in their house and helping Johrabai with drug peddling. However, Johrabai's two sons who run a garment boutique in the area have gone underground and the police have launched a manhunt to nab them. The purest form of charas supplied by the duo is called Malana cream and is not available in Mumbai, said the cops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-75-yr-old-may-have-links-with-those-supplying-drugs-to-celebs/articleshow/82925637.cms||Ahmed Ali

Some hospital administrators said they are yet to receive a response from Bharat Biotech on availability. Jitendra Oswal, deputy director of Bharati Hospital, said, “We had written to Bharat Biotech for a few thousand doses. But we are yet to receive a reply.” Founder of the Healing Hands Clinic Ashwin Porwal, who said he is in touch with Bharat Biotech, said the company told him supply would resume by the first or second week of June. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said the district is likely to receive some doses from the state or Centre this week. But he added that Covaxin supply to the region may take weeks to improve and stablilise. “We know many are in line for a second jab. Unless supply improves, this number that is due will continue to increase in the district,” he said. Data provided by the zilla parishad showed that as on May 24, there are 27,437 beneficiaries who are due for a second Covaxin dose in Pune rural areas. In Pimpri Chinchwad, that number is over 24,000. The list from PMC limits was not immediately available. Sanjay Patil, chairman of the IMA’s Hospital Board of India, said the growing waiting list for a Covaxin second dose is a matter of concern. He said the organisation will raise the issue soon with the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/still-no-word-on-covaxin-supply-thousands-await-second-shot/articleshow/82921828.cms||Piyush Bhusari

The civic body has started ‘vaccination on wheels’ for focused groups. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has urged NGOs and social groups to approach the PMC for arranging such drives. PMC has given jabs to 800 people in the last couple of days, since the drive started. So far, 12 special drives have been conducted.  Five more applications are in the process, said a senior official of PMC. “The civic administration wants to make sure that all the due beneficiaries receive the jabs. So, we have started this drive. Those who fall in this category should approach the civic body,” said Rubal Agarwal, additional commissioner, PMC. As per PMC officials, the drive is being carried out with a public-private tie-up. The beneficiaries include patients in mental hospital and senior citizens. Even commercial sex workers were inoculated. Ten special men and women from Savali school for special children and their eight caretakers were vaccinated on Monday. “The drive of bringing vaccines at the doorstep is very good.

Thousands of trees were uprooted across the township last year due to Amphan and they brought down a mesh of cables as well. It took several days for the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) to clear the mess. The overhead wires have been hanging from street lights in all the major arterial and cross roads of the township and have even wrapped around trees in many places. The cable lines that had snapped and touched the ground during Amphan can still be seen at some places. BMC officials said they are taking precautionary measures by trimming the branches. “Our teams have been deployed to ensure that trees are removed at the earliest if they get uprooted. We are trying to remove overhead cables as much as possible,” said a civic official. Two teams in Salt Lake and one in Rajarhat have been deployed, the official said. Residents said the overhead cable mess has been present for years. “Almost all main roads in Salt Lake are marred with overhead cables. The authorities should do something,” said Sankhadeep Roy Chowdhury, a resident of AE Block. BMC had planned to follow the New Town Kolkata Development Authority model to set up underground cable ducts, but the plan could not be implemented till now. In Sector V, overhead cables were removed from some stretches by NDITA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cable-mess-woes-plague-salt-lake/articleshow/82920072.cms||Suman Chakraborti

Chief PP, D R Kale, said he would address HC on Tuesday on medicine availability. The state government on Monday told the bench that two schemes for free treatment to underprivileged at select hospitals will cover mucormycosis cases. The HC directed that notwithstanding the policy, “identified private hospitals be restrained from raising astronomical bills and cost of treatment be monitored...” HC was hearing a criminal suo motu PIL on Covid-related measures and focused on treatment for ‘black fungus’. The schemes are Mahatma Jotiba Phule Jan Aarogya Yojana (MJPJAY) and Pradhan Mantri Jan Aarogya Yojana (PMJAY). The HC bench of justices R V Ghuge and B U Debadwar called for giving the scheme “wide publicity’’ as, it said, “the poorest of poor, illiterate, semi-literate and those in remote and tribal areas will be aware of the facilities”. It added, “This will prevent unscrupulous elements [hospitals] from fleecing the poor and ignorant by raising large bills for advancing treatment on mucormycosis.” The HC said the list of hospitals also be widely publicised so that no patient lands up at the “wrong hospital”. It also directed that “hospitals identified for treatment display an instructions board for the public at large, at conspicuous places” with information on availability of beds. About 130 hospitals in the state have been identified to treat anti-fungal ailments. Medicines would be available through the district civil surgeon. Also, 1,000 more hospitals are to be empanelled and 19 medical and surgical packages have been identified to treat mucormycosis under MJPJAY. Medicines will be free for patients in hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/hc-publicise-2-schemes-for-needy-black-fungus-patients-in-mumbai/articleshow/82923947.cms||Swati Deshpande

The drive will help the party bolster its organization in UP ahead of the assembly elections. “We got a few local leaders of BSP in Lakhimpur Kheri to cross over to our party. There are leaders from other parties also, including the BJP and the Congress, who are also in touch with us. We would share their names in a day or two,” TMC UP president Sanjay Rai said, adding the party is welcoming office-bearers of other parties and influential persons who can bring at least 100 people with them. “We are taking aadhar numbers and phone numbers of those who are joining us and are following full Covid protocol. We are also promoting the party on social media,” Rai said and added that TMC wants to be a serious contender for UP assembly elections and the membership drive is the first step towards it. The focus of the party is on rural UP where it will try to make as many new members as possible very much like West Bengal where TMC enjoys massive support in the rural belt. The party had not focussed on Bundelkhand for three years. But now the district has been covered under the membership drive. Starting from Kheri, TMC will enrol members in the Terai belt which is part of the Awadh region, one of the four organizational units that the party has divided UP into for better management. Purvanchal would be taken up in the second and west UP in the last leg. The drive would be taken up vigorously after the lockdown, the state party president added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/tmc-eyes-rural-votes-brings-local-bsp-leaders-to-fold/articleshow/82923762.cms||Neha Shukla
---||Pune||As situation eases, industries seek relief from oxygen curbs||Pune: With the second wave of the pandemic receding across Pune Metropolitan Region, and with the current restrictions slated to end on June 1, industries have asked the government for some leeway in procuring raw materials, especially industrial oxygen. While most industrials units in PMR, especially the larger ones, were operational during the recent lockdown-like period, some sectors — especially MSMEs which act as key vendors to larger units — were affected by raw material shortage. Some units had to shut shop as their raw material suppliers were not allowed to operate, and almost all oxygen supply was for medical use. With active cases and demand for oxygen dropping, industries have asked for a gradual resumption of supply. “We asked the authorities a week back to resume oxygen supply to industries in a phased manner. Hospitals need less oxygen now, and our suppliers have reported that they have a lot of stock. We would be okay with even 20% of the stock, as otherwise we have to use some very expensive alternatives such as plasma cutting,” said Sandip Belsare, president of the Pimpri Chinchwad Small Industries Association. Belsare also urged authorities to impose price controls on key raw materials such as steel and alloys, so that MSMEs can resume full production in a sustainable way. The Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industry, and Agriculture (MCCIA) said it was following up with authorities in this regard. “As the medical oxygen situation improves, the administration must start gradually releasing the constraints on industrial oxygen availability as many supply chains are dependent on it. More than 1,000 companies in the Pune division — 250-300 in the district — are dependent on oxygen supply,” MCCIA director-general Prashant Girbane said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/as-situation-eases-industries-seek-relief-from-oxygen-curbs/articleshow/82921852.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

This was revealed in the district collector’s latest report on key anti-mucormycosis medicines that officials allot to the treating hospitals in the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR), based on the number of patients under treatment at these facilities. Of the 420 patients, the hospitals in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) areas are treating a maximum of 307 patients, followed by health hubs in the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (101) limits and rural parts (12). District collector Rajesh Deshmukh has ordered rapid screening/surveillance among the recovered Covid patients, diabetic and immunocompromised population in rural parts of Pune for early detection and treatment of the fungal infection between May 24 and May 27. “The rapid screening-based survey will mainly target people who have recently recovered from Covid-19. It will also look for early warning symptoms of mucormycosis in diabetic and immunocompromised population in the rural areas,” he said. The suspected patients identified during the rapid screening-based survey will be referred to ENT surgeons and physicians for diagnosis. “The confirmed patients will be referred to hospitals/medical colleges empanelled for treatment of mucormycosis under Mahatma Phule Jan Arogya Yojana, the state-sponsored health scheme, for treatment,” Deshmukh said. Block development officers and taluka health officers have been told to play a key role in carrying out the survey. “We have asked them to prepare lists of patients who recovered from Covid-19 and were discharged from hospitals after April 15. A patient usually develops the disease within a month after Covid,” Deshmukh said. The talukas in the district wuith the highest Covid patients will be primarily focused on during the survey. Daund, Ambegaon and Bhor talukas have more “Covid hotspot” vilages. A village is termed a “hotspot” when it has more than 10 active Covid-19 cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/51-hosps-treating-420-mucormycosis-patients-in-pmr/articleshow/82921849.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Goa||Spain investigates new strain after ISL player tests positive for Covid-19||Panaji: A leading foreign player who excelled in the Indian Super League (ISL) last season has tested positive for Covid-19, prompting Spain to launch an investigation into the new strain. The footballer was asymptomatic and is now out of isolation, but the COVID Epidemiological Surveillance Network of Spain continues to monitor and test players who arrived from India. “One of the football players who returned has a positive result in COVID with a specific variant that is of special interest in Spain right now,” the COVID Epidemiological Surveillance Network of Spain wrote to the player’s club and the ISL organisers last week. Alarmed by the positive test for a new strain, Spanish authorities are understood to have tested other players who returned home. All of them tested negative for Covid-19. “Until the players were inside the bubble, there was no chance of them contracting the virus,” a club official told TOI. “The league had very strict protocols and we didn’t have a single positive case throughout the six-odd months that the team was together in the bubble. We tested the players almost three times a week.” Sources said the foreign player could have possibly contracted the virus during his holiday here, after the conclusion of the Indian Super League (ISL), or during the journey back home. India is a popular destination for Spanish footballers, since the launch of ISL in 2014. While Brazilian and French players were in abundance during the first two seasons, Spanish players are now in vogue. The last edition of ISL which concluded in March had more than 20 Spanish players with Igor Angulo winning the Golden Boot (highest goal scorer) and Alberto Noguera picking up the Winning Pass of the League award for most assists. Both players are from FC Goa, who had five of their six foreign players from Spain. Interestingly, Indian clubs are also increasingly opting for Spanish coaches to manage their teams. Seven of the 11 ISL teams had coaches from Spain at the start of the season. In the ISL’s seven-year history. only twice have non-Spanish coaches won the league – Italy’s 2006 World Cup winner Marco Materazzi (2015) and John Gregory (2017-18), both with Chennaiyin FC.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: United by grief, Amphan victims’ kin pray no lives are lost this time||KOLKATA: Ten-year-old Arpita Gayen still has nightmares during rain and thunderstorm while Saraswati Adhikari pleads with her family members to not step outdoors in heavy rain. Angad Singh Sethi spends sleepless nights, haunted by memories of his brother who was electrocuted on a waterlogged stretch. Separated by kilometres, families of the city’s Amphan victims are united by their grief. The fact that a similar storm is set to hit again, around the same time as last year, has left them distraught. Amphan had wreaked havoc in the city on May 20 last year, leaving 19 people dead from electrocution as bodies floated on waterlogged roads for several hours before they could be pulled out. Pintu Gayen, who had been leading colleagues through a waterlogged stretch of Becharam Chatterjee Road in Behala, was electrocuted near his home. His daughter Arpita saw the 37-year-old man’s body floating in the water, but no one — neither her mother nor her uncles — could step forward to pull him out. Ten days later, Arpita’s grandmother died of shock, unable to bear the loss. “She panics every time it rains. Since the day she heard that a similar cyclone is approaching, she has been pleading with me not to go to work. I have informed my office and will work from home on Tuesday,” said Aparna, Gayen’s widow. Aparna said she saw civic officials cutting down branches, cleaning clogged drains and stationing water pumps in multiple pockets around the low lying area near her house. “They seem prepared this year. Perhaps my husband’s death has taught them a lesson,” she said. At Parnasree, family members of Pavneet Singh Sethi spent Sunday at a Gurdwara praying for his soul and hoping the impending cyclone spares the city. “We would have celebrated my brothers 32nd birthday on May 23 this year. We know how painful it is to endure the loss of a young life. We request the government and agencies, like CESC, to see that no more lives are lost due to electrocution,” said Pavneet’s brother Angad, who lost a 40-year-old cousin to Covid recently.. On May 20 last year, Pavneet had stepped out of their complex to wade through a waterlogged lane in order to get medicines for his father. His family had found his body floating 500m from their home. A year on, as the city is staring at a similar storm, Pavneet’s parents have been asking relatives not to venture out till the water recedes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/united-by-grief-amphan-victims-kin-pray-no-lives-are-lost-this-time/articleshow/82920087.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Though the study, published in The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health, was conducted on a small group of paediatric patients, it shows some interesting data. Severe PIMS-TS, a rare post-viral inflammatory disorder associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, reports first six-month follow-up data. Most inflammation, gastrointestinal, heart, and clinically significant neurological symptoms were resolved within six months of being discharged from hospital, suggesting long-term damage to the organs is rare. Dr Justin Penner, co-author of the study from Great Ormond Street Hospital, UK, said, “As PIMS-TS is a very rare complication of Covid-19 in children, our study included a small number of children from one hospital. Nevertheless, these findings can hopefully signal cautious optimism that many of the most severe effects of PIMS appear to resolve within six months. The persisting fatigue, difficulty exercising and mental health effects we saw in some children, which can interfere with daily lives, must be closely monitored and patients should continue to be supported by medical teams with a range of specialisms.” Of the small number of children who have had severe PIMS-TS, the authors recommend that some may need ongoing support for muscle fatigue, mental health effects, and difficulty exercising. PIMS-TS, also known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), is a rare condition associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection that was first defined in April 2020. More than 250 cases were identified in the UK and Ireland from March to June, 2020. It is not known what triggers the condition, but it is thought to be a rare immune overreaction that occurs approximately four to six weeks after mild or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. The symptoms include fever, rash, eye infection, and gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. diarrhoea, stomach-ache, nausea). In some rare cases, the condition can lead to multi-organ failure. Dr Karyn Moshal from Great Ormond Street Hospital, UK, said, “The levels of fatigue and muscle weakness we found at six months follow-up are concerning and requires close monitoring, but it’s difficult to determine whether this finding is caused directly by PIMS-TS or if it’s a result of the disruption in children’s lives that the Covid-19 pandemic has caused on a wider scale. Therefore, it’s crucial that we continue to monitor these conditions as social distancing relaxes and children return to school and more active routines.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/most-symptoms-of-pims-associated-with-covid-resolved-after-six-months/articleshow/82920079.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Over 100 to 150 ASHA workers in Picket, Bolarum, Bowenpally and Trimulgherry staged a protest outside the urban healthcare centres by displaying placards. The protests were also held in other parts of the state. Some of the other demands of the ASHA workers include revised monthly salary of Rs 21,000 from the current Rs 7,000 per month and free Covid-19 treatment in hospitals. Meanwhile, expressing solidarity with the protestors, a social worker, T Satish Gupta, also participated in the protests in Secunderabad Cantonment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/asha-workers-protest-over-non-payment-of-salaries/articleshow/82921875.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Jayant Chaudhary’s elevation as Rashtriya Lok Dal chief today, focus on polls||LUCKNOW: As Jayant Chaudhary is set to take over the reins of Rashtriya Lok Dal after its national executive meet on Tuesday, focus is set to shift to Jat and farmers’ politics in west UP ahead of next year’s assembly elections. Jayant will be anointed as the new RLD chief 18 days after the death of his father and RLD founder Ajit Singh on May 6 due to Covid-19. RLD national secretary and member of national executive, Anil Dubey, told TOI that election of Jayant as party’s national president is certain in the meeting to be held virtually. Political experts, however, said the 42-year-old postgraduate from the London School of Economics will face the biggest challenge of not only taking forward the legacy of his grandfather – former PM and farmer leader Chaudhary Charan Singh – but also to regain west UP’s jat votebank which had decisively shifted towards the BJP in 2014 Lok Sabha elections following 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots. Jayant himself has been facing a political crisis. He lost Mathura parliamentary seat to BJP’s actor-turned-politician Hema Malini in 2014 and then faced defeat in Baghpat, an RLD stronghold, in 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Dubey, however, said Jayant was active in farmer politics since 2004 by holding Kisan Jan Jagran Yatras in various parts of the state. “He is well-versed with the geopolitics of the state and is trained enough to take charge of the party,” he said. RLD sources said Ajit Singh always consulted Jayant before making political moves, including entering the pre-poll tie up with Samajwadi Party in 2018 byelections on Kairana Lok Sabha seat and Noorpur assembly constituency which had fallen vacant following the death of BJP MP Hukum Singh and MLA Lokendra Singh. While the decision bore fruit for RLD which managed to win Kairana, it faced a rout in 2019 when the party stitched an alliance with SP and BSP. Experts said that Jayant will face the challenge to revive the RLD which once basked in the glory of huge political stature of Charan Singh who had managed to create a votebank which went beyond religious lines to identify itself as farmer. “It was Charan Singh’s legacy which was taken forward by Ajit Singh. It is now the turn of Jayant to do the same,” a political expert said. This will, however, be put to a litmus test in the run up to 2022 assembly elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/jayants-elevation-as-rld-chief-today-focus-on-polls/articleshow/82923791.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Delhi||Covid ICU occupancy still high in Delhi, but non-ICU beds falling vacant||NEW DELHI: Occupancy of Covid ICU beds in Delhi has not declined in proportion to non-ICU beds. In the past 12 days, the number of patients admitted on Covid beds has declined to 5,226 from 12,740. There were 5,403 occupied ICU beds 12 days ago and as on May 22, there were 4,798 occupied ICU beds. While Covid cases are down, there is no significant decline in the number of critical patients. Calls on Covid helpline number 1031 have, meanwhile, declined from 450 daily to 150 daily in the past 15 days. According to Delhi government officials, the current Covid wave left many among Covid-infected patients fighting the infection for longer periods in hospitals. “We have analysed that the critical patients are taking longer time to recover in comparison to the patients who were admitted in ICU during the last Covid wave,” said an official. On May 10, the capital had 83,809 active cases out of which 5,403 patients were admitted in ICU while 12,740 were on non-ICU Covid beds. The number of patients admitted in non-ICU beds started declining from May 11, but the number of those admitted in ICU continued to increase. On May 11, the number of occupied ICU beds increased to 5,425 while the number of occupied non-ICU beds declined to 12,099. Suresh Kumar, medical director of Lok Nayak Hospital, Delhi’s largest Covid hospital, said that the strain of coronavirus that was affecting the people in the current wave—double mutant Covid variant—was more virulent. This is one of the factors behind longer stays in Covid ICU beds. “The respiratory infections are taking longer to heal and the opportunistic infections like the black fungus are affecting more people and delaying recoveries from ICU,” said Kumar. A government report stated that on May 22, Delhi had 27,610 active cases out of which 4,798 people were admitted in ICU and 5,226 in non-ICU beds. The figure is almost similar now, but 12 days ago, the number of patients admitted in non-ICU beds was more than two times higher than those admitted in ICU beds. A doctor said that towards the end of recovery from ICU, many patients do not have normal blood test results. Some of them report higher TLC (total leukocyte count) levels while some others report lower than normal TLC level. The normal range for TLC is between 4,000 and 11,000. Those reporting below 4,000 TLC suffer immunity reduction and some of them get fungus. “Some patients report higher than 20,000 TLC count and experience a combination of health problems,” said the doctor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-icu-occupancy-still-high-but-non-icu-beds-falling-vacant/articleshow/82922027.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Nagpur||482 positive 100-day low in Nagpur, city’s 246 least since Feb 9||NAGPUR: Covid cases plunged to a 100-day low of 482 in Nagpur district on Monday. Of these, 246 were recorded in city limits, 227 in rural areas and 9 from other districts. The city’s tally too was lowest in 105 days. The district had reported 455 cases on February 14 this year while Nagpur city’s previous lowest than Monday’s tally was 201 on February 9, after which the cases kept spiralling up. Though close to 5,000 less tests were performed, the district cases crashed over 50% from a day before. The district witnessed 29 deaths, including 8 from rural, 12 in city and 9 from out of district. After 2,003 recovered on Monday, 12,384 patients are under treatment now. The daily Covid cases in city have dipped to 246 after 105 days. On February 9, days before the second surge began, the city had recorded 201 cases out of total 230 reported in the district. Between February 9 and May 24, the city saw 2,20,551 cases, which comes to an average of 2,100 per day or nearly 87 cases every hour. Though testing was closed at many civic centres on Sunday, the 246 cases were reported from 13,129 tests, which is over thrice that of before the second wave. The district had been roughly testing between 3,000 and 5,000 samples a day in February. The day’s positivity rate too fell to 3.6% from 5.7% a day before. Considering 4,887 less number of tests were performed on Monday, the positivity rate still going down is a welcome sign for the district, which was one of the firsts to be engulfed in the second wave surge. Yet, the overall positivity rate of the district remains at 17% for all the samples tested positive till date. The district labs have now performed over 27 lakh RT-PCR and rapid antigen tests (RATs) since the pandemic broke out. The number of patients under treatment has come down to 12,384 while it had hit the roof one time at over 60,000. Now of the total patients under treatment, 3,142 (little over 25%) are hospitalized or in Covid Care Centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/482-ve-100-day-low-in-dist-citys-246-least-since-feb-9/articleshow/82920115.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Despite being covered for domiciliary treatment, their claim was rejected by their insurer as the ‘standard line of treatment was not followed’. The Mehtas have reached out to the insurance ombudsman and are awaiting a response. In April, T Vijaya, 61, of Hyderabad lodged a claim for Rs 19,400 for Covid-19 home treatment but received only Rs 12,000 under her family floater plan. Coronavirus: Live updatesLast year, the IRDA directed all insurers that offer domiciliary treatment under their health policies to cover Covid-19 treatment at home. The companies were also asked to offer a specialised ‘Corona Kavach’ policy to reimburse Covid treatment costs, including for home treatment. Yet, many companies are not covering home treatment of Covid-19. Since most patients have mild symptoms, a majority opt for home treatment. They are now finding their claims rejected or settled for a lesser amount. Companies have limits ranging from Rs 15,000 to Rs 20,000 for home care. For those seeking home treatment because of a shortage of oxygen hospital beds, the limits are woefully inadequate. “We have to sit with our actuaries and see if requests for higher limits is possible,” said the CMD of United India Insurance Girish Radhakrishnan, “The demand is coming from our corporate customers.” United India has a limit of Rs 15000 for home care while for a select category of policies there aren’t such limits. “Oxygen cylinder rentals are enough to wipe off the limits. Besides, teleconsultation with infectious diseases specialists or pulmonologists can cost nearly Rs 1500 per session,” said Sanjay Datta, who heads claims and underwriting at ICICI Lombard said. ICICI Lombard covers only claims for hospital-like treatment at home and excludes quarantining expenses from the policy. Star Health, which was among the first to introduce home plans, offers a kit that includes a pulse oximeter and thermometer. “We set a limit of Rs 20000 which will be enough to cover mild infections. If the infection is moderate to severe, the insured will head to the hospital,” said MD of Star Health Dr S Prakash. Delhi-based insure-tech startup, Insurance Samadhan’s co-founder Shailesh Kumar said, “Many claims under the Corona Kavach get rejected because people would have gone for the Rapid Antigen Test instead of RT-PCR test. Besides, the home treatment has to be prescribed by a medical practitioner working in a hospital… many people miss out on these details. And their claims get rejected.” General Insurance Council (GI Council), an association of general insurers, said that home care claims must be reasonable. “You can't have exorbitant bills under home care. Our estimates show that it can at best be 20% of what a hospital bill for a case without comorbidities would be,” an official at the Council told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/remove-cap-say-insured-patients-as-home-covid-19-care-cost-soars/articleshow/82921869.cms||Rajesh Chandramouli

State education minister Kanwar Pal said this on Sunday following a meeting between the Centre and representatives of states. Speaking to media after the meeting, Pal said, "Under the leadership of defence minister Rajnath Singh and Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal, a meeting was held with the state and UT education ministers, secretaries and board chairpersons, and suggestions were sought from all regarding conduction of board examinations.” The minister said that he had said that the examinations should be scheduled according to the Covid-19 situation in various states. "We want the date sheet to be released 20 days prior to the start of examination. We had earlier announced holding of Class XII exams from June 1, but problems faced after the surge in Covid-19 situation, delayed everything. We have informed the Union minister that we can start the exams between June 15 and June 20," he added. On the duration of the examination, Kanwar Pal said, "The Union ministers had asked whether the examination time should be 90 minutes or complete 3 hours. We are prepared to hold a 3-hour examination, but we want the students to be allotted examination centres in their schools so that they won’t have to encounter crowds while travelling and it will ensure implementation of social distancing as there will be fewer students at the centre." In case any student has a problem due to the Covid-19 situation, he/she can appear for the examinations later, the minister said. Kanwar Pal said he wanted all teachers and officials deputed for examination duty to be vaccinated beforehand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/hry-ready-to-start-class-xii-exams-in-third-week-of-june-min/articleshow/82928310.cms||---

A 55-year-old UP native, who was the captain of a private ship, drowned after his vessel was stuck in the cyclonic disaster. The body of Nagendra Kumar Prajapati was recovered from the sea at Valsad in Gujarat, about 200km away from the Mumbai coast. Prajapati’s ill-fated ship, Varaprada, was stuck in the Arabian Sea along with the ONGC barge P305 many of whose crew members also lost their lives in the storm. Prajapati was among the seven victims whose bodies were recovered on May 23, said superintendent of police, Valsad, RS Jhala. “Two bodies were identified — Nagendra who was captain of the tugboat Varaprada and another of a crew member,” the SP added. Reports said there were 13 persons onboard Varaprada, which sank in the Arabian sea as the devastating cyclone lashed the western coast on May 17. A native of Rae Bareli, Prajapati lived with his family in Vridavan Yojana in Lucknow. He served in the Indian Navy and later joined the merchant navy in 1998. A distraught Kusum, wife of Prajapati, told TOI that she spoke last to her husband on May 16 when he was sailing. Everything was fine and he was planning to return home soon,” she said. “On May 17, I received a call from my husband’s shipping company and they asked for my bank account number. When I asked the reason, they did not tell me. Later, some relatives of mine contacted the company and learnt that my husband was missing,” said an inconsolable Kusum. “My husband was a courageous man and a warrior all his life,” she added. Prajapati’s sister-in-law, Neetu, told TOI that on May 23 they were informed by Gujarat officials that bodies of some people, who were sailing in Varaprada, had been recovered. Prajapati’s elder brother Surendra and other family members rushed to Gujarat where they identified his body Victim’s son Gaurav lives in The Netherlands while his daughter Shalini works in Pune.

An unknown man made fake Facebook account in the name of SRPF constable Manohar Patil, posted at railway stations for security. He approached Patil’s friends and relatives over messenger posing as the constable. One of Patil’s cousins, Bhushan Pawar, fell for the fraud. “Last week, Pawar received a message via Facebook Messenger. The conman, posing as Patil, asked Pawar to lend him some money, claiming he was going through a crisis. Worried by the message, Pawar immediately called up Patil. But the constable did not answer,” said a cyber police officer. Pawar then presumed that his cousin must be in trouble and asked the conman how much money was needed. The conman asked Pawar to send Rs 15,000 via UPI and shared a bank account number. Subsequently, the conman kept demanding more money, claiming he was still facing a crisis. After six transfers amounting to Rs 1 lakh, Pawar smelled a rat and kept dialling Patil till he answered the call. Patil confirmed his fear that the Facebook account was fake and that he hadn’t received any money. Pawar then approached a local police station that sent him to the North Region Cyber Police station. The cyber police wrote to the nodal officer of the bank where the conman held an account. Within 36 hours, the account was frozen and the amount was reversed to Pawar’s account. No arrest has been made yet but police are now trying to track down the fraudster.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-imposter-dupes-srpf-constables-kin-of-rs-1l-via-fb/articleshow/82925786.cms||---

---||Pune||Traders demand power bill, property tax waiver||Pune: The city-based traders’ bodies have demanded power bills waiver for three months, besides exemption in property tax and interest on loans, citing the losses during the ongoing closure of shops. The traders said the state government should announce a financial assistance package for the traders as they had lost the income opportunities in the last two months. The traders have paid salaries to the staffers despite the challenges, but such payments were not possible in the long run, a trader said. The Federation of Trade Associations of Pune (FTAP) recently wrote a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar elaborating their concerns. In the letter, they also raised the demand to allow functioning of shops after May 31. “The shops have been closed from the first week of April. Two months have passed without any trade. The shopkeepers are facing huge losses. The entire year has been challenging for all traders. All the traders have strictly followed the guidelines and have cooperated well with the government during the pandemic. The government should now allow the shops to function as the cases have reduced. This will help avoid further losses,” Mahendra Pitaliya, the secretary of FTAP, said. Pitaliya said payment of power bills should be waived off as shops had remained closed completely. There should be a waiver in the interest of bank loans and also in the property tax imposed by the local civic bodies. “These demands are justifiable as a significant number of shopkeepers are totally dependent on the income from daily trades. These shopkeepers have not been able to handle the burden when there has been no income. They can’t afford to keep their shops shut for three months,” he added. Sachin Nivangune, the president of Pune District Retailers’ Association, said his association had been demanding that non-essential shops function for a few hours in a day. “The complete closure of shops is a harsh step. The shops can be allowed to be open for four to five hours in a day in staggered manner. The shopkeepers will then be able to conduct some trade. The government should also provide financial assistance by announcing some discount in taxes,” he said. Sanjay Mehta, who runs a shop of home appliances, said even if the shops were allowed to open, it would take another two months to regain the momentum. “The traders are going to face long-term impact,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/traders-demand-power-bill-property-tax-waiver/articleshow/82921916.cms||Sarang Dastane

The city recorded 2,528 vaccinations as compared to 1,640 a day before. NMC officials said the turnout was encouraging despite the city falling short of its daily vaccination target by 74%. The day’s target was 9,700 jabs. As per NMC data, the turnout at most vaccination in your locality centres was pretty low. At some places, it was just 10% or below it. NMC officials said the basis for claiming it to be ‘good response’ to the locality drive was the fact that not many are now due for their vaccination in the 45+ category. “Most of the 45+ population has been vaccinated in the city. Many of them have already taken it at rural centres to avoid rush and delays. But we don’t have any data on such beneficiaries. Those remaining are being approached through centres near their homes,” they said. In Nagpur division, the number of inoculations has gone down to just over 15,000. Target-wise, Chandrapur with 84% is at the top while Nagpur has the most vaccinations in the day in the region at 4,322. However, Nagpur district’s overall achievement is 23%, which is the lowest among all districts in the division.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/with-nearly-900-more-jabs-nmc-claims-improvement-in-drive/articleshow/82920134.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Hyderabad||Look for other factors contributing to mucormycosis surge: Experts||Hyderabad: City doctors treating mucormycosis patients have said steroid abuse, uncontrolled diabetes and low immunity post Covid-19 recovery may be prime reasons for spurt in black fungus cases. Reacting to a recent study that said mucormycosis was seen in 14% patients who were not on steroid use and non-diabetics, the experts have suggested more investigations be done to find out the role of excessive use of zinc supplements and antibiotic abuse. Indian Medical Association past president Rajeev Jayadevan, quoting Prof V P Pandey’s study on 210 patients in Indore, said: “Antibiotics had been used in 100% patients, steroids not used in 14%, 21% were not diabetic, 36% were at home, oxygen use only by 52%... Use of zinc supplements as a risk factor needs to be investigated. Fungi thrive in zinc-rich environment, and mammalian cells try to keep it (zinc) away from fungus to avoid infection.” “Clearly, there are factors beyond diabetes and steroid use,” he added. However, majority of ENT experts opined that diabetes and steroid use were prime contributors. Dr. Mansrut, senior ENT, head & neck surgeon, Yashoda Hospitals, said: “Prime reasons are steroid use and uncontrolled sugars in diabetics and patients who are pre-diabetic.” “Inhaling steam and use of zinc are not prime reasons. The reasons are in front of us (high sugars, steroid use and low immunity due to Covid). The treatment protocol is surgical debridement as soon as possible followed by antifungal drugs,” he added. Agreeing with this, Dr Ravi Charan Palwai, senior ENT surgeon, Medicover, says: “Excessive dry or wet heat can make mucosa dry so that can be a contributing factor for the growth of the fungus. Mucor can be present in burns patient.” Dr N Vishnu Swaropp Reddy, chief consultant ENT, Care Hospitals, said: “Uncontrolled diabetes and diabetic ketoacidosis due to corticosteroid usage in hospital are key reasons.” “Using steriods by patients in home isolation is also a reason. There is a suspicion that oxygen administration using normal water in humidifier and contaminated equipment can also lead to this. Non-availability of the antifungal drugs amphoterecin-B is a huge problem,” he added. “The state government is coordinating for the supply of medication, but the process is very slow, delayed and inadequate in the context of life-threatening condition of rhino orbito cerebral mucormycosis with high morbidity and mortality,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/look-for-other-factors-contributing-to-mucormycosis-surge-experts/articleshow/82921924.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||India||What’s ‘manipulated media’ and how does Twitter tag them?||NEW DELHI: Just as the news of Delhi Police special cell team visiting Twitter’s office broke on social media on Monday evening, the hashtag “Manipulated Media” became one of the top trends with over 17k posts. But what does the label recently slapped on a bunch of BJP politicians, notably Sambit Patra, by Twitter mean? TOI takes a look at the tag that has led to another round of standoff between Twitter and the Union government: What is manipulated media? Twitter defines any media (videos, audio, and images) that have been deceptively altered or fabricated as manipulated. Tweets are labeled under this category when they are “likely to cause harm”. Read AlsoCongress, CPM slam raids on TwitterNEW DELHI: Congress and CPM on Monday slammed the Modi government and said BJP was running “scared” that its “lies” in the toolkit case would be caught. Hours after the police raided Twitter offices, Congress said it was an attempt to “silence the truth”. “BJP’s dictatorial behaviour will not last,”How does Twitter tag content as manipulated? Twitter says it uses a mix of technology and expert human review to label content. “In order to determine if media have been significantly and deceptively altered or fabricated, we may use our own technology or receive reports through partnerships with third parties,” the company has explained in a blog.

Jayant Jaysoorya, an advocate from West Marredpally, filed the petition questioning why authorities failed to procure and store enough drugs even after declaring the black fungus infection as a notified disease under the provisions of the Epidemic Diseases Act. The director of Drugs Control Administration has asked manufacturers and retail drug sellers not to directly sell them to patients and hospitals and instead asked them to seek the same online. But there was no provision on the portal to track the status of the request, he said. A committee, headed by the director of medical education, has to approve the requests and recommend the sale to them, the petitioner added. There were 160 in-patients suffering from black fungus at Koti Government Hospital, he said. The current supply of amphotericin was very low and the state has to step up its efforts to procure more by calling for global tenders on one hand and seeking more quota from the Centre on the other, he said. “Due to the shortage of the medicine, scores of lives are in danger now,” the petitioner said, adding, “The Right to Life, guaranteed by the Constitution is violated on account of the inaction of the health authorities.” The high court might take up the hearing on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/adequate-medicines-for-black-fungus-not-procured-plea-in-hc/articleshow/82921954.cms||---

Businessmen are demanding for a relaxation of three hours to open their shops, to find some relief after suffering losses in the lockdown. President of Jaipur Vyapaar Mandal, Subhash Goyal said that they support the government in the fight against Covid but need some support from the government now. “Vegetable and grocery shops are open from 6am to 11am. Similarly, the government can allow us to open our shops for three hours between 11am and 5pm. If there is a problem with opening the entire market, then they can allow us to open some shops like clothes’ shops for certain days and bicycle shops for certain. This will provide a lot of help to us,” said Goyal. Lockdowns in 2020 and 2021 have hit the traders in the city adversely. Last year, the three months’ lockdown hit the businesses hard. After the lockdown restrictions were lifted, slowly, business started to get back on track before the second wave hit. However, giving any relief to the traders at present does not seem to be a good idea. Antar Singh Nehra, Jaipur collector said, “Positivity rate of Jaipur is still above 10, that makes it very difficult for the administration to provide any relaxations in the situation. We will think about it once the situation is under control but not anytime soon.” Some traders in the market also agree that the situation is not suitable for anyone, but they expect some support from the government. Kailash Mittal, vice-president of Johri Market Traders’ Association said, “I agree that the government cannot give us any relaxations but they can provide support to us in other forms .”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/traders-plead-for-relaxation-to-make-up-for-losses/articleshow/82921962.cms||---

This can be gauged from the fact that even demand for an ‘illegal’ battery-operated autorickshaw has skyrocketed in the city, especially in north, east and central Nagpur. E-rickshaws without number plate can be seen plying in many areas, including Sugat Nagar, Pardi, Itwari, Gandhibagh and Mahal areas. According to data from the regional transport office (RTO), the city saw 104 battery-operated vehicles being registered in the last financial year. The demand for both battery-operated two-wheelers and e-rickshaws has been rising. As many as 31 e-rickshaws, followed by 30 two-wheelers and 26 cars were registered in 2020-21, the data revealed. As with other vehicles, the coronavirus-induced lockdown also affected sale of electric vehicles. In 2019-20, the city had recorded registration of 586 battery-operated vehicles -- mostly two-wheelers and autorickshaws. Of the city’s 18.21 lakh vehicles, battery-operated vehicles share is about .04%. According to the data, the city has 894 battery-operated vehicles of all categories. That is a small number but one that industry watchers feel will grow as newer and better models are launched and charging infrastructure develops. Amit Wanjre, a resident of Godhani, said he had purchased an e-two-wheeler three months ago and saved at least Rs6,000, which he would have otherwise spent on petrol. Wanjre, a bank employee, used to spend Rs2,000 per month on fuel and now his savings have increased with the switchover to eco-friendly vehicle. Likewise, Prathmesh Kulkarni, a businessman, had purchased a battery-operated two-wheeler for his college-going daughter. “Money spent for fuel consumption has come down and I feel relaxed as the vehicle’s speed is not so high,” Kulkarni said and advocated the use of e-vehicles for all children above 16 years of age. “A single charge of the vehicle gives up to 100km range, and consumes only 1.2 units of electricity. It also helps reduce pollution,” he said. A common grouse of e-vehicle owners is that there are insufficient charging points in the city. According to dealers, this too would soon change “once more people start buying electric vehicles, charging stations will automatically crop up just like petrol pumps”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/as-petrol-price-soars-electric-vehicles-gain-ground/articleshow/82922023.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The state’s case positivity continued to be as high as 35% on Monday. The state’s mortality count shot to 2,422 with 38 casualties reported over the last 24 hours. Of these, 25 patients died at the Goa Medical College (GMC), eight at the South Goa district hospital (SGDH), four at three different private hospitals. One casualty was a 63-year-old man from Curtorim who was brought dead to the local primary health centre. The man had tested positive last week and was in home isolation. The youngest was a 34-year-old woman from Parcem in North Goa who died at GMC after four days of treatment. The woman had tested positive just two days before hospitalisation and her comorbidity was hypertension. Two men, a 48-year-old from Usgao and a 41-year-old whose place of residence was not mentioned in the bulletin, and two women, a 59-year-old from Ribandar and a 51-year-old from Aquem, succumbed to the virus within few hours of hospitalisation. Three of them were in home isolation for a few days before they were rushed to the hospital in critical condition, indicating that their home isolation was not monitored. Health officials have admitted that with the increase in the caseload earlier this month, it had become difficult to maintain a check on home isolated patients. Meanwhile, the state has started preparing for the third Covid wave anticipating that a greater percentage of the paediatric population is likely to be affected. “We have decided to prepare for the worst-case scenario. All severe cases will be managed at GMC, while mild and moderate cases will be handled at district hospitals,” GMC’s head of paediatrics Dr Maria Silveira said. Two intensive care units of 30 beds each have been identified in the super-speciality block for paediatric patients. Manpower requirements have also been estimated and provisions are being made to counsel parents. “Parents get upset when children fall sick, so we’ll have counsellors to help them,” Silveira said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/monday-sees-38-deaths-1-4k-new-cases-35-positivity/articleshow/82923912.cms||---

The tribunal bench comprising Justices Madan B Gosavi and Binod Kumar Sinha passed this order after hearing the petition filed by the liquidator pertaining to BS Ltd. The liquidator marked IFCI, State Bank of India, Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, IDBI Bank, Syndicate Bank, United Bank of India, Bank of Maharashtra and Lakshmi Vilas Bank as respondents. Stating that the available material is suggesting that these bankers were in cahoots with the old management of the company, the liquidator sought the help of the tribunal to obtain proper answers from the banks. The bench, however, felt that they are all bank officers who were not benefited by the fraud committed by the previous management and said that they cannot be questioned now. “The liquidator has no jurisdiction to conduct such inquiries,” the tribunal bench said. The banks had a total dues of Rs 2,042 crore at the time of commencement of corporate insolvency resolution process. The liquidator wanted the tribunal to bring the banks on board to see how and when they granted the loan, the basis for the same, etc. He had even cited section 66 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, stating that this provision would enable the authorities to do so.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/nclt-junks-liquidator-plea-to-make-banks-respondents/articleshow/82922004.cms||---

Uttam visited a Covid-19 ward in the government general hospital in Suryapet district on Monday. Later, he told reporters that the state government has reduced the number of Covid-19 tests and that it is crucial to test as many people as possible to check the spread of Covid-19. The government should provide RT-PCR kits and other equipment to all the primary healthcare centres in rural areas and test maximum number of people for Covid-19 and provide them treatment, he said. Uttam said that that he would extend all help for development of the government general hospital and stressed the need for the hospital to be upgraded into a 950-bed hospital from the present 300-bed capacity. “The government should start post-graduate courses too in the government medical college,” he said. Uttam said he has already submitted a representation to the district collector to provide CT scan facility and ICU with ventilators in area hospital of Huzurnagar, and dialysis and oxygen pipeline should be set up in the community health centre at Kodad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/crucial-to-test-max-number-of-people-uttam/articleshow/82921991.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Pfizer, Moderna won’t sell vax to us: Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal||NEW DELHI: Vaccination of people aged between 18-44 and those above 45 years, frontline workers and healthcare personnel awaiting the second dose has been completely halted because Delhi government doesn’t have any Covaxin left with it. Voicing concerns over the vaccine crunch that has left thousands in the lurch, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said many centres had been closed. He added that he had already apprised the Centre of the shortage. “Pfizer and Moderna, which Delhi government had approached, have refused to sell vaccines directly to states as they prefer to deal directly with the central government. I have appealed to the Centre to import vaccines and distribute them to the states,” said the CM. Blaming the Centre for the shortage, deputy CM Manish Sisodia claimed that vaccination had become a joke. “The Centre is fully responsible for this dearth of vaccines being faced by the nation currently. It has failed to manage the situation. When Delhi government raised the demand for vaccines, the Centre provided only 4 lakh doses and asked us to float a global tender. We reached out to Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson, but the first two firms said they were speaking exclusively with the Centre and wouldn’t distribute vaccines to state governments,” he added. After visiting an oxygen depot at Mayapuri on Monday, Kejriwal said, “It is my earnest request to the Centre not to waste any more time in procuring foreign vaccines. The country has already lost a lot of time. There are a lot of vaccines in the international market, including Johnson & Johnson, Moderna and Pfizer. The Centre should talk to them and import and distribute vaccines among the states. If the central government invites these companies, deals can be made within 3-4 days. Why is the work not being done with urgency?” Sharing Delhi’s vaccine stock position, AAP functionary Atishi said for those aged above 45 and healthcare/frontline workers, the Covaxin’s stock would end by Monday, while Covishield’s stock remained for 14 days. “We received 1.5 lakh doses of Covishield for the 45+ segment today,” she added. “It is a matter of great concern as those given the first dose of Covaxin a month ago are due to get their second jab soon. If the second shot is not given, it can pose a serious problem and the first dose may get wasted. It is a humble appeal to the Centre to make sufficient doses of Covaxin available for Delhi at the earliest. The vaccine’s efficacy remains only when the second dose is given on time,” said Atishi. Drawing the attention of the Centre towards the threat Covid-19 poses to youths, Atishi said those who received both doses developed only mild infections. “We received 8,17,690 doses for this segment in May. The commitment for next month by the Centre is half of that, which is 4,01,000,” she added. Sisodia said the UK had cleared Pfizer. In fact, 85 nations had given Pfizer the green light, but the Centre had not cleared them. “Apart from India, Moderna has been distributed in 46 nations and Johnson & Johnson in 41 countries. The Centre needs to understand the gravity of the situation and immediately procure vaccines from global companies. It’s time to rise above petty politics and think about the safety of our citizens,” he added. AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj alleged that the Centre had approved only two vaccine companies and ensured immoral profiteering to them. “Delhi government doesn’t have vaccines to administer, but if you call private hospitals, they will give you the shot for Rs 1,200-1,400. The vaccine is being given at Rs 150 to the central government. This means a profit of Rs 1,000 is being made by private players,” he claimed. Kejriwal said Covaxin manufacturer Bharat Biotech was willing to share its formula and 16 companies could make the vaccine. “However, Bharat Biotech has struck a deal with only two companies. The Centre should invite these 16 companies and formally order them to start production within the next few days,” added the CM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pfizer-moderna-wont-sell-vax-to-us-cm/articleshow/82922018.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Banswara administration arranges home delivery of mangoes||JAIPUR: Mango growers of Banswara district, which is known as the hub of the king of fruits in the state, are facing difficulties in selling their produce because of the lockdown. At the same time, mango lovers aren’t getting their favourite varieties in the market due to supply bottlenecks. In order to address this twin problem, the district administration has adopted a unique digital initiative for online delivery of mangoes to ensure that residents are not deprived of mangoes in the peak season without violating lockdown guidelines. This service will be available in Banswara city and 5 km from the city limits. District collector Ankit Kumar Singh said they are organising a ‘virtual mango festival’ this time and people could order mangoes online. The administration has deputed a special team to provide door-to-door home delivery of mangoes and has formed a special digital showroom where orders could be placed by consumers. Singh said the initiative would not only help in maintaining lockdown guidelines and preventing gathering of crowd at markets, the move will ensure that the produce of farmers is not lost due to Covid curfew. Also, farmers who were worried for the untimely fall of mangoes from the trees due to cyclone Tauktae shall not incur much losses, he said. Not only ripe mangoes, but the raw ones are also in demand for making pickles for use during winter, he added. Singh formed two committees — district tourism upgradation committee and cooperative consumer stores, Banswara, — for arranging home delivery of mangoes. The cooperative consumer stores will act as an online digital showroom where any person can order a minimum of 5kg of mangoes. Also, passes have been issued to three wheelers and bikes too to arrange for quick deliveries. The district tourism upgradation committee will accept orders on WhatsApp. Also, a digital poster has been made with a QR code of the online store where people could place the orders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/banswara-district-admn-arranges-home-delivery-of-mangoes-during-lockdown/articleshow/82922000.cms||Joychen Joseph

The virtual help desk will function as a one-stop center for all Covid-19 care and relief services during the ongoing pandemic. SETU will work for achieving six major objectives. “First is medical service in which we will maintain list of hospitals, medicines, injections, oxygen, oxi-meters, oxygen concentrators, lab and blood and provide this information to the needy as and when required,” said faculty dean professor Bhavna Mehta. “Second is counselling services for Covid-19 patient, their family members, medical staff and other corona warriors. Third is inquiry and referral services in which we will provide information about tiffin services, government schemes, ambulance, follow-up services, vaccination centers, guidance for orphans or single-parent children,” she said. Through online intervention with children, the fourth feature, the faculty members will interact with children, play games, conduct inspirational and informational sessions through virtual mode. SETU will also mobilize resources, raise funds, prepare list of donors, beneficiaries and collect medicines among others. “Sixth is transportation services in which we will provide transportation services to MSU staff,” said Mehta, adding that the aim of the project is to bridge the gap between resources and affected people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/msus-virtual-ncov-help-desk-launched/articleshow/82918511.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Covid-19: Several cities in Rajasthan report cases among children in second wave||JAIPUR: The health department office in Sikar has admitted that 9% of the total 19,747 Covid cases it recorded since April were of children up to 18 years of age. The claim has indicated that children were infected in greater numbers in the second wave. Several other districts have also recorded cases in a similar pattern, but have not tabulated data in age-wise format. Ajay Choudhary, CMHO Sikar, refuted the claim that the third wave is exclusively for children. “The data clearly shows that out of 19k cases, 1,757 were children up to 18 years of age. It proves that second wave has not granted any immunity cover to children,” said Choudhary. Highlighting the important aspect of the report, he said that 99% of these cases don’t need hospitalisation. “Fortunately, I have not reported a single death in the district in this age group. Almost all of them recovered at home, except a few who were admitted to the hospital,” said Choudhary. Udaipur district has not compiled any data related to children, but the hospitalization of Covid patients indicates the same trend as in Sikar. Principal Medical Officer, Hiran Magri government hospital in Udaipur J P Badgurjar said in the second wave his hospital admitted 610 Covid patients. “Of the total, 5 patients were in the age bracket of 0-18,” said Badgurjar, who agreed that a majority of the children have recovered at home. Known for its Covid management, the Bhilwara administration, too, agreed that children were infected in the first and second wave in equal numbers. “The age-wise data is not available, but I can say that children have their share in the total infections. None of the children found infected have had severe symptoms to the best of my knowledge,” said Mushtaq Khan CMHO Bhilwara. He argued that the pattern in the cases doesn’t say that the third wave is exclusively for children. “Anyone who is not immune is vulnerable to the infection,” said Khan, who claimed to have sufficient facilities for children. The divisional headquarters, Ajmer’s CMHO K K Soni also denied knowing the exact figures on the number of infected children in the second wave. “The calculation has not been done so far, but the number of children infected in the second wave is similar to that of the first wave,” said Soni.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/several-cities-report-cases-among-kids-in-second-wave/articleshow/82921986.cms||---
---||Kochi||Ernakulam: Health institutions record over 700 deaths in 2 weeks||KOCHI: Ernakulam has reported a steep hike in Covid deaths in the past two weeks. More than 700 persons succumbed to the infection in two weeks, shows the situation analysis report of Sunday. These are the deaths reported from various health institutions. This is more than double the number of Covid deaths reported in the first 10 days of May, when around 282 deaths were reported. However, only 146 deaths were declared as Covid deaths by the government in the past two weeks in the district. The government used to declare less than 10 Covid deaths till a few days ago when health institutions were reporting more than 40 deaths daily. Now the government has started declaring more than 10 deaths daily. In view of the number of active cases and patients getting admitted in hospitals, authorities expect 500-750 more Covid deaths in the next two weeks also. In order to bring down the number of deaths, they reiterate early detection and initiation of treatment. “Though daily positive cases have started to decline, we have to continue with the strict lockdown measures. However, the worrying factor is that healthcare workers (HCWs) continue to get infected with Covid. As many as 506 HCWs contracted the virus in the past two weeks in Ernakulam. When a HCW becomes Covid positive, he or she will have to stay away from duty for 17 days. This puts huge burden on the health infrastructure,” said a district health official. The report further shows that almost all variants of coronavirus reported in other parts of India, are present in Ernakulam also. Of these, more than 25% cent is B.1.617.2 variant. Four other variants, including P.1 variant, which is responsible for deadly surge of Covid cases in Latin America, are also present in the district. The presence of these variants is a cause of concern among health fraternity. “Hence the spread should be contained to the maximum possible extent, as early as possible so that the virus is prevented from undergoing more genetic modification,” says the report. The report also recommends to increase testing in local bodies with test positivity rate (TPR) above 20%. With mucormycosis infection getting reported among recovered patients in the district, health authorities expect more such cases in the coming weeks. The report suggests giving training to medical officers to identify mucormycosis in early stage itself. It also cautions authorities to be prepared for next wave and calls for giving training to medical officers to manage paediatric cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/health-institutions-record-over-700-deaths-in-2-weeks/articleshow/82920293.cms||T C Sreemol
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Lokmangal Foundation delivered oxygen to 140 when it was hard to get||NAGPUR: After seeing corona patients struggling to get beds, medicines and oxygen during the second wave, four social workers came together to help. As they could not do much about beds and medicines, they decided to provide oxygen cylinders to the distressed patients at their homes. So far, their group Lokmangal Foundation has provided oxygen cylinders to over 140 patients, sometimes even after midnight after receiving calls. They started with nine cylinders and now have over 150. After coming to know about their noble initiative, a United Arab Emirates-based community group 'Triveni' dispatched 100 empty cylinders to them. They reached city yesterday from Mumbai. Union minister Nitin Gadkari, while lauding their initiative, handed over the cylinders to them for distribution among patients. Shripad Borikar, popularly known as Chhotu Bhaiyya, and his team have hired a vehicle for ferrying the cylinders which they procure from refilling plants and deliver them to the homes of needy patients. “We didn’t stop at this. We also help patients instal those cylinders with the oxygen flowmeters, when hardly anyone dares to go near the patients due to risk of infection. We took all the precautions by wearing PPE kits while going to patients’ home. We decided to take the plunge rather than sit at home in the lockdown. We saw even relatives and neighbours of patients were reluctant to help due to fear of contracting the virus,” Amit Khot, one of the members, told TOI. Their initiative started after Borikar received a distress call from a friend that a particular hospital was running short of oxygen and patients there may die if oxygen didn’t reach immediately. The members, also including Sachin Ingole and Vinod Mude, swung into action and arranged cylinders from refilling plant. “We tried to help the patients in all possible ways. Even providing them medicine and other essentials, as they can’t move out. We also came across and helped people in urgent need of oxygen but couldn't get a bed in hospital. We received a lot of blessings from everyone and we are very happy to have helped so many. One thing we realised during this pandemic is that oxygen and time are two very important things in life,” Borikar said. Mude and Ingole said they were receiving calls from not only the city, but also from places like Kamptee, Kalmeshwar, and Ramtek. “We feel very proud to have helped people there as well. It is very satisfactory experience,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/lokmangal-foundation-delivered-o2-to-140-when-it-was-hard-to-get/articleshow/82920268.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Nagpur||Don’t ignore your child’s gastrointestinal problems, as it may be Covid, say experts||NAGPUR: Specialists feel that extended gastrointestinal complications in a child should not be dealt with self-medications at home but brought to the notice of paediatricians at the earliest at such symptoms could be fallout of Covid infection. With the projected third wave post-monsoon feared to involve paediatric population in larger numbers, experts have advised parents to remain watchful about symptoms like abdominal pain, vomiting, loose motion, appetite loss and so with or without low-grade fever in the coming days and seek advise of a specialist at the earliest. If there is a Covid patient at home, the child’s ill-health should be looked into more intensely. While Dr Yogesh Waikar, paediatric gastroenterologist and hepatologist, said that around 10-15% children with Covid-19 may manifest gastro-related symptoms ahead of respiratory issues, Dr Pravin Khapekar, also a member of the Paediatric Task Force, emphasized the prevelance was as high as 20%-30%. Dr Waikar, referring to the extrapolated data from western countries, said there may be inflammation of the small intestine and rarely aggravation of the appendix too, apart from regular gastro-related problems in children. “Precaution is also required if the release of the liver enzyme is more. In such cases, the child may also need an ICU treatment,” he said. Dr Waikar, while urging the central government to speed up the process of vaccination, said that during the ‘nautapa’ phase of summer (May end to June first week), there is more possibility of diarrhoea. He also reiterated the need to wearing mask properly, sanitization and maintaining physical distancing. Dr Khapekar said the ACE-2 receptor, through which the novel coronavirus enters the cell, is present in the intestine, especially the small intestine. “Diarrhoea is the common symptom followed by others like pain in abdomen and vomiting. Unfortunately, we do not have RTPCR facility for testing stool. The chances of infection through faecal-oral route is high too as the patient may pass the virus through stool for a long time,” he said and added, “Some patients may also experience appendicitis pain.” Well-known paediatrician Dr Vinky Rughwani said he has seen a sizeable number of children with gastro-related problems in the second Covid wave. “The gastrointestinal problem is more common in Covid-affected paediatric patients than in the adults. In the summers, virus induced gastrointestinal issue is common. We suspect Covid, especially if there is a positive member at home. If there is no positive member at home, then we wait and watch for two days to check whether there is runny nose or fever in addition to the gastrointestinal issues before advising RT-PCR test,” said Dr Rughwani. He advised children to avoid outside food, cold drinks and going out in the sun. Having witnessed several Covid patients with symptoms of loose motion with low-grade fever, well-known gastroenterologist Dr Samir Patil said it can replicate in the children. “In adults or children, self-medication, use of non-indicated medicines or alternatives and such habits including popping up antibiotics, especially with less water, can lead to gastro bouts among other complications,” he said. “Children need to avoid outside food, uncooked food, junk food and drink only chlorinated or UV treated water. Parents should immediately get vaccinated and so does every person visiting the house and even staffers in schools whenever they re-open,” said Dr Patil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/dont-ignore-your-childs-gastro-problems-it-may-be-covid-experts/articleshow/82920284.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Hyderabad||City mosque opens its doors to Covid patients||Hyderabad: A mosque in city on Monday threw open its doors for a 40-bed isolation and care centre. This is the first time in Telugu states that a mosque is doubling up as a Covid-19 care centre with oxygen facility. All medical services for Covid-19 patients are free. The centre is open to all irrespective of faith, caste or creed. At least three NGOs joined hands to provide medical infrastructure in the mosque, Masjid-e-Muhammadi, at Rajendranagar to convert it into a full-fledged Covid-19 centre for asymptomatic, mild and moderate cases. Rotary Club International, the US-based Support for Educational and Economic Development (SEED) and Helping Hand Foundation (HHF) are sponsoring the Covid-19 centre, which has 50 medical, paramedical and supporting staff working round-the-clock in three shifts. Internal medicine expert and senior cardiologist Dr P Shafi is supervising the Covid-19 centre. Dr Shafi has thus far treated over 5,000 Covid-19 patients since the pandemic broke out last year. Mujtaba Hasan Askari, managing trustee of HHF, which will run the centre, said they have round-the-lock ambulances to pick up patients from their doorstep and also shift patients to any government or private hospital in case of an emergency. “With a strong network with all government Covid-19 hospitals, we will also facilitate admissions,” he said. The Covid-19 centre is equipped with oxygen beds, medical infra and a triaging system for first line Covid-19 treatment. There are separate rooms for pharmacy, doctors, triaging and casualty. There are separate toilets for men and women patients. The mosque’s two-storey building is now serving as the Covid-19 centre. Rotary Club will provide oxygen. SEED executive director Syed Mazhar Hussaini said the centre is a boon for patients who cannot afford huge medical expenses. NV Hanumantha Reddy, director general, Rotary Club of Hyderabad Deccan, VVSN Raju, president, Rotary Club of Hyderabad Deccan, and Sharath Choudhary, member of Rotary trust, participated in the inaugural on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-mosque-opens-its-doors-to-covid-patients/articleshow/82922009.cms||Syed Akbar
---||Hyderabad||T citizens will be covered under Ayushman Bharat||Hyderabad: The National Health Authority (NHA) has inked a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the government of Telangana to implement Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB PM-JAY) in the state, it said on Monday. The Ayushman Bharat scheme has been recently integrated with the state’s existing health insurance scheme, Aarogyasri, and this new scheme will be called Ayushman Bharat PM-JAY Aarogyasri. Ayushman Bharat is the flagship scheme of the Union government, that was launched as recommended by the National Health Policy 2017, to achieve the vision of Universal Health Coverage (UHC). It has two components — Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs) and Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY). PM-JAY is the insurance component of the scheme that provides a health cover of Rs 5 lakh per family per year. With the merger of the Centre and state government health insurance schemes, the beneficiaries will be entitled to avail free healthcare coverage of up to Rs 5 lakh per family per year for secondary and tertiary care hospitalisation in any of the 22,000 empanelled public and private hospitals across the country through the scheme’s portability feature. Around 26 lakhs families constituting around 1.3 crore individuals will be eligible to avail services as part of this insurance scheme in Telangana. Commenting on the launch, RS Sharma, CEO, NHA, said, “This is not only going to benefit the eligible families in the state but will also enable the delivery of healthcare services to PM-JAY beneficiaries from other states and Union territories (UT) living in Telangana.” With the launch of Ayushman Bharat PM-JAY in Telangana, the scheme has been further expanded and now encompasses 33 states and UTs, NHA said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-citizens-will-be-covered-under-ayushman-bharat/articleshow/82922014.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Timings to keep shops open likely to be extended||MUMBAI: With a dip in cases, the state government is likely to give relaxation in shop timings and may also allow shops dealing in non-essential items to remain open for limited timings. The government is working on a plan to allow re-opening of services and sectors from June 1 in a staggered manner. Officials said that the relief may not be extended to all districts. It is likely to consider certain factors like increase in cases, burden on health infrastructure and case positivity rate. “There are over 20 districts in the state which have a case positivity rate of over 10% and, according to norms, relaxations in these districts cannot be allowed,” said an official. “However, a decision will be taken in consultation with the task force by the end of the week.” The official added that there may not be too many changes as the government wants to ‘wait and watch’ for another fortnight. However, timings for shops may be extended for a few hours. Currently, all shops selling goods classified as ‘essential’ can remain open from 7am to 11am. The state government is also likely to increase attendance in government offices. Currently only 15% employees are allowed in public offices. Relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar said that the state government had been considering relaxing certain restrictions, but restrictions to allow commuters on local trains and for inter-district travel will continue for some more time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-timings-to-keep-shops-open-likely-to-be-extended/articleshow/82922588.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Covid-19: Hit by job loss & pandemic, sport coaches sell tea, samosa for living in Uttar Pradesh||LUCKNOW: What do samosa-seller Mahendra Pratap Singh, tea stall owner Mohammad Nasim Qureshi, cab driver Shanish Mani Mishra and labourer Sanjeev Kumar Gupta have in common? All of them had been shaping the future of budding sports persons as their coach till 2019-end when suddenly they were rendered jobless following a sports department decision to do away with the contract system and hire coaches through outsourcing agencies. The pandemic added to their woes. The department asked the contractual coaches to appear for trials after applying afresh for the job through outsourcing and assured them that they would get preference in selection. However, at least 377 coaches who were affected by the decision demanded that they should be reinstated and remaining vacancies should be filled through outsourcing. The coaches moved the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court seeking stay on hiring through outsourcing and financial support from the government till the matter is resolved. The case is still pending with the court. The outbreak of coronavirus pandemic in March last year forced them to take up menial jobs to make their ends meet. “I gave my entire life grooming young archers who went on to make their mark nationally and internationally. Now, how will I motivate young talent when I am myself frying samosas in my small shop,” wonders archery coach Mahendra Pratap Singh, who sells samosas, fritters and snacks in Nawabganj area of Barabanki. “What wrong did I do in taking up sports as a career? Had I joined a private job or opened a paan shop, I would have been in a better condition,” he rues. Singh obtained a diploma in archery from National Institute of Sports (NIS), Kolkata, and has 18 years of experience as an archery coach in UP sports directorate and the Indian Military Academy. His family comprises his wife, two children and an elder brother, who is mentally ill. Mohammad Nasim Qureshi, 58, who lives in Khandsari Bazar in Lucknow, has trained many national-level boxers in his 32-year-long career as a contractual coach. Out of job, he decided to start a tea stall. “I decided to sell tea to make a living but my students expressed displeasure and offered financial support. But one cannot help all the time. As they did not allow me to sell tea, I am currently unemployed and looking for options,” he says. Similarly, Shanish Mani Mishra, a national level soft tennis player, a Laxman award winner and a coach who has produced many national players, is working as a cab driver in Gonda district to support his family. Sanjeev Kumar Gupta of Neelamatha Bazaar, Lucknow, an expert fencer, a five-time medallist and a diploma-holder in fencing from NIS Patiala, worked as a coach for seven years at the Indian Military Academy. To support his family, Sanjeev is currently working as a labourer. However, his love for the sport remains unwavering. His 11-year-old daughter is a national gold medallist in fencing. Vikas Yadav of Lucknow, an international level taekwondo player, national medallist and coach, is currently unemployed. He got his diploma in taekwondo from NIS, Bangalore. “My father is 75 and my family is surviving on his pension. I had to even withdraw my child from school as I did not have money to pay the fee. We tried to meet sports authorities, ministers and even the Chief Minister but to no avail,” says Vikas, who is also the secretary of the association of diploma-holder coaches. ‘Former coaches should apply as per new arrangement’: Sports director RP Singh said the decision to hire staff on outsourcing was implemented across all government departments and the contractual coaches should apply through the designated portal for selection through outsourcing agencies. “We will give preference to contractual staff. Their compensation too will not be a penny less than the amount they used to get earlier,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/hit-by-job-loss-pandemic-sport-coaches-sell-tea-samosa-for-living/articleshow/82923997.cms||Fazal Khan

Addressing a press conference on Monday, the farmer’s body head said despite the Covid-19 pandemic, the state government had set up procurement centres and was purchasing paddy from the farmers.  “BJP leaders are making false allegations that the TRS government has failed to resolve the farmers issues and procure Paddy. Does any BJP ruling states have such farmers welfare schemes like Rythu Bandhu?” Rajeshwar Reddy asked. He said the government was constructing major irrigation projects to increase cultivable land in the state. Over 1.45 crore acres cultivated in the Rabi season, which is unprecedented in the country, the president of the farmers body said. The BJP should use their good offices and get national status for Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigaiton Project, he added. Reddy also dismissed allegations by BJP leaders that the government had failed in providing medical facilities for Covid-19 patients. “Our CM has provided all required medical infrastructure for Covid-19 patients, such as increasing beds—both ICU and oxygen beds—ventilators and ensured more oxygen supply to the state. He even visited the hospitals to take stock of the situation,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/only-t-taking-care-of-farmers-during-covid-claims-palla/articleshow/82922038.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kochi||Kerala’s second biomedical waste treatment facility at Ernakulam||KOCHI: Yet another common biomedical waste treatment facility (CBWTF) has become operational in the state from Monday. The new facility under the Kerala Enviro Infrastructure Ltd (KEIL) has been set up at Ambalamedu in Ernakulam with a capacity of treating 16 tonnes of biomedical waste per day. The facility started treating waste from government healthcare centres in the district. “The state government has issued directives to collect and treat waste from government hospitals in Ernakulam, Pathanamthitta and Malappuram districts,” said KEIL chief executive officer N K Pillai. KEIL has written to various hospitals and healthcare establishments informing them about the facility. “We are also in discussions with Clean Kerala Company and local body institutions for tie-ups to treat biomedical and hazardous wastes,” Pillai said. At present, IMA’s IMAGE, a common biomedical waste treatment facility in Palakkad, is the only one in the state which has been exclusively handling all the biomedical wastes. In view of the pande,ic situation, IMAGE had stretched its capacity and added new equipment to treat the entire waste coming from Covid care centres. IMAGE has 16,922 government and private healthcare establishments as its clientele. According to the central pollution control board rules, if there’s a CBWTF in a 75km radius, hospital and medical wastes should be treated there. KEIL is a special purpose vehicle set up by the Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation Ltd (KSIDC) with participation of 85 industries for management of hazardous waste in the state. M/s United Phosphorus Ltd (now UPL Ltd) and its group companies with a contribution of Rs 6.51 crore, has the majority equity in the company. The company is functioning on the 50 acres purchased in the name of Govt of Kerala from FACT-Cochin Division, and leased to KEIL for 50 years. The company disposes hazardous waste generated in various industries in Kerala in engineered landfills.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/states-2nd-biomed-waste-treatment-facility-at-ekm/articleshow/82920337.cms||Sudha Nambudiri
---||Delhi||Delhi: People in a fix with no second Covaxin shot in sight||NEW DELHI: When the family members of advocate Harish Kumar Kateja (65), a resident of Lajpat Nagar, took the first jab of Covaxin in the first week of May, they were happy and relieved. However, the news of vaccines running out of stock has made the family anxious and they are unsure if they will be able to take the second jab on time. “My 61-year-old wife Pushpa, 33-year-old son Nikhil and I got the first dose of the vaccine in the first week of May. Unlike Covishield, the gap between two doses of four weeks remains unchanged for Covaxin. After reading news for the past 2-3 days mentioning shortage of Covaxin, we have been making numerous attempts to book the slot for the second jab. However, the slot after June 1 is not reflecting on the website,” said Kateja. Deputy CM Manish Sisodia on Monday announced that all vaccine sites of the 18-44 age group and centres administering Covaxin to 45+ had been closed. People who are due for the second dose are worried and clueless. “With the vaccination centres closed, we are disturbed. We don’t know what to do and where to get the vaccine,” said Pushpa. A few residents of Dwarka don’t know whether to believe the government or the local authorities. Shivani Bhattacharya, a local resident, said, “My husband, his 77-year-old father and I are due for the second dose on May 26. While the government says there is no stock of Covaxin, a message came on the housing society group that a walk-in facility would start on Thursday for the second dose. We have been told that it would be on a first-come first-serve basis. I don’t know how this is possible.” A worried Rakesh (name changed) said that there was no surety whether they would be able to take the second shot on time. “We are scared as to what will happen if we fail to get fully vaccinated on time. There is no clarity on how our body will react if there is a delay in taking the second jab. Even if the government manages to add more stock of the vaccine in the next few days, it will become difficult to find a slot as there will be a huge rush. Most people will try to take the shot as soon as possible due to the shortage,” he added. Sunny Sehgal (34) and his wife Jyoti (33), who live in west Delhi and took the first shot of Covaxin on May 3, are due for the second dose between June 5 and 15. “We are not feeling safe due to the unavailability of stock. We have no idea if we will be able to take the second dose on time,” said Sunny. “According to reports, the immunity level after the first shot of Covaxin is not as high and it is recommended that the second dose should be taken within four weeks to ensure full efficacy. It is a matter of concern if we do not get the second dose on time,” added Sunny. Anasuya Gupta (48), who took the first shot of Covaxin on May 17, said, “Even in Gurgaon, most centres have Covishield and not Covaxin.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/people-in-a-fix-with-no-second-covaxin-shot-in-sight/articleshow/82922059.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Pune||Pune: Hit by Covid pandemic, 20% of restaurants may never reopen||PUNE: A cloud kitchen that came up in the Kausarbaug area when the lockdown was relaxed in the city in October last year took only three months to function as a full-fledged restaurant. Barely four months since January, the restaurant is up for sale. “We had taken a risk and invested Rs 13 lakh on the restaurant. But the second wave and restrictions have completely shattered the business. We don’t have a choice but to sell or rent it out. Though the administration has allowed delivery of food at customers’ doorstep, we are just not making enough money to pay our staff,” one of the partners told TOI requesting anonymity. Around 20% of restaurants and cafeterias, both big and small, in the city are not expected to open the shutters again because of the restrictions in place since April, the Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers Association stated. Association president Ganesh Shetty told TOI that of the around 3,400 restaurants and cafeterias in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits and 400 in Pimpri Chinchwad, only 5% could pull off home deliveries. “We want two things — to allow proper take-away and parcel services on all days, including weekends, and allow the restaurants to open up at their 50% capacity from June. Around 700 eateries in Pune city and around 100 in the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation limits are not expected to open again ever because of the restrictions in place since April 3. Also alarming is that just 5% of the eateries are into proper home deliveries, while the rest are not able to carry it out,” Shetty said. A majority of eatery owners said they were not earning any profits despite the home deliveries. “Not too many people are ordering food and our earning is going towards maintaining infrastructure and paying LPG and electricity bills and staffers’ salaries. Profit is zero at this point of time,” a café owner, whose outlet is near the Sadhu Vasvani Chowk, told TOI. The manager of a Kondhwa-based restaurant specializing in South Indian food said people were not coming in for takeaways. “Around 95% of the business is now only through food delivery applications. People need a proper reason to be out on the streets after 11am. Police are stopping them everywhere. On Saturday and Sundays, business shrinks even more. We are keeping our fingers crossed for some relaxation in the restrictions from June,” he said. In 2020, Shetty said, around 10% of eateries had shut down permanently. “Of the 4,500 eateries, 10% did not open up after the lockdown last year. Some more continued shutting down operations even during relaxations. Another major concern is many of the restaurant staffers left for their hometowns because of the restrictions in the past three months,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hit-by-covid-pandemic-20-of-restos-may-never-reopen/articleshow/82922054.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Will cos cover post mucor surgeries? Opinions differ||NAGPUR: As mucormycocis is also leading to surgeries for removing facial bones or eyes to save patients’ lives, there are questions whether plastic surgeries that may follow, for treating the disfigurement, would be covered by health insurers. The surgeries are expensive with the bills running into Rs 5 to Rs 6 lakh in some cases, said doctors. In the normal course, insurance companies do not pay for plastic surgeries as these are considered cosmetic treatment and not necessary to save a patient’s life or maintain functionality of a body part. The reconstructive surgeries would follow at least three months after the primary procedure due to mucormycosis. With the surge in mucormycosis cases is nearly a month old yet, patients are yet to face the question of insurance claim. As TOI talked to insurance companies and associated professionals, there was a mixed response. In what may be good news of the mucor patients, professional related to some of the private companies said the expenses would be covered. Manoj Aya from M/s GNTL Financial Services, an insurance consultancy, said it was confirmed by the private company he dealt with that even plastic surgery required after mucormycosis will be covered. “I have consulted a team of doctors scrutinizing the claims. They said this is being taken as a Covid-related complication due to which reconstructive plastic surgeries will be paid for,” said Aya. Dr Darshan Rewanwar, a plastic surgeon from the city, said surgeries should be covered by the insurance companies. The surgeries for removal of body parts have to be done for preventing the infection spread. This is followed by operations to maintain the functionality of the body part. In case of eyes, it is needed to maintain the symmetry, he said. However, an official of a private hospital who reverted after talking to an insurance company, said plastic surgeries are not likely to be covered. This is because it is an external treatment and not needed to cure the disease as such. Officials of two other companies said they haven’t come up with any such case so far at the regional office level. It is likely that as a special case, expenses on mucormycocis patients’ plastic surgeries may be reimbursed. “There have been no clear instructions yet,” they said. “The general rule is that, it is evaluated whether a particular surgery is needed for the patient to carry on his day to day work. If it can happen even without the plastic surgery, the expenses may not be reimbursed or covered under cashless schemes,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/will-cos-cover-post-mucor-surgeries-opinions-differ/articleshow/82920307.cms||Shishir Arya

Dr Bang, a gynecologist, has designed these sessions focusing on adolescents’ relationship with parents, information on sexual health, talks on the differences between love and infatuation and risks of premarital sexual relations. Dr Bang used to visit schools and colleges to conduct residential camps for youths, especially in tribal-dominated Gadchiroli district, to educate them. The initiative, which is continuing for 25 years now, has been attended by more than 1 lakh youths in 520 camps, and hundreds of talks in many schools in 24 districts of Maharashtra. Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, holding camps or talks in schools is not possible. So Society for Education, Action and Research in Community Health (SEARCH) organization, headed by Bang couple (Dr Rani and Dr Abhay Bang) has decided to bring the knowledge in the form of videos, and make it available to all. From May 26, ‘Tarunyabhan’ will come online on the YouTube channel ‘Nirman for Youth’. Dr Rani Bang will interact with the viewers every Wednesday. Being a social media platform, youths may post their questions which could be answered in next video. “Adolescents are one-third of the total population of the country. This age accompanies wide spread of adventure, sexual activeness, teenage pregnancy and exposure to peer pressure. Due to prolonged Covid lockdowns, it has become more important to have this educational programme open for all on social media,” said Dr Amrut Bang, from NIRMAN, a joint venture of SEARCH and Maharashtra Knowledge Corporation Limited. The initiative was started after shocking results of two studies by SEARCH in 1990s. First study, done in Gadchiroli, showed that 46.7% of unmarried girls examined had sexual contact. Another study revealed high prevalence of gynaecological disease among rural women. Tribal culture which allows live-in and pre-marital sexual relationships results in teenage pregnancy, abortions, miscarriages and unwanted pregnancies many a times.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/dr-rani-bangs-guide-for-adolescents-goes-online-on-wed/articleshow/82922044.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Four other convicted members of the gang got prison terms of 10 years each while two were sentenced to seven years' imprisonment. Overall, 11 murder cases had been filed against the gang, four of which were dismissed due to lack of evidence. Three other cases are still in different stages of trial. All the victims were truck drivers and cleaners. They were stopped, robbed and killed by the gang, whose members used to dress as cops.

The district administrations claimed that this was not alarming as all children are asymptomatic and none of them had been admitted to hospital. The districts have started the process of setting up dedicated Covid wards for children as it is feared that in the third wave, more minors will test positive. Dausa CMHO Manish Choudhary said, “In both the first and second wave, we had around 13,000 cases which includes patients of all age groups. In the second wave starting from March, we had approximately 9,000 cases out of which 2-3% were children. I issued a letter on Monday to set up a dedicated Covid ward for children in the district though till date we have not had any child who required hospitalisation.” In Hanumangarh, officials claimed that the total percentage of affected children between 0-10 years was 2.8% while over that from 10-20 years was 8.3%. District collector Nathmal Didel said, “We cannot say we are already in third wave and since last year we have had around 19,000 Covid positive cases out of which 10% were children. These children are the ones whose parents were infected due to which they also caught the virus. However, there have been no deaths and hospitalisation. If required, we will take support of paediatric wards in hospitals. Across the state, in all the districts, the situation is similar when it comes to the number of children getting infected.” Didel said they have fitted the ambulances with both small and large oxygen cylinders so that they can be used for children as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/covid-infection-among-kids-not-alarming-says-officials/articleshow/82922051.cms||Yeshika Budhwar

A demand to categorise lawyers as front line workers has also been put forward. District Bar Association (DBA) president Kamal Satuja and secretary Nitin Deshmukh, referring to Article 267 of the Constitution for contingency funds, has written to Modi asking for Rs10 lakh for the families of deceased lawyers. “We have also sought Rs20,000 as monthly assistance to needy lawyers as lockdown has affected their livelihood, and free medical assistance under government schemes,” said advocate Satuja. He added DBA has extended Rs25,000 assistance to families of deceased lawyers, and another Rs2,000 each to 300 of their members for treatment and other expenses apart from food kits to 500 during the second wave of Covid-19. The High Court Bar Association (HCBA) has provided assistance of Rs50,000 to deceased lawyers under 45 years of age, informed HCBA president Gauri Venkataraman. “A vaccination drive was organized. We had formed a committee which had organized webinars for creating awareness and also a list of doctors was circulated in the social media groups for help,” said Venkataraman. “As the district court is affected most, we need to create virtual hearing infrastructure in the lower strata of the judiciary too,” she said, urging lawyers to follow Covid norms diligently. Advocate Satuja, who had intervened in a suo moto PIL by the high court, where advocate Shreerang Bhandarkar has been appointed amicus curiae, also said there is an attempt being made to ensure virtual hearings at the district court were made a regular feature, but several lawyers are facing hardship for various reasons, including lack of sophisticated mobile phones. Advocate Anil Gowardipe, chairman of Maharashtra and Goa Bar Council, said Rs1 lakh was made available to families of deceased members if they had applied. “We are also providing Rs50,000 for treatment to lawyers who may need it,” said Gowardipe, adding he had also met state health minister Rajesh Tope to provide early vaccination to lawyers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/40-lawyers-dead-due-to-covid-bar-assn-seeks-aid-help-from-pm-cm/articleshow/82922062.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Pune||Maharashtra cop scales Everest, dedicates summit to late mother||PUNE: Assistant police inspector Sambhaji Gurav, a resident of Sangli district and currently posted with the Navi Mumbai police, became the third policeman from Maharashtra to climb Mount Everest, the world’s highest mountain (8,848.86m from sea level), at 6.30am on May 23. Deputy commissioner of police Suhail Sharma, posted with the anti-terrorism squad (ATS), and naik Shaikh Rafique Taher, are the only other state policemen to have achieved the feat. Sharma, who was the first IPS officer to climb the mountain from the China side in 2016, congratulated Gurav for the latter’s achievement. “I climbed Mount Everest to pay tribute to my mother, who succumbed to a brain stroke in March 2018,” said Gurav after reaching the successful summit. Speaking to TOI over the phone from Kathmandu, Gurav said, “I couldn’t identify the symptoms of my mother’s illness at an early stage. I could have saved her, if I had identified them. On the day she passed away, I made up my mind to climb Everest to pay tribute to her.” Pasang Sherpa, chairman of Pioneer Adventure, told TOI over a call from Kathmandu, “Gurav successfully climbed Mount Everest on April 23 morning. We will submit all photographs and videos to the Nepal government to get his certificate of achievement. It will take at least three weeks to get the final certificate.” It was a tough journey for Gurav, as his physical fitness was poor due to his unscheduled duty at the police station over the years. To properly prepare himself, he joined the Quick Response Team (QRT) of the Navi Mumbai commissionerate. He said, “When I started preparing, I couldn’t run more than 2km in one go. I diligently worked on my physical fitness. Within a few months, I could run a half-a-marathon (21 km) and subsequently a full marathon (42km). I would also go cycling for long distances for hours. This helped me improve my cardio fitness. I also practised yoga at home.” Initially, the Covid-19 pandemic hampered his preparations because he couldn’t practise mountaineering across the Himalayan ranges to get acquainted with the weather conditions and other aspects of climbing, he said. Gurav started his expedition on May 9 with five other climbers and sherpas of Nepal-based Pioneer Adventures. They could comfortably reach the first two base camps. But the journey between Base Camp 3 and Base Camp 4 was a tedious one. “We completed all four base camps as per schedule. But on May 20, the weather conditions took a turn for the worse, accompanied by high speed winds blowing at 40-50km per hour. We had to postpone our journey for the next two days. Even after that the condition didn’t improve much. We then collectively decided to continue with our journey amid the gusty winds at 8,000ft,” he said. “We could barely walk 100 metres in an hour. But this decision went in our favour, as we could climb the next few points without facing much difficulty,” said Gurav. On reaching the summit, Gurav pulled out his mother’s photograph and paid tribute to her. He also held the Indian flag and the Maharashtra police poster. “My sherpa and I spent a good 20 minutes at the summit amid the strong winds. I sang the national anthem and started my descent,” he said. His problems weren’t over just yet, as Gurav never realised that his oxygen support had got exhausted. “When we were just short 600m away from Base Camp 4, my sherpa alerted me. That’s when I started facing breathing issues for a while, but somehow managed to reach the camp where I got access to oxygen,” Gurav recalled. Gurav thanked his course mates in the police force and senior police officers, who supported him financially for the expedition. “Without their support, I wouldn’t have managed to bear the cost of the expedition,” he said. Additional Director General and former Navi Mumbai police commissioner Sanjay Kumar told TOI, “It is a great achievement not only for him but for Navi Mumbaikars and the Maharashtra Police. The outcome was the result of his grit, dedication, commitment and sacrifice, along with support of his family and well wishers. I personally feel proud of his achievement.” Back home at Padvalwadi village in Sangli district, his wife Sujata, their six-year-old daughter, his father and brother (Shivaji) rejoiced on Monday. They were tense and worried till May 23 afternoon as they could not contact him in any way. Talking about his expedition preparations, Sujata said, “He has been dedicatedly preparing for this expedition for the past three years. To prepare scientifically, he had undertaken a three-week long mountaineering course from Atal Bihari Vajpayee Institute of Mountaineering and Allied Sports at Manali in Himachal Pradesh two years ago.” “Gurav was awarded with the President gallantry award in 2014 for his successful participation in several anti-naxal operations in Gadcharoli district between 2011 to 2013,” said a senior police officer, who did not wish to be named. Meanwhile, deputy commissioner of police of anti terrorist squad (ATS), Suhail Sharma — the first IPS officer to climb the mountain from the China side in 2016 — congratulated Gurav for his achievement. Sharma told TOI over the phone from Mumbai, “It’s a monumental achievement. It requires a lot of effort, courage, determination and several months for preparation — physically and mentally. I am sure his achievement would inspire many more in the Maharashtra Police and other civil employees in the state.” Veteran mountaineer Umesh Zirpe from Griripremi Mountaineering Club, Pune, said, “Gurav’s achievement is a proud moment for all of us. He is the third policeman from the Maharashtra Police to scale Mount Everest.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maha-cop-scales-everest-dedicates-summit-to-late-mother/articleshow/82922078.cms||Sandip Dighe

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Kin of teachers who died of Covid during poll duty to get jobs||LUCKNOW: UP basic education minister Satish Dwivedi on Monday announced that dependents of those teachers who died of Covid-19 during poll duty will be accommodated as teachers in government primary schools, if they have BEd/DLED (former BTC) degree. However, those dependents who are not TET qualified but are eligible for class three posts will be accommodated even if there is no such post vacant. Earlier, qualified dependents were retained as class four employees if they did not have TET qualification. “Those dependents who did not possess TET qualification but were post-graduates, were given jobs as class four employees. Being a teacher, I find it derogatory to see a qualified person working as a peon, attendant and even sweeper.” “Now, a dependent who is not TET qualified but is eligible for a clerical post, will be given a job in class three category. In case there is no such post vacant, they will be appointed on “over and above the sanctioned posts”. They will start working with us right away and when a post becomes vacant, their names will be formally entered,” Dwivedi said. In view of growing pressure from teachers’ associations for compensation to families of teachers who lost their lives due to Covid during election duty, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had asked the State Election Commission to amend rules to ensure that the kin of a deceased get a job. Welcoming the decision, secretary of Rashtriya Shaikshik Mahasangh, an RSS-affiliate, Shiv Shankar Singh said, “A clerical post is better than a class four job. At least people will see the families of the deceased with respect.” The final list prepared by RSM has credentials of 1,488 teachers, including those on ad hoc basis, and employees who died in the line of duty. Prior to the implementation of the Right to Education (RTE) Act, the kin of deceased teachers who were graduates were accommodated in primary schools as teachers and while on rolls, they were provided training (BTC). After the RTE came into effect in 2011, TET became a mandatory qualification for recruitment in state-run primary and upper primary schools. Even dependents of the deceased who were graduates or post-graduates were given jobs as class four employees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/kin-of-teachers-who-died-of-covid-during-poll-duty-to-get-jobs/articleshow/82924040.cms||Isha Jain

---||Nagpur||Human activities to blame for bad air in city: Data||Nagpur: It is now certain that human activities in the city are responsible for increasing the toxicity in the air we breathe. Air quality monitoring data reveal that like last year, during this lockdown too the air is much cleaner compared to normal days. In the month of April, there was not a single day when levels of major pollutants went above the safe limits.This was revealed by an analysis of data done by environmental group Green Vigil Foundation. It showed compared to the months of January and February, the city’s air quality improved significantly in April when lockdown restrictions were increased.The NGO used data from the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB). While improvement in air quality is evident at various monitoring locations across the city, the organization focused on data of monitoring station at Civil Lines which is sent to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) for calculating the city’s Air Quality Index (AQI).MPCB monitors three main pollutants – sulphur dioxide (SO2), oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter (RSPM). In January, there were at least six days when the RSPM levels crossed the permissible limit and were over 100. As per CPCB, this range can cause breathing discomfort to people with lung and heart diseases, apart from children and senior citizens.On some days, levels of SO2 and NOx too were more than the safety mark. The situation was almost the same in the month of February too. However, data for the month of April showed that there was not a single day when levels of all three pollutants went above the safe limit. According to experts, this clearly proved reduction in human activities has a direct impact on air quality. “In Nagpur, vehicular pollution and emissions from construction activities have been the major contributors of air pollution. During the lockdown period, hardly 30% of the vehicles were plying. Though the government had permitted construction activities, they also reduced by 50-60%. This led to the improvement,” said Kaustav Chatterjee, founder of Green Vigil.As reported by TOI in April last year, scientists at the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri) had also stated that overall air quality of the city witnessed dramatic improvement during the nationwide lockdown.Now that the major sources are known, experts feel government should work on curbing pollution caused by them. “Synchronising traffic signals is crucial to avoid traffic congestions. The more the vehicles wait at junctions, more are the emissions. Also, construction activities, which have drastically increased in the city in last few years, should be time-bound so that emissions are controlled,” added Chatterjee.Surbhi Jaiswal, team lead at Green Vigil, said the civic body should also focus on saving the green cover. “In all these years, there has not been a single strict punishment against illegal felling of trees. We all know that trees play a major role in controlling air pollution. Even when giving permissions to fell trees, the civic officials should try and find a middle way that can save maximum number of trees possible,” she said.GROUND REALITY- Like last year, this time too drastic improvement in city’s air quality during lockdown- Air quality in April improved compared to January and February- RSPM, NOx and SO2 parameters within permissible limit- Vehicles and construction activities major sources of air pollution- Synchronisation of traffic signals and time-bound construction needed||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/human-activities-to-blame-for-bad-air-in-city-data/articleshow/82922082.cms||Manka Behl

He was admitted in the super speciality wing of the Maharana Bhupal Government Hospital in Udaipur since three weeks and was on ventilator since May 17 after his condition deteriorated. Khant was quite popular among the tribal populace in both Garhi and Bagidaura constituencies. He was elected from Bagidaura twice while he won the Garhi seat in 2013 assembly elections. Khant was known for his simplicity and easy accessiblity. He was considered a tough competitor for Congress stalwart Mahendrajeet Singh Malviya. MLA Gulab Chand Kataria, Former MP Raghuveer Singh Meena and others expressed condolences on Khant's death and termed it an irreparable loss for the people of Banswara.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai college principals caution against calling off XII boards||MUMBAI: City college principals are skeptical about the state's plan to skip board exams for class XII students. They have voiced concerns over the proposal to rely on past performance as the current class was promoted from class XI without an exam. Principal are worried that the quality of admissions to university courses will suffer if there is no uniformity in assessing students. They are also concerned about state and central boards adopting diverse methods of assessment for class XII, which would make it difficult to draw up a merit list. Maharashtra’s school education minister Varsha Gaikwad on Sunday said a no-exam route needs to be examined though most other states are in favour of an exam. The CBSE board too is keen on going ahead with it for a reduced number of subjects. A Mumbai principal said difficulties would emerge if students in class XII do not have an exam, especially since they were promoted from class XI without a test in the final semester. “Some took an online exam, which is not enough to decide admissions to higher courses. It will be very difficult for colleges to draw up a merit list based on marks given by schools and junior colleges. There will be no uniformity,” said the principal. Another principal said class XII boards are crucial for admissions to professional courses. “We understand the difficulties in holding an exam at this stage. The numbers are huge, but a plan B is needed,” said the principal. However, for those aiming for a seat in an elite engineering or medical college, for instance, would have to be judged mostly on the basis of the entrance exam (JEE/NEET) to these institutions with weightage reduced considerably for their class XII scores. Sudha Shenoy, a parent representative, said that JEE/NEET aspirants never take their internal college exams seriously. "If they are going to be assessed based on that, they may not score well," she said. Many agree that conducting board exams in the conventional form may not be possible this year without vaccinating all students. “They can probably hold a single-day entrance exam for arts, science and commerce students when the situation improves in July,” said a principal. Vidyadhar Joshi, vice principal of the junior college at Kelkar-Vaze’s, said that there should be a national common policy for evaluation of class XII students. “State board schools/colleges do not have a mechanism for continuous evaluation to rely on. The last uniform evaluation for this batch was done when they were in class X, which was not stream-based (for arts, science or commerce) and cannot be accepted for degree admissions. Conducting the exam is also not a solution as colleges cannot call over 1,500 students to the campus, it would risk their health. Internal evaluation for conventional BA, B Com, B Sc could still be fine, but entrance exam could be an option for self-financed courses,” said Joshi. He also said that board exams can be held later – when the situation improves – for students who need their class XII scores.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-city-college-principals-caution-against-calling-off-xii-boards/articleshow/82922599.cms||Yogita Rao
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Parents of kids below 12 years to get jabs on priority||LUCKNOW: UP government has announced special vaccination booths for parents and guardians of children below 12 years, state government employees and teachers across all 75 districts from June 1. In a meeting on chaired by chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday night, it was decided to target parents whose children were young as experts have expressed apprehension about the expected third wave affecting children the most. “Experts have raised concerns about children being the most affected in the third wave and, therefore, the state government has decided to immediately vaccinate parents of such children who are below the age of 12 years and provide them with a shield against the third wave,” the CM said. Additional chief secretary, information, Navneet Sehgal, said that such persons will be vaccinated on priority. “Separate ‘Guardian Special’ booths are to be set up in all districts. Such persons whose children are below the age of 12 years will be contacted and encouraged to get vaccinated on priority. They will be told that the vaccine will not just keep them safe but also their children. The CM has said that this has to be taken up on mission mode,” Sehgal said. Separate booths will also be set up for state government employees who did not make it to the frontline workers category. Such booths will be set up at the district, tehsil and development block headquarters levels. A similar effort will be started for teachers as well. For this, the offices of the district school inspector and basic shiksha adhikari will be converted to vaccination centres. The teachers’ association has claimed that over 1,500 teachers lost their lives due to Covid as a result of their panchayat election duties. At present, vaccination of persons 45 years and above is taking place across the state and for those in the 18-44 years age group is taking place in 23 districts. From June 1, this would be extended to all 75 districts. Special vaccination camps are also being held for judicial officers and media personnel. The CM has also stressed on a public awareness campaign to highlight the need for vaccination. Yogi said the Centre has given clearance to three vaccines. In the coming days, many more vaccines are likely to be available. The state was the first to issue a global tender for vaccines. However, Pfizer and Moderna, for which the government had introduced special changes in the tender before extending its date, have informed various other states that they will only deal with the Centre. Sources in UP government said that even without them, they still had Johnson&Johnson, Astra Zeneca and Sputnik to bank on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/parents-of-kids-below-12yrs-to-get-jabs-on-priority/articleshow/82924074.cms||Neha Lalchandani

The vaccines will be available for people above 18-45 years and those above 45. As many as 2,000 free vaccines will be administered to people in the underprivileged category. The drive-in facility has been priced at Rs 1,400, while the walk-in vaccination at Rs 1,000. In the beginning, only Covishield will be available, but the hospital has also applied for other vaccines and will try and procure them with due course of time,a n official said. Speaking to TOI, Dr Aashish Chaudhry, managing director, Aakash Healthcare, Dwarka said “We were constantly thinking about people who are old with ailments and probably can’t afford to walk all the way to a centre to get vaccinated. We also realised that people were hesitant coming to a hospital, hence, we spoke to the mall authorities, who readily agreed. For people who can’t use a smartphone or are not technology-friendly, we will launch a number, which they can contact and reach the mall where they will be registered and walk-in vaccinations will be done.” To apply, one must first register on the CoWin website and then select the centre, following which they will redirected to a page where payment can be made digitally. Once at the mall, the person can enter after showing the message and will be given a form, completing which they can get to any of the 3-4 booths and can easily get vaccinated. Another such facility is likely to come up in south Delhi’s Vasant Vihar, but whether it will be just walk-in or drive-through as well is being discussed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-to-get-first-drive-in-vax-facility-on-wednesday/articleshow/82922083.cms||Sakshi Chand

He also said that vaccines should be given to lactating mothers on priority. Sawant said the party’s request is being considered. “We have informed our central leadership that it should intervene and allot Covid-19 vaccines to the state government on priority as per the order placed,” Tanavade said. The state requisitioned for five lakh vaccine doses with Pune’s Serum Institute. Tanavade said Goa could achieve 100% vaccination status as the state is very small. “Also, if we have to overcome the third Covid-19 wave, we need to vaccinate the entire population of Goa,” he said. In response to the opposition’s claims, Tanavade said non-Goans working in Goa could take the Covid-19 vaccine in the state. “When they are working in Goa, will they go for vaccination to their respective villages?” he asked. BJP MLAs are also of the opinion that domestic help should be vaccinated so that they don’t spread Covid-19 at their respective workplaces, Tanavade said, even as he took a potshot at the opposition for criticising the government. He said it should advise the state on how to control the spread of Covid-19 instead. He also slammed the opposition’s criticism over the Class X board exam being cancelled. “The opposition speaks both ways. Last year, it had demanded that the exam be cancelled,” he said. When asked if the state government’s decision to impose a curfew in the state had come late, Tanavade said no one had anticipated that the second Covid-19 wave would be so massive even as people organised events and celebrated religious festivals. He appealed to anyone who developed a fever to get tested immediately.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/those-with-comorbidities-should-get-vax-sans-booking/articleshow/82924216.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Thiruvananthapuram’s Covid-19 deaths remain a mystery||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The number of Covid deaths recorded for a day in a press note issued by Kerala Government Postgraduate Medical Teachers Association (KGPMTA) Thiruvananthapuram Medical College unit has been found to be at variance with the official death figure recorded for the same day, deepening the mystery regarding difference in actual Covid deaths in Thiruvananthapuram. TOI on Monday reported on the huge variation in number of Covid victims being cremated in crematoriums and the official figures. KGPMTA issued the press note in response to the complaint about the dead body of a Covid-19 victim being abandoned for 15 hours in a ward on May 12. In the press note, the association pointed out that two nurses and two attendants were dealing with around 80 patients requiring critical care. Besides, the note pointed out that 70 deaths happened in 24 hours and the Medical College Hospital (MCH) mortuary with a capacity of 50 corpses was holding more number of dead bodies that day. Dr Unnikrishnan G, one of the office-bearers of the association, said that the number of deaths for that day was factually accurate since it was reported and signed by the doctors on duty. Officially, only 30 deaths happened in the entire district on May 12. These deaths were reported in daily lists over three days — 17 on May 15, 12 on May 16 and one on May 18. MCH authorities said data and information regarding deaths are communicated from the office of superintendent to district medical office. If 40 deaths were not enlisted as Covid deaths it ought to have been included in the list of non-Covid deaths citing that the actual cause of death cannot be attributed to Covid. However, on May 12, one non-Covid death was reported in the state and that was not in Thiruvananthapuram but in Ernakulam. One official said it could be that those 40 persons who died in the MCH on May 12 may not be natives of Thiruvananthapuram and may have been referred to the hospital from other districts or even Tamil Nadu. However, the official point out that it was highly unlikely that such a huge number of patients on critical care from other districts/state died in the hospital that day. District medical officer Dr Shinu K S could not be reached for comments. Almost all the major crematoriums in the district have reported higher number of Covid deaths especially in the past two months as against the official figures released by the health department. A total of 467 Covid-19 deaths have been officially reported in the district in May so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/districts-covid-19-related-deaths-remain-a-mystery/articleshow/82920429.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Delhi||Corporations may look at scaling down Covid cremation capacity in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Only about 15% of Covid-designated funeral platforms are currently being used in the city with the number of deaths going down over the past few days. Funeral data from civic bodies shows that less than 200 Covid funerals are being carried out daily since May 21 as against the capacity of handling 1,184 cremations. Officials say that the number of designated platforms may soon be reduced to facilitate cremation of non-Covid bodies. According to a May 23 report released by the corporations, 147 Covid funerals were carried out. On May 22, 149 funerals were conducted and a day before that, 161 cremations took place. “In the wake of the number of deaths going down, 88% capacity remains unutilised. Soon, we will have to start reducing the reserved capacity. We have already started asking local authorities to facilitate non–Covid cremations,” said an official. In the largest crematorium of the city at Nigambodh Ghat, 168 bodies can be cremated in a day. On May 23, 24 cremations were carried out here as per corona protocol. About 25 bodies on average are being cremated at Punjabi Bagh Shamshan Bhumi, which has 100 funeral platforms reserved for Covid bodies. The Covid-reserved capacity was scaled up in April-end when the number of Covid funerals peaked at 717 funerals per day. As of now, North Delhi Municipal Corporation’s cremation grounds can handle 507 Covid funerals per day—Nigambodh Ghat has a reserved capacity for 168 bodies, Paschim Vihar 96 and Mangolpuri 42. Out of these 507 reserved platforms, 24 were utilised on Sunday. Similarly, in case of South Corporation, 79 out of 507 platforms were utilised. In East Delhi, 23 out of 150 platforms were utilised, the report states. A funeral manager said that since most of the platforms were reserved for Covid victims, the relatives of those who died because of non-Covid reasons in the past one month were forced to take the bodies to smaller sites far away from their homes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/corpns-may-look-at-scaling-down-covid-cremation-capacity/articleshow/82922109.cms||Paras Singh

As part of the preparations, a children ward with 22 beds was being prepared in Jawahar Hospital. He said out of 14,500 Covid cases reported in the district from April 15 till date, 186 were children aged 0 to 6 years, which translated to 1.3% of the total cases. Modi added that none of the infected children had to be admitted to hospitals and all were treated at home. Similarly, 1,914 children in the age group of 0-18 years were infected, which translated 13.6%. None of these children had any serious symptoms and none had to be admitted to hospitals. In the last 15 days, 12 children have tested positive. Jawahar Hospital paediatrician Dr Dinesh Jangid said in the last 45 days, he received very few cases of Covid-infected children and none had to be hospitalised. Most of the children were asymptomatic and isolated in their homes. “Now preparations have begun to prevent the third wave. We are alert and very few Covid-infected children are coming to OPD,” he said. Revenue minister Harish Choudhary directed the administrative officers and village-level core committees to collect information about infected children. That will be sent to the district administration so that treatment can be started before cases get out of hand. Baytoo assembly constituency will be the first area in the Jodhpur division to start influenza-like-illness survey.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jaisalmer-had-13-covid-19-cases-in-0-18-yrs-age-group/articleshow/82922085.cms||---

We don’t want to take the risk.”The district administration has, meanwhile, directed the village officials in general to keep vigil on all the village borders and prohibit entry of outsiders for at least a week. That’s not all. The villagers too won’t be allowed to venture out unnecessarily.In a circular, the district administration has directed the panchayat officials to form monitoring committees in all the 228 village panchayats in the district. Each committee would comprise panchayat president, secretary, village administrative officer, village health nurse and a police official, and be guided and monitored by block-level officials.The monitoring committees have to set up Covid care centres in their limits with adequate facilities. “Whenever a person tests positive for the virus and is directed to remain in home quarantine, the patient could be housed in the Covid care centre if there isn’t sufficient space for isolation at home. The committee should make arrangements to provide food to the patients,” the circular said.MP P R Natarajan, meanwhile, petitioned district collector S Nagarajan, urging him to take steps to impose self-lockdown in the district.“Even though the state government has imposed a complete lockdown, public continue to step out onto the roads. To reduce their movement, self-lockdown is the only way. With the help of public representatives and volunteers, self-lockdown could be implemented at ward level,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/ravathur-village-isolates-itself-from-world-to-keep-coronavirus-at-bay/articleshow/82922093.cms||Nivedha Selvam

---||Chandigarh||‘Important for villages to follow Covid rules strictly’||Ludhiana: Even as experts indicate that rural areas might witness rise in cases during the probable third wave, many villages are still ignoring Covid norms. Villagers hardly wear masks and are seen gathering at common places, ignoring social distancing completely. Team from TOI visited a number of villages in Jagraon and Raikot areas and found that Covid-related norms are being ignored by many people across these villages. At Bassiyan village near Raikot, a group of people were seen at a common place in the village, most of them sitting close and without masks. At Jhorran village as well a group of villagers, mostly without masks were sitting closely under a tree and were playing cards. At Lakha village, a group of people, all without masks were sitting on the road side. At Chakar village, there were two groups of people sitting under two trees, one playing cards and one resting under the tree and most of the members of both groups were not wearing masks. At Akhara village, near Jagraon, a group of villagers were sitting under a tree near the entrance of the village and most of them were not wearing masks and were sitting closely. Many villagers said such gatherings are part of lives of people. A villager from a Jagraon area, who asked to be identified as Manjeet Singh, said sitting at a common place (chaupal) in villages is an integral aspect of rural life and it is hard for most to give up such practice. However, he added due to increase in cases from rural areas, many more are following Covid \norms than before. Deputy commissioner, Varinder Sharma said villagers needed to be persuaded differently than city folks and they are doing what it takes to convince them. Meanwhile, health experts said it is important for people in rural areas to start adopting Covid preventive measure strictly. “The probable third wave may affect the villages so there is need for people living in villages to follow Covid norms so that cases are kept under control,” said Ludhiana Indian Medical Association president Dr Saroj Aggarwal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/important-for-villages-to-follow-covid-rules-strictly/articleshow/82922105.cms||Shariq Majeed

But I persevered, and within a few months, I could do the half marathon (21 km) and marathon. I also did cycling and practised yoga at home,” says Gurav. But the Covid-19 pandemic was a dampener as acclimatisation on the Himalayan ranges was not possible. He started the expedition on May 9 with five other climbers and sherpas. “We covered all four base camps as per schedule. However, on May 20, weather conditions worsened, and we had to take a two-day break. Though things didn’t improve much, we decided to continue with our journey amid gusty winds at 8,000ft,” he said. On reaching the summit, Gurav pulled out his mother’s picture. He also held the Indian flag and the Maharashtra police poster. “My sherpa and I spent 20 minutes at the summit. I sang the national anthem and started my descent,” he said. He will get the certificate attesting the feat in the next few weeks. Gurav thanked his course mates in the police force and senior officers who provided financial support for the expedition. Additional director general and former Navi Mumbai police commissioner Sanjay Kumar told TOI, “It is a great achievement not only for him, but also for Navi Mumbaikars and the Maharashtra police.” Back home at Padvalwadi village, his older brother Shivaji, father, wife Sujata and six-year-old daughter rejoiced. Sujata said her husband had been practising with dedication for the past three years. DCP Suhail Sharma and Naik Shaikh Rafique Taher are the only other state policemen to have achieved the feat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-on-everest-top-cop-holds-tricolour/articleshow/82922608.cms||Sandip Dighe

The vehicles will reach all the 100 wards of the city. In addition, the corporation has also asked traders of daily markets to sell vegetables using their own vehicles and granted permission to 500 more vehicles.”“Arrangements have been made to sell about 105 varieties of fruits and vegetables through the vehicles.

---||Coimbatore||Two more oxygen generators start operation at ESI hosp||Coimbatore: Eighty more beds were equipped with oxygen from two oxygen generators at ESI Hospital on Monday. The hospital officially began using two 200 litres per minute (LPM) medical oxygen generator plants that will provide oxygen at 5LPM to Covid patients with breathing difficulties. This takes the total number of oxygen generators in the hospital to five and number of beds equipped to 140. This will reduce the hospital’s dependence on liquid oxygen, which must be procured from external sources, especially with the state facing an oxygen shortage.The two generators, which cost a little more than Rs 1 crore, were bought from city-based Faraday Ozone. They were donated by ZF Wind Power and Codissia members.The initiative began with an SOS call for oxygen generators made in a WhatsApp group of city-based Mani Higher Secondary School alumni belonging to the 1990-batch, which included Codissia president Ramesh Babu.ESI Hospital already has three 100LPM oxygen generators, which provide the gas to 20 beds each. They were donated by Rotary clubs in Coimbatore and other fundraising initiatives. “Of the 400 patients on oxygen support, 300 require only five litres per minute. They can be provided oxygen from generators, which is sustainable because they capture air from the atmosphere, separates oxygen and supplies it,” said an official. “This way, use of external liquid oxygen reduces to a large extent and can be reserved only for very sick patients on ventilators or those requiring oxygen at 10 to 12LPM.”The hospital is trying to acquire five more oxygen generators of higher capacity, so that more of the 405 oxygen beds in the hospital can be put to use.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/two-more-oxygen-generators-start-operation-at-esi-hosp/articleshow/82922102.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Land sharks target Jaipur’s ecological zone during lockdown||JAIPUR: In a major drive against illegal construction in ecological zone, the Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) sealed 13 duplexes in zone 10. The action was initiated after the developer refused to stop construction even after the notices were issued. An official said, “Duplexes were sealed in Govardhan Dham, which were being constructed on khasra number 1306, 1307, 1309, 5082/1308 in Kho-Nagorian village. The drive was carried out after issuing the notices under Section 32-33 of JDA Act.” An enforcement wing official said the warning to the developer was issued earlier and materials were confiscated. However, taking advantage of the lockdown, construction resumed. The JDA constructed a brick wall on the entrance of the duplexes to prevent people from entering. Encroachers are giving sleepless nights to JDA staff as they are targeting land in ecological zone. On Sunday, the JDA razed a colony fencing in Kho-Nagorian area, where the land grabber was attempting to develop a colony on a six-bigha land. Similarly, JDA demolished a boundary on a seven-bigha land in Jamwa Ramgarh area, which was also falling under ecological zone. A source said, “On Agra Road, the JDA issued 37 notices to developers whose colonies were falling under ecological zone.” After land mafias became active and developed illegal colonies during the pandemic, the JDA conducted a meeting to tackle the issue. In the last one month, the JDA removed encroachments from approximately 300 bighas where illegal colonies were developed. With a spurt in population and increase in demand for land, illegal construction and development of colonies in the city is on the rise. Cracking down heavily on the illegal colonies and encroachments in the state capital, the JDA in the last three months demolished a total of 117 establishments, which were being developed on 1,121 bighas in separate areas, as per data.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/land-sharks-target-citys-eco-zone-during-lockdown/articleshow/82922108.cms||---

After drawing the flak as numbers shown by Vadodara officials were lower as compared to the state health bulletin, it is now the turn of Vadodara to show much higher numbers than that by the state bulletin. The difference in data has been observed for quite some time now. While it is expected that there could be some discrepancy, the difference in numbers has been glaring at times. When the issue was raised earlier, officials had said that they were looking into the issue and would find out the reason. But the difference remained and even many citizens were confused when they saw different data at different places. While there is no major difference in the number of daily deaths declared by the state against those declared by Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC), that makes a combined bulletin for the city and district, the difference in the number of positive cases can differ by as high as 200. This had reached 278 on May 20. The number of daily deaths may not differ much, but when it comes to the total number of deaths, a major difference is observed. Against 580 deaths admitted by the VMC, the number stands at 737 on the Covid-19 tracker of the state government on Monday evening. Interestingly, neither the health bulletin issued by the state government nor the tracker gives the total number of cases detected in Vadodara. But if one were to add up the number of live cases, deaths and recovered patients on the dashboard, it can be concluded that by Monday evening Vadodara had 70,914 Covid cases. At the other end, the figure stands at 65,644 in the VMC bulletin. An official in the VMC said that the discrepancies had been pointed out to those who were responsible in the state government, but the problem had still remained. He held that the data released locally was up to the mark.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/discrepancies-in-vmc-state-covid-data-remain-citys-number-higher/articleshow/82918695.cms||Sachin Sharma

Of four, two plants will be set up for Hyderabad and Secunderabad while the remaining two will be set up in different states. The move comes after the decision of IMRC, USA chairman Manzoor Ghori, who directed the CEO of Sahayata Trust Syed Aneesuddin to oversee the project. “This is the first time an oxygen plant is being set up by any NGO in Hyderabad,” said Aneesuddin. "Of two plants earmarked for the city, one plant will be set up at the Indo US Hospital in Malakpet while the other one will be set up at one of the trust's facilities in Tolichowki. Each plant would have the capacity to produce about 5,000 litres of oxygen per day," he said. The INDO-US hospital plant will be solely for hospital patients, while the Tolichowki plant will provide free refilling of oxygen until the Covid-19 crisis ends. According to Aneesuddin, these concentrators will be provided to different NGOs in different cities across India. “This is the largest donation of oxygen concentrators to any NGO from another country,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ngo-to-set-up-two-oxygen-plants-in-city/articleshow/82922104.cms||---

The day also marked the first time the district recorded more than 4,000 cases, taking the total number of cases to 1,43,164. With 2,528 people getting discharged, the number of active cases touched 33,325. The total number of people cured stood at 1,08,791, dragging down the recovery rate to 75.99%.The district also recorded 28 deaths due to the virus, taking the toll to 1,048. Of the 28 deaths, five of them or 17% of the victims, were in their 30s, and only one had co-morbidity diabetes. The victims included a 35-year-old man, who died eight days after hospitalization on Saturday, a 33-year-old man who died after four days of being given hospital care, a 38-year-old who died within 24 hours of hospitalization and a 33-year-old diabetic, who died within 24 hours of hospitalization. All five deaths occurred at Coimbatore Medical College Hospital. Another five victims were in their 40s, which pointed to more than one out every three victims being under 50 in the productive, young age bracket.Six oxygen and 24 ICU beds are available in the city, despite the spike in active cases. Also, 655 beds are available in Covid care centres.What is more alarming is slowly but gradually increasing cases of black fungus or mucormycosis in the district. The district reported nine fresh cases of the fungal disease, of which one was reported from the government sector and eight from the private sector. “While three patients were cured of the fungal disease on Monday, 19 are still under treatment,” said the district administration’s bulletin. This takes the total number of black fungus cases to 30 in the last four days. However, not a single hospital has antifungal medicine liposomal amphotericin B injection. TOI called eight hospitals to source vials for a patient in Madurai, which is also facing a shortage of the imported drug, only to find that none of them had stock.Four major pharmaceutical companies in the district also did not have the drug.

Now, it has been reduced to one. Due to this, people crowd at this single centre, which in turn might become a super spreader. So, the district administration should take steps to provide vaccine at Kalveerampalayam, VNR Nagar, Maharani, Veerakeralam, KK Pudur, Muthukumar Nagar, Ganapathy, Rathnapuri and Gandhi Managar,” Arjunan added.Similarly, Jayaram requested the collector to take immediate steps to provide vaccine at Singanllur, Nanjundapuram. Sowripalayam, Neelikonanpalayam, Peelamedu, Palayur, Nesavar Colony and Masakalipalayam. “At present, vaccine is made available only at Varadharajapuram primary health centre and it has been causing a lot of inconvenience to the public,” Jayaram added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/mlas-seek-to-increase-vaccination-centres/articleshow/82922112.cms||---

It was a busy night and the calls kept coming. He did not leave. He kept working through the night, taking 15 patients to hospitals and finished his shift before leaving for his village, 200km away in Mainpuri. And after conducting his mother’s last rites, he rushed back to work in 24 hours. “I was shaken, but I had to gain control and go on. I couldn’t just drop what I was doing. The work we do is critical,” Prabhat, 33, told TOI. Prabhat has been driving ambulances for the 108 service for nine years now. Last year in March, when all district ambulances were earmarked for Covid-19 patients, he was among the first to be recruited as drivers. His Covid-19 When the number of cases had started going down towards the end of last year, some of the ambulances were used for regular services again for a few months. In April, Prabhat was back on Covid duty. “I had asked him to stay home for a few days after his mother’s funeral and take some time off but he insisted on getting back as soon as possible. He said he wanted to help,” said Ajay Singh, program manager of Mathura’s 102 and 108 ambulance services. “He is a dedicated worker, always supportive.” It was Singh who arranged transportation for Prabhat from Mathura to Mainpuri the day his mother died — the state is still under partial lockdown and there is no public transport available yet. He got back around 1.30am the next day and reported to work for the morning shift. In July last year, during Prabhat's previous stint as a Covid ambulance driver, his father had died of Covid-19. Then, too, Prabhat had gone home for a day, conducted the funerary rituals and hurried back. A shift is usually eight hours long but can spill over. Weekly leave is flexible but Prabhat and others like him try to only take them when absolutely necessary. “We are on Covid duty. We deal with critical patients every day. Their families need our help. I can’t just sit at home and mourn my mother. My mother is gone. If I could save some people, she would be proud of me,” said Prabhat. “We need to help as many people as we can.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/he-got-a-call-his-mom-had-died-but-kept-driving-covid-ambulance/articleshow/82918730.cms||---

Girdhari Israni, a resident of the area said, “First, we have to get up in the early morning to fill water and now this situation. The water also smells bad.” Many residents said they have to fill water from a tap in a nearby park to fulfill their daily requirements. On Sunday, a group of residents went to the public health and engineering department (PHED) office and met officials. Manish Sharma, a resident of the area, said this was not a new issue and many-a-times polluted water has been supplied to houses. “A few months ago, red water was supplied through the pipes. There is a need to fix the issue permanently so that public won’t have to run from pillar to post every day,” said Sharma. PHED junior engineer Khushal Sharma said, “I received a complaint on Sunday that polluted water was coming in the supply line. We checked the morning supply line, but our workers couldn’t find anything. So, we figured that the nearby tubewell must be having some issue which is being sorted out at present. I am sure that from Tuesday onwards, people will get clean water.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/krishna-colony-residents-complain-of-polluted-water/articleshow/82922110.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Noose for 12 AP robbers for ’08 highway murders||Vijayawada: In a rare instance of capital punishment being handed to as many people at once, a sessions court in Andhra Pradesh’s Ongole on Monday sentenced to death 12 men — gangster Md Abdul Samad, alias Munna Bhai, and 11 of his accomplices — in three cases of dacoity leading to the murder of six people on the Chennai-Kolkata highway in 2008. Four other convicted members of the gang got prison terms of 10 years each while two were sentenced to seven years' imprisonment. Overall, 11 murder cases had been filed against the gang, four of which were dismissed due to lack of evidence. Three other murder-for-gain cases are still in different stages of trial. The gang was also found guilty of illegally possessing a 9mm machine gun. Munna Bhai, who hails from Kanigiri village in Prakasam district, and his associates Sk Riyas, Syed Hidayuthulla, Md Jamaluddin, Batala Salamon, Y Chinna Veeraswamy, G Bhanu Prakash, Rachamala Sampath, G Sreedhar, Sk Hafeez, Gangadhar Rao, Sk Kamal Saheb, Sk Rahamuthulla, Sk Dada Peer, Sk Irfan, and Sk Rafi were charged under various sections of the IPC and the Indian Arms Act. VIII additional district and sessions court judge G Manohar Reddy had upheld the submission of public prosecutor S Sivaramakrishna Prasad and convicted the accused on May 18. The quantum of punishment was pronounced on Monday. The trial started in 2008, after the gang members were arrested and charged for the murders over a period of several months. All the victims — Ramar Shekar and Perumal Subramanium from Tamil Nadu, G Syambabu and G Vinod Kumar from Andhra Pradesh, and Bhushan Yadav and Chandan Kumar Mahato from Bihar — were truck drivers and cleaners. They were stopped, robbed and killed by the gang, whose members used to dress as policemen. The trucks and loads would be later sold to scrap merchants. The murders came to light in October 2008, when a driver and cleaner went missing along with a lorry laden with iron rods en route to Kalpakam in Tamil Nadu from Durgapur in Bengal. Lorry owner Veerappan Kuppuswamy lodged a complaint at Ongole police station. The police suspected the involvement of Abdul Samad and his gang and launched a manhunt. The other cases came to light after Samad was arrested from Karnataka and interrogated. His gang members were apprehended from different parts of the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/noose-for-12-ap-robbers-for-08-highway-murders/articleshow/82924203.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

However, Jaipur Covid figures show marginal increase in percentage of infected children in the second wave compared with the first wave. However, in May (till 23) more children (0-10 years) were infected than in whole year of 2020. Jaipur reported 22% of the state’s total Covid-19 cases in May. Out of Jaipur’s total cases, 2.8% were children (0-10 years). In April, it was 3% for the same age group. However, in the worst two months (November, December 2020) of the first wave 2.2% children were infected in November and 1.7% in December. “The number of infected children has increased in the second wave. In May (till 23), the number of children (0-10 years) who tested positive for Covid were 1,917, accounting for 2.8% of the 68,832 total cases of Covid reported in May,” said Dr Narrottam Sharma, chief medical health officer (Jaipur-I).

According to records, 177 residents have applied online for issuance of lease deeds in the last one week with 23 applications received in Zone-12. Similarly, 93 name transfers and 49 matters related to subdivision are pending at the zone offices. Other than this, 11 cases of land conversions (90-A) are pending at the civic body. An official said work cannot be expedited till restrictions are lifted as applicants have to be present physically to submit the documents at citizen care centre. “Once the documents are submitted online, physical verification is required to avoid forgery. As JDA will remain close , work cannot gain momentum.” After the first wave, the JDA had made seven public related works online. The monitoring of these work zonewise occurs weekly. A senior JDA official said, “There is a time-frame of maximum one month to dispose of the works of the residents. After witnessing pendency, notices were also issued to the officers concerned. But, officials have expressed helplessness in this scenario.” JDA had started online application facility for some major services last year to provide benefit to residents during the lockdown. However, in absence of staff, it is facing a hindrance. Source said, “The JDA top-staff has been deployed in Covid management. Also, staff is working from home. The system can function only after office resumes.” JDA online system is not helping many people in difficult times, residents whose plots fall under Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) also cannot do any such work sitting at home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/public-work-piles-up-at-jda-due-to-lockdown/articleshow/82922137.cms||---

---||Ranchi||In a first for Jharkhand, Cyclone Yaas set to enter state||RANCHI: For the first time in Jharkhand’s nearly 21 years of existence, the projected path of a cyclone is set to pass through the state and likely to leave a trail of destruction. The state government has now scrambled to protect its assets and people apart from making efforts to conduct rescue operations. However, there are no plans to evacuate people currently. On Monday, the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) issued a red category warning for East Singhbhum, West Singbhum and Seraikela Kharsawan, saying Cyclone Yaas, which make landfall at the Odisha-West Bengal border on Wednesday noon, will enter the state on the same day. A very severe or severe cyclonic storm will reach Jharkhand through East Singhbhum and will be preceded by fairly widespread rainfall and squally wind with speeds up to 40-50 kmph, the IMD said. Unlike previous cyclonic storms originating in the Bay of Bengal, Cyclone Yaas has an unchanged projected path and intensity even after making landfall and expected to reach Jharkhand, putting the entire administrative machinery on its toes. The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) has allocated four of its team for Jharkhand and three of them are being deployed in Jamshedpur and one team has been kept on standby in Ranchi to extend necessary support to the local administration. The director-general of NDRF, S N Pradhan, said they are prepared to tackle any situation and help the state. “As the IMD has predicted a severe cyclonic storm in Jamshedpur, three teams have been dispatched to help evacuate residents in low-lying areas and carry out relief and rescue operations as required,” he said. According to its evening bulletin, the IMD said Yaas is currently over the east-central area of the Bay of Bengal and 490 km south-southwest of Paradip (Odisha) and 580 km south-southeast of Digha (Bengal) which is very likely to move north-northwest and intensify into a severe cyclonic storm in next 12 hours and into a very severe cyclonic storm in subsequent 24 hours to reach north Odisha-West Bengal coast near Balasore on Wednesday noon. It further said heavy rainfall is expected in isolated parts of Jharkhand over East Singhbhum, West Singhbhum and Seraikela-Kharsawan on Tuesday and issued a yellow category alert for the region for the day. “The cyclonic storm would approach the state from southeast parts (East Singhbhum district) as severe cyclonic storm/cyclonic storm on May 26 evening/night and gradually reach near Jamshedpur city with decreased intensity as deep depression (28-33 knots/ 50-61 kmph) around 5.30 am on May 27. It would further move north-northwest gradually decreasing its intensity and reach to the east of Ranchi city as depression (17-27 knots/ 31-49 kmph) around 5.30 pm of May 27,” the bulletin read. It also issued a red category warning for the southern districts — East & West Singhbhum and Seraikela Kharsawan for May 26 and May 27 — when there are very high chances of extremely heavy rainfall and widespread rainfall throughout the state. Abhishek Anand, a weather scientist at the IMD Ranchi office, said the impact of Yaas would be evident on Jharkhand from Tuesday. “The main impact would be observed on Wednesday and Thursday. During the daytime, wind speeds up to 50-60 kmph would be witnessed in the south and southeastern districts which may reach up to 110-120 kmph by evening with gusty winds reaching up to 130 kmph,” he said. Anand added, “The cyclonic storm would convert into a deep depression by 5.30 am on Thursday accompanied by extremely heavy rainfall in southeastern districts while the north-western districts would experience heavy to very heavy rainfall.” Another weather scientist, Dr A Wadood of Birsa Agriculture University, said unlike previous cyclones, the IMD has not predicted any deviation in the projected path of Yaas and will progress even after hitting the landmass. “From the prediction, it seems that the cyclone would remain violent during its entry into Jharkhand and the wind speed can cause substantial damage to trees, thatched roof, power lines and inundation of low lying areas,” he said. Wadood explained that wind speed ranging from 40-50 kmph does not cause much damage but once it crosses the 80-kmph range, even big trees cannot withstand it and can damage property. “People living in low-lying areas along the banks of Subarnarekha and Kharkai rivers must be evacuated on time to avoid loss of life,” he said. Disaster management minister Banna Gupta issued directives to the departmental secretary on Monday to make necessary arrangements and streamline power and water supply during the three days beginning Tuesday when the cyclone is likely to remain active in the state. “We have directed the NDRF teams to remain alert and assist the local administration in case of any eventuality,” Gupta said. As a preventive measure, the railways have cancelled as many as 11 trains — either originating or passing through the Ranchi rail division -- and a total of 129 in the state. The state electricity distribution companies have also assured that they would remain alert and carry out immediate repair and maintenance work in case power lines are snapped.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/in-a-first-for-jkhand-cyclone-set-to-enter-state/articleshow/82920960.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

Dr Anand is also accused of speaking ill about health minister Banna Gupta for directing the health department to conduct the raid. The minister had ordered a probe on receiving complaints of charging hefty amounts from Covid patients treated at his nursing home. RIT police station officer-in-charge Srinivas Singh said Dr Anand was arrested under sections 304, 323, 340, 341, 353, 506, 188 of the IPC in connection with a case filed on May 15 by the health team. Jamshedpur (East) MLA Saryu Rai, however, criticized the state government for arresting Dr Anand. Terming it as a violation of human rights and government excesses, the Independent lawmaker said people's trust on the administration and police will erode if officials continue to work as an agent of the government anti-people actions. "Prima facie it appears that the nursing home manager is being targeted. I will wait for the next three to four days for more facts, if any, are coming to the light. Police and administration's action of the next few days will help me conclude my final opinion about the case," Rai said after meeting family members of Dr Anand at the latter's residence in Adityapur. Earlier in the day, drug officials of Seraikela Kharsawan district also seized a large quantity of medicines from an ambulance parked at a private school campus owned by Dr Anand's family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/adityapur-nursing-home-owner-sent-to-jail-for-threatening-probe-team/articleshow/82922805.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ranchi||Vax stock for 18+ group will last just 3 days; will last only 10 days for 45 & above: Hemant Soren||RANCHI: Chief minister Hemant Soren on Monday said that the state will run out of its stock of Covid vaccines meant for those between 18 and 45 years of age in two or three days. Soren made the comment while he was interacting with his cabinet colleagues in a virtual meeting to take feedback on the ground situation of the pandemic and seek suggestions for the future course of action. “Vaccination is increasingly becoming a concern even as we are trying to come out of the second wave of the pandemic. The situation is such that we barely have stock for two to three days for the 18+ age group,” Soren told the ministers. The state is also reeling under a crisis for vaccines for the 45+ age group. “We have stocks for a maximum seven to 10 days. The entire vaccination system has been marred by mismanagement on the part of the central government, which everyone is fully aware of now. Rather than blaming the Centre, we are focusing on ways to arrange vaccination. We are also planning to import vaccines from overseas and modalities for it is being worked out,” Soren added. Soren said the Centre failed to alert states and take necessary measures even as it had prior knowledge of the second wave of the pandemic. “Government of India knew about the (second wave of the) infection but there was delay in directions to the states and ultimately the entire country was impacted by it,” he said. He added, “We were suggested that there should not be any lockdown in the country but given the rate of infections, the state governments started taking their own decisions. Today there are partial or complete lockdowns (in every state).” Notably, the state government is providing free vaccines from its coffers since May 14. About 1.57 crore people between 18 and 44 years of age have been identified in the state. Of them, 3,70,955 -- about 2.36 % of the target -- have been vaccinated so far. In the 45+ age group, the funds for which is provided from the central pool, 32,53,040 of the targeted of 83,86,677 have taken their first dose. As far as the second dose is concerned, 3,50,547 of 4,47,383 have received the jab since the beginning of the drive. The CM said Jharkhand has barely 40 lakh doses of vaccines against a requirement of 4 crore doses, leading to the shortage. However, the state government would make serious efforts to procure vaccines, including through imports, he said. Soren said the state government would soon make a decision on extending the lockdown as 23 of its 24 districts share borders with either Odisha, Bihar, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh or Chhattisgarh, which are severely affected. Every day about 20,000 people are coming to the state through the railways and to combat the spread, Jharkhand has decided to intensify testing in rural areas on a war footing, Soren said. In urban areas, he said, the chain of the virus has been broken and fresh cases have reduced drastically to around 2,000 from earlier 15,000-20,000 a day. “As far as death rates are concerned, we are the top in the country. UP and Bihar are reporting fewer deaths but you can assess if it is true. Many states are manipulating data but it is the priority of our government that we will ensure full transparency and take all possible steps to contain the virus,” Soren said. “Till the time a single death takes place in the state, we will consider it as peak,” he said. Meanwhile, state health minister Banna Gupta has also demanded the government to completely do away with PM Narendra Modi’s picture in vaccination certificate, as done by Chhattisgarh for the 18+ age group, and replace it with Soren’s photo. Last week, the state government had launched a separate vaccination card in Ranchi bearing the chief minister’s photo.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/vax-stock-for-18-group-will-last-just-3-days-will-last-only-10-days-for-45-above-hemant/articleshow/82922763.cms||ASRP Mukesh

A letter in this regard was issued by additional chief secretary (health) Arun Kumar Singh, directing the authorities at the state-run hospital to constitute a technical expert group (TEG) so that Rims can function as a centre of excellence for effective management of the fungal disease. “The fact that many recovered patients of Covid-19 stand the risk of contracting the disease and even losing their lives necessitates the setting up of the best healthcare system to tackle the disease. In order to provide the best treatment to such patients we have decided to start a dedicated ward for mucormycosis patients which will be managed by a team of expert doctors,” Singh said. He added, “As a heavy dose of medications is required for each and every black fungus patient on a daily basis, the decision will help us in preventing the misuse of essential drugs.” Following the directive, the management at Rims has started preparations for management of the disease and has made their dengue ward as a dedicated ward for treating the black fungus patients. The public relations officer at the hospital, Dr D K Sinha, said, “A technical expert group is being formed which will have one expert each from microbiology, internal medicine, neurology, ENT and ophthalmology. In addition to this, one surgeon each from plastic surgery, neurosurgery and a dentist have also been included in the group for a comprehensive care.” Meanwhile, the National Health Mission (NHM) has directed all the deputy commissioners and civil surgeons to step up a cell for monitoring the mucormycosis patients on a daily basis and report to the state health department. In a letter addressed to the DCs and the civil surgeons, NHM MD Ravishankar Shukla directed them to identify suspected cases of mucormycosis through their Integrated Disease Surveillance Program (IDSP) cell in order to provide timely treatment to such patients. According to Shukla’s letter, the district surveillance officers of IDSP have been directed to compile a data of suspected as well as confirmed cases of black fungus after collecting the aforementioned information from all the government private hospitals in their respective districts. The officers have also been given a detailed format which needs to be filled up and submitted to the state IDSP by 5pm daily.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/rims-to-become-nodal-centre-for-black-fungus-mgmt/articleshow/82922890.cms||Gaurav Pandey

Airing his views, Patralekh said, “While I am on the same page with my cabinet colleagues on the extension of the ongoing lockdown to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic, my biggest concern as the agriculture minister is the impact of the Cyclone Yaas on the state's agriculture sector.” He added, “According to the inputs I have received, the cyclone is likely to leave a devastating effect on the agri sector. Moreover, squalls, thunderstorms and lightning will also create havoc in the state. We have to first prepare to tackle it on an urgent basis. Hence, I am proposing a three-day complete lockdown to avert another disaster of losing lives and livelihood amid the pandemic.” Soren said he has taken note of the suggestions and informed the ministers that he will soon take a suitable decision after another meeting with his senior officials and experts. On the extension of lockdown, Soren said he is holding brainstorming sessions and a final decision will be taken soon after the sessions. During the online meeting, water and sanitation minister Mithilesh Thakur along with Patralekh also raised the concerns of farmers and the loss they have suffered during the pandemic. The ministers also sought a special intervention from the government to help the farmers. While Patralekh said the situation is so grim that watermelon and tomato growers are not getting any buyers, Thakur cited how the Food Corporation of India (FCI) has not been sympathetic to the farmers by not paying for the paddy procured from them. Finance minister Rameshwar Oraon, who also favoured an extension of the lockdown, stressed on providing relaxation for certain sectors. He also urged Soren to give a special focus on rural areas. “Our intervention in rural areas while fighting the second wave of the pandemic is currently lacking steam. Moreover, since we have closed garment shops, people are facing problems in buying shrouds and other clothes required for cremation activities amid the high number of deaths registered daily. As a result, they are being forced to buy the items at exorbitant rates,” he pointed out. Taking note of Oraon’s suggestions, Soren said the government will soon provide the shrouds free of cost. “The government has already waived off all kinds of charges at cremation sites in the interest of people. Now, we will also give free shrouds (kafan),” he announced. The chief minister also stressed that the government’s entire focus is now shifting towards the rural areas to tackle the pandemic and a host of initiatives have already been rolled out. Later in the day, he also launched a rural Covid management task force. Soren said from Wednesday onwards, special door-to-door testing and tracing activities will be kicked off across panchayats by special teams comprising sahiyas, anganwadi sevikas and nurses among others. “The idea is to monitor the health condition of every villager and take appropriate steps. We are also converting all district and block hospitals into oxygen-supported healthcare facilities. Efforts are also on to provide medical kits to every second household. Only if people are healthy, we can vaccinate them. And to tackle Covid, we have to increase the number of inoculated people,” Soren added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/mins-in-favour-of-lockdown-extension-to-contain-virus/articleshow/82922964.cms||ASRP Mukesh

Pointing at symptoms that are seen in people who have recovered from Covid-19, Guleria said: “If the symptoms are seen for 4-12 weeks, it is called ongoing symptomatic Covid or post-acute Covid syndrome. If the symptoms are seen for more than 12 weeks, it is called post-Covid syndrome orlong Covid and that needs treatment too.” Common symptoms are breathing difficulties, cough, tightness in chest, anxiety and high pulse rate. These symptoms can remain because of the body’s immune response to inflammation. “There is also chronic fatigue syndrome and it needs symptomatic treatment. Another is brain fog when people who have recovered from Covid have difficulty in concentrating and find it difficult to work and they also suffer from insomnia and depression,” Dr Guleria said. Experts say that while several people are still reporting such issues after recovering from Covid-19, all these require rehabilitation through multi-disciplinary post-Covid clinics.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/post-covid-issues-need-to-be-addressed-aiims-chief/articleshow/82927528.cms||---

While the institute will monitor and guide the government towards achieving its sustainable development goals and Vision 2030, it will also work at doubling the per capita income by 2025. “Overall, the institution will work with a ‘vision prosperity’ for Goa,” a senior officer said, adding that GIFT will function as an independent body. Former chief minister Manohar Parrikar in his budget speech 2017-18 had stated that “with the disbanding of the planning commission at the national level, I propose to close the state planning board from the forthcoming financial year. Alternative mechanisms will be announced in due course of time.” Accordingly, the state planning board was disbanded with effect from April 1, 2017. Chief minister Pramod Sawant in his budget speech 2019-2020 had announced that the “government will established state institution for transforming Goa (SIT-Goa) on the lines of Niti Aayog, which will function as an autonomous body to assist, advice and guide the state government in policy making and formulation, implementation, monitoring of the sustainable development goals and evaluation of various development plans/programmes/schemes. It will also serve as a knowledge hub to the state in replicating best practices which are suited for the sustainable development of the state.” SIT-Goa was later named as GIFT. Accordingly, in order to create appropriate institutional mechanisms to address issues pertaining to the government, a committee under the chairmanship of the chief secretary, Goa with eight members was established for the formation of the proposed GIFT. The financial implication involved in constituting the institution is around Rs 2.5 crore per annum. GIFT will be constituted on the lines of NITI Aayog and will coordinate and conduct techno-feasibility and viability studies and advise the state government on critical issues such as sick industries in the state, eco-friendly non-polluting industries, industrial and infrastructure development inline with ‘Make in Goa’ and take up development issues within the state for management as also development of inland rivers. It will function as a one-stop solution provider, a knowledge and innovation hub for leveraging expertise and for analysing and suggesting improvements in financial management. GIFT will suggest necessary amendments with course corrections measures to deliver results on the basis of knowledge, measurement, monitoring and evaluation and innovation. The institute will identify and explore opportunities in different sectors and areas for investment. It would also consist of a flexible number of teams organised on sector lines in order to deal with specific concerns, issues and problems of important sectors of the economy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-gives-go-ahead-for-setting-up-govt-think-tank/articleshow/82921041.cms||---

VMRDA will enter into an MoU with East Coast Railways for construction of the RoB. VMRDA metropolitan commissioner P Koteswara Rao said that the urban development body will pay around Rs 2 crore to the railways towards ‘way leave’ charges, supervision charges and other departmental charges.  “Rites Limited, an empanelled consulting agency of the railways, is the project management consultant for this multilevel grade separator (flyover) project. The construction of the RoB would cost about Rs 16 crore, which was included in the contract given to the successful bidder of the project. Work on the RoB would be grounded shortly and completed by September,” said Koteswara Rao. The VMRDA commissioner inspected the NAD flyover project on Monday as well as the site for the proposed RoB between the two existing RoBs on the airport side.

During his inspection, the commissioner asked the contractor to open the lower rotary of the flyover for traffic movement. VMRDA is constructing the flyover at an estimated cost of Rs 150 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/vmrda-gets-rlys-nod-for-nad-flyover-rail-over-bridge-project/articleshow/82919428.cms||---
