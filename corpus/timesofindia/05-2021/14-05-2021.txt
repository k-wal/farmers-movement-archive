But, on each such occasion, I asked myself, “is there any need to punish oneself with unhappiness?” The answer has always swiftly banished such negative thoughts. This is why I am certain that, as with the sojourn, the departure from life too will be amidst the surround-sound of pleasure, and more so, excitement. All these years, I have always been restless for new experiences. Now, to tell you the truth, this life has become jaded. One has had the privilege to have been there, done that, bought the T-shirt. Now, as for an adventure traveller, the last frontier beckons, demanding to be experienced. Of this, I am certain: the never-before destination, the great unknown will not disappoint. Everyone has talked of its mystery: us paar na jaane kya hoga, us paar jaroor kucch naya hoga. I can’t wait to explore it.

They know that I will embrace death with the same uninhibited celebration with which I have hugged life. In this aware club are my gurus who have nurtured and pampered me. Sometimes, I have a quiet laugh when thinking of those who will mourn for me. Poor things.

I had never met any businessman or woman with such a passion for spiritual wisdom, knowledge and atma gyan.

Seeking permission to start the re-verification process under the supervision of a monitoring committee, represented by the respective district judge, district magistrate and superintendent of police, Sarma contended that many ineligible names have been included in the draft NRC while eligible names have been left out. Sarma said the error has to be rectified, arguing that preparation of a correct and error-free NRC is integral to national security. He told the court that around 50,000 people, who were found eligible to be included in NRC, have been excluded from the final draft and the number may increase if detailed re-verification is done. Over 19.06 lakh people were left out of the final draft, published in August, 2019. “That, out of names of 40,07,719 persons, excluded from the draft NRC, about 3,93,975 persons did not file any claims and therefore their names are in the exclusion list of the NRC. After some sample checks and analysis of the names of the persons who did not file claims on the basis of surnames only, it was found that 50,695 persons were apparently eligible for inclusion in the NRC,” he said in an application filed in the apex court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/assam-nrc-coordinator-moves-sc/articleshow/82616752.cms||---

---||Chennai||Number of Covid patients needing hospital care up in Chennai||CHENNAI: The city is experiencing an acute shortage of beds not only because of an explosion in fresh infections but also because more people are moving out of home isolation and into institutional care. Official data from the state government shows that on April 30, around 67% of the 31,475 active cases in Chennai then were in home isolation. However, on May 12, when the city had 40,613 active cases, only 60% were in home isolation. Across the city, many Covid-19 patients are in a mad scramble to get oxygen beds everyday, sending out SOS alerts over social media platforms. Doctors say this wasn’t the case during the first wave, when the percentage of asymptomatic patients recuperating at home was higher. Dr E Theranirajan, dean of Madras Medical College and Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH), said the percentage of patients requiring oxygen support has doubled compared to the first wave. He also pointed out that while many patients reach medical college hospitals in a state of panic, not all need critical care. “Of the 20 ambulances waiting outside the hospitals, at least 4-5 patients are ones who can be in home isolation or in Covid care centres,” he said. Dr S Subramanian, an infectious diseases expert, said patients from the same household needing hospital care were fewer during the first wave. “Severity among family members is higher in the second wave,” he said. Younger family members are also being hospitalised now, he added. Many patients are also not willing to go home after a substantial part of their treatment is over, Subramaian said. “They ask us to give an assurance that they won’t fall sick again.” A Greater Chennai Corporation senior official said there are cases of people waiting till the fourth or fifth day of fever to get themselves tested. “Early testing and medication is key. If not, the condition worsens and hospitalisation is needed. This is why we are giving medical kits to symptomatic patients, irrespective of their test result,” the official said. The system of a step-down oxygen beds, for which beds at Chennai Trade Centre (CTC) are being used, is a good option, Subramanian said. “Some patients who recover still need oxygen and some nursing care, which can’t happen in home isolation. Step-down oxygen beds are for them,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/number-of-covid-patients-needing-hospital-care-up/articleshow/82618224.cms||Siddharth Prabhakar

Oxygen production commenced at the plant around 10 pm on Wednesday and the first load was flagged off by district collector K Senthil Raj around 7 am. Escorted by the police it reached the Tirunelveli medical college hospital. Sterlite sources said there are two oxygen plants on the premises of the sealed copper smelter plant. The first has a capacity of 515 metric tonnes a day and has been put to use in the first phase while work is under way to utilize the second one, with a capacity of 535 metric tonnes a day, in the next few days. Production in the first plant is expected to be scaled up over the next few days. A Sterlite statement said one of the plants commenced production from May 12, and that the oxygen supplied is 98.6% pure and has received medical-grade certifications. The company will be despatching two oxygen tankers daily to begin with which will be gradually scaled up as production expands. Efforts are being made to resolve the logistics involved in transporting the oxygen to the required parts of India, it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/sterlite-begins-to-despatch-oxygen/articleshow/82619430.cms||---

The university has already sent the virus samples to ICMR to assess possibilities of any new variant in Aligarh. Vice-chancellor of the university, Tariq Mansoor, told TOI that the CM assured all possible help in the fight against Covid-19, especially with supply of life-saving drugs, including Remdesivir and Oxygen supply. The CM said, “Vaccination could have saved lives. The VC raised the demand for additional oxygen, which has been provided.” A government spokesperson said, oxygen and medicines have been dispatched and the university brass has been promised every possible assistance in handling the situation. The CM also reviewed the vaccination programme and visited the integrated command and control centre, he said. The AMU VC told TOI, “Though we have an eight-bed paediatric ICU and high dependency unit (HDU) each, CM Yogi has asked us to expand it in view of a possible third wave which could be harmful for children.” During a meeting with the CM, the VC said that many of the faculty members and non-teaching staff, who died due to Covid-19, were not vaccinated and were hospitalized late. He also said there could be possibilities of a new strain of the virus in Aligarh too. The VC said, “Vaccination is very important and I have been urging all staff members to get vaccinated first.” Alarmed by the death of a large number of faculty members, retired professors and non-teaching staff due to Covid, the VC had written a letter to the ICMR on May 9 for urgent genome sampling of the virus samples from their lab to check for mutations. However, the report is still awaited. This was the CM’s first visit to the varsity since he assumed office in 2017. In fact, the last UP chief minister who visited the AMU was ND Tiwari in 1984, said university spokesperson Dr Rahat Abrar. The CM also held a virtual meeting with district officials of Aligarh, Etah, Kasganj and Hathras to review the Covid-19 situation. While addressing media persons, the CM said, “The cases have declined in the past 12 days across the state.” He added, “Shortfall of oxygen supply was the result of a sudden rise in daily consumption from 300 metric tonnes to 1,000 metric tonnes.” Divisional commissioner Guarav Dayal, who was also present in the meeting, said that the CM also interacted with the district magistrates of neighbouring districts and directed them to increase testing, set up more oxygen plants and create paediatric ICUs in each district. “At least 5,000 samples are being tested in the district daily but the CM has asked to increase the numbers to 7,500,” said Aligarh district magistrate CB Singh, adding that they have also been asked to hold virtual meetings with public representatives. After the review meeting in AMU, the CM visited Mathura and Agra too, where he took stock of the situation and also interacted with Covid positive patients to know their health status and assess the situation in hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/uttar-pradesh-chief-minister-yogi-adityanath-visits-aligarh-muslim-university-after-several-faculty-deaths/articleshow/82619454.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

In an affidavit filed in the Delhi HC on May 5, the instant messaging app said that Big Basket, Koo, Ola, Truecaller, and Zomato as well as Aarogya Setu collects similar data that WhatsApp does. It also mentions that Zoom and Google have similar privacy policies. This affidavit was filed in response to a petition filed by advocate Harsha Gupta, who had argued that WhatsApp’s new policy violates a user’s right to privacy. On Thursday, WhatsApp told TOI in a statement sent over email that users will not lose functionality if they do not accept its new terms on May 15.  “WhatsApp continues to provide an important way for friends and family to stay in touch during this difficult time. While the majority of users have already approved our update, no one will lose functionality on May 15 if they haven’t yet and we’ll be sure to provide reminders at a later time. We want everyone to know that this update does not impact the privacy of personal messages. We’re providing information about new options we are building to communicate with businesses that people may choose to use in the future. We’re grateful for the important role WhatsApp plays in people’s lives and we’ll take every opportunity to explain how we protect people’s personal messages and private information.” The reassurance, however, came with a caveat. The giant has said that after “persistent reminders” to users they will “encounter limited functionality on WhatsApp until you accept the updates.” “After a few weeks of limited functionality, you won’t be able to receive incoming calls or notifications,” the announcement added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/other-companies-collect-more-data-whatsapp-defends-its-policy/articleshow/82619547.cms||Anam Ajmal
---||Goa||15 more Covid patients die at Goa hospital as oxygen dips again||PANAJI: Tragedy struck the Goa Medical College (GMC) yet again on Thursday, with 15 Covid-19 patients dying due to erratic supply of oxygen. As many as 26 patients had died at the premier state-run hospital on Tuesday. A day after, on Wednesday, the Bombay high court had directed the Goa government to ensure that there are no more casualties at the hospital due to oxygen shortage. There were also unconfirmed reports of some deaths on Wednesday. “The oxygen interruptions are causing problems leading to deaths. Last night, the interruption that was caused between midnight and 8am caused 15 deaths,” GMC nodal officer Dr Viraj Khandeparkar told the high court, which is hearing a PIL regarding oxygen shortage. The horror unfolded around 1:25am on Thursday when relatives began making SOS calls saying that oxygen levels were dropping at GMC. Wards 143, 144, 145, 146 and 149 faced oxygen shortage. With oxygen pressure dropping, the SPO2 levels of patients on ventilators also dipped. Doctors made frantic calls to GMC’s senior officials and to Scoop Industries, the company contracted to supply oxygen cylinders to GMC, asking for oxygen supply to be looked into. Their calls went unanswered. “As far as piped oxygen is concerned, there was a dip in the night. There were small dips at least three-four times and one big dip of about half an hour,” GMC dean Dr S M Bandekar told the high court. Bandekar said the patients who succumbed during the period were those who had a high severity score. Among the 15 who lost their lives in the early hours of Thursday was a couple. Their two young daughters were orphaned overnight. The government, particularly health secretary Ravi Dhawan, insisted that the state had adequate oxygen and that the dip in supply was due to the changeover of oxygen cylinders and lack of trained drivers who could manoeuvre the cylinder trolley quickly. Dhawan’s assertion that “there is no dearth as such of oxygen” and that the deaths took place because of “logistical issues” did not find favour with the HC, which said that the authorities were in “denial mode”. “We are quite pained that such logistical issues should give rise to such serious consequences to Covid victims. We expect the state administration to find out ways and means to overcome these logistical issues, so that precious life is not lost on account of any deficiencies in the matter of supply of oxygen to the patients,” said Justices M S Sonak and Nitin W Sambre. Dhawan pinned the blame on inexperienced tractor drivers. “Between 1:45am and 2am, the driver who was bringing in the trolley got stuck in the pathway and that pathway can bring only one tractor down in reverse. The oxygen manifold is in the basement of GMC and the driver got stuck for 10-15 minutes and therefore, the changeover time was extra,” said Dhawan. The court said that the submissions made by the state were not appreciated. “These kinds of submissions are in the nature of a denial that the problem is elsewhere,” said Justice Sonak in an oral observation. With the court taking a stern line, the government decided to appoint a committee to inquire into the oxygen supply issue that has plagued GMC for over two weeks. The three-member committee consists of IIT Goa director B K Mishra, former dean of GMC Dr V N Jindal and urban development secretary Tariq Thomas. The committee will ascertain the adequacy of the oxygen supply and recommend improvement in the delivery system at GMC.

On May 5, a five-judge bench by a 3:2 majority had ruled that only the President (read the Centre) could identify and notify SEBCs for the purpose of eligibility for reservations in jobs and admissions to government educational institutions even as it upheld the validity of the 102nd constitutional amendment. The Centre has sought an open court hearing on its review petition and requested the SC to stay operation of its judgment denuding states of the power to identify and declare inclusion of a community in the SEBC category until it has decided the review petition. The Centre said, “The constitution bench of the SC, by a majority of three judges out of the five, upheld the validity of Article 342A of the Constitution. However, in so doing, the majority interpreted Article 342A read with Article 366(26C) to the effect that the amended provision excludes and denudes the states in the country from exercising the powers which they undoubtedly possess of identifying and declaring socially and educationally backward classes in the respective states. “It is submitted that the minority of two judges, including the presiding judge (Justice Ashok Bhushan), has expressly held that Article 342A does not in any manner deprive states of their power and jurisdiction and competence to identify and declare socially and educationally backward classes, which is the correct interpretation of Article 342A of the Constitution.” The majority decision denuding the states’ powers in this regard was rendered by Justices L N Rao, Hemant Gupta and S R Bhat. “Pass an appropriate order staying the findings and observations by the majority of three judges to the extent that the majority has held that Article 342 and the other provisions inserted by the 102nd amendment to the Constitution would denude the states of their power to identify and declare backward classes in each state so that the powers of the states to identify socially and educationally backward classes which always existed is not taken away in the absence of any express provision to that effect in the Constitution,” the Centre said. It said the majority judgment failed to appreciate that Article 15 of the Constitution bestowed the power on states to identify backward classes and that the power had not been changed by the 102nd constitutional amendment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/review-ruling-let-states-spot-declare-sebcs-centre-in-supreme-court/articleshow/82619980.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

It has advised the government against unilateral action and suggested that it should wait for a multilateral solution to the issue so that it is “more acceptable to the global business and larger community worldwide”. The chamber also said the provision of compulsory licensing must be used cautiously and with utmost discretion. “If not used judiciously, it may discourage innovator companies, which have heavily invested in R&D, and turn out to be counterproductive to the present situation,” Ficci said. The statement came amid demands from several political parties and leaders to invoke provisions related to compulsory licensing to deal with supply constraints as well as pricing issues. Natco had sought a compulsory licence to manufacture a low-cost variant of a medicine being used by Covid patients. “The immediate focus has to be on connecting with the ‘right’ global companies to facilitate ‘technology transfer’ and voluntary licences to Indian companies that have the capacity and capability for mass-production of vaccines. This will be a definite game-changer and help in creating a robust manufacturing ecosystem with scalability. Ficci believes that the government has initiated steps in this direction, and we believe that these should be concluded soon,” Ficci said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/use-of-compulsory-licences-could-backfire-warns-ficci/articleshow/82620106.cms||---

They claim to be residing together in a live-in relationship and claim protection of their life and liberty from the girl’s relatives. In the considered view of this bench, if such protection is granted, the entire social fabric of society would get disturbed,” the single-judge bench of Justice Anil Kshetarpal said. Co-petitioner Ujjawal, a native of Patti Dhamtan Sahib in Haryana’s Jind, had said she feared her influential family might implicate her partner Manpreet, who is from Rasidan village in the same district, in false criminal cases. While seeking protection for the couple, their counsel argued that the nature of their relationship made it even more important for the authorities to save them from any harm or harassment. “Such type of relationship will certainly put an end to the demand for dowry,” the lawyer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/high-court-rejects-live-in-couples-plea-seeking-protection/articleshow/82620395.cms||Ajay Sura

The number could be more than 3 crore doses, indicated sources close to Balmer Lawrie, the logistics partner of Dr Reddy’s which has tied up with Russian firm Gamaleya for Sputnik in India. A lot of private hospitals here are pinning their hopes on the vaccine’s arrival because of the low supply of the other ones. The sources in Balmer Lawrie, also the logistics partner for Covaxin-maker Bharat Biotech, said some volume of Covaxin “is steadily reaching Bengal”. Balmer Lawrie is a mini ratna PSU with its headquarters in Kolkata. According to sources, “once this Sputnik consignment arrives, the dependence on other vaccines will reduce”. President of Association of Hospital of Eastern India Rupak Barua told TOI that the group is in touch with Dr Reddy’s for the Russian vaccine. “We have been asked to register by the end of this month by the company. We have also learnt from sources that some big volume of Sputnik may come,” he said. According to him, once the consignment reaches situation may ease. The managing director and CEO of Woodlands, Rupali Basu, said she has communicated with Satish Reddy of Dr Reddy’s for a bulk order of Sputnik. “We are also procuring Covishield shortly along with Covaxin,” she added. Chairman of Medica Aloke Roy said, “Whatever we get is good.” Belle Vue CEO Pradip Tandon will approach Dr Reddy’s on Friday. Regional director (east) of Narayana Health R Venkatesh said, “Our central procurement team is in discussion with Dr Reddy’s lab for the Sputnik V vaccine. Though limited stock may be available with us by this month end, we expect a reasonable quantity to arrive by the first week of June.” CEO of Peerless Hospital Sudipta Mitra said it is too early to decide whether it would procure Sputnik V. “It all depends on the situation,” he said. It is learnt that Balmer Lawrie is providing a temperature-controlled warehouse to Bharat Biotech for Covaxin along with temperature-controlled vehicle for some areas. “Bharat Biotech is mainly using the Hyderabad and Vizag warehouses of Balmer Lawrie. Besides, the PSU is providing special vehicles for direct delivery to hospitals in a 50sqkm area in and around Hyderabad,” a source said, adding, “The vaccine is moving very fast now. It is going from warehouse to the final destination within a day or even a few hours.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/over-3cr-sputnik-doses-may-land-around-may-28/articleshow/82613472.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

The drop came as citizens cut spending on foreign education, international travel, and remittance to relatives. In absolute terms, total remittances for the first 10 months of FY21 at nearly $10 billion was $5.7 billion lower than $15.7 billion in the same period of the previous year due to the pandemic. According to Reserve Bank of India data, Indians spent $2.6 billion in overseas travel in the first 10 months of FY21, which is less than half of the $6.1 billion they spent in FY20. On overseas education, Indians spent $3 billion in the same period of FY21, which is over a billion dollars less than the $4.2 billion they sent abroad in the previous year. While overseas travel did pick up marginally around the third quarter as the first wave of the pandemic ebbed, the slump in the sector has returned with the second wave. “The only signal of a pick-up that we are getting is in remittances for overseas education. While many are going ahead with their plans to study abroad, they are postponing admissions to September as the expectation is that the pandemic situation will ease and there will be offline classes,” said Ebix Cash World Money business head M Hariprasad. He added that while overseas travel had picked up for closer destinations like Dubai and Maldives in December, things look bleak right now. Although some travel agents are optimistic of a pick-up in December 2021. The decline in remittances on account of education and travel alone adds up to $4.6 billion. This is significant, considering that India’s current account deficit for the third quarter was $1.7 billion. The current account position returned to a deficit after turning surplus in the first half due to a decline in economic activity and lower oil prices. Besides travel and education, the third biggest item of expenditure is the maintenance of non-resident relatives, which amounted to $2.1 billion during the first 10 months of FY21. This is only $616 million lower than what was sent during the same period of the previous year. Under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme, all resident individuals, including minors, can freely send up to $2.5 lakh per financial year (April-March) abroad for any reason excluding some prohibited transactions like gambling. The other reasons for buying dollars are foreign currency deposits, purchase of property, investment in securities, donations, maintenance of relatives, and gifts. Sending money abroad as a gift continued to be high at $1.2 billion when compared to $1.5 billion earlier. Spends on foreign travel and education saw a big jump from FY18 when average monthly remittances shot up to almost $1 billion from $630 million in the previous year. In FY19, the average was $1,148 million.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/foreign-spends-dip-5-7bn-in-10-mths/articleshow/82613913.cms||Mayur Shetty

Immediate past president of IMA’s state unit Dr Bimal Kumar Karak said continuation of lockdown was necessary to minimise the spread of Covid infections in the state. “The lockdown should be total on the pattern of curfew, compelling the people to remain confined to their homes. In fact, there should have been at least a month-long lockdown in the entire country to deal effectively with this deadly menace,” he said, adding the government should also accelerate the current pace of vaccination so that most adults could get the jabs during the period of lockdown itself. Paediatrician Dr Arun Shah said the government should review the situation after 10 days and decide about further extension of the lockdown. “Had this lockdown been imposed at least a fortnight earlier, a lot of lives could have been saved. Even after the end of the extended period of lockdown, the government should study the positivity rate in different districts and grant some relaxation only where the rate of positivity is reduced to a minimum,” he said. Dr Gangadhar Singh of Govt Ayurvedic College and Hospital, Patna, said the lockdown should have been extended by at least a fortnight to bring some remarkable change in the positivity rate. “In the first wave last year when the virus was not so strong, the positivity rate could be reduced only due to the nationwide lockdown imposed for a much longer period. Unless the movement of people from one part of the country to another was completely checked, it would be hard to do away with this menace easily,” he said. Patna high court lawyer Sudhanshu Kumar Lal said at a time when the state has been faced with acute shortage of medical facilities and doctors and paramedical staff to treat Covid positive patients, extension of lockdown was the only option left for the government. “However, lockdown should be strictly implemented, restricting the movement completely except for healthcare. It’s true that the people would have to face some financial problems owing to the lockdown, but loss of financial income is much less as compared to the loss of lives,” Lal added. Patna University Teachers’ Association general secretary Abhay Kumar said extension was the much-needed step as it would help bring down the positivity rate considerably. “Relaxation in some cases may be accorded only after reviewing the situation after 10 days. Teachers and students would hardly lose anything owing to this extension as the universities are already having summer vacation till May 31,” he said. Retired telecom engineer Gopal Sharan Singh said extension of lockdown by 10 days was necessary to check the positivity rate completely. “The lockdown should be enforced in urban as well as rural areas more strictly. Any relaxation in the lockdown would spell disaster for the entire population of the state,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/many-hail-govts-decision-of-extending-lockdown-in-state/articleshow/82612652.cms||B K Mishra

As many as 26 patients had died at the premier state government hospital on Tuesday. The deaths took place a day after the Bombay high court directed the state government to ensure that there are no more casualties at GMC due to oxygen shortage. “The oxygen interruptions are causing problems leading to deaths. Last night, the interruption that was caused between midnight and 8am caused 15 deaths,” GMC nodal officer Dr Viraj Khandeparkar told the high court, which is hearing a PIL regarding oxygen shortage. There were also unconfirmed reports of some deaths on Wednesday. The horror unfolded around 1:25am on Thursday when relatives began making SOS calls saying that oxygen levels were dropping at GMC. Wards 143, 144, 145, 146 and 149 faced oxygen shortage. With oxygen pressure dropping, the SPO2 levels of patients on ventilators also dropped to as low as 40%. Doctors made frantic calls to GMC’s senior officials and even to Scoop Industries, the company contracted to supply oxygen cylinders to GMC, asking for oxygen supply to be looked into. Their calls went unanswered. “As far as piped oxygen is concerned, there was a dip in the night. There were small dips at least three-four times and one big dip of about half an hour,” GMC dean Dr S M Bandekar told the high court. Bandekar said the patients who succumbed during the period were those who had a high severity score. Among the 15 who lost their lives in the early hours of Thursday was a couple. They were being treated at GMC by their two young daughters, who found themselves orphaned overnight. The government, particularly health secretary Ravi Dhawan, insisted that the state had adequate oxygen and that the dip in oxygen supply was due to the changeover of oxygen cylinders and lack of trained drivers who could manoeuvre the cylinder trolley quickly. Dhawan’s assertion that “there is no dearth as such of oxygen” and that the deaths took place because of “logistical issues” did not find favour with the court, which said that the authorities were in “denial mode”. “We are quite pained that such logistical issues should give rise to such serious consequences to Covid victims. We expect the state administration to find out ways and means to overcome these logistical issues, so that precious life is not lost on account of any deficiencies in the matter of supply of oxygen to the patients,” said justices M S Sonak and Nitin W Sambre. Dhawan pinned the blame on inexperienced tractor drivers. “Between 1:45am and 2am, the driver who was bringing in the trolley got stuck in the pathway and that pathway can bring only one tractor down in reverse. The oxygen manifold is in the basement of GMC and the driver got stuck for 10-15 minutes and therefore, the changeover time was extra,” said Dhawan. The court said that the submissions made by the state were not appreciated. “These kinds of submissions are in the nature of a denial that the problem is elsewhere,” said justice Sonak in an oral observation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-respite-15-more-die-as-o2-supply-at-gmc-drops-again/articleshow/82619243.cms||Newton Sequeira

The fisherman, David Garya, damaged his net and will seek compensation from the fisheries department. On Wednesday, Garya and a few labourers had set out in his boat ‘Sahara’. What got into his net was a 20-ft-long whale shark (Rhincodon typus). Garya said that the fish was trying to set itself free, the boat was losing its balance due to the weight of the fish. The fishermen got down to help release the fish, but it was fully entangled. “After two hours of trying, we decided to cut the net,” said Garya who did not want the fish trapped. A net costs around Rs 10,000. Garya shot a video of the release as proof to claim compensation. The scheme began in 2018 to encourage conservation of marine creatures. Bernard D’Mello, president of Utan-Pali Fishermen Society, said big fish try to turn the boat with the tail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-fisherman-snips-net-as-1500kg-whale-rocks-boat-to-set-self-free/articleshow/82617877.cms||Sandhya Nair

As per the Islamic calendar, the celebration marks the end of the holy month of Ramzan. People started thronging shops which opened at 7am to sell essential items. With lockdown in place, the shops downed shutters at 11am but only after witnessing huge rush of people. Several shopkeepers were seen violating the curfew. Some vehicles were also seen plying on roads near Sabzibagh, Phulwarisharif, Alamganj, Shahganj and Raja Bazaar. Huge rush was seen at shops selling vermicelli or ‘seviyan’ and lachcha, grocery, bakery, milk, fruits, vegetables, chicken and meat. Owner of a bakery at Sabzibagh, Md Afsar Ali, said the customer footfall was much lower than the previous year. “Despite the nationwide lockdown, we had made good profit last year. However, the business was badly affected this time as shops are allowed to open for only five hours a day,” he said. Several bakeries in the city have increased the prices of ‘naan rotis’ and ‘bakarkhanees’. Shafi Khan, a shopkeeper at Haroon Colony, said they have reduced the workforce and increased the prices of bakery items. “Naan rotis, which were earlier available at Rs 20 to Rs 220, are now being sold between Rs 50 and Rs 300. There is also 5% rise in prices of ‘bakarkhanees’, ‘lachcha’ and ‘seviyan’,” he said. Makeshift stalls selling essential items, itar (perfume), head-cap, scarves, crockery, dates, bangles and henna had also cropped up at marketplaces. Aisha Jabeen (33), a resident of Shahganj, said she would celebrate the festival only with her family members this time. Governor, Nitish greet people: Governor Phagu Chauhan and CM Nitish Kumar on Thursday extended greetings to the people of state and country on the eve of Eid-ul-Fitr. In his message, the governor appealed to Muslims to follow the Covid-19 guidelines during Eid celebrations. “I wish the festival will bring health, prosperity, peace and prosperity in the lives of the people,” the governor said. The CM said in his message that the prayers offered by devotees in the month of Holy Ramadan will bring peace and prosperity to the state and the country. The CM wished peace and harmony would remain intact in the society and urged Muslims to offer Eid prayers at their homes and follow the Covid-19 protocols. Education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary said, “Eid is a day when people socialise with relatives and friends. However, under the present scenario, people should celebrate the festival at their homes.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/eid-shoppers-throng-patna-markets-despite-lockdown/articleshow/82612427.cms||Faryal Rumi

This isolation centre will be in addition to the already functional isolation centres of the district administration. GMC deputy mayor Akhauri Onkarnath alias Mohan Shrivastava said several big marriage halls in the town area, which are closed because of the lockdown, can be converted into isolation centres. “We have decided to convert such a marriage hall into isolation centres where adequate space and other facilities like sanitation and easy accessibility are available. Talks have been held with the owners of the marriage halls in this regard. We have also consulted some senior doctors and social activists, who are ready to provide their services at the proposed isolation centre. All facilities like oxygen, medicines, medical kit and the doctors will be made available at the isolation centre to ensure better care to the patients,” the deputy mayor said. He added: “We will seek permission from the government and the local administration to start the isolation centre.” Mayor Virendra Kumar alias Ganesh Paswan said: “The ongoing drive of GMC for the last 25 days has started paying results as the number of fresh positive cases have dropped in the past few days. As part of the drive each road, lane, house and the shop is being sanitized.” The district administration has already made isolation centres at Manpur (58 beds), ANM training schools at Tekari, Sherghati and Neemchak Bathani (70 beds each), ITI campus, Maigra (50 beds) and Gaya museum (65 beds) in Gaya town.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/gaya-civic-body-to-set-up-100-bed-isolation-centre/articleshow/82612408.cms||---

Today, towards the end of my shift, I video called the relatives of a patient who is not going to make it. We usual… https://t.co/8IrIMu0jIG— Doctor (@DipshikhaGhosh) 1620818139000On Wednesday, critical care doctor Dipshikha Ghosh of Apollo Gleneagles made a video call — like she had done many times during the year-long pandemic to connect critically ill patients with their family members on request. It helped them get closure. The calls were discreet and though some of them were very emotional, Ghosh had always been composed while handling them. But she wasn’t quite prepared for what happened in the ICU on Wednesday afternoon. She connected the 47-year-old Covid patient with her 25-year-old son. After inquiring about how she was, the son began to sing a popular Kishore Kumar number from the 1973 hit film ‘Aa Gale Lag Jaa’. The poignant moment is best described in the tweets she sent out a few minutes later. “Today, towards the end of my shift, I video called the relatives of a patient who is not going to make it. We usually do that in my hospital if it’s something they want. This patient’s son asked for a few minutes of my time,” she wrote. “He then sang a song for his dying mother. He sang ‘Tera Mujhse Hai Pehle Ka Naata Koi’. I just stood there holding the phone, looking at him looking at his mother and singing. The nurses came over and stood in silence. He broke down in the middle but finished the verse. He asked her vitals, thanked me and hung up,” Ghosh posted. “Me and the nurses stood there, shaking our heads, our eyes moist. The nurses went back one by one to their allocated patients and attended to them or the alarms of vents/dialysis units. This song is changed for us, for me at least. This song will always be theirs,” Ghosh wrote. The tweet went viral within minutes, with first tens, then hundreds and finally thousands applauding the doctor’s gesture and thanking her for succinctly sharing a touching farewell that so many bereaved families of Covid patients had missed. Till last count on Thursday evening, the post had been retweeted over 10,000 times, drawn nearly 40,000 likes and over 1,500 comments. “Read this piece twice. Sums up the pain and choked emot-ions. Good job doctor,” wrote one netizen. Many recounted how their inability to speak one last time with their loved one still haunted them. “The value of this call is too much. Thank u doctor. God give you strength and good health. Bow down,” wrote another person who had lost his mother as well. Yet another commented, “Wish I had such a doctor on duty when my mom died in ICU. Was refused to see her last time or hold her hand or say goodbye. Still hurts.” “Doctor by profession but lady by heart,” is how one Charitarth Tiwari described Ghosh. On duty in Covid ICU since last April, Ghosh has lost many patients to the virus, including in inexplicable deaths of young people in their 20s and 30s without co-morbidity in this second wave. She said something about the song in that poignant moment uncorked the emotions that had been bottled within her for long. “I later learnt it was their favourite song. I, too, have heard the song composed by R D Burman many times in the past. But now, to me and the rest of the team who were present in the ICU that day, this song will belong to the mother and her son,” she said. The patient passed away 12 hours after the video call.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/son-sings-to-dying-mother-tera-mujhse-hai-pehle-ka-naata-koi-/articleshow/82613339.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Business||Job market plunges in Apr after brief recovery in Jan-Mar||Chennai: Recovering from the pandemic’s first wave and the sudden onslaught of a second wave has led to the country’s job market plunging in April after showing positive trends in January to March 2021. Job openings declined an average 20%-25% month-on-month from March to April 2021, as per estimates from various HR firms and online job portals TOI spoke to. While IT and related sectors had an appetite to hire but struggled with recruitment formalities due to rising cases, hiring froze in aviation, manufacturing, retail, and hospitality sectors. New jobs such as lab technicians for short-term contracts, nurses and paramedics opened up in healthcare sectors. Hiring activity declined by 15% in April compared to March as per job portal Naukri.com’s monthly index. The job market across both metro and non-metro locations posted a double-digit sequential decline in April barring Kolkata that remained flat (0%) and Hyderabad and Kochi, where hiring declined only 4% and 5% respectively. “However, the current impact on the job market is less severe than what we saw in April 2020 given the lack of a strict nationwide lockdown where the Naukri JobSpeak index declined by 51% month-on-month,” Pawan Goyal, chief business officer, Naukri.com said. Talent demand declined 16% month-on-month in April with top industrial sectors all noting a double-digit drop, as per data from TimesJobs’ monthly index RecruiteX. Retail and infrastructure sectors suffered the steepest fall (28% each) month-on-month. Demand for talent shrunk least in the IT/telecom (10% fall) and healthcare (12%). Sanjay Goyal, business head, TimesJobs said operations in most sectors had started to recover in April but the Covid surge threw everything out of gear.Specialist HR firm Michael Page said April saw a dip in economic activity due to localized lockdowns but impact is unlikely to be as devastating as last year. "The ongoing second wave will only result in a short-term setback and the medium-term growth outlook remains stable for the rest of 2021.” Data from staffing firm Xpheno showed that active job openings in April recorded a 31% drop over March and stood at the lowest levels for 2021. The decline was also well above the fall witnessed from March to April 2020 when active jobs dropped by 18%. Active jobs accepting applications in April just touched the 200,000 mark as against 290,000 in March. Retail, entertainment and manufacturing is set to face a rough patch ahead, the firm’s analysis said. “Going by the addition of jobs in the last two weeks, we could well be staring at another slow month in May,” Kamal Karanth, founder, Xpheno, said. “Unless the next two weeks of May bring in some fresh cheer, we will witness a near replay of the drop in hiring action seen last year this time,” he added. HR firm Teamlease said that automobile, textile, telecom and other industrial sectors paused hiring in April. “Auto was picking up in March, but things turned downwards mid-April,” Kaushik Banerjee, VP & Business Head - Teamlease.com, said. As per the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), unemployment rate shot up from 6.5% in March to 8% in April due to partial lockdowns and the inability of the economy to create sufficient jobs. The labour participation rate (LPR) in April fell for the third consecutive month to 39.98%-- the lowest since May 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/job-market-plunges-in-apr-after-brief-recovery-in-jan-mar/articleshow/82613810.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

According to the Telangana State Development Planning Society figures up to 8.30am on Thursday, Asifnagar received highest rainfall of 35mm followed by 32.3mm in Shaikpet, 30.5mm in Chandulal Baradari and Manikonda, and 30mm in Langer House. Parts of the city started witnessing strong thunderstorm activity accompanied with gusty winds around 1am and continued till 4am. The sudden rainfall led to water-logging in parts of Nadeem Colony in Old City. Although it was cleared by morning hours, water-logging for residents of Nadeem Colony has become a perennial issue. Gusty winds uprooted trees in some parts of LB Nagar. “Even 10 minutes of rainfall leads to massive water logging in our area. During last monsoon, our areas suffered a lot due to unprecedented rains. Ahead of monsoon season, we hope the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation fixes the issue permanently,” said Rafeequddin, a resident of Nadeem Colony. Many areas such as Alkapur Township, Manikonda, Brindavan Colony, Shaikpet among others witnessed 5-10 hours of power outages. According to Southern Power Distribution Company of Telangana, momentary interruptions occurred in 57 feeders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rains-result-in-power-outages-water-stagnation/articleshow/82615488.cms||---

Due to low oxygen saturation, he had to be taken first on BiPAP and then ventilator. On Wednesday, he breathed his last at a private hospital in the city. The doctors treating him said he had a severe bout of coughing which proved to be fatal – his damaged lungs got ‘punctured’ due to the stress. Dr Rajesh Chandra Mishra, a city-based critical care specialist and president-elect of Indian Society of Critical Care Medicine, said the condition is identified as spontaneous pneumothorax in medical parlance. “In general terminology, it can be understood as a leak of air from lungs to the chest cavity or thorax. If it happens between lungs near the heart, it’s called pneumomediastinum,” he said. Reasons for this complication which is now being reported in ICUs across city is prolonged period on BiPAP which delivers high pressure oxygen to lungs and use of steroids. Key reasons for this complication which is now being reported in ICUs across the city is prolonged period on BiPAP which delivers high pressure oxygen to the lungs and use of steroids. “When patients are given oxygen with peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), the positive pressure weakens the lungs in absence of natural inhalation-exhalation process. The lungs slowly lose its elasticity,” he said. “Moreover, if the heavy doses of steroids such as methylprednisolone and dexamethasone are administered, it weakens the outer layer of lungs, increasing the chances of rupture.” International journals have indicated higher instances of spontaneous pneumothorax in Covid or Covid-recovered patients as majority patients with hypoxia where patients are given both oxygen with pressure and steroids. Dr Anil Jain, director of EPIC Hospital, said that the number of patients after Covid recovery with such complications has increased manifold during this wave. “It has near-fatal complications in the majority of the cases. The lungs not only get stiffer but also brittle in such a way that a hard sneeze or prolonged coughing can rupture the lungs,” he said. “For its treatment, experts drain out the air from the diaphragm using a pigtail catheter. They try to ensure that the lungs don’t lose their elasticity completely.” It’s also seen in some of the active Covid-19 patients, said Dr Amit Patel, a city-based pulmonologist. “The phenomenon is getting common among both active and former Covid patients due to the nature of the viral infection. It’s mostly seen in patients on BiPAP for long. If the patients’ condition allows, we advise and practice prone positioning in the early phase of infection,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/coronavirus-complications-puncturing-patients-lungs/articleshow/82617881.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Kolkata||Covishield gap of over 12 weeks may be stretching it too far, say experts||KOLKATA: Experts in Kolkata felt it would be stretching the gap too far if the break between the first and second doses of Covishield, was extended to 12 -16 weeks. The gap was recommended by a central panel on Thursday following some recent research findings. While a wait of up to three months (12 weeks) seemed plausible, going by findings in the run-up to the pandemic, some pointed out there was yet no concrete evidence to show either Covishield or Covaxin worked better when their twin doses were split by 12 weeks or more. Both Covishield and Covaxin had been recommended to be taken at a gap of four-six weeks at the start of the inoculation. For Covishield, the gap was later extended to six-eight weeks and now, to 12-16 weeks. The government panel, however, made no recommendation to extend the gap for Covaxin. A Lancet study on AstraZeneca in March had said “that the second dose of both vaccines (Pfizer and AstraZeneca) should be routinely scheduled between four and 12 weeks after the first vaccine. This will allow more people to benefit from the protection provided from the first dose during the roll-out phase…”. Serum Institute of India CEO Adar Poonawalla recently observed that the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine was 90% effective when applied at a gap of two-three months. Covishield is the Indian brand of the vaccine manufactured by Serum Institute under licence from AstraZeneca-Oxford. Poonawalla’s observation came at a time when millions across the country, including Bengal, waited for their second jabs. Some, like IPGMER professor Diptendra Sarkar, are sceptical about the protracted gap. The last Lancet study in March showed an increase in vaccine efficacy after two standard doses from 55.1% with an interval of less than 6 weeks to 81.3% with an interval of at least 12 weeks, Sarkar said. Spacing out vaccine doses allowed antibodies to form and act better, according to Peerless Hospital microbiologist Bhaskar Narayan Choudhuri. But, he, too, felt a gap of more than 12 weeks could be a little “too prolonged”. “The virus has started mutating and we are encountering several strains, including an Indian one. At this stage, a longer gap could be unwise.A third vaccine is on the anvil,” said Chaudhuri. He added studies of reports conducted at Peerless Hospital showed better results for one of the vaccines being administered. “We haven’t come across a single case of infection among people who received this vaccine where there have been several patients who have got Covid even after the second dose of the other vaccine,” said Chaudhuri. But some, like Fortis Hospital internal medicine consultant Joydeep Ghosh, felt delaying the second dose would be a win-win situation for recipients. Efficacy of the second shot was not affected by a few weeks’ delay, he said.  “In fact, better antibodies are produced that offer stronger immunity. Also, it will help ease out the crisis generated by the shortage of vaccines. Waiting a week to 10 days extra will help. But I won’t recommend a 16-week gap yet,” said Ghosh. What happens to those who got the shot earlier? Some experts felt it might make the antibodies lose potency earlier. The idea was to provide protection during the height of the pandemic, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/covishield-gap-of-over-12-weeks-may-be-stretching-it-too-far-say-experts/articleshow/82615010.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Kolkata||‘Longer vaccine gap may complicate logistics’||KOLKATA: The Union health ministry decision to accept a national expert committee recommendation on increasing the gap between two doses of Covishield from 6-8 weeks at present to 12-16 weeks could further complicate the logistics on vaccines, fear state officials dealing with the inoculation drive. The state received the intimation of the revised second dose recommendation on Thursday evening. The communication from Union health secretary has asked states to strictly adhere to the revised interval. This revision is not applicable to Covaxin. “We were waiting for this official communication on the changed protocol of the gap between the first and booster dose of Covishield. Now, we have to work out the dates and alert those who will come to the government-run Covid vaccination centres for their second doses. A gap of 12 to 16 weeks will mean between three and four months from the first dose,” said said a health department official. At present, the state is inoculating only those whose second doses are due in the 45-plus age group category, both for Covishield and Covaxin. Since the past few weeks, the state government has stopped the first dose vaccination in this priority group with the exception of healthcare and frontline workers who are still allowed to take the first dose if someone hasn’t. “The shortage of vaccine supply has forced us to prioritise second dose so people did not miss the scheduled dates for the second shot. With the new guideline for Covishield dose gap, there will be a lull for a month in the second dose. We might utilise this period to start offering the first dose again for the 45-plus age group. But that will depend on the vaccine supply. So we have to make a lot of calculation before we decide on this,” said the official. A study published in Lancet on March 6 said the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine shows greater efficacy if the second shot was administered 12 weeks after the first dose. The vaccine is manufactured under the brand Covishield by Serum Institute of India. Health experts said staggering the second dose would mean accommodating more people for the first jab. “The body starts developing antibodies in about two weeks of taking the first shot and it has been found in studies that antibody level is maintained till 16 weeks. If the second dose is delayed, it will serve two purposes—one, the total duration of protection will be longer, and two, the doses can be offered to people who are yet to get the first shot. I think this is a smart strategy,” said senior clinical trial specialist Santanu Tripathi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/longer-vax-gap-may-complicate-logistics/articleshow/82614949.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

On getting information, the district administration immediately swung into action and reached the spot. The bodies included those of a male of about 50-55 years and a boy of eight to 10 years. Both the bodies were fished out from the Ganga and cremated at Gulbi ghat electric crematorium, said Patna DM Chandrashekhar Singh. The DM said on inquiry it appeared that the bodies had reached the Gulbi Ghat after traveling from some distance and they appeared to be old and partly decomposed. “An intensive patrolling of the entire stretch of the Ganga right from Didarganj to Digha was carried out by a team of the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), but no further body was found floating in the river anywhere,” Singh said. Meanwhile, in reply to a tweet by Union jalshakti minister Gajendra Singh Shehawat, state water resources minister Sanjay Kumar Jha said the way dozens of bodies have been found loating in the Ganga is really inhuman and also an insult to the sacred river. “The Centre should find out from where these bodies have come from. The Bihar government would extend its full cooperation in this work,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/2-bodies-found-floating-in-ganga-at-gulbi-ghat/articleshow/82612706.cms||B K Mishra

A viral video of a 29-year-old man being forced to buy blood for his mother despite arranging donors has further exposed the menace. Anoop Kumar, whose video went viral on Thursday, told TOI over the phone on Thursday his mother Urmila Devi had a liver problem and extreme deficiency of haemoglobin and needed a blood transfusion at PMCH. “Initially we in the family donated blood. When the need exceeded, we told the doctor about our financial status and he mentioned in the callbook to provide blood to us from the blood bank,” said Anup, who had come from a small village in Dagdishpur block in Bhojpur district. His father is a tea seller and his elder brother a private school teacher. However, Anup’s trouble did not end here. When he went with the prescription of the doctor to the blood bank, he was denied blood and the staff instead told him to talk to one Shashi Kant, a tout standing outside the blood bank. “Initially I bought blood from him, I have proof of Rs 32,000 which I paid through Google pay, but the rest of the money paid in cash has no account,” Anup said. He even managed to get three donors later on, but all were sent away by the PMCH staff. “In two cases they said the donors do not have sufficient haemoglobin. They claimed this without even testing the blood sample. In the third case they said they cannot exchange the blood,” said Anup, who even filed a complaint to the superintendent in this regard. PMCH superintendent Dr IS Thakur through a text message informed TOI that show cause has been initiated against the staff concerned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/viral-video-shows-blood-sold-in-black-at-pmch/articleshow/82612563.cms||Sheezan Nezami

According to religious belief, purchasing jewellery made from gold, silver or other precious metal on the occasion of Akshay Tritiya is considered to be auspicious. Every year, on Akshaya Tritiya, devotees used to throng the Vishnupad temple to have darshan of the footprints of Lord Vishnu at the sanctum sanctorum. But this year too, the temple is closed. Gaya Bullion Association president Sanjay Verma said, “The situation is similar to previous year when jewellery shops did not open due to lockdown. Normally, people purchase jewellery for wedding purpose and jewellers were expecting good sale on Akshaya Tritiya this year. But as shops are closed, sale of jewellery even during the wedding season has been badly affected.” “The association has 180 registered members. Apart from the members, there are nearly 500 shops in Gaya town, excluding showrooms of branded jewellery. Though losses to the tune of more than Rs5 crore is estimated, the association is in full support of the lockdown,” Verma added. Central Bihar Chamber of Commerce former president-cum-patron Kaushlendra Pratap said, “The ongoing lockdown due to Covid – 19 pandemic has spoiled almost all the business except that of essential commodities whether it is retail, wholesale or the banking sector. As the market is closed, sale-purchase of almost all the goods has dropped to such extent that businessmen are struggling for survival. But inducing lockdown is the need of the hour. People will have to understand and have patience by following the guidelines till the situation improves.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/akshaya-tritiya-lockdown-to-hit-jewellery-biz-worth-rs-5cr-in-gaya/articleshow/82612528.cms||---

In an appeal to CM Nitish Kumar, Ranjan said her husband is a critical diabetic patient and was also operated upon recently for gall-bladder, which has made him vulnerable to infection. Pappu, a former MP, had represented Purnia and Madhepura in the Lok Sabha. Even as the outbreak of the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic started in April, the state government imposed statewide 11-day lockdown from May 5, which was extended to May 25 on Thursday. In between, Pappu had become very active helping the needy and the distraught patients. He had also highlighted how the ambulances purchased by BJP’s Saran MP Rajiv Pratap Rudy with the MPLAD fund were kept on the campus of a voluntary group at Amnour in Saran district. Ranjeet, who arrived here from Delhi on Thursday, said, “The jails are short of facilities and the Supreme Court has also asked not to arrest people during the pandemic, besides asking the government to decongest the jails. If my husband turns corona positive in the jail, people of the state will not forgive the CM.” Ranjeet said CM Nitish Kumar, BJP, Rudy and others concerned (like medicinal drugs and oxygen cylinder ‘mafia’) have been playing “jail-jail, politics-politics and lobby-lobby games” as a result of which Pappu was arrested. She also alleged that hordes of staff of Rudy work at his various private establishments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ranjan-threatens-fast-unto-death-if-pappu-is-not-released-in-2-days/articleshow/82612420.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Patna||Rural Bihar gasps as Covid spreads tentacles in villages||PATNA: A fall in the overall positivity rate may have come as a relief amid the raging Covid second wave, but this deadly virus seems to have spread its tentacles deep inside rural Bihar, where the awareness of this disease is low, and the healthcare facilities are inadequate even in the best of times. To make matters worse, people in the countryside have to depend on local quacks for treatment. Unaware of the symptoms of Covid-19, villagers ignore fever, cough and other manifestations till the condition gets serious, and then they end up with the quacks who, in some cases, are known to have given typhoid medications. "More than 90% of villagers here are going to quacks. Only a handful are consulting an MBBS or a qualified physician," said Shashi Kant Tripathi of Kayamnagar village in Bhojpur district. Tripathy, however, added that there is some awareness regarding the vaccination now. Bablu Pathak, a social worker from Birampur village, said, "Many villagers here just shrug off any suggestion to consult a physician if they suffer from cough and cold or fever. They prefer to go to the village quack. Many of them have vaccine hesitancy too." Recently, leader of opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav shared data on his social media stating 76% of the infected cases in Bihar were from rural areas. Even the Union health ministry on Thursday tweeted that there were at least seven districts in Bihar that have over 20% positivity rate and another 26 districts with over 10% positivity rate. Buxar DM Aman Samir on Thursday stated that out of 1,033 active patients of Covid-19 in the district, 60% are from rural areas and the remaining 40% from urban areas. Rajesh Kumar of Bangaon village in Sitamarhi said nearly 50% of villagers have had a fever recently. "While a few are getting isolated and taking medicines, including vitamin C and other tablets. Several give lame excuses," said Rajesh, adding, how his neighbour refused to admit he had Covid and later, he passed away. Raju, a resident of Harijan Tola on the outskirts of Chiksi village, said, at least 20 people were suffering from fever and a few deaths have occurred. "It must be because of Covid-19, but no one will accept," Raju added. When asked if anyone in his neighbourhood had an oximeter, he said, "I don't know what you are talking about." In Begusarai, almost all 18 blocks are getting positive cases every day. A businessman from Bakhri Bazar locality, Rajesh Agarwal, said there was an alarming situation in many villages especially, Ratan and Salona where at least a dozen of people have died. In Sameli block in Katihar, Dr U K Sinha, medical officer (MO) of the primary health centre, said, "Migrant workers coming from other states, and somehow reaching their villages, evading the rapid antigen test at transit points, are infecting others." Dr Musharraf, the medical officer of Barari CH), which is also a dedicated Covid health centre (DCHC) with 40 oxygen beds, Covid-related deaths were occurring in the villages, but caseload is gradually decreasing. In Aurangabad district, the worst affected areas are Deo, Goh, Obra, Navinagar and Madanpur. Up to a week ago, 300 to 400 cases were being reported daily from these areas. Gaya Prasad, a resident of Pateya village in Madanpur, said because of bad experiences at government health facilities, people were taking medicines at home.

---||Patna||Patna: Home isolation leads to rise in biomedical waste generation||PATNA: The biomedical waste collection from households in the city has increased in the last couple of weeks with the rise in Covid cases. Large quantity of disposable masks, gloves, syringe, cannulas and other medical waste have been making their way to regular garbage piles as several infected people and some having Covid symptoms are getting treated under home isolation. Devendra Prasad Tiwari, additional commissioner of Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC), said of about 1,000 metric tonnes of waste being collected from households per day in the six circles – Azimabad, Bankipore, Kankarbagh, New Capital, Patliputra and Patna City – 6-7% are biomedical waste. “As the Covid-19 cases have increased, the medical waste has also surged. Masks and gloves have been provided to the PMC workers as well. The civic body has also provided black bin bags to sanitary workers engaged in door-to-door waste collection for collecting biomedical waste. These bags are being kept separately in auto-tipper,” Tiwari said. He added as per the protocol, all the waste materials get transported to the landfill site in Ramachak Bariya where they are disposed of by incinerators. “The medical waste incinerator has been installed by Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences at the landfill site,” he added. Some ward councillors said the quantity of biomedical would be much higher as many people do not follow the biomedical waste protocol and mix the bio-waste with other household waste. As per the district administration’s data, of the 19,316 active Covid patients in the district, 80% are under home isolation. The civic body has urged the people to keep the used medical waste in separate garbage bags as mixing biomedical waste with household garbage would put the lives of sanitary workers at risk. Patna Nagar Nigam Staff Union’s president Chandra Prakash said of every 100 households, only 2-3 are following the protocol of biomedical waste. “We have urged the PMC commissioner and Patna mayor to start isolation centres for sanitary workers and provide more safety gears to them. However, our demands have not been fulfilled yet,” he added. Prakash said the civic body has around 8,000 sanitation workers. Ram Babu, who collects garbage from Kankarbagh circle, said the sanitary workers should get incentives apart from all safety gears. “There is constant fear of getting infected as we come in direct contact with all used items of Covid-9 patients,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/home-isolation-leads-to-rise-in-biomedical-waste-generation/articleshow/82612384.cms||Faryal Rumi

The contractual employees had gone on an indefinite strike from Wednesday after several of their demands were not met by the state government. The health employees were aggrieved that the state government had not fulfilled their demand of providing a cover of Rs 50 lakh life insurance and medical insurance facilities but is continuously taking work from them as regular employees with a meagre salary. Due to this, they are forced to collect money to assist anyone who falls ill and the family of those who fell prey to Covid. State government additional advocate general Anjani Kumar had filed the IA in the PIL of Shivani Kaushik late in the night on Wednesday urging the high court to declare the strike illegal and show-cause them as they can’t refrain from discharging their duties and function amid the present pandemic situation. Taking a serious note of this IA, the division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Kumar on Thursday morning and issued notice to four office-bearers of the federation for appearing before the high court virtually. The federation office bearers represented by Vijay Kumari Singh assured the court of resuming work but aired their anguish that they had gone on strike last year too but called it off as the high court had directed the state government to form a committee to look into their grievances. The court was appraised that the committee never submitted its report to the state government for fulfilling their demands. The bench then directed the state government to file a reply by June 21. HC on Black fungus drugs: The division bench of the Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Kumar while hearing PILs of Shivani Kaushik, Rohit Kumar and Gaurav Kumar Singh orally directed the state government on Thursday to apprise on Monday about the availability of drugs for black fungus disease in Covid-19 patients reported so far. HC on seized cylinders, medicines: The Patna high court has issued direction to all functionaries to release case properties, mainly oxygen cylinders, regulators and drugs as per law seized from persons black-marketing them. Pointing at subordinate courts, the high court observed that it sees no reason why such proceedings are not conducted virtually considering the case properties are vital for saving human life. Around 350 oxygen cylinders besides regulators, drugs like Remdesivir injection, more than 4000 testing kits and other items have been seized across the state in the last few weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/27000-contractual-health-staff-end-strike-after-hc-intervention/articleshow/82612360.cms||Debashish Karmakar

When the matter was posted on IIM Calcutta’s alumni network, Gautam Khanna, CEO of PD Hinduja Hospital, who is also from IIM-C, ensured that the two elderly women got quickly vaccinated. Similar is the case with former Facebook India MD Kirthiga Reddy, who lives in the US and was keen that her mother in Chennai got her second vaccination dose. She received help from the Chennai chapter of IIM-C with its president J Balaraman of Congruent Solutions ensuring the task was accomplished within a day through a vaccination camp he had organised. The Chennai Chapter is said to have become a “go to” group for people needing information or help on vaccination locations, oxygen concentrators, hospital beds and even domestic help for elderly relatives. Shiv Shivakumar, Aditya Birla Group’s executive president (corporate strategy & business development) and who’s an alumnus of IIM-C, said, “Since most professionals work outside their hometowns, they are away from their personal networks. In times like these, it is their alumni networks and professional networks which help them the most.”  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); Many such alumni networks are active, especially during the second wave of the pandemic which has put immense pressure on the healthcare system, given the rising number of cases. When a batch mate of Rituparna Chakraborty, co-founder of TeamLease Services, was struggling to find a plasma donor, their alumni network of Goa Institute of Management was able to find a solution within a few hours. “It was also nothing short of a miracle that he found an ICU bed, all due to the efforts put in by the network,” said Chakraborty. “At critical times when systems fail to work, alumni networks are working round the clock and have become an effective channel of help for many of us. Alumni groups have powerful global networks too. Several members are located outside India and are desperate to help people here. Help is not restricted to your own alumni network, but network of networks which are helping out people who may be facing any kind of exigency at a time when on-ground support may have gone missing,” says Chakraborty. Vinaya Bansal, an alumnus of Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology, said he has seen active conversations in the alumni network on help that can be provided to those in need with spreadsheets being drawn up on possible donors of plasma, food packs and medicines. Chakraborty said alumni networks are also more trustworthy and reliable and there’s a genuine intent when it comes to information that goes out, given that there may be fake information floating online.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/distress-call-to-alumni-help-mom-back-home/articleshow/82613964.cms||Namrata Singh

---||Surat||After high court rap, trustee booked for fire that killed 18||Surat: Following Gujarat High Court’s rap asking the state government to act against persons responsible for the fire at Welfare Hospital in Bharuch on May 1 that killed 18 people, Bharuch police on Wednesday night booked the president of Bombay Patel Welfare Society, Khalid Patel, in this connection. The midnight inferno that engulfed the entire Covid-19 treatment facility at the hospital claimed lives of 16 patients, mostly on ventilators, and two trainee nurses. During investigation, police found several instances of negligence and gross violations on part of the hospital which led to the fire. Police said that along with Patel, if other trustees or any other person too will be found involved, they too will be booked under sections 304-A (causing death due to negligence), 336 (act endangering life or personal safety of others), 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) and 114 (abetment) of Indian Penal Code. Police also concluded that the cause of fire was a spark in the cable of a ventilator placed near bed 5 in ICU-1. Cops said that Charmi Gohil, one of the injured trainee nurses said in her statement that around 12.45 am on May 1 when deceased trainee nurse Fariga Khatun had gone near bed 5 to dispose her used gloves, her PPE kit’s shoes caught fire and she started to shout. Gohil went to her rescue, but her kit caught fire too. On hearing the duo shouting for help, another trainee nurse Madhvi Padhiyar, who too had succumbed, rushed to their help. When Padhiyar’s PPE kit caught fire, she and Khatun rushed to the bathroom, while Gohil rushed out to the lobby and was saved. Meanwhile, lights went off and the fire was spreading in ICU-1. Sixteen patients from Bharuch, Surat and Vadodara were later found dead inside the ward either from burns or severe asphyxiation caused by smoke. The regional fire officer Dipak Makhijani also told the police that the hospital did not have any fire-fighting equipment. There were just three to four fire extinguishers which no one knew how to use, he said. Bharuch Ankleshwar Urban Development Authority (BAUDA) also confirmed that it had not granted building use permission for the construction where Covid-19 patients were being treated. The building had 48 ICU beds divided into three different ICU units where 41 patients were being treated. One patient was also being treated in isolation facility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/after-high-court-rap-trustee-booked-for-fire-that-killed-18/articleshow/82612624.cms||---

Brass prices are up 40% while that of polymers are up 300%. Sanitaryware makers had increased the prices first in August last year by 3% to 5% and the second during February by 5% to 7% at the retail end. “Competitors have increased prices, but we are holding on for now. If raw material prices continue to rise we have no choice but to increase prices, but that may happen at the end of June,” said K E Ranganathan, MD of Roca Parryware. Other commodities that are used by the sanitaryware industry — including Zamac (up 20%) and stainless steel ( up 25%) — have also seen a rise over the past 12 months. “The advantages of having a powerful brand like Cera provides pricing power and customer and trade pull factors, which is why we always stay one step ahead of raw material behaviour. Another price rise may take place in the near future and is under discussion,” said Ayush Bagla, director, Cera Sanitaryware. Parryware is operating all its plants currently. “While the big retail markets shut due to Covid induced local lockdowns, our production schedule is going on uninterrupted. We believe when we come out of this second wave the demand pull will be steep and significant. We plan to operate our factories fully till June and then take a call based on the prevailing pandemic situation,” Ranganathan added. “While construction activities are subdued or stopped in many markets owing to Covid induced lockdowns, the moment there is clarity on containment of the pandemic, construction activity could witness heightened action as the need for houses and dwelling units will increase, pushing up the demand for sanitaryware products,” a Credai member said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/taps-and-faucets-set-to-turn-dearer/articleshow/82613801.cms||Rajesh Chandramouli

The safe house has been set up with the initiative of Rajarhat Gopalpur Trinamool MLA Aditi Munshi. BMC officials said that due to shortage of vaccine supply, they can only run a few vaccination centres on a regular basis. “From about 170 to 180 vials earlier, we are now receiving only about 35 vials of vaccine,” said a BMC official. New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) on Wednesday opened its second walk-in RT-PCR testing centre at the New Town fair ground in association with a private healthcare organization. NKDA is also operating a free rapid antigen test centre from 10am to 1pm daily. NKDA is also compiling a list of construction workers and hawkers for the vaccination drive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bidhannagar-gets-safe-home-2-more-on-cards/articleshow/82613388.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||Goa||Government’s excuse for oxygen deaths: No ‘expert’ to reverse tractor||PANAJI: The state government told the Bombay high court on Thursday—the day 15 Covid patients died at Goa Medical College due to interrupted oxygen supply—that the deaths were due to a delay in replacing oxygen cylinders as they didn’t have an “expert tractor driver” capable of manoeuvring the tractor carrying the cylinders in a small pathway in reverse gear to unload it. The court highlighted the grim picture by stating that 419 Covid deaths have taken place at GMC from May 1 to May 12, and that several took place between 2am and 6am that are directly attributable to logistical issues. “We are completely down seeing these figures. There is admitted deficiency and admitted technical and logistical glitches,” the bench said. It said it was pained that “such a mighty” state couldn’t find a solution. Slamming the state government for its failure to sort out “logistical issues”, a bench of justices M S Sonak and Nitin W Sambre said: “You have to prevail upon all officers that these are not acceptable reasons … that we could not get a tractor, couldn’t get a driver, technicians, we couldn’t get a spanner … For these kinds of reasons if people are going to die, it is not acceptable. “Power doesn’t exist in isolation. Along with power comes responsibility, accountability, but right now we don’t want to go into issues because we want to save lives.” “We are not concerned with economics here but with life,” it said, adding that the government may lose crores but at this point it is “losing lives”. On Wednesday, the HC, hearing a slew of PILs on Covid mismanagement, including oxygen shortages, had directed the state government to ensure there were no more deaths due to interruption in oxygen supply at GMC. “It’s not even a shortage of oxygen, only logistical issues. How long can this continue. We expected that yesterday (Wednesday) itself there wouldn’t be a single death on account of logistical issues and tonight also,” the court said. Health secretary Ravi Dhawan said the system at GMC is “archaic”, where the changeover takes place from one trolley to another and “nozzles are removed from one trolley and put onto another trolley” during which time the pressure dips. He said the driver bringing in the trolley “got stuck in the pathway” and that this pathway “can only bring in one tractor in reverse position”. The bench said that it thought tractors were only used in the fields and didn’t realise these were actual agricultural tractors. The advocate general agreed with the bench that it was “"disgusting”. The court said it was “not at all impressed” by the state government’s explanation for the delay in refilling oxygen because a tractor got stuck due to want of an expert driver and asked the government point blank why it couldn’t find a solution to a “technical problem” with all the “paraphernalia of the cabinet, IAS officers, technicians and MTS staff” available to it. “Advocate general, you are also part of our institution, both of us can’t give them solutions on whether the tractor should go in this way or that way. That is something they will have to find out,” the court said. It also said that it was “shameful” that the oxygen cylinder could not be replaced in time as a result of “technical issues” and repeatedly sought to know what solutions the government could offer to ensure this didn’t recur. “You have to find some solution. If you cannot find out then we are really sorry to say that (sic),” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govts-excuse-for-o2-deaths-no-expert-to-reverse-tractor/articleshow/82619336.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Hyderabad||No coercive steps against NFCL: HC||Hyderabad: A vacation bench comprising Justice G Sridevi and Justice A Abhishek Reddy on Thursday directed IDBI, ICICI, SBI, UCO and other banks not to take any coercive steps against Nagarjuna Fertilizers and Chemicals Ltd and its directors. The company, which took Rs 1,675 crore loans from the banks, was dragged to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) by the lenders. According to Vikram Poserla, counsel for the company, a debt resolution plan was approved by the committee of lenders and the tribunal to ensure that the company revives and functions normally. It was agreed to bring in Indian Farmers Fertilizers Cooperative Limited (IFFCO) and Indian Potash Limited (IPL) as investors with a 26 per cent stake in the company as part of the plan. Later, the lenders’ committee took a U-turn and decided to approach the NCLT seeking initiation of insolvency process against the company. Senior counsel D Prakash Reddy, who appeared for the NFCL, said that they were aggrieved by the decision of the lenders who refused to consider the case of the company which produces urea for the farming sector. A single judge earlier dismissed the plea of the company and asked it to air its grievances before the NCLT instead. Unable to accept this order, the company preferred an appeal. The bench, while issuing notices to the banks and posting the matter to July for further hearing, asked the banks not to take any coercive steps against NFCL in the mean time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-coercive-steps-against-nfcl-hc/articleshow/82615548.cms||---
---||Pune||HC seeks PMC reply on crematorium pollution plea||Mumbai/Pune: The Bombay high court (HC) on Thursday adjourned a petition filed by a Pune resident over concerns of air pollution in the vicinity of crematoriums located within the city. The HC bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni placed the petition on May 19 to enable Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) counsel Abhijit Kulkarni to place its affidavit in reply on record. The public interest litigation (PIL) filed by a man, who said he is a retired civil engineer, stated that there is a ‘lot of load on the crematorium situated near SM Joshi Hall, Navi Peth, Pune’ and the additional load had been leading to increased pollution in the surrounding environment due to the constant smoke. His counsel Asim Sarode with Ajinkya Udane had sought an urgent order as he sought to submit that some crematoriums in the city were handling 80-100 last rites everyday causing pollution. The court then asked the petitioner what he had been doing for so long. The Central Pollution Control Board had laid down norms for disposal of dead bodies and the HC asked PMC counsel Kulkarni what steps the civic body had undertaken for implementation of the norms put forward by the board. The HC remarked that the crematoriums are sometimes situated in thickly populated residential areas of urban areas. Navi Peth residents want facility to move elsewhere The increased load at Vaikunth crematorium at Navi Peth has raised concerns among those residing in the vicinity. Residents have demanded that the crematorium be shut down as soon as possible and shifted to a less inhabited area of the city. “The crematorium is a major concern for our health and should be closed down. We have come to know that more cremation facilities are going to be installed at the premises, which will lead to even serious problems for us. We oppose this move,” said local resident Vikrant Latkar. “Many residents are facing issues due to this facility. Now, the bodies of patients, who have died due to Covid-19, are also cremated here. This is causing even more concern for us,” said Suresh Naik, another resident. Officials from Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) said, on an average, 40 bodies were cremated every day at the facility before the pandemic. Since the civic administration has allowed cremation of people, who have died of Covid-19, the number of cremations has increased to 75. “We are taking proper care of the crematorium. Eco-friendly material is being used for cremation of bodies here. Due diligence is done before and after cremation of bodies to avoid pollution,” said Shrinivas Kandul, a senior official of the PMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hc-seeks-pmc-reply-on-crematorium-pollution-plea/articleshow/82615578.cms||---
---||Nagpur||In Covid, FDCM transfers 57 forest guards, violates GR||Nagpur: The Forest Development Corporation of Maharashtra (FDCM) is once again in the eye of a storm, for transferring 57 forest guards. Ajay Patil, president, Maharashtra State Forest Guards and Promoted Foresters Union, said the transfers during Covid-19 pandemic are in complete violation of state government directions. On May 3, chief general manager (CGM) Rishikesh Ranjan issued an order to transfer 57 forest guards on administrative ground in five FDCM division – Nagpur, Bhandara, Gondia, Yavatmal, and Kinwat. Patil said last year the government had allowed transfers till August 2020. From August till May 9, 2021, no new transfer guidelines were issued. As several departments were inquiring about directions on transfers, on May 10, 2021, the general administrative department (GAD) issued a GR clarifying that considering the spread of Covid-19, no employees should be transferred till June 30, 2021. “Only transfers allowed were posts that have fell vacant post-retirement, posts which are essential to arrest the spread of Covid-19, and thirdly transfer of employees against whom there are serious charges and complaints,” the GAD has clarified. Yet, FDCM transferred forest guards dubbing them as administrative urgency. However, Patil asks, “When working is not in full swing due to Covid, what is the urgency?” CGM Ranjan said, “Though the order was issued on May 3, we are making it effective from July 1. These guards were posted at one place for six years and hence transfers were necessary. There were 109 guards due for transfer but we shifted only 57.” However, Ranjan also admitted that those willing to join new places of postings are free to go. Patil said, “Coronavirus is showing dangerous trend in rural areas. Besides, there are travel restrictions and other problems. Forest employees too are vulnerable to Covid-19 and under such a situation the transfer order should be scrapped. It smacks of vested interest.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/in-covid-fdcm-transfers-57-forest-guards-violates-gr/articleshow/82617812.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Goa||Muslims turn Eid celebrations into charity work||Vasco: On Friday, volunteers of Islamic organisations working to help people during the pandemic will greet Covid patients and their families on the occasion of Eid with fruits and messages. The state saw a sharp increase in the number of cases from the month of April when the second wave hit, and these organisations have been involved in various community services, especially as an act of worship during Ramadan. Though the United Arab Emirates and United Kingdom celebrated Eid-Ul-Fitr on Thursday, India will be celebrating Eid on Friday, the first day of Shawwal, the tenth month of the lunar-based Islamic calendar. The Humanitarian Relief Society and Students Islamic Organisation (SIO) are among those reaching out to the underprivileged who have been hit by the pandemic “Since the past 15 days we have been distributing around 150 food packets in the afternoon and 250 in the evening outside the Goa Medical College along with water to the relatives of patients. We also distribute 30-40 packets per meal outside the Chicalim sub district hospital, 50-60 packets outside the Mapusa hospital, and 20-30 packets outside the South Goa district hospital,” president of SSI, Suheb Ahmed Naik said. On Friday, the organisation has decided to give fruits along with ‘get well soon’ messages to patients to boost their morale. “Muslims are more generous in the month of Ramadan and we have to follow the spirit throughout the year,” he said. This year saw Muslims donated wholeheartedly to organisations helping the needy during the pandemic and lockdown. Naik said that they have a call centre to monitor those home isolated and to reach out to their needs. The SIO has helped with six funerals of Covid deceased. The Muslims have to compulsorily part with a sum of their earnings called as ‘Zakat’ in the month of Ramadan annually. The New Vaddem Sunni Youth Association along with Muskan Travels has organised four cars to operate as ambulance service for Covid patients. The association’s president, Rizwan Khan said, “In Ramadan we are encouraged to do charity and the reward is assured with Allah, the Almighty. We thought using these vehicles for a social cause would be the best form of charity.” Eid-Ul-Fitr is the first day of the Islamic month of Shawwal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/muslims-turn-eid-celebrations-into-charity-work/articleshow/82617839.cms||Ruvina Khan
---||Delhi||Narcos... Delhi chapter: Rs 275-crore drugs seized||NEW DELHI: Following leads emerging from the investigation of the blast outside the Israel embassy in January this year, Delhi Police’s Special Cell stumbled upon a huge Taliban-led drug cartel pumping in grade-A heroin into India. Contraband weighing 54kg and worth over Rs 275 crore in the international market has been recovered and five men have been arrested. With the US forces on their way out of Afghanistan, apparently several new poppy-heroin processing modules have become operational. Gunny sacks and garments soaked in heroin are being sent to Delhi-NCR and seasoned chemical experts arrive on medical visas to execute the complex heroin reconstitution operations at scattered locations in the region. Police Commissioner S N Shrivastava is learnt to have formed a special investigation team to disrupt this cross-border narco-terror network. DCP Pramod Kushwaha said that the arrested men were Altaf Darji and Abid Hussain Sultan from Srinagar in Jammu and Kashmir and Hashmat Mohammadi, Tifal Naukhej and Abdullah Najibullah from Afghanistan. “A narcotics reconstitution factory in Batla House a rea in southeast Delhi has also been unearthed," Sultan said. Special Cell had been trailing a number of cartels associated with Afghanistan when it was tipped off about Mehrajuddin, a codenamed conduit of a Kashmir-based narco-module who frequently visited Delhi-NCR for carpet trade. Developing this intel bore fruits on May 2 when an intelligence input revealed Mehrajuddin's real name was Altaf Darji and that he was coming to Ashoka Road to deliver a consignment. A special team formed under ACP Lalit Mohan Negi and Hriday Bhushan monitored the road. The team apprehended Darji, who had been living in Zakir Nagar, with 4.5kg of heroin. Based on Darji’s disclosures during questioning, a second raid led to the arrest of Sultan and confiscation of 12kg of contraband. "With two initial accused, both of them permanent residents of Srinagar in Kashmir, in custody, the ambit of investigation was widened. Sustained confrontations of the arrested with the evidence revealed the existence of an entity named Haji, who was sending the contraband to India through carriers,” DCP Kushwaha said. The contraband was being reconstituted and refined using chemicals being supplied by a character named Lakha from Amritsar, Punjab. The first concrete involvement of Afghani presence in this module surfaced in the name of Mohammadi, a Zakir Nagar resident, and he was arrested with 5kg of heroin. His interrogation revealed that the contraband was being sourced from Kasim, his brother, and one Haji. Both Kasim and Haji are based in Afghanistan. Mohammadi also disclosed that a reconstitution factory was operating in Zakir Nagar, which was exposed during a raid led by inspector Vinod Badola at a house in F-Block, Batla House. The cops recovered 29.5kg contraband there. The house belonged to Naukhej, who was arrested as well. Another raid was conducted in Wazirabad and Abdullah was nabbed with 3.2kg of heroin. Examination of the digital footprint to the identification of several Italian and African nodes of the network, which are under surveillance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/narcos-delhi-chapter-rs-275-crore-drugs-seized/articleshow/82615572.cms||Raj Shekhar
---||Delhi||Delhi: 900 inmates on 3-month parole to decongest Tihar Jail||NEW DELHI: Around 900 inmates of Tihar Jail were granted an emergency parole of three months and released on Friday as part of a massive drive to decongest overcrowded prisons in Delhi in the wake of the Covid pandemic. Sources said the 90-day parole was only granted to inmates who had used it last year and later came back without any adverse report. Director general (prisons) Sandeep Goyal said all possible steps were being taken to ensure welfare of inmates inside the jail. Tihar Jail is currently running at almost double the capacity, with nearly 20,000 inmates against the sanctioned strength of around 10,000. At least 1,200 inmates will be freed as part of the decongestion drive. Last year, 1,184 convicts were released on emergency parole, of which 112 did not return yet. Similarly, 5,500 undertrials were released on interim bail by courts, of which only around 2,000 returned. This became a challenge for the police as many of those who did not return were caught committing crimes again. Such criminals, Tihar officials said, won’t be released again. Inmates have been identified for release based on a set of criteria agreed upon by various stakeholders, including the Delhi Police. Tihar administration went on alert a fortnight ago with active Covid cases crossing the 300 mark. At least 227 inmates had tested positive and were recovering apart from at least 60 staff members, officials said. The women’s jail also recorded around 45 cases. Between mid-March and mid-April, around 70 inmates and 11 staff members had tested positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of prisoners affected to 190 and prison staff affected to 304. Cases rose quickly from mid-April. Even inmates in high-security cells, such as Chhota Rajan, had tested positive, apart from others like Mohammad Shahabuddin and Umar Khalid. While Shahabuddin died, the other two recovered and have now returned to jail. The spurt in cases, however, prompted the officials to initiate the decongestion drive again. The cops sent out requests to mass vaccinate the inmates. Tihar DG has also ordered that all precautionary measures be taken and a mandatory check-up for those above 60 who are lodged in prisons be carried out every day across prisons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/900-inmates-on-3-month-parole-to-decongest-tihar/articleshow/82643610.cms||---

According to Shadnagar ACP Ch Kushalkar, truck driver Balakishan Singh’s family has a dispute with his cousins, Niranjan Singh and Rajesh Singh about sharing of nine acres of land in Medigadda near Amangal. Currently, Niranjan and Rajesh have possession of the land and they leased it to a tenant farmer for cultivation. As Balakishan was not allowing the tenant farmer to harvest the crop, he sought Niranjan’s help. Niranjan and Rajesh along with few of their associates including E Sandeep, 26, an unemployed came to their fields in Medigadda. “Balakishan came to know about it and he reached the spot in his truck with his relatives. After an argument, Balakishan rammed his truck into the two parked cars of the victims and when Sandeep tried to intervene, he fell on the road and the truck ran over him,” the ACP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/six-held-for-killing-a-man/articleshow/82615586.cms||---
---||Pune||Cops step up action to curb movement without reasons||Pune: Joint commissioner of police Ravindra Shisve and other senior officers are leading teams over the past one week in checking vehicles found moving without any purpose at various checkpoints across the city. The police have intensified the enforcement of curbs on public movement as part of the prevailing Covid-19 restrictions. One can feel the intense monitoring at the nakabandi points, especially during late afternoon and evening hours. The police are also collecting fines of Rs500 each from the motorists if found in violation of Covid norms and the lockdown-like restriction orders issued by the state government. “The number of Covid-19 cases has waned in the city in the past 15 days and, due to this, everyone was feeling at ease. This is wrong. The number of Covid cases is still high in the city. And if we neglect it, the numbers might increase. We cannot be complacent about it,” Shisve said. “About seven days ago, I noticed that the number of punitive cases against the motorists moving on the roads without any valid reasons has gone down to about 1,000 per day, especially in April. Following this, an action was undertaken and we started executing strict nakabandi operation at all 98 points. Now, we are penalizing around 4,500 motorists a day for being on the roads without any valid reason,” he said.“Many people are not wearing masks and are violating the social distancing norms while on the roads or visiting any shops. We are taking action against these individuals at large now,” Shisve said. “People should adhere to the restrictions and Covid-appropriate behaviour. We don’t feel happy to fine people but at the same time, we do not want that due to inappropriate behaviour of the people, the number of Covid cases to surge again,” he said.“The policemen at the nakabandi operations are risking their lives and every day facing arguments of the motorists. I would like to appeal the people at large not to argue with the policemen at the nakabandi points,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cops-step-up-action-to-curb-movement-without-reasons/articleshow/82615609.cms||---

The move has enraged a section of PWD candidates, who are in the race for PhD admissions. “Many state universities, including Mumbai University, have adopted the UGC regulations and offer 5% relaxation in marks to PWD candidates. Unfortunately, Bamu, which runs in the name of social crusader Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar has not ratified the same and failed to give justice to the people with disabilities,” said one of the affected candidates, preferring anonymity. Educational activist and lawyer Shirish Kamble said the matter had already reached the Aurangabad bench of Bombay high court, which has recently refused to grant any relief to one affected candidate. “While maintaining that the petitioner would be bound by the regulations of the university, the court also observed that the petitioner has also not assailed the regulations of the university not providing relaxation of marks to the physically disabled candidates. Now when the affected candidates have the liberty to approach the court afresh with the intention to assail Bamu regulations, the university should instead become considerate towards PWD candidates and adopt UGC regulations,” he said. When contacted, Bamu’s public relations officer Sanjay Shinde said the university was offering 3 % reservation to PhD candidates in PhD admissions. “Considering the interests of PWD candidates, we have reserved quota for PWD candidates as per UGC policy of reservation. However, it is prerogative of the state university whether to offer relaxation of marks or not,” he said, adding that competent authorities would consider the demand of relaxation in marks also.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/bamu-ignores-ugc-norm-for-persons-with-disabilities/articleshow/82610665.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Delhi||Hoarders won’t benefit from relaxed bail rule||New Delhi: Hoarders and black marketeers of Covid medicines or equipment won’t be eligible for the relaxed bail criteria meant to decongest prisons in Delhi. They have been excluded by the high-powered committee led by a high court judge, in the latest series of recommendations. “SN Shrivastava, commissioner of police, has raised a concern that in these difficult times, some unscrupulous people are indulged in blackmarketing and/or hoarding of essential drugs, oxygen cylinders, oxygen concentrator machines and other related items required for treatment of Covid-19. He voiced that such people should not be extended the benefit of criteria laid down by this committee,” the panel recorded in the minutes of its meeting held earlier this week. Justice Vipin Sanghi noted that the panel “appreciated the concern raised by commissioner of police and observed that during these testing time, when people should come forward to assist each other in order to come out of this unprecedented situation, some people have indulged in making wrongful and undue profits by black marketing and hoarding drugs and products required for treatment of this lethal virus.” The panel also noted that a “sizeable number of people did not surrender and are still absconding” while excluding such a category also from future interim bail once they are rounded up. It, however, relaxed the criteria for a category of undertrial prisoners (UTPs) who are accused of murder and are in jail for more than two years with no involvement in any other case. It also allowed release of women UTPs who are pregnant or have their children with them in jail. However, any UTP, who has three or more criminal cases pending against him, shall not be considered for the relief. The panel also decided that around 1,133 UTPs who surrendered on time after being released on interim bail last year during the pandemic, to decongest jails, be released forthwith on interim bail for a period of 90 days subject to their furnishing a fresh personal bond for a sum equivalent to the sum for which they had furnished the personal bond last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hoarders-wont-benefit-from-relaxed-bail-rule/articleshow/82643624.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Chandigarh||Haryana to float global tender for purchase of Russian Sputnik vaccine||CHANDIGARH/AMBALA: Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Thursday evening confirmed that his government would float a global tender to buy Covid-19 vaccines for residents of the state. “All costs for the vaccine will be borne by the state government and the will be administered free of cost in government hospitals,” he said. The chief minister said that the tender for Russian vaccine Sputnik has been arranged and will be issued in a few days. Haryana home and health minister Anil Vij had tweeted on Thursday morning, “Haryana will float global tenders to purchase Covid vaccine for people of Haryana so that free vaccination could be provided to every 18+ citizens of the state at the earliest.” Highly-placed sources in the state health department had said earlier that the state would only purchase the vaccine that is approved by the Union government. Up to May 12, Haryana recorded cumulative inoculation of 46,58,366 persons out of 2.52 crore population of the state. “Global tenders are being floated to provide free Covid-19 vaccine to every citizen above the age of 18 in Haryana. To develop a strong security circle against Covid-19, vaccination is very important, therefore, the government will procure vaccines from anywhere in the world as soon as possible,” Vij said. On a question on whether the government had not analysed the number of vaccines which would be required to cover the population, Vij said, “It is a matter of pride that scientists of Hindustan prepared vaccines for this disease. They are manufacturing the vaccine as per their capacity but our country is very big and the vaccine is required in very large quantities. Therefore, if we get it from a foreign country then we would have to bring the same.” He also said he had raised the matter of short allocation of oxygen before the Centre during a video-conference meeting with health ministers of the country and alleged that discrimination against of Haryana. On the oxygen crisis, Vij said, “In Delhi, there is an allocated quota of 700 metric ton (MT) oxygen on 85,000 active patients while the same for Haryana is 258 MT for more than one lakh active patients. I raised the issue yesterday (on Wednesday) before the Union health minister in the video conferencing meeting with the health ministers of the country.” Vij said private hospitals charging more than the fixed rate during Covid-19 pandemic will not be spared. Also, strict action will also be taken against the government doctors who give prescriptions for purchasing medicine from outside even though medicines are available in hospitals. Some cases have come to notice where private hospitals are charging more than the prescribed rate, which is intolerable in any condition, he said and elaborated that during Covid-19 when free treatment is being given in government hospitals, complaints of overcharging in private hospitals is unfortunate. Private hospitals should treat Covid patients with humanity without overcharging and cooperate in public interest, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/haryana-to-float-global-tender-for-purchase-of-russian-sputnik-vaccine/articleshow/82615558.cms||---

Sabeel Ahmed in his application filed through his advocate MS Khan stated that he is a “qualified MBBS doctor with seven years of experience” in management of critical cases. The application filed before additional sessions judge Dharmender Rana further stated, “His experience and expertise being a medical professional would be helpful for dealing with the surge in Covid cases and treatment of inmates in Central Jail, Tihar.” The plea, therefore, in the interest of justice, urged the court to direct the jail superintendent to allow Ahmed to assist the jail administration for medical purposes on such terms and conditions as may be deemed fit and proper. Delhi Police’s Special Cell had arrested Ahmed recently and brought him to the city from Bengaluru on 10-day transit police custody in connection with a matter relating to allegedly trying to establish Al-Qaida in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS). Earlier, Ahmed, an alleged AQIS operative, was brought to Delhi from Saudi Arabia. He was arrested by NIA in connection with a case that pertains to a conspiracy hatched by members of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Harkat-ul-Jehad-e-Islami to commit subversive activities and wage war against the Government of India. The NIA has chargesheeted him before the NIA Special Court in Bengaluru.

---||Aurangabad||Private hospital in Latur stripped of DCHC status||Aurangabad: A private hospital in Latur has been barred from serving as a dedicated Covid health centre (DCHC) after it allegedly inflated the total number of ICU beds with patients needing remdesivir injections among other glaring lapses and shortcomings. The Sunrise Hospital, which has a sanctioned capacity of 70 beds for Covid patients, was also found to be operating without any intensivist and physician when a team of government officials paid it a visit on May 8. While issuing the DCHC cancellation order, Latur civil surgeon Laxman Deshmukh also pointed to the violation of fire safety norms and mixing of Covid and non-Covid patients at the hospital. “The Sunrise Hospital had shown 28 ICU beds needing remdesivir injections on record, but the official visit revealed that it had only 18 such beds. Moreover, the official protocol, which mandates centrally channelized distribution of these injections, was also violated. These injections were prescribed to patients and they were told to directly purchase them from outside,” Deshmukh told TOI on Thursday. The civil surgeon said the visit to the hospital on May 8 also revealed that only two resident medical officers (doctors) were managing 69 patients, of whom, 18 were admitted to the ICU. “The overall functioning of the hospital was not as per the official guidelines. Therefore, its DCHC status has been cancelled. The hospital has been asked not to admit any new Covid patient and work as a non-Covid hospital only after discharging all the existing Covid patients,” Deshmukh said. When contacted, Dr Hanuman Kadam, the in-charge of Sunrise Hospital, said his health institution has some shortcomings as a DCHC. “We are in the process of overcoming all shortcomings noticed by the official team. We have requested the district administration to reconsider the action taken against our hospital,” he said. Social activist H M Desarda said action against a private DCHC at Latur should serve as caution for other private hospitals. “Amid uncontained spread of Covid-19, a large number of private hospitals have jumped into Covid care in rural, semi-rural and urban areas. A close watch on such hospitals is needed,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/private-hospital-in-latur-stripped-of-dchc-status/articleshow/82610680.cms||Prasad Joshi

The survivor has alleged the accused raped her after spiking her drink and then blackmailed her for money. The survivor has alleged that in 2018 she had lodged a complaint with the BMC against an illegal construction in Kandivali east. The accused offered her help and they were in regular contact over WhatsApp, said police. In March 2018, the accused called the survivor to his place stating he needed help with a domestic issue. When the woman reached his house, he claimed his wife had left him. He then offered her tea allegedly laced with sedatives. “I don’t remember what happened. When I woke up, I found myself nude. When I questioned him, he showed me a video clip he had recorded of the act and threatened to make the video viral and kept on demanding sexual favours,” the survivor said. She alleged that the accused forced her to indulge in sexual acts with him at various places and later started extorting money. Sources said since the registration of the FIR on April 24, there is a lot of political pressure on Samta Nagar police not to arrest the accused. Last Friday, police recorded his statement. “We have booked him and have seized his mobile phones and sent them to the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) to retrieve the contents as the victim has alleged he has shot obscene videos. We are gathering evidence before arresting him,” said senior inspector, Anandrao Haake. Police have seized his three mobile phones. The accused has moved Dindoshi sessions court seeking anticipatory bail. The matter is kept for hearing on May 17.

---||Kanpur||Now, get info on Covid Hosp beds on mobile app||Jhansi: Even as families of Covid patients grapple for beds, which are in severe shortage, especially those with oxygen and ventilators, the administration launched an App on Thursday which will give real-time information about availability of beds in various private and government hospitals on the mobile phone. With this, the families of a patient can decide from home where to admit him or her as per required facilities without running from one hospital to another risking the life of the patient as well as exposing themselves to the coronavirus. Developed by NIC, ‘Jhansi Med Help’ App was launched by Jhansi DM, Andra Vamsi in Deendayal Auditorium where he gave the details to doctors and private nursing home owners. He requested them to constantly update the app and provide the latest status along with the facilities available with them through a Power Point presentation. One of the major highlights of the App is that if a particular hospital does not update itself for over 12 hours, it will be marked with red colour. “The App will save time and the patient will get a fast response. With sudden surge in the number of patients it was becoming difficult for many to find space in hospitals and they had to run here and there. Now with the help of the App anyone can locate a suitable hospital from their home itself,” Vamsi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/now-get-info-on-covid-hosp-beds-on-mobile-app/articleshow/82616132.cms||---

Shabnam Ali, a resident of Yerawada, said, “We have all had a relative, friend, colleague or an acquaintance, who has been infected by Covid-19. Many of us have also faced great personal loss. It is important to remember that we have been hit hard by the second wave and we must not let our guard down to visit people’s homes even during a festival. We will be praying at home and having a nice lunch on Eid.” Kondhwa resident Mariam Shaikh hasn’t bought new clothes for Eid this year. “Instead, we have donated the money towards Covid relief in the city. A few friends and I have got together to prepare food and distribute it in the slum area nearby. It is an important part of the day to give to the needy,” she said. While quite a lot has changed due to the pandemic, the festive spread is the same. “We will be making the usual biryani and sheer khurma, but in much less quantities as we will not be having any guests over. Before the pandemic, I used to prepare tiffins full of sheer khurma on Eid for my husband to take to office and share with his colleagues, who used to look forward to the treat.” For many, a meeting with family and friends will be virtual. Jaweed Mujawar, a resident of Pimpri Chinchwad, said, “My wife and I usually travel to Solapur with our children to celebrate Eid with the family but, this year too we are staying back in Pune and spending the festival at home. The children really miss their grandparents, who live back in our hometown.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/this-eid-families-plan-low-key-modest-celebrations-limited-to-close-relatives/articleshow/82615673.cms||---

---||Allahabad||Covid-infected mothers gave birth to 227 healthy children at SRNH in past one year||PRAYAGRAJ: While over 850 Covid patients have died in Prayagraj so far, the Covid positive women in the city have given birth to a total of 227 healthy children at Swaroop Rani Nehru Hospital, city’s only Level-3 Covid facility, in the last one year. The hospital witnessed 230 deliveries, of which three women gave birth to stillborn babies. Four children out of the 227 healthy deliveries were found infected with coronavirus. All the four recovered later. Three Covid-infected women gave birth to twins. The three mothers and the six children are all healthy. Two women died due to excessive Covid infection, and the child of one of them could not be saved. Apart from this, more than 100 general deliveries were also made. The first infected woman delivered on May 12, 2020, in SRN Hospital. “Last month, when the second Covid wave had a devastating impact on the city, 75 women gave birth to healthy babies at SRNH. A few of the 75 delivered twins,” said head of the department of Women and Obstetrics, Moti Lal Nehru Medical College, Dr Amrita Chaurasia. While sharing her experiences, the doctor recollected, “A Covid positive woman, who belonged to a well-to-do family of the city, had conceived through Inabout Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) technique, and had to go through a number of complications. She was also apprehensive of the facilities at SRNH. But after counselling, she agreed to get admitted and delivered twins (a boy and a girl),” said Dr Chaurasia. Prior to this, another positive woman had also conceived through IVF. “She did not have any symptoms. But when she got tested before admission at a private clinic, she was found to be Covid positive, and hence referred to SRNH. She did not get admitted immediately, thinking that she would be alright in around a week. She waited for five days despite being cautioned by us, and lost her baby before coming to us.” She further said that she and her team had been successful in delivering the baby of a woman whose oxygen saturation level had gone down to 50-60 per cent. “Although, we failed to save the mother, the baby was saved and is doing fine now,” she said. The HoD informed that soon after the delivery, if the child tests positive for coronavirus, he/she is kept with the mother. We make sure that the mother is wearing mask while feeding the baby. If the baby is found to be negative, he/she is not given to the mother, and instead, handed over to the family members. Principal of MLN Medical College, Dr SP Singh, said that not only Prayagraj, but infected pregnant women in the nearby districts, including Pratapgarh, Kaushambi, Fatehpur, Mirzapur and Bhadohi, are also being admitted at SRN Hospital for delivery. “Last month, when maximum number of people died in SRN Hospital due to Covid, 75 infected and 50 healthy women delivered their babies,” said Dr Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/covid-infected-mothers-gave-birth-to-227-healthy-children-at-srnh-in-past-one-year/articleshow/82615513.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Covid +ve lion Tripur in Nahargarh behaving normally, say forest staff||JAIPUR: The state forest department is on alert after a lion named Tripur living in Nahargarh Biological Park tested positive for Covid on Wednesday. The forest official received the report on Thursday from Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Bareilly. The report states Tripur is positive for SARS-CoV-2 that causes Covid. The officials, however, claimed that the animal was showing no signs of infection and its fresh samples will be sent to IVRI, Bareilly, for retesting. Chief wildlife warden ML Meena said, “No Covid symptoms are visible in animals, all are active and eating healthy diet.” The sample reports of a leopard, a white tiger and a lioness from Jaipur will also be sent as IVRI assessed to resample them. Senior veterinary doctor Arvind Mathur said, “The oral and nasal swabs of Tripur and other wild cats were taken and will be sent for re-testing at IVRI. The samples were taken after putting the animals in squeeze cage. This cage has no space and animal cannot move or resist while taking samples.” A release from the forest department reads that the park is closed since April 17 on directions of the government. Further, on the directions of Central Zoo Authority (CZA), samples of lions Tripur, Tara and Shristi, tigers Rambha, Mehak, Nahar, Rani, white tiger Chinu, and leopard Krishna were sent to IVRI, Bareilly, for Covid test. When the samples were sent, there were no symptoms of Covid in the animals, but the report of IVRI has confirmed Tripur Covid positive. The IVRI has asked to resend samples of Chinu, Tara and Krishna, which are being sent. Though official claimed several measures for prophylactic purpose are been taken at the biological park, sources revealed there are possibilities that forest staff could have transmitted Covid virus to the animals. Sources said, “In recent past, forest staff including officials tested positive. Moreover, near the cages, used gloves and mask were dumped by workers. This causal approach is not monitored by seniors.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/covid-ve-lion-tripur-in-nahargarh-behaving-normally-say-forest-staff/articleshow/82615668.cms||---

On Thursday morning, people in Sujabad area under Ramnagar police station, saw bodies floating on a bend and alerted police. Ramnagar cops reached the spot and divers were called to the spot. Deputy commissioner of police, Kashi zone, Amit Kumar also reached and monitored the search operation. Six decayed bodies and a partially burnt one were recovered and cremated. Meanwhile, six decomposed bodies were recovered at Dhanapur in Chandauli and cremated. Chandauli district magistrate Sanjiv Singh said all the bodies recovered in Dhanapur were badly decomposed and appeared to have been disposed of a week ago. None of the bodies was packed in PPE kit and stones were tied to them, he added. Divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal said, “We have deployed teams in villages and at cremation grounds in rural areas to tell people not to dispose of bodies in rivers and inform officials if they are incapable of cremating bodies.” The disposal of bodies in rivers started causing ripples when corpses piled up on the Ballia-Buxar border and Ghazipur on May 10. Bihar authorities placed a net in the river after claiming that 71 bodies had flown down from UP. The opposition has launched an attack on the state government accusing it of under-reporting Covid deaths in the state. Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav tweeted, “Bodies floating in the Ganges are not mere statistics, they are someone’s father, mother, brother and sister. There has to be accountability of the government that has failed its people so badly.” Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said in a tweet, “Bodies are floating in the Ganga in Ballia and Ghazipur. Reports are coming of mass burials on the banks of the river in Unnao. Official numbers from cities like Lucknow, Gorakhpur, Jhansi and Kanpur appear to be grossly under-reported.” She demanded a judicial enquiry by a high court judge saying what is happening in UP is inhuman and criminal. The government is busy in image-building while people are suffering, she alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/more-bodies-found-in-ganga-7in-ramnagar-six-in-chandauli/articleshow/82615182.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

---||Goa||Vaccination for 18-44 age group to begin tomorrow in Goa||PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Thursday that the state would launch the vaccination drive for those in the 18-44 age group from Saturday. “The vaccine will be administered free of cost across Goa through 35 government centres,” he tweeted. “Citizens are urged to register themselves on the Co-Win portal. Let’s work together to defeat the menace of coronavirus...” The government has received around 32,870 doses of the Covishield vaccine from the Serum Institute of India. Since vaccination will now be open both for the 18-44 age group as well as those beyond that, a senior official said that the government would have to chalk out a plan to manage both age groups. Aiming to speed up the vaccination drive in the state in order to control the spread of Covid-19, the state government had ordered the five lakh doses of the vaccine to be administered free to those in the 18-45 age group. However, the government has only received 32,870. The Centre had announced that vaccinations for the 18-44 age group would start from May 1, but as the state did not received the doses, it didn’t. One private hospital did start vaccinations for this age group, but with the privately-obtained Covaxin. Over 2 lakh people above 45 have taken the first dose of the vaccine, and over 90,000 have been fully vaccinated. The state’s population is over 15 lakh. The state government is focusing on completing the vaccination drive at the earliest. As there was poor response to the drive for citizens above the age of 45, the state government organised a ‘Tika Utsav’ across Goa after Prime Minister Narendra Modi advised states to speed up the process. With Goa witnessing a high positivity rate, which ranges from 40-45% and occasionally breaches 50%, health experts said that the state would have to expedite vaccinating the population. A health official said that the success of the vaccination drive would depend on the availability of the shots.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vaccination-for-18-44-age-group-to-begin-tomorrow/articleshow/82617931.cms||---

Police said Crimsun Organics, which was part of Sipcot industries cluster, was functioning with 50% workforce as per Covid-19 protocol when the boiler exploded due to a valve malfunction. Some of the workers, who inhaled the gas, swooned after complaining of breathlessness. A team of fire and rescue services personnel rescued and admitted them to the Cuddalore government hospital.R Rajkumar, 42, of Pazhaya Vandipalayam, K Ganapathi, 25, of Semmangkuppam, S Savitha, 35, of Kaaraikaadu, and Visheshraj, 25, of Bhuvanagiri, all from Cuddalore district, died at the hospital. Thirteen other workers are undergoing treatment. Several residents of nearby villages who complained of irritation of eyes were being treated at the hospital.Established in 2016, the unit manufactures active ingredients and intermediates for crop protection chemicals.Labour welfare and skill development minister C V Ganesan, superintendent of police Sree Abhinav, DRO B Arun Sathya and RDO P Jagatheeswaran visited the injured at the hospital. The team also visited the industrial unit and made inquiries.Chief minister M K Stalin has announced a solatium of Rs 3 lakh each to the families of the dead and Rs 1 lakh each to the injured. PMK founder-leader S Ramadoss, who condoled the deaths, asked the government to extend a solatium of Rs 25 lakh each to the kin of the dead and Rs 5 lakh each to the injured. He also urged the government to order safety audits by an interdepartmental team at all industrial units in Sipcot.“Ammonia is a water soluble gas. In mild concentrations, it causes eye and throat irritation. In higher concentrations, it causes corneal burns and largely affects the lungs leading to bronchospasm, a condition leading to constriction of airways resulting in breathlessness and wheezing and finally causing death. It can also lead to pulmonary edema as fluid accumulates in the air space of the lungs leading to respiratory failure,” said Dr U Amaravathi, Jipmer emergency physician.The Sipcot area community environmental monitors (Sacem) said lack of industrial disaster management plan and onsite emergency response systems led to frequent accidents claiming lives of workers. Sacem accused the industries of failing to extend proper training to workers and officials to tackle emergency situations. The forum demanded safety audits of all units in Sipcot by an interdepartmental committee, including pollution control board officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/boiler-blast-4-tn-workers-asphyxiated/articleshow/82613740.cms||Bosco Dominique

They brought the matter to the notice of senior health and administrative officials,” informed Gupta. Ironically, there was a long list of recipients above 45 years of age who did not receive vaccination certificates even after being administered both the doses of vaccine. Vineet Kumar and his five family members aged above 45 years who got the first and second doses of vaccine on March 12 and April 9, through the walk-in method, have not received their certificates till date. “I, along with five of my relatives got vaccinated at a community health centre on these two dates, but haven’t received the certificates as yet,” said Vineet, adding, “Whenever we ask the health officials about the issue, they just say that it’s the portal’s error.” Additional chief medical officer and district immunization officer (DIO) Dr Teerath Lal admitted to TOI, “The department has received numerous complaints of recipients who haven’t received certificates despite getting vaccinated.” He added, “The data of the vaccinated beneficiaries is still being uploaded on the portal, and accordingly the certificates are being sent to their phone numbers. We have been checking the issue with the concerned authorities to get it resolved.” Dr Lal advised the couple from Old City to register again on the portal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/couple-receives-vax-certificates-without-getting-vaccinated/articleshow/82615457.cms||---

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has directed all commissioners and DMs to identify and strengthen the infrastructure in 2 CHCs with 50 oxygen beds in each division as L1 facility so that the pressure on the city hospitals and L2 & L3 facilities is reduced to a certain extent. In Kanpur division, 2 CHCs in every district have been identified and necessary steps are being taken up by the administration and Health department to ensure that 50 oxygen beds are ensured in them. The necessary arrangements like beds, oxygen supply (oxygen generation plant or oxygen concentrators or jumbo cylinders), doctors, nurses, essential medicines and testing facilities are to be ensured in these identified CHCs. Divisional commissioner Raj Shekhar on Thursday visited the CHC Bilhaur to assess the ground situation and to plan for the execution accordingly. The visit was accompanied by AD Health and MOIC CHC Bilhaur. “During our visit, we found that there are a total 30 beds available as of now. More space to be created for another 20 beds. Places have been identified accordingly,” said the commissioner. Also, requirements of medicines, equipment and estimate for works to be done to be sent to CMO in next 2 days.

Five subjects include electrical engineering, civil engineering, computer science, electronics instrumentation and control engineering, production and industrial engineering. Application for three more courses is pending. NBA accreditation has international importance as it looks into standard of education, teacher-student ratio, laboratories and infrastructure. RTU VC RA Gupta said, “This is a big achievement for our state as we are one of the first institutes that have NBA accreditation for so many subjects. This will be beneficial for students to get jobs in foreign countries as this accreditation is valid in 50 countries of the world.” According to the university, in the last two years engineers of India were finding it difficult to get jobs in Gulf countries without NBA-accredited courses. Even the foreign ministry has advised the engineering colleges to apply for more accreditation to raise the standard of engineering in the country. The university had a made a self-assessment in June 2019 and submitted it to the NBA experts while requesting a visit in 2020. However, with the sudden announcement of lockdown, it got shifted for a year. On March 19 to 21, 2021, experts from BMS College, Bangalore, IIT-Delhi, Jamia Milia University, Netaji Subash Chandra Institute, Delhi and Murthal, visited the institute.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/five-courses-of-kota-tech-university-get-nba-label/articleshow/82615724.cms||---

Nashik municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav has already directed all the six divisional officers to identify locations on the roadside for the sale of vegetables. District disaster management authority, comprising the district collector, the municipal commissioner, the police commissioner, zilla parishad CEO and others members, has imposed severe restrictions in Nashik district for 12 days from May 12 to 23.All the vegetable markets and weekly markets in the city will remain closed, but farmers and vendors are allowed to sell vegetables and fruits along the roads. The sale of vegetable on the roadside will be allowed from 7 am to noon and social distancing has to be maintained.Accordingly, the NMC administration has started the process to identify the locations along the city roads.“We are already in the process of finalising the locations. It is difficult to inform now the exact number of locations across the city to sell vegetables, but it is expected to be over 250 locations,” said Pradeep Chaudhari, the deputy commissioner of NMC.During the Covid-related lockdown last year, over 105 spaces were identified to sell vegetables to avoid crowding at one place. But this time, instead of open spaces, the sale of vegetables is allowed along the city roads only following the Covid norms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-to-announce-locations-along-city-roads-for-farmers-to-sell-their-produce/articleshow/82610700.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Pune||Jail tourism plan on hold for now||Pune: The Maharashtra prison department has put on hold its jail tourism programme till further notice in the wake of the Covid-19 situation in the state. On January 26, the government had launched the programme from the Yerawada central jail, the largest prison in the state with more than 150 years of rich history, including the one related to the Independence struggle. The state had started the programme by allowing a limited 50 tourists for such visits, considering the Covid situation. However, the surge in Covid cases caused by the second wave of the pandemic prompted the department to reconsider the initiative and it decided to put the programme on hold till further notice. Additional director general of police (Prisons) Sunil Ramanand on Wednesday told TOI, “We have put the jail tourism programme on hold for an indefinite period due to the Covid concerns. We may think of resuming it after the Covid situation improves .” The state has nine central prisons, 31 district prisons, 19 open prisons, an open colony, and 172 sub-jails. As of now, as many as 34,896 inmates are lodged in these prisons. A total of 3,287 inmates have so far been infected by the Covid virus since the outbreak of the pandemic in March last year, and nine of them have succumbed to the infection. At present, there are 110 active Covid cases in the state prisons. The infected inmates are either isolated in separate cells or are admitted in the government hospitals. “It will be risky to continue with the programme. We assessed the overall situation before taking a call on putting it on hold indefinitely,” Ramanand said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/jail-tourism-plan-on-hold-for-now/articleshow/82615741.cms||---

---||Nashik||Muted Eid & Akshay Tritiya: People to pray at home, skip gold purchase||Nashik/Aurangabad/Kolhapur: The continuing Covid pandemic has necessitated the need for subdued celebration of festivals the second year now. This year, Eid-ul-Fitr — on the conclusion of the holy month of Ramzan — and Akshay Tritiya, a day considered auspicious for purchase of gold, both fall on Friday. Given the strict Covid-related restrictions in place and the need for Covid-appropriate behaviour, even the festival-driven businesses would take a hit again. The religious leaders of the Muslim community have requested people to pray at home and avoid congregational namaz. This is the second consecutive year that the congregational prayers across the state have been banned by the state government given the Covid spread. The state government had already banned all public religious celebrations. “We appeal to all to ensure that they stay home, stay safe and offer namaz to celebrate Eid-ul-Fitr on Friday. People should remain indoors and protect themselves from the infection — as mentioned in the guidelines released by the state government,” said Maulana Adbul Hamid Azhari of Malegaon. Nashik city Shahar-e-Khatib Hafiz Hisamuddin Ashrafi has also appealed to all Muslims to offer prayers at home between 6.30 am to 7.30 am. “Not only should one avoid going in groups to offer namaz at any open place, people must also ensure that they maintain social distance while greeting their neighbours and relatives so that the virus doesn’t spread. Infecting one person means infecting the entire family and the society,” he said. The Nashik city and rural police held meetings with the religious heads taking them into confidence and seeking their cooperation. The rural police on Thursday conducted a route march in Malegaon. Superintendent of Police Sachin Patil visited the town and inspected the preparations. Nashik district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal also extended his best wishes to the Muslim community and appealed citizens to celebrate Eid safely and peacefully. In Kolhapur too, the district collectorate has called for low-key Eid and Akshay Tritiya celebrations. Gani Ajrekar, the chairman of the Muslim Board in Kolhapur, said: “We have appealed to the citizens to offer the special Eid namaz at their homes while maintaining safe distance from each other. They will ask for dua or pray for humankind to be free from the coronavirus soon. As per tradition, Eid donations should be given to the Covid-hit poor people.” Gold markets will remain closed on Friday. Kuldip Gaikwad, the head of Kolhapur Saraf Sangh, said, “There are 2,000 shops in Kolhapur district and they will all remain closed on Akshay Tritiya as we have extended support to the Covid-related restrictions. Usually, there is a turnover of crores of rupees on Akshay Tritiya for the jewellers, but this year it will be zero. After Gudi Padwa, Akshay Tritiya will also be dry. We will be taking only gold bookings online or through phone calls on Friday, but the gold will be delivered to the customer only after the restrictions ends”. In Aurangabad, district collector Sunil Chavan said: “With joint efforts by all, we have succeeded in containing the spread of Covid-19 to some extent. It is our duty to observe discipline in future too to combat the pandemic situation.” Accordingly, the district administration said, “There should be no crowding while celebrating the festival. Any kind of religious or cultural programmes should not be arranged.” Pavez Shaikh, a private professional, said he would pray for society to be free from Covid-19 on occasion of Eid. “The pandemic has brought everything to standstill. It is time to reflect on our behaviour as human beings and seek the Almighty’s mercy for protection from the viral disease,” he said. On Akshay Tritiya, which is synonymous with buying of gold, many will miss the opportunity to purchase the yellow metal as jewellery shops in Aurangabad will stay shut. “The gold prices are still below Rs 50,000 per tola (10g) and Akshay Tritiya would have served as a great opportunity to buy gold. The custom of buying gold will be missed this year too,” said Rupali Nirmal, a home-maker.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/muted-eid-akshay-tritiya-people-to-pray-at-home-skip-gold-purchase/articleshow/82610706.cms||---
---||Goa||Plaint against CM, chief secy, oxygen supply officer||Panaji: Goa Forward Party (GFP) said that chief minister Pramod Sawant, chief secretary Parimal Rai and nodal officer for oxygen supplies Swetika Sachan failed to ensure adequate supplies of oxygen in the state which led to the deaths of several Covid-19 patients. GFP has filed a complaint at Agasiam police station and demanded that the three should be booked for “gross and reckless act of negligence” under the Epidemic Diseases Act and for causing the death of patients not amounting to culpable homicide. Strangely, GFP did not mention health minister Vishwajit Rane under whose watch the state’s health infrastructure has crumbled and is now on the verge of collapse. GFP claims that Sawant and the two bureaucrats were aware of the rising cases but failed to procure oxygen, which accounts to criminal negligence that caused the death of innocent patients. “The above accused are directly responsible for sourcing, and maintaining uninterrupted supply of oxygen amongst others facilities at the Covid ward, and have by gross acts of remiss in duty and deliberate acts of negligence in not ensuring uninterrupted supply of oxygen at GMC caused the death of more than 72 persons,” said GFP functionary John Nazareth. Congress and Corporation of the city of Panaji councillor Bento Lorena have filed similar complaints against the chief minister, Rane, officials of the health department and owner of Scoop Oxygen alleging criminal conspiracy and culpable homicide amounting to murder. GFP has also said that Sawant, Rai and Sachan did not undertake any remedial steps and have in a “callous manner and with full knowledge of the consequences” refrained from ensuring the uninterrupted supply of oxygen to GMC and other hospitals treating Covid 19 patients. GMC has been plagued by repeated drops in medical oxygen supply which prompted resident doctors to pen an open letter to the state government highlighting the severe oxygen crunch. After hiding the entire matter, Rane finally admitted that GMC has inadequate oxygen supplies and that patients are dying due to the lack of oxygen. GMC dean Dr Shivanand Bandekar has admitted that oxygen has been erratic and that Covid-19 patients have died. “The very fact that more than 26 patients have died overnight at the state’s largest Covid facility at GMC on account of shortage of oxygen, shows the complete lack of care and gross negligence on part of the above named accused,” said Nazareth.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/plaint-against-cm-chief-secy-oxygen-supply-officer/articleshow/82617997.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The sanitation staff went on strike on Wednesday for not being provided with safety equipment like masks, sanitizers and gloves by the firm due to which one worker lost his life due to Covid a few days ago.

Nand Kishore Dandoriya said, “We called off the strike looking at the promise of compensation. The firm has also promised to provide safety measure to workers. We have been working for so long in the pandemic and our lives should have some value. If the firm doesn’t provide masks and sanitizers, we will again go on strike.” Meanwhile, Gurjar assured workers that compensation will be given and sanitation workers will be provided with masks and sanitisers. Dandoriya had said in JMC-Heritage, masks and sanitizers were provided to workers, but not gloves.

---||Varanasi||Kashi Gears Up To Tackle Third Wave||Varanasi: The second wave of Covid-19 is coming under control, but some experts have warned of a third wave that would affect children and newborns more. Though the nation was caught unaware by the sudden surge of cases due to highly infectious variant, the authorities in Varanasi, the parliamentary constituency of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, have been busy making preparations to counter any situation if it arises and have planned to set up a group of experts to tackle any impending crisis. MLC A K Sharma, a former IAS and PM’s trusted aide, who is Covid in-charge of Varanasi, said, “The PM has been keeping a constant eye on the Covid situation in Varanasi and we are getting all assistance. We have handled the second wave successfully and are fully prepared for the third wave if it comes.” “After tackling critical issues like availability of oxygen, hospital beds and medicines, we are now focusing on preparedness for any future crisis. A group of experts from the medical field will design an action plan for this,” he said. Sharma, who attended the PM’s video conference on April 18 with divisional commissioner, district magistrate and commissioner of police, said the PM is taking constant feedback and had asked the administration to extend all assistance to the people of Varanasi with utmost sensitivity. “All measures for improvement in Covid care in Varanasi were on the directions of the PMO,” he added. Divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal said, “Focus now is on medical infrastructure for pediatric care besides strengthening existing facilities further.” “Today, Varanasi is almost self-dependent for oxygen needs even with an increased number of beds. Varanasi is in a position to supply oxygen to neighbouring districts as well,” he added. District magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma said, “Today, there is no problem for Covid patients in getting beds in the hospital. There are 2,400 beds with oxygen support, which would be increased to 2,900 shortly.” “Besides, anticipating a surge of cases in rural areas, we had started a massive drive just after panchayat elections counting and sent dedicated teams to survey villages and distribute medicines to those having any symptoms,” he said. So far, medicines have been distributed to 78,000 families in rural areas and RTPCR tests were increased from 5,000 to 6,000 per day a month ago to 12,000 per day with installation of two automatic RNA extraction machines. The test reports are now available within 24 hours. A Kashi Covid Response Centre (KCRC), which works round the clock, was set up with dedicated phone lines for ambulances and telemedicine for timely help to Covid patients. Varanasi gets its first oxygen plant: The Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) oxygen generating plant, a source of medical-grade oxygen, started functioning at the Deen Dayal Government Hospital in Varanasi. The 600 LPM PSA Oxygen generation plant, set up with local industry CSR funds, was brought from Aurangabad, Maharashtra. The plant brought a major relief to DDU district hospital, which has 203 beds out of which 120 are getting oxygen directly from the plant, which was installed in a week’s time.Local industrialist and vice-president of Indian Industries’ Association RK Chowdhary had donated funds for this plant. Closed oxygen plant restarts: An oxygen plant lying defunct for years in Darekhu area was acquired by the district administration and restarted to tackle oxygen crisis. The plant is refilling 450 cylinders per day, and its capacity will be increased to 1,000 cylinders. Earlier, the district was getting oxygen from six plants in Chandauli and one in Mirzapur. Lal Bahadur Shastri Hospital self-dependent for oxygen: With the installation of a 120 LPM oxygen plant, the Lal Bahadur Shastri Hospital in Ramnagar became self-dependent for oxygen needs. Another 960 LPM plant is being installed with the help of DRDO. Oxygen cylinder refilling for home isolation patients: The district administration started oxygen cylinder refilling in Durgakund and Chowkaghat for Covid patients in home isolation. The poor patients will be given free oxygen, while others will be charged Rs 550 for refilling a jumbo cylinder. DRDO Covid hospital functional: A 750-bed makeshift hospital set up by DRDO at BHU became functional recently. The Armed Forces have provided specialists, doctors, nursing and other medical staff, to run the hospital in coordination with BHU and civil administration. The medical staff has been trained in Covid protocols. All beds in the hospital have oxygen support as the hospital has three tanks with a total 40 KL capacity. Medicines and food are being provided free of charge to all patients. Local jugaad: Not only foreign aid and government efforts, local people contributed with their ‘jugad’ to overcome the oxygen crisis. Divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal said two entrepreneurs of Ramnagar Industrial Area, Vipin Agrawal and Gautam Chaudhary, developed a 400 LMP oxygen plant using ‘desi jugaad’ with locally available material. On the initiative of the commissioner, Banaras Locomotive Works (BLW) provided them two tanks for this purpose. This plant is being installed at the district hospital in Chandauli. Besides, local mechanics helped in running two oxygen plants imported from the USA and Israel. “We got oxygen plants from foreign countries and local mechanics who had no prior experience installed the plants and made them functional,” said DM Kaushal Raj Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/kashi-gears-up-to-tackle-third-wave/articleshow/82615394.cms||Binay Singh
---||Jaipur||Amid allegations of ripping the public, ambulance drivers say they do what nobody would do||Jaipur: Bodies never scared him during his 15-year job as an ambulance driver. But now, Naresh Yogi says he feels a shiver inside as he looks at it before picking up.“Family members of the deceased stand afar, let alone extending a helping hand. At the hospital and the crematorium, I have to load and unload it. I simply close my eyes and go through the process mechanically and quickly,” said Yogi.Yogi lives in Jaipur with wife and two kids, but sleeps in ambulances that don’t carry Covid patients. “They tell me not do the job. They are worried about me and I am also afraid of infecting them. That’s why I prefer to stay outside than go home,” said Yogi. Vimal Kumar, another ambulance driver, said they are paid a small amount for the service very few would do. “I have not gone home for the past two months. Yes, I am earning a little more money but I put my life at risk. Besides handling dead bodies, it’s not easy to drive in a PPE kit a hundred km. Doctors and nurses also wear PPE kits, but they are in AC rooms,” said Kumar who hails from Bihar but stays with his family in the city.After complaints of ambulance drivers ripping the public, the state government recently fixed rates for private operators, starting from Rs 12.50 per km. The government 108 ambulance service has deployed only about 15 vehicles for ferrying corona patients. Private vehicles cater to the bulk of the demand.“Drivers used to take Rs 12,000 per month. But because of the nature of the pandemic and risks, their demand has increased. We are paying them Rs 25,000, apart from the expenses incurred for their insurance cover, PPE kits, food, etc etc. Additionally, the fuel prices are increasing every day. That’s why it’s not fair to say that we have increased prices,” said Chandan Tripathi, who runs an ambulance service.Yogi said that getting oxygen has become very difficult. “When you ask for oxygen money, often people get into arguments. Everybody knows how hard it is now to get oxygen. Sometimes, hospitals delay admission and the patient remains in the ambulance with oxygen support for hours. When you ask for the money, they start fighting,” said Yogi.Another operator requesting anonymity said that some ambulance service providers are charging more and it cannot be called cheating. “People don’t fight with hospitals over rates. We become the easy targets even though we provide the service many would not do. So, some operators feel they can charge a little more. But please don’t label it as cheating. Black marketers of medicines, oxygen and other items are cheats, not us,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/amid-allegations-of-ripping-the-public-ambulance-drivers-say-they-do-what-nobody-would-do/articleshow/82615752.cms||---

Despite messages through various social media platforms regarding special vaccination drive at the civil hospital on Wednesday evening, the administration did not take any action or issued any clarification to the public. Later, when the situation got out of control, the staff at the hospital informed the public to return back as there was no information regarding the special vaccination drive. The chief medical officer (CMO), Dr Jasjeet Kaur, after witnessing the situation, decided to not hold vaccination drive at the civil hospital. District immunisation officer Dr Meenu Sassan said, “I did not give any permission for holding a special vaccination drive at the civil hospital as it is a critical Covid-19-care facility and gathering of public can be risky.” When contacted CMO Kaur, she also denied giving any permission to hold the special vaccination drive at the civil hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/now-no-vax-drive-at-pkl-civil-hosp/articleshow/82613749.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The facility was set up in less than a week and was started on May 1. The RWA members said that Delhi Police played an important role in arranging logistics, including the beds and oxygen concentrators, getting permissions, ensuring safety, etc. Seeing the encouraging response to this initiative, the RWA also started a quarantine facility on Wednesday. So far, 74 people have used the beds and 18 people have benefited from the quarantine facility. “The surge in covid cases motivated us to do something meaningful to help people. We started a discussion on April 25, collected funds and had a meeting with north district DCP Anto Alphonse and SHO Ajay Kumar, who agreed to provide assistance. On May 1, the 20-bedded facility was inaugurated by Rajesh Khurana, special commissioner, Delhi Police,” said Nitin Kumar Goel, senior vice president, Civil Lines Welfare Association (CLWA). To run the facility, RWA arranged for a team of doctor, nurses and technicians working in two shifts. “The site is managed by a qualified doctor, Dr Chandra Prakash, who visits the facility every day and also gives online consultation for free. To help him, there are teams of two nurses and one technician engaged in two shifts,” said Rajneesh Mathur, CLWA president. The RWA has also issued a helpline number 8800312860 for people. The facility saw full occupancy for five to six days from when it started because of a surge in cases. “We also realised that people who are recovering or others with mild symptoms with no sufficient space for home quarantine need some facility to stay. So, we started the quarantine centre on May 12. There are around 18 people here,” said Anil Gupta, a resident and member of CLWA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rwas-join-hands-with-cops-for-covid-centre/articleshow/82615853.cms||Vibha Sharma

Internationally acclaimed wildlife documentary makers shooting in the state are in a fix as the forest department is considering cancelling permission to them to shoot documentaries. The documentary makers claimed that protocol was duly followed before entering the forest and an RT-PCR test was being conducted every 72 hours. Moreover, it will be a big dent on their research, which will be displayed internationally, if the state government abruptly terminates their permission succumbing to the pressure of green activists. “Issuing permission for shooting a documentary in Ranthambore was a positive step taken by the government. Complete Covid protocol was followed by the crew, including social distancing. These documentaries are informative for children and nature lovers as they can explore wildlife world virtually,” said a member assisting a crew in Rajasthan As per the sources, chief wildlife warden has written a letter to withdraw the permission. “Years of hard work will go down the drain if permission is withdrawn for no reason. There is no certainty when the infection spread will come to an end and the project will be stalled,” added the member Many forest officials, too, believe that documentation of wildlife behaviour is integral conservation process and would promote Ranthambore once the pandemic is over. A senior official who wished not to be quoted said, “The documentary is being shot for an International firm and wildlife filmmakers have commitments. It will give a bad repute to state forest department if permission is withdrawn after issuing and more delay is caused.” Green activists had earlier alleged that the tiger reserve is closed for tourists and administration is making all efforts to minimise human-animal interaction in the forest to cut the risk of transmission of Covid from humans to wild animals. But nothing much can be done to restrict filmmakers as permission has been provided by higher authorities. An official at Ranthambore said, “The filmmakers are monitored and appropriate distance is maintained. A staff member accompanies these filmmakers to keep a check they do not venture close to the animal. Moreover, shooting documentary is not leisure activity tourism. They are considered as wildlife journalists.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/permit-hurdle-for-wildlife-research-docu-filmmakers-in-ranthambore/articleshow/82615832.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

He said the exercise for the joint need assessment has begun and pooling of resources with the Western Command is being worked out so that well equipped L-2 facility for holistic treatment to Covid-19 patients as per the Indian Council of Medical Research (IMCR) guidelines is set up. Various aspects like site, deployment of doctors, nurses, paramedics, ambulance service, trained personnel for administration and management of the facility, uninterrupted oxygen supply etc. are being looked into, said the DC. “With the availability of L-2 or L-3 beds turning grim, we seek to make as many oxygen beds as possible available to Covid-19 patients,” said the DC. Rubbishing reports on non-commissioning of make-shift hospital in Mohali and that Western Command is now extending support to Covid-19 facility at Rajindra Hospital, Patiala, which will be a loss to Mohali residents, the DC said, “Rajindra Hospital is the government L-3 facility attached officially with Mohali and any critical patient from Mohali can be referred to Rajindra Hospital. So, by no means Army supporting Rajindra Hospital is a loss to the people of Mohali. In the meanwhile, we are working towards operationalising a civil-Army joint venture.” Colonel Jasdeep Sandhu, director, civil and military affairs, Western Command, said the Army will work to support the civil authorities in combating the Covid-19 surge, where ever there is a need.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/admn-army-to-set-up-covid-hosp/articleshow/82613783.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

On their part, officials gave him an overview of containment zones in the district, beds (including O2) available in private and government hospitals, facilities in hospitals and requirements in the district. The minister called on the officials to take actions on a war footing to curb the virus spread and fulfil chief minister M K Stalin’s target to eliminate Covid-19 deaths in the state. “The total lockdown should be enforced in a strict manner, if needed.” Senthil Balaji directed the health department officials to ensure beds and good treatment to all Covid patients. He also urged them to monitor the patients in home isolation and check their restroom facilities. “If the house doesn’t have proper facilities, including the restroom, the patient should be referred to any of the nearby hospitals.” The revenue department officials were, meanwhile, directed to distribute food to all the Covid-19 patients thrice a day. “Three eggs should be given to them daily. The state government is ready to allot sufficient funds for these works,” the minister said. The minister warned the private hospitals of strict action if they collect exorbitant fees form covid-19 patients. “A team has been formed to monitor the private hospitals.” Senthil Balaji inspected the Salem steel plant, where oxygen production is to be started. He said a Covid care centre with 500 beds and oxygen facilities would be set up on the plant premises within 10 days. “The number of beds could be increased, if required. We are committed to providing uninterrupted electricity supply to all the hospitals in the state.” Similarly, housing board minister S Muthusamy conducted a Covid-19 review meeting at the Erode collectorate. The minister said a Covid-19 help centre would be set up in Erode with a doctor and nurse to offer services round-the-clock.  “We have arranged food packets for 3,025 people and the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowment Department will take care of the same,” the minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/salem/enforce-total-lockdown-strictly-senthil-balaji-tells-salem-officials/articleshow/82615872.cms||---

She was rushed to the hospital in the commissioner’s vehicle but was declared brought dead. A case of criminal negligence has been registered by the police against the contractor. The work at the site had been stalled due to lockdown but the water tank had been left uncovered by the contractor. According to the police, construction of government quarters was going on near Arora Circle close to the municipal office. Since the work was stalled due to lockdown, the contractor had appointed Suresh Rawat for security of the material. Rawat had been living here with his wife and five daughters. “On Thursday afternoon, Dhapu, one of Rawat’s daughters, fell into the water tank at the site while playing. Seeing her drowning, her mother also jumped in the tank and her three other daughters also followed suit to save the kin,” said the police. The site is adjacent to the residence of the municipal commissioner (North) Rohitashva Singh Tomar. He was at home during the incident and his driver was waiting for him outside. “Hearing their shouts, both Tomar and his driver rushed to the spot and took all of them out of the tank. All were rushed to the hospital in the commissioner’s vehicle, where one daughter was declared dead,” police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/6-year-old-girl-drowns-in-tank/articleshow/82615874.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The desert state surpassed Uttar Pradesh on Thursday where 2,04,658 active cases were reported. Last week, Rajasthan was at number six in active cases, but due to the fast spread of infection, the graph of active cases has increased in the state. Though Rajasthan is among the top four states in active cases, it is better than other states in terms of mortality as the death rate is less than 1% making it the 12th state in the country in terms of fatalities. Though Punjab, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh have less cases, casualties are much more. As per official records, the maximum number of cases were registered in Jaipur, Jodhpur, Udaipur, Alwar and Bhilwara districts. Except Jodhpur, active cases in the remaining four districts have increased in the last one week. Since May 6, the highest number of active cases has increased to 5,004 in Jaipur. An official said, “There were 46,206 active cases in Jaipur till May 6, which has now increased to 51,210 on Thursday.” Similarly, till May 6, active cases in Udaipur were less than 10,000, which has now increased to 11,019.

---||Delhi||Breathe easier: NGO opens free oxygen refill centre at school in Delhi||NEW DELHI: With many critical Covid-19 patients still requiring constant oxygen supply across the city, a free oxygen refill facility has now started at Kerala School on Canning Road. To get a refill, one simply needs to bring an oxygen cylinder of 15 litres or lower, along with a Covid-19 positive test result and the Aadhaar card of the patient. The free service has been started from May 8 onwards by an NGO Distress Management Collective India (DMCI), which is run by Justice Kurien Joseph and former Union minister KJ Alphons. The NGO is also providing oxygen concentrator services for free. Advocate Manoj V George, general secretary and spokesperson of the NGO, said that during the first Covid-19 wave, the NGO’s focus was on providing dry ration, cooked meals, laptops to help children take online classes and providing air ambulances. “In the second wave, we found that the need for addressing the oxygen shortage was more. We have therefore got around 35 large 50-litre cylinders from Chennai, which are now being used at Kerala School to refill oxygen cylinders,” said George. Oxygen is also being provided by them to the nearby Covid care centres at Andhra Bhawan and Mount Carmel School, he stated. “Kerala School is centrally located and we have already received over 3,000 calls since we started providing oxygen concentrators and refills. We have 10 to 12 volunteers working 24x7 who are receiving calls and we have been able to provide concentrators even at 2 am to the needy people,” said George, stating no security deposit or money is being collected by them for the service. “Details such as the Covid-19 report, Aadhaar card suffice and the concentrator is provided immediately,” he added. Former Union minister KJ Alphons told TOI both the concentrators and cylinders were brought to Delhi to help people battle the oxygen shortage, with 16 concentrators also sent to Bengaluru. “The oxygen refill service takes place from 10 am to 5 pm for cylinders that are 15-litre in capacity or lower. For oxygen concentrators, we have set up helpline numbers which can be called on,” said Alphons, adding fresh meals were also being cooked for Covid-19 affected families. Alongside oxygen concentrators, Covid-19 patients are also being provided telemedicine consultation and online counselling as part of their initiative ‘Praan Vayu’. The NGO is assisted by Bengaluru-based Hope Action group and USA- based Karmaodaya Inc. George says people can contact them on the helpline numbers +919871046508, +919871741197, +919480332223 and +919899911011 for assistance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/breathe-easier-ngo-opens-free-o2-refill-centre-at-school/articleshow/82615946.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok
---||Jaipur||Probe purchase of faulty ventilators with PM Cares fund: Rajasthan CM||JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Thursday urged the Union health ministry to launch a probe into the procurement of defective ventilators using PM Cares fund. Gehlot in a tweet said the central government made available to states 1,900 ventilators using PM Cares fund. The installation and maintenance was of the Union government. According to doctors, there were many technical deficiencies in the ventilators so use of these ventilators was dangerous for patients’ lives. The doctors complained that these ventilators have a problem of ‘pressure drop’. After working continuously for one to two hours, they stop functioning. These include the sudden drop in PIO2, the failure of oxygen sensors and compressors. In the Covid review meeting held from open VC on April 5, Dr Lakhan Poswal, principal of Medical College, Udaipur, raised the issue of these ventilators. Apart from Rajasthan, different problems in these ventilators have also been reported in the media in Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Maharashtra and Gujarat. In order to make them aware of the problem of these ventilators and to get them fixed at the earliest, two letters were written by the Rajasthan government at the secretary level and one letter at the ministerial level to the Government of India so that they could be rectified. For the maintenance of ventilators in Rajasthan, the company appointed by the Centre had promised to send 11 members, but only six people are working here. However, due to lack of experience, they are unable to fix it. The Union health ministry should investigate how the purchase of such defective ventilators was made. These can threaten the lives of patients. Gehlot said cases of mucormycosis (black fungus) disease among patients who have been cured of corona in various states, including Rajasthan, are very worrying. It has been reported that this disease is increasing in patients with diabetes and cured of corona. In this disease, people are losing sight and in some patients the doctors had to remove jaw. The Centre should take it seriously and conduct research to prevent it. Also, necessary medicines and injections such as amphotericin, which can be used in the prevention and treatment of this disease, should be arranged, he demanded. He also repeated the demand of vaccines instead of states floating global tenders. Gehlot said, “So far, 11 states have mooted global tenders for the purchase of vaccines due to lack of stock in the country. This will cost different rates to various states. It would have been good if the Centre would have taken out global tenders and made vaccines available to the states in a planned manner because vaccination could only prevent the third wave.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cm-seeks-probe-into-defective-ventilators-procured-under-pm-cares-fund/articleshow/82615866.cms||Joychen Joseph

They said instead of removing the GST, the rates can be brought down to minimum levels so that the manufacturers can claim ITC while the burden on the states will be negligible. Pankaj Ghiya, a leading tax advocate in the state told TOI, “Out of the IGST collected, 50% is remitted to the states as their share of SGST and 50% is retained by Centre. The suggestion should be that the CGST share should also be transferred to the states. By this the seller claim ITC benefits and the states will get the complete tax reimbursement.” Alternatively, Ghiya said that the tax rate can also be reduced to 0.1% which will be a win-win for all as manufacturing companies will get ITC credit and the burden on the states will be far less. Products exempted from GST are not eligible for ITC and if the tax is completely exempted, the manufacturers will increase the prices to reduce extra tax burden. As per the state government, there are about 3.75 crore people in the age-group of 18-44 who need to be vaccinated. The vaccines attract 5% GST. If the state is state is going to vaccinate all the people in this category, the tax burden will be huge. Ujjval Sharma, another tax expert, said that the vaccine companies may not sell all the vaccines to the state government at the reduced prices. “After giving 50% of the total production to the Centre, the manufacturers will supply the rest to the states. But they are unlikely to sell all of the rest 50% to state governments at reduced prices. So, some of the 50% will also be sold to the private sector. In that case, the GST accrued from there will go to the state government. If GST is waived, the state government will lose the tax,” said the expert. He said while the state government will buy Covishield for Rs 300 per dose, the private sector will have to pay Rs 600. “If the state government is paying Rs 15 per dose as tax, it will get back Rs 7.50 as its SGST share. When the private sector pays Rs 30 as tax per dose, the state gets Rs 15 as its part of SGST. In this scenario, the state government will lose taxes if GST is waived,” said Sharma. However, he said that the common man will have to pay the GST tax. “To save the common man from paying taxes on vaccines, the Centre should remove GST and import duties on raw materials used for vaccines. So that the vaccine will be cheaper,” added Sharma. Further “The government can direct cash subsidies or incentives to pharma and Covid equipment suppliers,”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/vaccines-will-be-costlier-if-gst-exempted-say-experts/articleshow/82615912.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

He was reacting to a statement by the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) that those having laboratory test-proven SARS-CoV-2 illness should defer Covid-vaccination for six months after recovery. “Separately, the advisory group on Covid-19 vaccines has also recommended increasing the gap between two doses of Covishield to 12-16 weeks. Currently, the interval between two doses of Covishield is 4-8 weeks,” Kamat said, adding that NTAGI has also suggested that pregnant women may be offered the choice to take any Covid vaccine and that lactating women can be inoculated any time after delivery. “Although, the recommendations of the NTAGI will be sent to the national expert group on vaccine administration, it is important that decisions are taken fast as we are already running out of time in the second wave of pandemic,” the opposition leader said. “I once again urge the government to come out with an action plan on testing as well as vaccination. The confusion created by the government with inconsistent timelines has resulted in fear in the minds of the people about testing as well as vaccination,” he said. Kamat said that the government should ramp up testing in the state and form a task force comprising of experts to monitor testing as well as vaccination effectively.

Raising the red flag on discrepancies in the trials data, changes in the trial protocols, quality and accuracy of data as well as a lack of transparency, they said: “Restricted access to data hampers trust in research. Access to data underpinning study findings is imperative to check and confirm the findings claimed.” These questions come at a time when Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF)’s Indian partner, is preparing to receive the shipment of the second dose from Russia after the first lot of 1.5 lakh first doses arrived in Hyderabad on May 1. “It is even more serious if there are apparent errors and numerical inconsistencies in the statistics and results presented. Regrettably, this seems to be what is happening in the case of the Sputnik V phase 3 trial,” the experts said in a correspondence published in The Lancet’s Online First edition on Wednesday. The experts expressed concern regarding the availability of the data from which the Sputnik investigators drew their conclusions as they had refused to share it. “Data sharing is one of the cornerstones of research integrity; it should not be conditional and should follow the FAIR principles,” they said in the letter. Scientists also rued the fact that the full trial protocol and the reasons for making changes in the interim analyses as well as the primary outcome were not made public. “Initially the primary outcome was to be assessed after the first dose, but the evaluation was postponed to after the second dose. The presented primary result (efficacy of 91.6% is dependent on this change but the reasons for the change have not been made public,” they pointed out. They also said the definition of the primary outcome is unclear and several crucial information is lacking such as the clinical parameters determining suspected Covid-19, diagnostic protocols used, when the PCR testing was done, what specific method was used, or how many amplification cycles were used. “The way cases of suspected Covid-19 were defined could have led to bias in PCR testing used to assess the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases, which is crucial for the efficacy determination,” they pointed out. While raising concerns about the enrolment and randomisation of patients and a discrepancy in the numbers shared, they also pointed to several inconsistencies in the data and numerical results reported. “…data for the vaccinated group of day 20 refer to more individuals than at day 10…the number of participants reported for the different vaccinated age cohorts do not add up to the reported total. With such inconsistencies we question the accuracy of the reported data,” they said. Sputnik scientists respond: In a response published in the same Lancet issue, Sputnik V scientists said the reporting of the interim analysis in the phase 3 trials was fully compliant with the “clear and transparent regulatory standards” for provision of clinical trials data. “It is on this basis that Sputnik V has received registration in 51 countries, which confirms our full transparency and compliance with regulatory requirements,” they said, adding that all the amendments made to the protocol were submitted to the Lancet along with the rest of the documents for review. They also attributed the numerical inconsistencies to simple typing errors that were formally corrected and said the “safety and immunogenicity of the Sputnik V vaccine has been confirmed in multiple studies”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/as-india-eyes-sputnik-rollout-experts-question-efficacy-data/articleshow/82620581.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

However, the allocation doesn’t seem to be sufficient considering the surge in the number of active cases. Earlier, the allocation of the drug for the state was between 100-150 vials. The Centre has allocated 45,000 Tocilizumab vials for the states on May 11. The drug is sourced only through imports from a pharmaceutical company Hoffman La Roche by Roche India and is marketed in India by Cipla Limited. According to officials, the injections will be distributed to private and government hospitals through Rajasthan Medical Services Corporation Limited (RMSCL) and private distributors. The distribution will be done as per distribution percentage of 65% by RMSCL and 35% by private distributors. “It has a huge demand in the country for Covid treatment. But, it was hardly available anywhere. Only one company – Cipla – imports it and distributes it across the country. If the drug is unavailable with this company, it won’t be available anywhere. Also, this drug is very expensive and each dose costs Rs 40,000,” said an official. “Private hospitals in states should be informed by the state governments that they have to contact the health department of their respective state to source the drug. The distribution is being done to states looking only at active case load in the states. The states are requested to prevent hoarding/black-marketing and also ensure that the drug is used judiciously strictly according to the treatment protocol advised in the clinical guidance issued by joint monitoring group of MoHFW,” read the Centre’s order. “The state governments are requested to widely publicise the mechanism put in place in their respective state of obtaining the allocated vials by the needy patients, private hospitals and government hospitals,” it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/states-allocation-of-tocilizumab-injection-increased-to-2185-vials/articleshow/82615913.cms||---

Of the 500 beds, 204 were lying vacant in the dedicated Covid hospital at Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH). Deputy superintendent of the hospital Dr Satish Kumar said there was no shortage of oxygen as it was being made available through pipelines, cylinders and over 90 oxygen concentrators. He said 22 doctors appointed on the basis of walk-in-interview held on May 10 have also joined, thus adding to the workforce engaged in the treatment of Covid patients. At All India Institute of Medical Sciences -Patna, 37 beds were vacant in the 300-bed Covid ward. Dr Sanjeev Kumar, nodal officer for Covid at the hospital, however, said all the 60 ICU beds were full. Similarly, 27 of Covid beds were lying vacant at the Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH). Superintendent of the hospital, Dr I S Thakur, presented red roses as a token of good wishes to 11 patients discharged on Thursday. He said the lockdown imposed by the state government has helped much in checking the spread of the Covid virus and it was evident by the decreasing number of serious patients seeking beds in hospitals. Almost half of the post-Covid care beds set up in the PMCH also remained vacant. Another dedicated Covid facility, Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) also had 60 of its Covid beds lying unoccupied. IGIMS medical superintendent Dr Manish Mandal said the number of admitted patients stood at 225. However, all the 60 ICU beds remained full with serious Covid patients, he added. There was low occupancy of patients in the 100-bed Covid ward being run by the Army in the ESIC Hospital at Bihta. The nodal officer of the hospital, Ashok Tiwari, said 86 beds were vacant. Besides, 20 beds in the 50-bed Covid ward being run by the district administration in ESIC were also lying vacant, Tiwari added. First time in recent weeks, 10 beds were found vacant at the Paras HMRI hospital, a private Covid facility. However, hospital’s regional director Dr Talat Halim said all the 29 ICU beds remained occupied. At High Tech Emergency Hospital, 12 beds with oxygen support were lying vacant in the 40-bed Covid ward.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Antigen tests in rural areas to check rapid spread of virus||JAIPUR: To scale up Covid testings, antigen tests will be conducted in rural areas for early identification of cases. Though the state government acknowledges that sensitivity of antigen tests is around 40%, it has decided to use the same in rural areas since it gives results within 20 minutes. The decision has been taken as the state is witnessing surge in Covid cases. On Thursday, the state reported 159 Covid deaths while 15,867 others tested positive taking the casualty count to 6,317 and overall tally to 8,21,525. The health department, which was conducting only RT-PCR tests to diagnose Covid, has now decided to conduct rapid antigen test in rural areas. In 68 places, the health department has developed facilities of conducting 1.45 lakh RT-PCR tests per day. “In rural areas, we are finding cases having symptoms of cough, fever and influenza-like illness symptoms. In such as a situation, we have decided to conduct antigen test for quick test. The sensitivity of RT-PCR is 70%, but it is 40% in case of antigen test. But, in antigen test, the result is issued in 15 to 20 minutes,” said Raghu Sharma, health minister. Apart from scaling up testing, the health department is also taking measures to strengthen treatment facilities. Amid spiralling Covid cases, Mucormycosis, also known as ‘black fungus’ is emerging as a serious concern for health authorities. Following a few cases of black fungus, the health department is now taking measures to prevent deaths from it. “We have issued directions to Rajasthan Medical Services Corporation for procuring injections useful in treatment of black fungus. Across the country, over 2,000 cases of black fungus have been reported. In Rajasthan too, few cases have been reported. Each patient requires 60 injections of a specific drug for treatment of black fungus,” said Sharma. Districts which reported new cases are Jaipur (4,099), Jodhpur (1,074), Udaipur (997), Alwar (771), Kota (740), Bharatpur (609), Bikaner (579),Sikar (583), Chittorgarh (496), Ajmer (493), Hanumangarh (423), Dausa (403),Jaisalmer (398), Churu (397), Bhilwara (380), Sriganganagar (325), Pali (302),Dungarpur (295), Barmer (265), Jhalawar (264), Jhunjhunu (225), Nagaur (213),Rajsamand (210), Sirohi (191), Karauli (187), Sawai Madhopur (156), Tonk (140),Baran (140), Pratapgarh (137), Bundi (126), Dholpur (111), Banswara (91) andJalore (47).

---||Mumbai||Bombay HC rejects minister’s apology for ‘impromptu’ village event||MUMBAI: A day after the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court questioned minister for EGS and horticulture Sandipan Bhumare’s holding of ceremonies in his constituency despite the pandemic lockdown restrictions, it declined to accept an unconditional apology from him on Thursday. Bhumare, through Advocate S S Thombre, filed an application to say he was not aware whether a ceremony was arranged on May 7 in Devgaon village in Paithan taluka. The Shiv Sena politician said he reached the village casually and was surprised to see a collection of villagers. He said he had no intention of violating the lockdown restrictions and apologised for participating in a function that day. His said his aim was to ensure that the unemployed get work under employment guarantee schemes. Chief public prosecutor D R Kale said that since Dhumare had apologised there was no need to register an offence. The bench of Justice R V Ghuge and Justice B U Debadwar said it found it difficult to believe that a minister casually visited his village, found a crowd and suddenly a function started and “suddenly a bhoomi pujan (ground breaking) ceremony was also performed’’ as a “mighty coincidence”. The high court said that “such coincidence is impossible”, more so as a gramsevak had lodged an FIR against five persons about the minister desiring to conduct a bhoomi pujan at the primary health centre in Mauji, Devgaon. The high court said Dhumare by his application before it had attempted to create an eyewash and disposed of it saying it could not entertain his plea in view of the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code. The high court disposed of another application by D R Gorde, who sought action against Bhumare for violation of lockdown rules. Th high court on Thursday in its order said Gorde could take his grievances to the police station concerned. The high court had on Wednesday said: “We are called upon today to face a peculiar and weird situation, regarding people’s representative, politicians and ministers flouting lockdown restrictions and conducting public functions physically and that too by making a farce of appeals to the public not to attend such a physical function,” said the high court. It had said it was compelled to direct that these “respected” representatives of citizens should not hold physical ceremonies and functions. These would include inauguration of any constituency development programme, bhoomi pujan and felicitations, said the high court. The high court asked whether the politician was not duty bound to obey the chief minister’s instructions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-rejects-ministers-apology-for-impromptu-village-event/articleshow/82618073.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Kolkata||Rain delays TBM Urvi’s breakthrough||Kolkata: Two days of heavy rain delayed tunnel borer Urvi’s planned breakthrough on Thursday. Breakthrough is needed at the end of a tunneling when the tunnel boring machine (TBM) is made to punch through a wall that integrates the tunnel with an underground Metro station. In this case, a diaphragm wall has been built to integrate the two sections of the same tunnel. One section covers around 1.6km from Esplanade till Bowbazar’s Durga Pituri Lane. Another 800m stretches from Sealdah station till the same spot. The two sections will be bridged on Sunday. The breakthrough will finally mark the completion of the TBM-driven tunnels of the Rs 8,575.98 crore East-West Metro project. Urvi, as TBM S-616 is nicknamed, should cover the last 10m by Saturday night or Sunday afternoon (Friday being a holiday). Thus, Kolkata’s biggest infrastructure project would achieve its most significant milestone ever. Despite several staff members of contractors ITD ITD-Cementation infected with Covid-19, Urvi was veering towards the Thursday deadline for the breakthrough. By evening it would have punched the diaphragm wall below Bowbazar’s Durga Pituri Lane. But heavy downpour on Tuesday and Wednesday came in the way. Water started seeping in through the Sealdah station shaft, from where the 800m tunnel till Durga Pituri Lane starts. “The hi-tech electrical equipment was at risk. We had to stall the digging temporarily. Now the water has dried up and the TBM has been re-initiated,” an engineer involved in the project said. Officials of Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation (KMRC), implementing agency of the 16km East-West Metro corridor project that will eventually join Sector V with Howrah Maidan, said they were eyeing a Sunday afternoon breakthrough. The ITD ITD Cementation is contracted to build the last 2.45km Esplanade-Sealdah stretch of the East-West Metro. On January 4 this year, Urvi started its journey from below Sealdah station to bridge the last 800m gap of the westward tunnel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rain-delays-tbm-urvis-breakthrough/articleshow/82613812.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

Cops have arrested one person named Bharat Burman from Tufanganj for making objectionable comments about north Bengal. The FIR was lodged in Jorbagan against this post. Burman, police said, had been arrested by the local police earlier in another complaint related to the fake post FIR. “He has been brought to Kolkata after seeking permission from a local court there in this regard,” said an officer from the north division. The accused has been taken into police remand till May 21. “We want to question him if he was part of an organized gang,” the officer added. The detective department, which has issued multiple notices to profile owners, are yet to officially announce any arrest. “The questioning and recording of statements have begun. If there is any need, arrest will be carried out. The idea is to allow the profile user to understand their mistakes,” said an officer from cyber cell. The cyber cell has begun demarcating each fake video — from those circulating only on WhatsApp to those being shared across social media — and accessing its impact.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-cops-arrest-one-for-fake-posts/articleshow/82613857.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Delhi||Delhi: Covid-stung, they now supply food to help others fight back||NEW DELHI: When 24-year-old Jasleen Kaur Arneja, an investment risk analyst, was infected with Covid-19 last month, food was a big problem while in isolation. After she recovered, Arneja and her friend, Jatin Sharma (24), who too had tested Covid-positive, have been paying for meals delivered thrice a day to Covid patients in the city. Since May 5, they have been providing nearly 60 food packets every day. “We contacted tiffin providers and tasted their food. We pay them to serve families in areas like north Delhi, Laxmi Nagar, Patparganj, Dwarka Sector 7, Vikaspuri, Shastri Nagar, Geeta Colony, Nirman Vihar and Tilak Nagar," said Arneja. "When we receive a call from Covid patients, we follow up with meals delivered to their doorsteps. We also take daily feedback from the recipients about the quality of food. If there are complaints, we get them remedied the following day.” Like Arneja and Sharma, many others have also formed networks across Delhi-NCR to provide meals to Covid patients. Communication professional Atisha Jain, 28, has been taking out time from her work to make homemade food for people recovering from Covid. Withthe help of delivery services, she has been sending free meals to people in South Delhi. “When some family members and friends had Covid, I felt sad and helpless. As I enjoy cooking, I decided to prepare simple food for patients,” said Jain, who caters to a maximum seven people in a day. Some businessmen have similarly joined forces to ensure nutritious food for Covid-affected people. Gurjeet Singh, one of them, said, “We roped in seven housewives in Shastri Nagar whose family incomes have been hit by the pandemic. They cook lunch and dinner and we pay them a nominal fee. After packing the food, we go with two hired delivery persons to reach the meals to needy homes.” Jaspreet Singh Karamsar, who is actively involved in this initiative, added, “Many Covid patients take food from us when they are unable to cook themselves. However, when they feel better in four-five days, they discontinue our service so that other needy patients can get the food.” Among those who have benefited from generous do-gooders is Sakshi Khurana, a Covid patient in Tilak Nagar. She said, “My mother and I were hospitalised after testing positive. We ordered meals for my father and brother, who were home quarantined. Now we are back home, and even two thalis given to us are enough for the four of us.” A similar initiative in Vikaspuri is stalled for want of requests. As Rohan Kapoor, a businessman, explained, “We are able to deliver meals only in Vikaspuri. We have shared this on different social media platforms, but we are still awaiting requests from Covid patients.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-stung-they-now-supply-food-to-help-others-fight-back/articleshow/82616019.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

Currently, the single court is overflowing with people to pay fines in order to release impounded vehicles. The government had imposed a strict lockdown to break the chain of Covid cases and infections which had overwhelmed hospitals. Police are currently cracking down on violators and impounding vehicles violating lockdown restrictions. Bar association general secretary Gajraj Singh said, “During the last lockdown, there were four courts in as many zones to deal with motor vehicle cases. That helped to decongest courts. This time only a single court is dealing with such cases resulting in overcrowding.” He said at least 10 courts are required as police have started impounding vehicles in large numbers. People are gathering in huge numbers to pay fines to release their vehicles. “This must be avoided, other wise the lockdown effort will go in vain,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bar-assn-demands-more-courts-for-mv-cases-to-curb-crowding/articleshow/82615994.cms||---
---||Dehradun||At least 40% more bodies in Uttarakhand than deaths claimed||DEHRADUN: Data exclusively accessed by TOI has revealed that Uttarakhand — which has highest Covid-19 fatality rate among Himalayan states with 33 deaths per lakh population — has had significantly higher cremations and burials of Covid patients than the number of Covid deaths recorded by the health department. The data, obtained from the state urban development department (which oversees crematoriums and burial grounds) shows that 1523 people were cremated at Covid-dedicated burning ghats or buried in graveyards as per Covid protocols in the period between April 20 and May 2. In the same period though, the official Covid bulletin of the health department listed 910 deaths, which is 613 deaths less than the number of Covid-related cremations and burials recorded by the urban development department. As to what accounted for the disparity in numbers, officials had no concise answer. Rohitash Sharma, deputy municipal commissioner of Dehradun Municipal Corporation, who oversees the municipal works of a Covid-dedicated crematorium of Dehradun, said, “Many Covid patients pass away while in home isolation and their deaths are not necessarily reported to the chief medical officer of the respective districts which might have caused this variation in the data. Also, some unclaimed bodies, too, are being cremated as per Covid protocols currently.” In a similar vein, Dr Tripti Bahuguna, director general of health, told TOI, “People are not coming forward and reporting that they are Covid cases in many instances and quietly undergoing isolation. It is only when it comes to taking health insurance-related claims that we get to know of such cases. However, we have a dedicated Covid death committee which is looking into each and every case very carefully.” Intriguingly, while the urban development department was recording a separate count of Covid and non-Covid cremations and burials till May 2, it abruptly stopped doing so from May 3 and began collating only the total number of bodies for which final rites were being conducted. When queried why this was so, Vinod Kumar Suman, director of the urban development department, said, “Since there was a surge in deaths, even non-Covid bodies were being cremated in Covid-dedicated ghats and vice-versa and it became difficult to segregate numbers. That is why, we stopped recording Covid-only cremations and burials at that time.” He added that “department workers have now been asked to compile death details properly.” From May 3 to May 11, a total of 4448 deaths including Covid and non-Covid fatalities were recorded by the urban development department across the state while the official Covid fatality toll as per the health department during this period was 1132.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/at-least-40-more-bodies-burnt-at-covid-dedicated-crematoria-or-buried-in-graveyards-in-ukhand-than-number-of-deaths-claimed-in-official-covid-bulletins/articleshow/82612588.cms||Shivani Azad

But there was no way he could reach Canada as all international flights are suspended due to the Covid-19 surge. But this young student found a way out and left India in a chartered flight to Maldives on April 24. After completing 14 days quarantine, he left for Canada from the island nation via Dubai. Large number of people from Rajkot and Ahmedabad, who are keen to reach US, Europe and Canada, are taking the Dubai or Egypt route via chartered flights from Mumbai. A number of travel agents whom TOI spoke to said people who have H1B visa and work permit in the US, Canada and European countries are eager to go back to save their jobs or permits and reach on time. The immigrants, students, work permit holders are desperate to go back and they are ready to throw any amount to fly. The 19-seater chartered flights operating mostly from Mumbai and Delhi take nine passengers to maintain social distancing. The travellers are required to quarantine in Dubai for four to 10 days depending on their destination countries. Sanjay Mehta, chief executive of a Rajkot-based travel firm said “A person holding US visa gets on arrival visa in Dubai. Those who have to reach the US, Europe and Canada are preferring this route. We are flooded with such inquiries and several of my clients successfully reached their chosen countries using this route.” About 12 flights have left for Dubai from Mumbai airport in the last two weeks, he said. The doors of Maldives and the UAE also closed after they suspended flight operations from India. However, Egypt is now becoming the preferred lay over destination. Per head expense of a flier to Cairo from Mumbai is nearly Rs 1.80 lakh which includes accomodation and meals for four nights and five days. Egypt has a tourism policy where they provide group visas to four or more people, which are lapped up by travel agents. Travellers from Cairo get flights to New York which they book in advance when they leave India. “These are genuine business class charters. When we get an inquiry, we circulate a message in our travel agents groups to find adequate number of passengers for a charter. Once the number of passengers are sufficient, we approach the chartered flights operator and ask for a date,” said another travel agent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/intl-fliers-opt-for-chartered-service-to-us-via-dubai-egypt/articleshow/82612646.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

According to health minister Raghu Sharma, Rajasthan urgently needs at least 20 lakh doses to continue vaccination. The state now has a capacity to vaccinate seven lakh people a day. Authorities stated that they were in touch with companies such as the Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat Biotech for delivery of vaccines for the 18+ category and with the Centre for other categories. In Thursday evening, 3.60 lakh vaccines arrived in Jaipur. Majority of the vaccination sites were closed by afternoon in Jaipur and other parts of the state on Thursday due to lack of vaccines. For the 18+ category, there were no slots available throughout the day in many districts. Expressing concern over the scarcity of vaccines, Raghu Sharma told TOI, “In order to continue vaccination for the 18+ category and as well as others, the state needs at least 20 lakh vials. Due to lack of vaccines and its random supply, only 1.45 crore people in Rajasthan have received the first and second dose.” Due to supply shortage, vaccination for all categories has been affected for the past one week. “We have 2.90 crore beneficiaries in the category of 45-59 age group. In the 60 and above category, 80% have received their first dose while only 27.4% have got their second one. As the Centre is responsible in vaccinating health workers, frontline workers, 45-59 and also 60 and above categories, they should regularly send vaccine. For the 18+ category, the state government is in touch with SII and Bharat Biotech. We are also trying to export the vaccines from Russia and other countries as well.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/state-needs-at-least-20l-vaccine-doses-urgently/articleshow/82618099.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: CBI plea for digital records of Rashmi Shukla phone tap denied||MUMBAI: A CBI plea for a direction to the state to hand over all digital devices seized by the cyber cell of Mumbai police related to the phone taps made by former police commissioner of state intelligence, Rashmi Shukla, was rejected on Thursday by the additional chief metropolitan magistrate at Esplanade court. The CBI, represented by a lawyer from Delhi, invoked section 91 of the CrPC that empowers a magistrate to order any officer concerned to produce a document or other records in his/her possession necessary for an investigation, inquiry or trial. Special public prosecutor for the state Ajay Misar cited three grounds to oppose the plea for the devices containing digital records. Firstly, the devices were seized by Mumbai police in its probe into its FIR; secondly, the digital records were sent to a forensic laboratory for analysis, and thirdly, CBI was going beyond what HC permitted it. The Mumbai Cyber Cell, BKC, had registered an FIR on March 26 against unknown persons over “leaking’’ of Shukla’s confidential report dated August 20, 2020, on the alleged politician-police nexus on transfers and ‘powerful’ postings. She had said her report was based on phone tap permissions granted from July 17, 2020, to July 29, 2020. On the directions of the Bombay high court on April 5, CBI conducted a preliminary enquiry into allegations of ‘corrupt malpractice’ made against then home minister Anil Deshmukh by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh in a letter on March 20. It registered an FIR on April 21 against Dehmukh under the Prevention of Corruption Act. The additional CMM Sudhir Bhajipale rejected CBI’s application for reasons to be given separately.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cbi-plea-for-digital-records-of-shukla-phone-tap-denied/articleshow/82618108.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Delhi||Monsoon likely to keep its date with Delhi||NEW DELHI: Delhi recorded a spell of light rain on Thursday morning, which resulted in the mercury dropping below normal for this time of the season. India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast a spell of light rain for today as well. Track the pollution level in your cityMet officials say monsoon is likely to hit the city around the normal onset date , which is June 27. Last year, monsoon rains had hit Delhi on June 25. “If the monsoon hits the country around normal date, then it should hit Delhi around its normal onset date too. However, we will have to see how it progresses after hitting Kerala,” said a senior IMD official. Another Met official said more rain was likely to occur in the next couple of weeks in the build-up to actual monsoon rains. “As temperature crosses the 40-degree mark, a low pressure is created and that leads to short but intense spells of rain. From May onwards, you start recording pre-monsoon showers that intensify as temperature rises,” said the official. On Thursday, Delhi’s maximum temperature was recorded at 35.3 degrees Celsius – four notches below normal. At 21.3 degrees Celsius, the minimum was also recorded four notches below normal.

---||Nagpur||Never requested for transfer to Aurangabad: Justice Haq||Nagpur: Nearly seven years after he was appointed as Bombay high court judge, justice Zaka Haq retired from office on Thursday. Popularly referred to as the ‘people’s judge’ in the legal fraternity, he was accorded a warm farewell by the High Court Bar Association (HCBA) members at HC’s Nagpur bench. The celebrations, however, were muted due to Covid-19 pandemic, with only executive committee members, including president Gauri Venkatraman, vice president Purushottam Patil and secretary Prafulla Khubalkar attending the event. The function was webcast live on YouTube and watched by hundreds. In his emotional speech, justice Haq, well known for his disciplined and straightforward approach, candidly expressed his feelings and also opened up about the controversy over his sudden transfer to Aurangabad last year. This had come soon after he issued a contempt notice to HC registrar (administration) in Mumbai, and flayed his office for negligence, on January 2 last year. Over 300 members strongly protested his transfer and unanimously passed a resolution opposing then chief justice Pradeep Nandrajog’s decision. Terming the incident as an ‘insult’ and ‘humiliation’ to the prestigious bar, the HCBA office bearers along with senior counsel Shreehari Aney even met the then CJ and requested him to cancel the transfer. It was perhaps the first time in HCBA history that all members stood up for a judge and even threatened to boycott work. There was speculation that Haq may resign at that time. It was only after justice Bhushan Dharmadhikari took over as CJ was justice Haq moved back to the city. TOI had also published a series of reports quoting lawyers on how the Mumbai-based HC registry allegedly targeted judges here if they pulled it up for lapses. Speaking on the issue, justice Haq clarified that there was an impression created at that time that he had requested a transfer to Aurangabad, but he had never asked for it. “That time, some senior members approached me to ask whether I sought the transfer. When I said no, they all stood by me by passing a resolution. It proved how much the bar members loved me and I am truly thankful for them for the support.” Explaining further, he said when the transfer order came, his family was disturbed initially, but they all stood with him in difficult times. “When I look back at the incident, I found that it gave me more confidence. If you are right, you are right. The HCBA shouldn’t hesitate to take up the right cause, as it’s known for courage.” Box Justice Haq to restart practice from next week Declaring that he would be returning to the bar next week, justice Haq said he was experiencing the same feeling one gets when going back home. “I am anxious to come back to the bar, which is my family. I wouldn’t be taking up any assignment like a tribunal, but would plead arbitration and other cases, and also in the Supreme Court and other HCs,” he told TOI. After enrolling with the Bar Council of Maharashtra and Goa on January 15, 1985, justice Haq started practice at Akola district court with father Mohammed Haq, and later shifted to Nagpur on December 3 the same year. He represented the Union of India as additional standing counsel and also Maharashtra government as ‘A’ Panel Counsel. He was elevated as additional HC judge on June 21, 2013. He had taken cognizance of many issues and converted them into suo motu PILs, like ongoing Covid-19 pandemic case and potholes on roads and also Pench-Khawasa Road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/never-requested-for-transfer-to-aurangabad-justice-haq/articleshow/82616093.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Mumbai||In relief to Malad school, HC disposes of investor petition||MUMBAI: In a relief to about 2,000 parents and the founders of Witty International School, the Bombay high court has disposed of a petition of investor Cerestra Infrastructure Trust. It granted relief to the school founder, Vinay Jain. Both parties have accused each other of “willful fraud” and “criminal breach of trust” with regard to a 2016 agreement. The matter of this Malad international school came up on Wednesday and the court stated the investor did not have a case. The prayer that the trustees deposit money in the court till the matter was settled was not accepted. Favouring educationists and parents, the court said the trustees were “not going anywhere”. “A school is more than a building or a cluster of buildings and a playground, with or without a swimming pool. There are still students.” The 2016 agreement between Cerestra and Vinay Jain allowed the former to acquire a 51% stake in VJTF Infraschool Services (Mumbai) Pvt Ltd (VJTFI), the asset management company of Witty International School (Mumbai), for Rs 97 crore. School trustee Vinay Jain said after the agreement, the company invested Rs 47 crore and failed to infuse the additional equity of Rs 51 crore by March 2020. The Witty school management, which was committed to pay a fixed lease rental to VJTFI, also stopped paying the rental and invoked force majeure as the full investment did not go through. The court upheld this and ordered Cerestra to shoulder the legal charges of Rs 10 lakh which need to be paid to Jain in three weeks. As the principal asset, the Malad property is in the name of VJTF Infra and that would necessitate an injunction against Cerestra. “I have no doubt that the relative prejudice to the Jain group is far greater than any conceivable prejudice to Cerestra,” the final order read. Cerestra spokesperson said this was an interim order and the two parties would now argue the matter before a three-member arbitration panel. A parent of a Class III student said the HC order was a huge assurance to students and parents of not only the Malad school but for many who had feared “the school would be evicted”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-in-relief-to-malad-school-hc-disposes-of-investor-petition/articleshow/82613918.cms||Hemali Chhapia

A Hisar resident has accused the hospital staff of stealing a gold bangle of his dead mother. Industrial Area, Phase 1, police, who received three such complaints from April 25 to May 10, said they were verifying the facts and DDRs have been registered.A few days ago, the UT administration had constituted a three-member committee, led by PCS officer Jagjit Singh, to probe the issue of the hospital taking oxygen cylinders in excess.Bittan Mittal, a resident of Hisar, said in his police complaint, “I had admitted my 60-year-old mother with lung infection to the hospital on May 8. Her Covid-19 report was negative. I deposited Rs 1 lakh in advance for her treatment. The next day, my mother passed away. While receiving her body, I noticed that her one gold bangle was missing. I insisted the hospital staff check the CCTV cameras, but they did not.” Mittal then filed a police complaint.Another complainant, Sanjeev Rastogi, a resident of Sector 21, reported that he had admitted his sister on May 2 and deposited Rs 1 lakh with the hospital in advance. After two days, the hospital allegedly demanded Rs 1 lakh more and he paid Rs 50,000. However, the staff told him to shift the patient to another hospital as they had run out of oxygen and the administration was not providing it to them as per their demand. They allegedly removed the oxygen pipe from his sister on May 6. Due to this, she started suffocating, Rastogi alleged. He filed a complaint against the hospital at Industrial Area, Phase 1.Amit Arora, a resident of Paschim Vihar, New Delhi, said his brother, Sita Ram, tested positive for Covid-19 and he talked to Dr Sanjay Bansal of the hospital about the availability of ventilator before coming to the city. The doctor assured him of the availability, Arora alleged, adding that he paid Rs 50,000 for an ambulance and gave Rs 50,000 to the hospital in advance. “After taking the payment, the hospital staff told me that a ventilator was not available. Then I admitted my brother to a private hospital in Zirakpur,” he said.Talking to the TOI over phone, Dr Sanjay Bansal of Eden Hospital denied all allegations. He said inquiries were pending with the police and they would provide all CCTV footage and other documents to them required under the law for investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/city-hospital-accused-of-denying-treatment-despite-taking-money/articleshow/82613915.cms||Pawan Tiwari

Party president Girish Chodankar said that Union home minister Amit Shah did not bother to listen to Goa’s demand for a lockdown nor the deaths that are occurring due to oxygen shortage but found the time to settle the quarrel between Sawant and Rane. “It is really sad that the top leadership of BJP has not uttered a word on deaths in Goa which occurred due to the BJP government’s gross mismanagement.

The division bench of Justice Ritu Bahri and Justice Archana Puri has now fixed July 8 as the next date of hearing to reassess the situation. The PU had filed an application against the high court order of March 23, wherein the university was asked to complete the senate poll process within two months. The PU counsel submitted on April 19 Punjab had put a cap of 20 people at gatherings and out of 28 booths, 24 fall in various districts of the state. They had sought approval from the Punjab government for gathering, but the state on April 30 advised PU to postpone the elections in view of human health and safety. The Himachal Pradesh government also withdrew its permission to hold the senate polls and Haryana has ordered closure of all its educational institutions till May 31.  The PU submitted that under these circumstances, it is difficult for them to comply by the March 23 directions of the high court.  The PU submitted, “The elections can be held whenever the circumstances become normal.”The petition was filed by Keshav Malhotra and six others. The former senators had sought the quashing of the August 15, 2020, orders of the VC to defer the elections indefinitely. An appeal was also made to set aside the October 16, 2020, communication of the UT administration asking PU to defer the elections. Recently, UT had communicated to PU authorities that it should take a decision to conduct senate polls on its own. PU senate is a 91-member supreme governing body of the university, in which 36 members are nominated by the chancellor.

---||Chandigarh||Vendors leave city, dip in fee collection||Chandigarh: The surge in the Covid-19 cases that led to lockdown in the city has resulted in a sharp dip in the monthly vending fee payment made to the MC. As per records, out of total 10,888 registered vendors, 6,873 defaulted on payment in March, and the number increased to 7,612 in April.Due to restrictions, many vendors have left the city and many who were registered in the second phase, also could not earn. “It has come to our notice that many vendors have gone back to their native places with their families. As markets are closed and people do not come out of their houses, these vendors were left with no hope,” sources said.Though at present no relaxation has been announced for the registered vendors, sources said MC may give them more time to pay. Last year too, the civic body had given relaxations, like exemption of vending fee for a few months.The monthly vending fee is different for vendors across the city as per their work. It varies from Rs 300 to Rs 2,000 per month. There are 46 earmarked vending zones throughout the city and Sector 15 has the biggest with over 800 sites.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/vendors-leave-city-dip-in-fee-collection/articleshow/82613908.cms||Deepak Yadav
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Mass promotions for state board Class X regular students||AHMEDABAD: In a major relief for the 8.7 lakh regular students in Class X at schools affiliated with the Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB), the government has decided to give them mass promotions. The government had earlier declared mass promotions for Classes I to IX and XI. After a lot of dilly-dallying, the state education department on Thursday finally decided to cancel Class X board exams due to the Covid-19 situation in the state. “This is the first time in the history of the state that board exams have been cancelled. It never happened earlier, be there earthquakes, riots or any other calamity,” said Bhasker Patel, president of the Federation of Self-Financed Schools, Gujarat. The government’s decision is only for regular students and does not include about 3.6 lakh external students, sources in the state government said. “This is not a small number and holding exams for such a large number of external students is going to pose a major challenge,” a source said. The state government’s decision to cancel the Class X board exams is in lines with the Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE) cancelling its exams for these students. The decision for the CBSE to cancel the Class X exams for 2021 and postpone those of Class XII was taken at the behest of Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal, after his review of the Covid-19 situation in the country with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “Earlier some government officials were of the view that the Class X board exams must be held. Their reasoning was that the present batch got mass promotion last year in Class IX and this will be the second straight mass promotion for them. As a result, this batch could face issues in taking examinations two years later when they are in Class XII,” said a source in the know of the matter. The state government had earlier announced postponement of the Class X and Class XII board exams while giving mass promotion to other classes. While taking the decision to cancel the Class X board exams, senior officials at GSHSEB were not taken into confidence, said a source. The state education board had earlier announced that it would hold exams for Class X and Class 12 from May 10 and May 25, respectively. The government said the new exam dates would be announced after a review of the Covid-19 situation on May15. The decision to cancel the exam came after growing demand from parents and schools as the second Covid wave was turning into a major crisis with hospital full and oxygen supplies under pressure. Various representations were made in the last few weeks to Gujarat chief minister on this matter. In rural areas, which have also been hit severely in the second wave of Covid-19 cases, there is a huge risk, as students have to travel outside their towns of villages with their parents or other family members to take the exams.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/mass-promotions-for-state-board-class-x-regular-students/articleshow/82613958.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Double challenge for villagers in Uttarakhand hills||Dehradun: Even as Covid-19 surge continues in the Uttarakhand hills, many villagers, who are mainly dependent on earnings from tourism, claimed that they are now faced with the double challenge of financial crunch and lack of access to nutrition due to the curbs during lockdown. Many villagers said they are unable to procure fresh vegetables and citrus fruits which help in fighting the infection. With less than a week to go for Char Dham Yatra, this is the time when, each year, Govind Mehar along with his team of around 4,000-odd women in the Garhwal hills work day and night to prepare prasada – from locally grown products – for the devotees. However, the cancellation of the yatra this year for pilgrims has come as a major setback crippling the primary source of income for many households. A resident of Badav village in Rudraprayag district, Harish Singh Negi pointed out that the two nearest town areas were Pokhri – around 13 km away – and Chandrapuri, which was roughly 18 km away. “Now, with public transport off the roads, we cannot go to these markets and fresh vegetables and fruits cannot be brought to our place. Earlier, villagers took a shared vehicle to reach these markets. Some relaxations have been allowed and we are praying that the Covid numbers decrease quickly so that things return to normal,” Harish said. Last year, Sunita Chauhan, a resident of Joshimath heading Annapurna Seva Samiti – a women self-help group involved in making prasada – had taken a loan of Rs 5 lakh. She was optimistic that the high turnout and the popular demand of the prasada would help her repay the loan in quick time. But, while 2019 saw a total turnout of around 32 lakh pilgrims for Char Dham, it dropped to 3.1 lakh in 2020. “We suffered heavy losses as the business was low last year and going by the way of events it appears a similar trend this year too. Raw materials worth tonnes have been left wasted and now I face the uphill task of returning the loan amount without much sale,” she told TOI. Not only Sunita, others like Paini resident Kamla Devi, Gita Devi of Guptkashi and Sarita Uniyal from Joshimath, too, find themselves in a similar situation. Ashok Negi, who runs a small dhaba in Agastyamuni area in Rudraprayag on the way to the Kedarnath shrine, said that they are battling a double whammy – rising cases of Covid as well as economic uncertainty – since the situation is expected to last through the summer season when most of their earnings happen. “It will be two consecutive seasons now. I am hoping that this second wave ends soon so that the yatra season can commence,” Negi added. Social activist Anoop Nautiyal said, “The Centre has warned about the steep rise in Covid cases in the last two weeks, mainly in the rural pockets. Apart from Uttarakhand, the other seven places are Jharkhand, Punjab, Haryana, Telangana, Odisha, Bihar and Jammu and Kashmir.” He added, “Uttarakhand tops the list of maximum active cases per lakh population among the Himalayan states. With 771 active Covid cases per lakh, Uttarakhand is also ranked at seventh spot in the nationwide list.” Nautiyal asserted that it is extremely important that a dual approach of checking the numbers and providing better health services is provided in the hills. “There is complete mismanagement in Uttarakhand and for which we have come up with a detailed analysis of the situation and it shows a major concern. Uttarakhand has 771 active cases per lakh population, which is far more than neighbouring Himachal Pradesh which has 573 active cases per lakh population. Data shows that Uttar Pradesh has 103 per lakh population and Delhi has 495 active cases per lakh,” Nautiyal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/double-challenge-for-villagers-in-uttarakhand-hills/articleshow/82612656.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan’s genome sequencing centre to come up in 2 weeks||JAIPUR: Alarmed over increasing Covid-19 cases and in preparation for the expected third wave of the pandemic, the state government has decided to have its own genome sequencing facility to study various strains of viruses. The genome sequencing centre, to come up at SMS Medical College, will initially sequence 20 samples per day and soon increase it to 60 samples. On Thursday, TOI spoke to health minister and officials on how much time it would take to set up this facility. While experts said that it would take 14 to 20 days, health minister Raghu Sharma said that it would be up and running in a fortnight. He said the new facility would make Rajasthan self-sufficient in studying various virus strains. “With the genome sequencing facility, we will not be dependent on the central government. There are only 10 such facilities in the country and it usually takes a lot of time. The centre will help us to study a strain, its variant and enable us to act and react accordingly. I believe this will be a revolutionary change and we would be able to tackle mutations and strains of Covid virus more effectively,” said health minister Raghu Sharma to TOI. He added that the facility would start in a fortnight at SMS Medical College where the state health department has enough manpower. Though in December 2020, the government had announced setting up a genome sequencing facility by January 2021 to detect mutations, the project failed to take off as cases started to dip from January. Speaking on upcoming centre, Vaibhav Galriya, secretary, medical education, said, “For this, firstly you require a machine, trained and skilled experts, and testing kits. We have spoken to the company which is providing the machine. They have promised to provide us kits in the next 15 to 20 days. But we are pushing them to give it as early as possible.” “Initially, we will be able to study the genome sequencing of 20 samples at a time. The results of samples would come in three days. later, we are aiming to enhance our capacity to 60 samples per day,” Galriya said. He said that samples collection won’t be confined to Jaipur district. “We have borders with Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh. So, our sample collection will be across from Dungarpur and Udaipur, which are close to Gujarat, and Bharatpur and Dholpur, which are close to Uttar Pradesh," he said. Dr Sudhir Bhandari, principal and controller, SMS Medical College, said, “We need kits to start it as soon as possible. We have trained and skilled microbiologists and other specialists for the task.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rajs-genome-sequencing-centre-to-come-up-in-2-wks/articleshow/82618131.cms||Ashish Mehta

On Wednesday, S Suhaashan, a class III student of the panchayat union primary school at Ramagovinda Kadu in Thagattur village, met district collector Praveen P Nair and handed over a demand draft of Rs 10,135 towards the chief minister’s relief fund. The boy had saved the money for purchasing a gadget for attending online classes. Earlier, on Tuesday evening, he had rung up his headmaster expressing his willingness to donate his savings in the post office savings account for the cause. Asked why he chose to do so, he told headmaster G Subramaniyan that he saw news about people dying due to Covid-19 on television and thought his savings may help the government get medicines for those affected. Moved by his request, Subramaniyan spoke to his parents and got their consent. He also made arrangements for Suhaashan to meet the collector and hand over the DD. Collector Praveen P Nair greeted the boy with a shawl for his gesture and being a role model for others at his tender age. Asked how he will get the gadget for online classes now, Suhaashan said he will ask his father to get him one. The boy’s father S Sakthivel, 38, credited headmaster Subramaniyan for inculcating the habit of savings in children. “It has become a habit for Suhaashan to save all the money that he receives from relatives during festivals and what we give him occasionally for his piggy bank,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/boy-8-from-nagai-donates-rs-10k-savings-towards-covid-19-relief/articleshow/82618130.cms||---

These include permanent structures with facilities to handles indoor patients at in the city. The need for these was felt as there are several patients in temporary arrangements at the BAPS Atladara campus and the GMERS Hospital at Gotri. These will not be useful in monsoon and alternative arrangements will have to be made. Sources said that in wake of the situation permanent solutions are being looked into. The officials at the SSG Hospital and the Gotri hospital have been discussing the possibility of having new buildings. The possibility of a new building in the Gotri hospital campus as well as a new facility attached to the SSG Hospital (SSGH) located at the Infectious Diseases (ID) Hospital in Karelibaug or the Ansuya Leprosy Hospital ground on Ajwa Road is being looked into. Officials said that a block for emergency medicine, additional facilities in the ID Hospital and a superspeciality and multispeciality hospital at the leprosy ground had already been proposed earlier by the government. Insiders said that attempts were being made to impress on the government that if work began soon and the facilities came up at the earliest, they could be put to use for Covid-19. These would not be additional financial burden in the government. Officer on special duty for Covid-19 Vinod Rao said that the options were being considered and a proposal would be sent to the state government soon. “We are looking at a hospitalization capacity of 1,000 to 1,500 at the Gotri hospital and a similar number at the ID Hospital or Leprosy Ground,” he said. Another aspect that is being looked into is that of using the existing facilities of the SSGH and the Gotri hospital for non-Covid work. The facilities for Covid here have eaten into space meant for other purposes and ailments. “The hospitals have to begin their routine work at some stage,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/cases-down-but-vadodara-ramping-up-medical-infra/articleshow/82612495.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh municipal corporation sends revised Rs 9.5 crore property tax notice to Panjab University||CHANDIGARH: The municipal corporation has sent a revised property tax notice of Rs 9.50 crore to Panjab University (PU), asking it to deposit it at the earliest. It comprises the principal amount as well as the arrears, which PU had not paid to the MC. About a couple of months ago, the civic body had sent Rs 13.60 crore notice to PU. The university authorities had challenged it, saying some buildings situated inside the boundary of the varsity, like a school, post office and a few others, do not fall under their ambit, and so, their tax must be deducted from theirs. In its wake, the MC revised the amount after excluding those buildings and sent the fresh notice to PU. Sources in MC said, “The tax branch had conducted a survey of the buildings at Panjab University. It found some buildings were in the tax ambit, but their property tax was not being paid. After the survey, the details were checked and the tax amount was prepared.” “We have now told the PU to pay the revised amount. The university officials are expected to discuss the issue with the MC. It is, so far, the highest property tax the university will pay,” they added. Gets over Rs 12cr in April MC has earned over Rs 12 crore in the first month (April) of the rebate period from the commercial and the residential property taxpayers. As the civic body has increased the rebate period by another month till June 30, it expects to receive a good response.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mc-sends-revised-rs-9-5-cr-property-tax-notice-to-pu/articleshow/82613949.cms||Deepak Yadav

---||Rajkot||Pandemic grounds flight operations from Rajkot||Rajkot: From May 15, the Rajkot Airport was expected to handle 12 flights daily. But with Covid-19 restrictions imposed in most part of the country that looks a distant dream now. At present, the airport witnesses zero traffic, which means no flight operations, on three days in a week. The situation has resulted due to two private airlines’ decision to temporarily halt their operations from the Rajkot Airport. Last week Spice jet had informed the airport authority that they have suspended their operation from Rajkot till May 31. Indigo, on the other hand, has decided to stop operating Rajkot flights for a week. Earlier, these two airlines used to operate on the routes like Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Bengaluru. A flight to Goa was also scheduled to start operating from May 15. Also, Air India, the only airlines currently operating from Rajkot Airport, too has reduced its flight frequency. Air India operates flights for four days in a week on Mumbai and Delhi routes. Talking to TOI, Diganta Borah, Rajkot airport director, said that surge in Covid cases are the reason behind flights being grounded. “The flights have been suspended because there are hardly any passengers due to surge in Covid cases. Even businessmen are avoiding travelling now. Only those who have some family emergency are taking flights,” Borah said. Last month, the Rajkot Airport had got approval to start an air cargo facility. But with very few flights operating now, the air cargo service is also under suspension. According to Airport authority, in March total 390 flights — arrival and departure — operated from Rajkot while the total passenger movement was 33,858. In April there was a drastic fall in passenger movement, which dropped to 15,896, despite the fact that there wasn’t much reduction in number of flights. The flight movement of April of 346, a marginal reduction of 44 compared to March. The airport authority had after much coaxing convinced the private airlines to start operations at Rajkot. To compensate airlines’ loss from passenger income, the airport authority had also taken the approval to start air cargo service.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/pandemic-grounds-flight-operations-from-rajkot/articleshow/82612769.cms||---

While giving permission to set up these mini Covid care centres, the UT administration had already clarified to the associations and NGOs running them to ensure that out of the total bed capacity, 80% was of oxygen support.

He had requested the high court to grant him bail and allow him to go for Ayurveda treatment in Haridwar. The court has adjourned the matter till May 21. The decision of adjournment was taken by the division bench of Justice Sandeep Mehta and Justice Devendra Kachhawaha following a medical report by AIIMS advising completion of his isolation period. Before this, his counsel from Delhi, Siddharth Luthra, appearing through video conferencing, argued that his client had been suffering from heart ailments along with other diseases and he wanted to undergo preferably an Ayurveda treatment for these physical problems. On the other hand, protesting against these arguments, public prosecutor Anil Joshi argued that currently Asaram has been undergoing treatment for Covid at AIIMS and until he is cured and completes his isolation period of 14 days, there was no point in arguing on bail plea. Joshi also argued citing the medical report that the report by AIIMS has not pointed to any other physical ailment as stated by Asaram, he has been suffering from. Hearing the arguments of both the sides, the court observed that looking at the old age and medical conditions, Asaram’s treatment should be continued at AIIMS-Jodhpur under supervision of the doctors/specialists. Asaram had tested positive for corona virus in Jodhpur Central Jail and had been admitted to MG Hospital on the night of May 5 after he had complained of breathing difficulty. Two days later, he was shifted to AIIMS, where he has been undergoing treatment. His condition is stated to be stable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-hc-adjourns-hearing-on-asarams-bail-plea-till-may-21/articleshow/82616140.cms||---

About 40% of parents are facing difficulties paying school fees this year after the lockdown, a recent survey found. As businesses and jobs have been hit hard, parents are focusing more on savings and seeking easy instalments for fees, according to a media statement. The survey comes ahead of the Gujarat high court’s verdict on fixing school fees for the current academic year. It was carried out by a leading Gujarat-based fintech firm, Credin. Some 30,000 parents were invited to participate in the survey of whom 50% responded to questions related to their economic condition and other financial aspects. The company runs a Credin Shiksha programme, which helps parents to pay school fees on time which they can repay in instalments with 0% interest. According to the survey, 55% of parents want to keep liquidity in hand looking at the uncertainty around and want to delay paying school fees. Sixty eight per cent of parents observed an impact to their income due to the pandemic and believe it may take time to settle. “Not that people are unwilling to pay the fees. Sixty percent of parents are seeking instalment facilities to pay school fees. Hoping to hear some good news, 40% of parents delay payment of fees as they are expecting more discounts in fees from schools and the government,” according to the survey findings. The study also revealed changing mindsets of people living in fear and uncertainty. Fifty one per cent of parents believe that as Covid-19 is going to affect normal life this year too, schools should opt for online study model only. Seventy per cent of parents don’t want to send their children to school till they are not completely sure about the end of this pandemic, it showed. “With the Credin Shiksha programme, we are helping parents pay school fees easily and it’s creating a huge impact. Schools need fees as they have to manage fixed expenses, staff salaries, and the cost of managing digital learning platforms. With the Credin Shiksha programme, we offer a winwin solution for both educational institutions and parents,” said Birju Naik, co-founder, Credin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/40-of-parents-finding-it-tough-to-pay-fees-survey/articleshow/82614001.cms||---

The probe report, submitted to the DM on Thursday alleged that two of the five patients died at least two hours before the claimed time by the hospital while the "remaining deaths happened during the time when oxygen supply was allegedly cut". The report also maintained that the "hospital had enough medical oxygen for the entire day". The hospital administration had claimed that they had been continuously updating the status regarding oxygen availability to the local nodal officer, but despite that they didn’t receive the supply as a result of which their oxygen stock finished around 1.30 on the intervening night of May 3 and 4. By the time oxygen was restored about 30 minutes later, five patients – three elderly and two young – had passed away, the hospital had said. “The hospital didn't write hypoxia [lack of oxygen] as cause of death anywhere in the audit. Two of the five individuals died a couple of hours before they had claimed that the oxygen supply was disrupted. Also, it has been found that the hospital didn’t use proper channels to alert administration of the oxygen crisis,” said a senior administrative official involved in the probe. Commenting on the probe report's claims, Dr Vishal Dhain, owner of the Vinay Vishal hospital where the alleged deaths occurred, accepted the fact that two persons died prior to the incident. “This misinformation was shared to the administration as the hospital staff was in panic due to other deaths that had happened because of oxygen supply disruption. We did not mention hypoxia in death reports because the patients were grappling with Covid pneumonia,” he added. Haridwar DM confirmed that he received the probe report and action has been initiated against the hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/magisterial-probe-into-roorkee-hosp-deaths-reveals-patients-didnt-die-of-lack-of-oxygen/articleshow/82612774.cms||Ishita Mishra

The guards had to carry the man on their shoulders for four kilometres till they reached an ambulance vehicle, which then ferried him to a hospital in Gopeshwar, about 80 kilometres from his village in Chamoli, on Thursday. The patient had returned from New Delhi earlier this month. He was in home isolation after he tested positive for Covid-19. Prakash Pallav, nayab tehsildar from Gairsain told TOI that he had received a call from Dr Anita Kumari, a medical officer in the area, on Thursday evening, requesting for help in carrying a patient to the hospital. “The 45-year-old man was staying in Suryani Malli village, which can only be reached after trekking four kilometres from the main road of the village. We decided to send a medical team on the spot and four personnel from PRD and home guards. The patient was then referred to Gopeshwar as his oxygen level was low. Our jawans ferried him on a cot on their shoulders and shifted him in an ambulance,” added Prakash.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/four-guards-come-to-rescue-of-covid-critical-patient-gasping-for-breath-in-gairsain-village/articleshow/82612761.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Doctors to do Covid duty even as stir goes on||AHMEDABAD: The teachers of six government-run medical colleges and eight GMERS colleges, who are holding protests against the government to press for their demands, will continue with their Covid duty. After a meeting with senior government officials on Thursday, the members of Gujarat Medical Teachers Association (GMTA) and GMERS Faculty Association said that only those faculty members attending non-Covid duty will strike work. “The government has accepted 10 of our 13 demands that we had put before them. We will continue the protest while ensuring that Covid duties are not affected. We are hopeful that the government will accept our remaining demands too,” said a member of GMTA. GMTA, which represents about 1,700 professors and lecturers of six government medical colleges, had called for a hunger strike on Wednesday. If their demands are not met, they have threatened to strike work. GMERS Faculty Association, which represents 700 doctors, had earlier this week gone on strike to press their demands. The Junior Doctors Association (JDU) has also joined the protests. The demands of the medical teachers include higher non-practising allowance in line with the 7th Pay Commission recommendations. Another demand is the abolition of contract appointments. As medical college teachers are barred from private practice, an allowance is paid to them as compensation. GMTA has demanded that such teachers be allowed to start private practice after 10 years of regular service. Citing a government resolution of 2017, GMTA also sought an increase in the cap on salaries. Promotions of faculty members at GMERS colleges have been pending for long too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/docs-to-do-covid-duty-even-as-stir-goes-on/articleshow/82614086.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Curbs cause fuel sales to drop||AHMEDABAD: Reduced traffic movement and discontinuation of public transport due to second wave of Covid had hit fuel demand in Gujarat. The sale of petrol as well as diesel has clearly declined in April this year vis-à-vis March, despite lockdown-like restrictions getting imposed only from April 29. Petrol sale went down by 17% from 2.64 lakh kilo litre (KL) in March to 2.22 lakh KL in April. During the same period, diesel demand declined by 19% from 5.2 lakh KL to 4.21 lakh KL, according to data by Federation of Gujarat State Petroleum Dealers’ Association (FGSPDA). Decline in fuel sale is a clear reflection of restricted or limited movement of vehicles. “Most offices have shifted to work from home again and people are apprehensive of stepping out for anything other than emergencies. Moreover, travel has also taken a hit due to local restrictions and lockdowns in various other states. With little movement, fuel sale is bound to get impacted,” said Arvind Thakkar, president, FGSPDA. Despite allowing transport movement amid lockdown-like curbs, diesel sale showed a steeper decline due to lack of demand for goods and raw materials. “Various vehicles are off the road because of the second wave. While demand has gone down from manufacturing to retail segments, a number of transport drivers or their families have also got affected by Covid. As a consequence, transport vehicle movement has reduced,” said Mukesh Dave, president, Akhil Gujarat Truck Transporters’ Association. Individual fuel stations have reported steeper decline in sale of petrol and diesel by up to 30%. Padmajay Rathod, an Ahmedabad-based petroleum dealer, said, “The average sale in April was way less than what it was in March and this month it has further deteriorated by 30%. Since our staffers report for duty, we have to pay them. With decline in sale, meeting operational expenses remains a challenge.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/curbs-cause-fuel-sales-to-drop/articleshow/82614169.cms||Niyati Parikh

---||Dehradun||Notice to 4 private hospitals for not treating patients under Atal Ayushman scheme||DEHRADUN: The authorities of Uttarakhand Atal Ayushman health insurance scheme on Thursday issued notice to four private hospitals in the state capital for allegedly not treating Covid patients under the scheme. The hospitals have been asked to immediately start free Covid-19 treatment of patients with Atal Ayushman card and action will be taken under the Epidemic Diseases Act, if they fail to follow the instruction. President of the state health authority, DK Kotia, said that reports of many hospitals across the state not providing free treatment under the scheme have surfaced. “After investigating the patients' complaints, we found them to be true in some cases. We found that people with Atal Ayushman cards have paid full bills in private hospitals which are empaneled with us and have been directed to give free Covid treatment,” Kotia added. The official further said that the hospital management has been asked to take immediate action for Covid treatment of patients with golden cards. The department will initiate legal proceedings against them if they don't. “We have found complaints from Dehradun based Mahant Indresh Hospital, CMI hospital, Kalindi Hospital and Velmed Hospital. If they don't start treatment as per protocol, action will be taken against them under Clinical Establishment Act/ Disaster Management Act, 2005 and the Regulatory Committee, and the 19th and 20th September 2017,” Kotia said. Commenting on the notice, Dr Mahesh Kudiyal, owner of CMI Hospital, told TOI that he has already ordered the hospital staff to ensure free treatment of Covid patients with golden cards. “I will take action against my staff if they turn away patients,” he said. Bhupender Raturi, public relations officer of Mahant Indresh Hospital, said that the hospital hasn’t received any notice so far. “We are the biggest private partner of the Uttarakhand Atal Ayushman scheme. The case on which notice has been issued will be checked,” he added. Sourabh Sharma, Velmed Hospital, told TOI that the hospital is presently empanelled and authorised only for cardiac and orthopedic services under Atal Ayushman scheme. "As per directions, we are awaiting the written authorisation for admission and treatment of Covid-19 patients to be able to serve the community in pandemic times," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/notice-to-4-pvt-hosps-for-not-treating-patients-under-atal-ayushman-scheme/articleshow/82612777.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Dehradun||Perform Eid prayers at home, urges Dehradun's shahar qazi||Dehradun: With the festival of Eid-ul-fitr set to be celebrated on Friday amidst the rising Covid-19 crisis across the state, Dehradun’s Shahar Qazi Mohammad Ahmed Kasmi has appealed to the community to offer their prayers at home and follow the Covid guidelines issued by the state government. Qasmi told TOI that Muslims have to fulfill their duty towards society by making sure that the virus doesn’t spread among the public. “It is important that people are more concerned about making sure that Covid isn’t spreading, rather than performing their 'namaz' on Eid. I urge everyone to follow the guidelines laid down by the state and even if they are offering their prayers with very few people inside a mosque, social distancing should be strictly maintained,” said Kasmi. Many mosques have adopted an interesting technique of ensuring that the turnout for Eid 'namaz' remains low. The mosques have announced that they will conduct the prayers at 6am which is way too early than the traditional prayers - which is usually at 9-9.30am. Conducting prayers early in the morning will ensure that the turnout remains relatively low. Meanwhile, Uttarakhand DGP Ashok Kumar has announced that only up to five persons will be allowed inside a mosque on Eid day. Traders, who deal in Eid-centric products which are normally in high demand during the festive season, have been hit hard this year as well. "Our business of Itar (fragrance) and other Eid centric products like skull caps has taken a hit this time as well. We went to Uttar Pradesh to buy the stock in bulk prior to the start of the month of Ramzan, and didn’t expect another Covid surge. People are now not keen on spending too much," said Hafiz Laiq, who owns a shop in Paltan Bazaar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/perform-eid-prayers-at-home-urges-dehraduns-shahar-qazi/articleshow/82612790.cms||Mohammad Anab

To make it convenient for the disabled persons to get themselves vaccinated, the centre has also provided drive-in facility. School chairman Guruprasad Pawaskar said that free transportation is also being provided for persons with disabilities staying in and around Porvorim to come to Sanjay School for vaccination. “We are getting a very good response for this special vaccination drive. Parents of these children with disabilities are glad for the facilities being provided. There is also a request from parents to offer similar facilities for vaccination in South Goa, as it is very difficult for them to cover long distances for the vaccination with persons with disabilities,” said Pawaskar. He said that persons with disabilities have inherent challenges in maintaining physical distancing, wearing masks and following the other SOPs, which calls for special measures to be put in place for their vaccination. “They have to be handled with extreme care, caution and empathy. Some of them have very low immunity because of various health issues and they may get infected very fast with Covid,” he said. “I thank the chief minister and the health minister for considering my request and giving permission for this special centre to vaccinate persons with disabilities,” Pawaskar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/drive-in-transport-facility-for-persons-with-disabilities/articleshow/82618310.cms||---

Around 24 persons had tested positive on May 3 and hence the block medical officer suspended sample collection there. After people’s objection and news reports, the medical officer resumed sampling work by setting up a camp on Thursday. Residents fear the long gap in sampling could be dangerous and a large number of persons might have got infected during the past nine days. Kanera gram panchayat falls under Nimbaheda panchayat samiti and has 24 villages in it. Most of the villagers in the area come to Kanera because of the proximity. After the block medical officer stopped sample collection, villagers had to travel 40km to Nimbahera or Chittorgarh. Sarpanch Ramchandra Malviya said people from 24 villages prefer to come to Kanera as the CHC here also has a quarantine facility and people do not need to travel far for treatment. Dr Sunil Kuimar Teli, block medical officer, said the department is doing sampling on roster basis. “We have limited manpower and hence sampling is being done on a roster basis. Testing is not a cure; to get well one has to take medicines. If one is found positive he has to take medicines and so our focus is on treatment not on testing.” The medical officer also said that those tested positive have been isolated and those who came in contact, too, have been warned to stay quarantined.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sampling-resumes-in-chittor-village-after-9-days/articleshow/82616199.cms||---

However, not even a single of these ventilators worked for even a day, causing great inconvenience to severely ill Covid-infected patients. This is despite the district recording 8,159 coronavirus cases and 95 related fatalities so far. Locals say that some Covid-19 patients have even died due to the lack of ventilator support in the district. When queried on the issue, Dr RG Nautiyal, principal of Almora Medical College, told TOI, “The ventilators are in working condition but the medical staff here has not received the training on how to use them. We are trying to make sure that these ventilators are put to use soon.” Meanwhile, Dr Savita Hayanki, chief medical officer, Almora, told TOI, “The district has more than 40 ventilators. We are also setting up a temporary ICU facility with a 12-bed capacity.

---||Delhi||Court rejects Navneet Kalra’s anticipatory bail plea in O2 concentrator case||NEW DELHI: Observing that businessman Navneet Kalra’s custodial interrogation was required to unearth the conspiracy behind the alleged hoarding and black marketing of oxygen concentrators in the capital, a Delhi sessions court on Thursday dismissed his anticipatory bail plea. Additional sessions judge Sandeep Garg further noted that the allegations against Kalra were serious. The bail order stated, “There is prima facie incriminating evidence on record against the applicant/accused, i.e. the concentrators being sold by applicant/accused were not manufactured with German collaboration and were manufactured in China. They were not having adequate output so as to meet the requirements of even one person”. According to reports of a testing lab, Shriram Institute for Industrial Research, which the police relied upon in respect of two oxygen concentrators seized from the premises owned by Kalra, the average output in terms of oxygen purity was found to be 32.7 % and 38.2 %. “With the laboratory room air, the oxygen concentration was found to be merely 20.8 %. As per the statement of one aggrieved, the applicant/accused had firstly quoted the price of the oxygen concentrator as Rs 49,999 and on the next day, he forced him to pay Rs 55,000, owing to his urgent requirement,” it was alleged. The police had alleged that he made fraudulent representations that he was selling premium portable oxygen concentrators, manufactured with German collaboration, which were sufficient to meet the requirements of two people. However, he allegedly collected advance payments from several needy people for supply of oxygen concentrators and he kept postponing the delivery on the pretext of shipment being held-up. As a result, he reportedly kept increasing the price of the machines and eventually, neither did he supply the product nor was the amount refunded. Pahwa pointed out that his client had only carried out a legitimate transaction of import. “Customs authorities were activated. Customs was aware of the transaction. The GST is deposited with the government. Invoices are given, returns are filed,” the counsel argued. Seeking anticipatory bail for Kalra, senior advocate Vikas Pahwa argued that all rules had been complied with and the transactions of sale were through banking channels. “Oxygen concentrators are not cosmetic, they are not for luxury. It is only (for use) when someone is medically unfit or someone is dying. When selling it through banking channels, where is the offence?” asked Pahwa. He also submitted that there were police officials, judicial officers, politicians, neighbours and friends who had purchased the machines for emergency use, and not for luxury. “Custodial interrogation of applicant/accused is required to be carried out to unearth the entire conspiracy hatched between him and a number of co-accused people…the possibility of applicant/accused tampering with the evidence or intimidating the prosecution witnesses cannot be ruled out. Therefore, no case for grant of anticipatory bail is made out. The application is accordingly dismissed. Nothing expressed herein above shall tantamount to expression of opinion on merits of the case,” held the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-rejects-kalras-anticipatory-bail-plea-in-o2-concentrator-case/articleshow/82616278.cms||Aamir Khan

---||Patna||Patna high court refuses urgent hearing on Pappu Yadav’s bail plea||PATNA: The Patna high court on Wednesday refused urgent hearing in a criminal writ petition and regular bail matter of former MP and JAP chief Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav, who was arrested on Tuesday in a 32-year-old kidnapping case and sent to jail. A Madhepura court has issued non-bailable warrant against him for not appearing in the trial despite notices served on him. Counsel Yogesh Chandra Verma appeared before the division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Kumar and prayed for an urgent hearing on his matter on Wednesday itself. However, the high court directed Verma to adopt the present procedure of sending email for mentioning the case for its urgent hearing on which a decision would be taken. Later in the day, Verma sent an email. A criminal writ petition was filed on October 19 last year for quashing of the FIR against him in the kidnapping case lodged with Murliganj police station in Madhepura and quashing of the lower court order to issue non-bailable warrant against him in September last year. This petition is pending for hearing. Besides, an interlocutory petition (IA) was also filed urging for granting Pappu regular bail on the plea that his arrest was malafide and aimed at settling political scores for his public work amid pandemic and teaching him a lesson. The IA mentions how Pappu on May 7 exposed that ambulances purchased from MPLAD fund of Saran MP Rajeev Pratap Rudy were lying covered and unused at Amnaur in Saran amid pandemic. It also mentioned that Pappu had undergone gallbladder surgery three months back and was risking his life while helping the Covid-19 patients. Verma submitted that an extraordinary situation is present at Madhepura bar where lawyers had passed a resolution to abstain from any court hearing during the pandemic due to which regular bail prayer is being directly made before the high court. Pappu was granted bail by a lower court long back in the kidnapping case as police had delayed in filing the chargesheet. But, later, he did not appear in the court during case trial, leading to non-bailable warrant against him. Meanwhile, Madhepura SP Yogendra Kumar said Pappu was produced before ACJM-I court on Tuesday night after which he was sent to Birpur sub-jail in neighbouring Supaul district. "It is presently serving as an interim jail for new inmates to spend a 14-day quarantine period," the SP said and added he would be later brought to Madhepura jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hc-refuses-urgent-hearing-on-pappu-yadavs-bail-plea/articleshow/82583933.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The authorities of Devasthanam board have been asked to make necessary arrangements for the same. The Char Dham Yatra was slated to start from today with the opening of Yamunotri temple portals in Uttarkashi. The portals of Gangotri will open on Saturday while Kedarnath and Badrinath portals will open on May 17 and 18 respectively. The government, earlier this month, had suspended the yatra for pilgrims until further orders. Notably, even last year, the Char Dham Yatra had started for people of Uttarakhand on July 1 due to the rise in Covid cases. As per the estimate of Devsathanam board, over 3.2 lakh devotees visited Char Dham temples, including Kedarnath, Badrinath, Gangotri and Yamunotri, among which more than 90% visited Badrinath and Kedarnath temples. “Respecting the sentiments of the devotees at this time of crisis, we are preparing to organise virtual darshan of Char Dham. People will be able to take a glimpse of the gods on a click of their remote. I spoke to the chief minister and he gave permission for the same,” said the tourism minister. Chief executive officer (CEO) of Devasthanam Board Ravinath Raman has been directed to arrange online “darshan” and other related arrangements for the same. Suresh Semwal, chief of Char Dham Teerth Purohit Mahapanchayat, informed that the palanquin of goddess Yamuna will start its journey to Yamunotri temple from Kharsali village today morning and will reach the temple around 11am. The portals will be open after 12pm and only 25 people will participate in the portal opening ceremony, and all of them have a negative RT-PCR report. “We will start the doli yatra of goddess Ganga from Mukhba village today in the evening and it will reach Gangotri shrine on Saturday when its portals are to open,” Semwal added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/no-char-dham-yatra-this-yr-tourism-dept-announces-online-darshan-of-aarti-at-shrines/articleshow/82612813.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Nagpur||After deaths of 2 tiger cubs, irri dept to cover canal wells||Nagpur: Stung by the death of two tiger cubs in a siphon well in Tekepar lift irrigation canal, 15km from Bhandara, on Wednesday, the forest and irrigation department conducted a joint inspection of the canal to take up mitigation measures to avert such tragedies. “As a temporary step till funds are approved, the forest department has decided to cover these wells with bamboo mats,” said irrigation department officials. On Wednesday, two month-old female tiger cubs drowned in one of the wells adjoining protected forests in Garada (Buzruk). “The cubs’ death is a wake-up call. The Tekepar canal is 10.5-km-long and almost 6km portion cuts through the forest area. There are 32 such siphon wells and we have asked the irrigation department to cover all of them so that no more animals die,” said P Kalyan Kumar, chief conservator of forests (CCF), Nagpur Circle, who visited the site with other officials. DyCF SB Bhalavi, ACF Yashwant Nagulwar, RFO Vivek Rajurkar, irrigation department executive engineer DK Manwatkar, junior engineer Yashwant Gaidhani, Bhandara honorary wildlife wardens Pervez Shahid Khan and Nadeem Khan were part of the joint inspection. CCF Kumar will submit a detailed report to the state government soon. Ravi Parate, SE (minor irrigation), Bhandara, said, “The canal was constructed before 1998 as per design prevalent that time to cater to 5,500-hectare agriculture lands. We will now propose covering the wells either with RCC slabs or steel grills. In a day or two estimates will be prepared and funds will be sought in the current financial year budget and the money will be sought under DPDC. A proposal will be submitted to the VIDC soon.” CCF Kumar said, “We need a long-term solution to the problem. Even domestic animals and reptiles cannot be saved if they fall in these water-filled siphon wells. There are several such canals in the district passing through forests. I’ve asked the irrigation department to prepare a detailed report on the length of these canals and the number of siphon wells and estimates. We will talk to all authorities for funds.” As steel grills can be stolen, honorary wardens Shahid Khan and Nadeem Khan pushed for building ramps so that animals can come out easily even if they fall inside. However, Parate says, “As we have to drain out rainwater from these wells concrete slabs will be the best possible solution as of now. These slabs also cannot be stolen.” Generally, mother tigress doesn’t leave small cubs alone. After cubs were found dead it was feared that mother must be missing. However, on Wednesday four camera traps were placed near the well and the tigress did a frantic search of the entire area near the well. “One of the camera trap pictures showed how the tigress peeped inside the well to cross-check the cubs. It is possible that the cubs must have slipped inside while playing when the tigress was away to make a kill,” said forest officials. They said the tigress was from the second litter of Koka wildlife sanctuary’s dominant tigress T-10, nicknamed Mastani. The spot where the cubs were found dead is connected to Koka and further to Dawdipar and Umred-Karhandla-Paoni wildlife sanctuary. “We had recorded pugmark of a male tiger near Bela-Korambi near Jawaharnagar railway line a few days ago. We suspect the male to be a partner of the Garada tigress. There is an urgent need to conduct a survey of tigers in the entire Bhandara forest division,” said Khan.

---||Dehradun||Ventilators unused in government facilities in Haridwar & Almora for lack of staff||HARIDWAR /ALMORA: Precious medical equipment like ventilators, which can save many lives during the pandemic, are lying unused in various government Covid facilities due to the lack of staff trained to use them. For example, Haridwar, which is the second worst Covid-29 affected district in Uttarakhand, has 64 ventilators in government Covid hospitals but lacks trained staff to operate them. As a result, families of critical patients have to look for ICU and ventilator beds in private hospitals. The ventilators were arranged last year as part of the preparations for this year’s Kumbh mela but the health department never used the machines or made effective preparations to deploy them. Even a 150-bed Covid care centre, jointly run by the state government and yoga guru Ramdev’s Patanjali Yogpeeth, has 10 ventilators but so far none of these has been used. Local residents alleged that the centre is deliberately not admitting seriously ill patients or using its ventilators to avoid showing any fatalities. “During the inauguration of the centre on May 5, Ramdev had said that patients will be treated holistically and all of them will get cured at his centre. That is why they are refraining from taking critically-ill patients and admitting only moderate cases,” alleged Anuj Sharma, a local resident whose 66-year-old Covid-positive mother died after being admitted in the centre on May 6. Social activist Dr Vishal Garg told TOI, “I receive five to six calls daily for ICU beds and ventilators but there are limited beds in private hospitals, and government ventilators are useless. I knew many people who died due to lack of availability of ICU and ventilators in Haridwar but neither the government nor the district administration is taking the situation of Haridwar seriously.” Chief medical officer of Haridwar Dr S K Jha when queried about the situation, said, “We have 64 ventilators but due to lack of staff, we could not operate them. As far as the base hospital run by Baba Ramdev and the government is concerned, we did not get staff from the Srinagar base hospital to run the ventilators and as a result have not been able to admit serious patients yet. We handed over 28 of our ventilators to private hospitals and have asked them to take ventilators from us on demand.” A similar situation regarding ventilators is being witnessed in Almora district, which has a total of 34 ventilators in government Covid facilities but not even one can be used causing great inconvenience to severely ill patients. The district has recorded 8,424 cases and 98 fatalities due to Covid since April last year. Locals said that many patients have died due to the lack of ventilator support in the district. Asked to comment on the matter, Dr R G Nautiyal, principal of Almora Medical College, told TOI, “The ventilators are in working condition but the medical staff here has not received the training to use them. We are trying to make sure that these ventilators are put to use soon.” Dr Savita Hayanki, chief medical officer, Almora, added, “The district has more than 40 ventilators. We are setting up a temporary ICU facility with a 12-bed capacity. In addition, the state will have a functional oxygen plant by May 25.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ventilators-lying-unused-in-covid-facilities-no-trained-staff-to-operate-them/articleshow/82612829.cms||MS Nawaz
---||Lucknow||Appalling healthcare at Lokbandhu & Balrampur hospitals, claim patients||LUCKNOW: The two days that the mother of Prateek Mishra, a resident of Gomtinagar, had to spend at a Covid hospital was such a nightmare that she had to “literally run away from there”, shifting to another facility when the first opportunity came. Like Mishra, a number of patients are having a harrowing time allegedly due to lack of facilities at a few Covid hospitals, especially Lokbandhu and Balrampur hospitals. However, the hospital authorities have denied charges claiming that there may be a few people who are not satisfied but efforts are being made to provide best facilities and treatment to patients. Prateek said the horror started on April 24 night when he reached Lokbandhu hospital with his critically ill mother. He found that nine ambulances were already waiting at the gates. The hospital had wrongly updated at Covid control room that it had 10 vacancies, while there were none. “After a six-hour wait, patients got temporary beds after a senior officer intervened. However, the cylinder soon ran out of oxygen. Despite repeated pleadings, the staff replaced it only after canisters of three other patients got empty. The clothes and a water bottle I left for my mother were delivered to her the next day when I threatened to lodge a complaint. Later in the night, she called to inform about poor sanitation and stale food. She said nobody was helping her with oxygen. Fearing for her life, I used all my resources to get her shifted to KGMU on April 26,” said the businessman, while sharing video clips he made during his hospital visits, as evidence. Ashutosh Singh’s uncle also had to wait for four hours at the gates before getting a bed at Lokbandhu Hospital on April 29. “My uncle was put on oxygen concentrator support nobody came for hours to start treatment. When uncle’s oxygen dipped to 35% and his daughter raised an alarm, he was given some injections. Daily, we had to bring oxygen cylinders on a stretcher from the supply area on our own,” he said. “Our patience gave way on May 4, when a doctor told the girl that her father is unlikely to survive and submitted a discharge slip on the family’s behalf. Consequently, uncle’s third Remdesivir dose was cancelled. It was administered only after we spoke to the director. On May 6, we got our patient shifted to DRDO hospital,” Singh added. Rashmi Agarwal (48) of Hazratganj blamed Balrampur Hospital for her husband’s demise. “He was admitted on April 15 with low oxygen level and acute chest pain. We pleaded for a CT scan but the authorities kept delaying till his condition deteriorated. They conducted an X-ray on the tenth day that showed Covid pneumonia with 70% lungs infected. Our request for an ICU was denied citing oxygen crisis, but on April 28, when his oxygen level dropped further, doctors first made him lie in prone position and later shifted him to the ICU. It was too late by then,” he said. He was the only bread winner for the family of four. Suresh Ram (63), father of Satish Bharti of Adilnagar, was admitted to Balrampur hospital on April 14. “Though tested negative on April 25, he is still under treatment because of post-Covid complications. From giving medicines to the patient to helping him with meals and sponging, I do everything after wearing gloves, a face mask, and a face shield, which I had to buy myself,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/appalling-healthcare-at-lokbandhu-balrampur-hosps-claim-patients/articleshow/82618346.cms||Yusra Husain
---||Patna||Lockdown extended in Bihar till May 25, shop timings tweaked||PATNA: The Bihar government on Thursday extended the lockdown for another 10 days while revising the timing of the opening of shops selling essential items. Shops in urban areas will open between 6 am and 10 am while the timing will be 8 am-12noon for rural areas. Also, the number of guests allowed at weddings has been cut to 20 with a ban on 'Baraat' and loudspeakers. CM Nitish Kumar on Thursday afternoon posted a tweet announcing the extension of the lockdown from May 16 to May 25. Nitish said in his tweet that a positive response to the lockdown and after discussion with cabinet ministers and senior officers, it has been decided to extend the lockdown by 10 days. The state had imposed a lockdown from May 5 to 15 in the wake of the massive surge in Covid-19 cases. Briefing on the guidelines for the extension, chief secretary Tripurari Sharan said, "The lockdown was imposed to curb the spread of Coronavirus. A review meeting was held at the level of the chief minister on Wednesday to take feedback from DMs and other field officers. Another meeting was held at the government level on Thursday and it was finally decided to extend the lockdown by 10 days and keep it up to May 25." Additional chief secretary (home) Chaitanya Prasad said, "Against the existing time slot of 7 am to 11 am for essential shops, it will now open from 6 am to 10 am in urban areas and 8 am to 12noon in rural areas." He added that shops dealing in construction raw material, hardware and seeds and fertilisers will be allowed to open from 6 am to 10 am on Monday and Thursday. The daily caseload of Covid in Bihar has come down from over 15,000 to less than 10,000 in the past 10 days. The active cases of Covid-19 patients also dropped below 1lakh after 22 days on Wednesday. "The Covid positivity rate in Bihar came down from 15.7% on May 2 to 8.9% on May 11. It was definitely due to the impact of the lockdown," Pratyaya Amrit, additional chief secretary (health) said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/lockdown-extended-in-bihar-till-may-25-shop-timings-tweaked/articleshow/82615245.cms||Piyush Tripathi
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Teachers take additional load to keep e-classes going||KOLKATA: Almost every city school has teachers, who are battling Covid at different stages. While some are serious, a few have succumbed to the illness. Family members of many teachers are affected, too. In a scenario like this, schools are continuously making efforts to keep the online routine going smoothly for students, with teachers taking on additional load so that classes don’t suffer. In this second year of online education, the pattern of teaching has changed so as to reach out to those who have under-performed last year. Each child is being made to write and submit more and more assignments so that teachers are sure that they are able to pick up the threads of the concepts. As a result, the load of online corrections is huge and teachers are making the transition from exercise copies to e-corrections. Schools said that while in junior classes, where the load of work is comparatively less, in senior classes, a lot of learning lag has been carried forward from last year so no gaps in online classes can be allowed. With colleagues ill, teachers have volunteered to take additional load — many with mild symptoms have volunteered to continue teaching with the camera off, standing in for those who have lost family members. At Heritage School more than 12 teachers were down with Covid. While one teacher was hospitalised, several of those affected lost family members. “When the routine is being shuffled to keep the classes going, we simply took the additional load to keep the classes running,” said Seema Sapru, principal of the school. The school’s former vice principal, David Rao, and the present college section principal, Pranay Chowdhury, succumbed to Covid. The headmaster of one of the St Augustine schools and 10 teachers across its Kolkata branches are seriously ill, said head Richard Gasper. At DPS Ruby Park, a teacher passed away recently, more than 20 tested Covid-positive, some had to be hospitalised and some lost their family members. “Even as sad news kept coming in, other teachers stood in for their colleagues, knowing well that the future is uncertain for everyone,” said Indrani Chattopadhyay, vice principal of DPS Ruby Park. With more than 10 teachers affected by Covid with their entire family, the atmosphere at Lakshmipat Singhania Academy is very tense. “In senior classes, to stand in for another teacher is not easy but not a single class went blank, thanks to the others. One such teacher who teachers English in classes IX and X joined work two days after she lost her father, saying that she wanted to keep her mind distracted and the children needed her attention. Hats off to my teachers,” said Meena Kak, director of Lakshmipat Singhania Academy. At Birla High School, there are 10 affected teachers. One of them lost her father one day and mother the next and her husband is in ICU. “Our teachers lived up to the situation just like soldiers,” said principal Loveleen Saigal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/teachers-take-addl-load-to-keep-e-classes-going/articleshow/82614186.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Jodhpur||Jodhpur rural areas turn Covid epicentre with 43% positive cases||JODHPUR: With over 43% positive cases reported in 11 sub-divisions of Jodhpur district in first 10 days of May, rural areas have emerged as new epicentres of the burgeoning Covid-19 crisis. Out of 20,336 persons tested positive from May 1 to 10 officially, 8,770 belonged to rural areas of the district. This is a spike of staggering 9% over the cases reported in last 10 days of the previous month i.e. from April 21 to April 30. Going by the same percentage as a conservative approach, the situation indicates that similar percentage of deaths might have been reported in rural areas, which is a major concern. It also points to lack of timely efforts by the administration to focus on rural areas to check the spread. Rattled by this devastating spike of positive cases in rural areas, the district magistrate visited many rural areas on Wednesday to review the situation and gave necessary directions to the SDMs concerned and medical staff. But according to a senior officer from medical and health department the rural areas were heavily neglected this time, which resulted in uncontrolled spike in positive cases. “There should have been a parallel focus on rural areas right from the beginning and both prevention and enforcement activities should have been put in place with a primary objective of reducing pressure on city hospital”, he said. He added that though the situation this time was different than that in the first wave but steps like door-to-door survey, contact tracing and isolation centres at early stage, when there were not much cases reported in rural areas, could have helped a lot. “Last time, we had paid regular visits to rural areas and steps taken to curb the spread ensured immediate contact tracing, isolating the infected person and setting up containment zones,” said the officer. TOI sought details of screening in rural areas done by the medical and health department but did not receive any response. Attributing this spike in rural areas to liberal lockdown and weddings, as well as other festive gatherings, SDM (Luni) Gopal Parihar said that people continued to commute to city for purchasing in public transport and many working outside visited the villages for these functions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/jodhpur-rural-areas-turn-covid-epicentre-with-43-positive-cases/articleshow/82616239.cms||---

As per the orders from the state government, the provision stores and ration shops were allowed to open till 1 pm on May 10. While Covid curfew had been in place from May 11 till the morning of May 18. With the ration shops closed since the beginning of the week, many residents are finding it difficult to get daily provisions. To extend relief, the mandi samiti is sending mobile vans to sell vegetables and fruits in several areas which residents say is not enough. SP Sharma, a resident of Johri village at Rajpur Road, said, “The ration shops should be allowed to open at least for two hours daily. Opening them once a week will make the city crowded as every one will move out to stock necessities that will last for a week. People living on the outskirts are facing this problem much more as they have to come to the city centre to get a monthly ration.” Another resident Yagyawrat Sharma said, “Imposing curfew may be the need of the hour, but the administration must think about a plan to ensure the supplies are also not affected. If there are five ration shops in a locality, then at least two should be allowed to open every day on rotation. The online service is available, but the delivery is only possible after a wait of at least three days.” “Niranjanpur mandi samiti is sending mobile vans for vegetables and fruits to the residents at wholesale rates, but it is not possible to provide it across the city daily. So, the shops must operate as usual for minimum hours," said Anju Mehta, a housewife in Dharampur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/residents-want-ration-shops-to-be-open-more-often/articleshow/82612826.cms||Abhijeet Singh

A city-based major private hospital has sent a team of its doctors to Hyderabad for a meeting with DRL officials to procure over 2,000 doses on a daily basis. “We have already sent a two-member team of our doctors to Hyderabad to hold meeting with senior officials from Dr Reddy’s Laboratories. We have already placed demand for at least 2,000 vaccines per day,” said Nitin Dangal, a senior doctor of a big private hospital from Nashik.“We have already tied up with over 10 large industries for vaccination and many are approaching us for it. We have huge plan for vaccination in the city if we get adequate doses of vaccines from DRL,” said Dangal. Meanwhile, president of private hospital owners’ association in Nashik Raj Nagarkar said that there is a dire need to vaccinate as many people as possible at the earliest. “It is really a positive development that Russia-made Sputnik V will be available for vaccination from next week. In fact, government should adopt an open policy, making the vaccine available with the doctors and medical stores in the markets to speed up vaccination process,” said Nagarkar.“Many private hospitals in the city are in touch with the laboratory to get Sputnik V, he said, adding that he himself has placed demand for 10,000 doses with the Dr Reddy’s Laboratories.Meanwhile, 24 of total 29 vaccination centres were operational in the city on Friday and around 8,125 doses of vaccines were administered to the beneficiaries above age of 45.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/private-hospitals-in-touch-with-dr-reddys-for-sputnik-v/articleshow/82638145.cms||Tushar Pawar

---||India||Government vows vaccine push, says will get 217 crore shots from August to December||NEW DELHI: Setting out its roadmap to vaccinate the around 95 crore 18-plus population, the Centre on Thursday said India should be able to access an estimated 217 crore anti-Covid shots between August and December. In the meantime, 51.6 crore doses have been ordered to cater to the demand till July. This includes 35.6 crore doses (including 1 crore from GAVI’s Covax facility) procured by the Centre, and 16 crore directly contracted by states and private hospitals. Responding to concerns over the slump in vaccinations due to lack of supplies for the 18-44 age group and plateauing in the 45-plus category, the government said the pace would pick up and access to vaccines made in India would be ramped up even as foreign vaccines may also become available over the next few months. Apart from the estimated production of Covishield and Covaxin which are currently in use, Russian Sputnik V — approved for emergency use and expected to be available in the market next week — the estimate of 216 crore doses is based on anticipated production indicated by companies of promising vaccine candidates currently under advanced stages of clinical trials. “You may say it is optimistic. Yes, this is optimistic. Is there a risk that it may not happen. Possible, but preparations are there. These are very promising vaccines,” said Dr V K Paul, Niti Aayog member and head of the National Expert Group for Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC). The total number of doses available would further rise to around 300 crore by the end of the first quarter of 2022, Dr Paul said. He said the estimates were based on lab and trial results. Of the total order of 35.6 crore doses placed by the Centre so far, 7.6 crore have been received and utilised, whereas 86% of the 12 crore doses procured in phase-2 have been received and the rest will be in by the end of this month. Between May and July, another 16 crore doses will be supplied as part of the Centre’s phase 3 procurement. In May alone, around 7.3 crore doses have been available through the Centre, states and private hospitals. The big push is expected between August and December, when Serum Institute of India is expected to manufacture around 75 crore doses, and 55 crore doses of Covaxin — now also being made in three public sector units apart from Bharat Biotech — are estimated to be available. Local manufacturing for Russia’s Sputnik V, currently being imported, will begin from July and 15.6 crore doses are expected to be available for local consumption in the indicated time period. Apart from these, the government is looking at Biological E's recombinant vaccine, being partnered with Baylor Medical College in the US, to provide 30 crore doses, besides vaccines from Cadila Healthcare, Gennova Pharma and Bharat Biotech’s nasal vaccine candidate. The projections also include Novavax, which SII will manufacture in India. The projections are “responsible” and have been indicated by the companies, Dr Paul said. “We are proud to say that over 2 billion doses in a matter of five months will be made in India for people of India. So there should be no two ways about it that vaccines will be available for all as we move forward,” he added. Emphasising the asymmetry in demand and supply of vaccines, Dr Paul said the new policy allowing states and private sector a role in procurement was a response to popular demand and insistence of states for a say. The distribution was thus divided between the Centre that kept 50% production for the priority 45-plus group and divvied up the rest between states and private hospitals. In a pandemic situation across the globe, prioritisation of vaccine recipients was necessary, he said. The government is also in regular talks with foreign vaccine manufacturers like Pfizer, Moderna and J&J asking them to make their vaccines available in India, Dr Paul said. “We would like these companies to bring their vaccines to India, partner with Indian firms, do technology transfer and also manufacture them here. Under the new policy, the channel is open and we will support them,” he added. The government has of late also relaxed the regulatory norms for granting approval to such foreign developed and manufactured vaccines which have already been approved by credible global regulators like USFDA and UK’s MHRA etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/government-vows-vaccine-push-says-will-get-217-crore-shots-from-august-to-december/articleshow/82620912.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: 15 flights cancelled in a single day||AHMEDABAD: Fifteen flights operating from Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International (SVPI) airport in Ahmedabad were cancelled on Thursday. These include flights to Lucknow, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi, Chandigarh, Goa, Dehradun, Jaipur, and Chennai. Flights were cancelled due to operational constraints, according to sources. This is primarily because of infrequent passenger movement at the city airport, and airlines are not finding it viable to operate flights with inadequate passenger load. On Wednesday, too, 16 flights were cancelled from the city airport. Flight cancellations have been widely reported since the second wave of Covid-19 infections gripped Gujarat and other parts of India. Amid widespread apprehensions over travelling, passenger footfalls have drastically reduced at city airport, according to airport sources. A drastic fall in passenger movement, especially in April, has made it unviable for airlines to operate aircraft as a result of which cancellations are more frequent. The fall in passenger movement at the airport is visible since March (5.16 lakh domestic passengers), when the passenger movement at the city airport marginally declined by 0.3% against February (5.17 lakh domestic passengers) according to data provided by Airports Authority of India (AAI). The air traffic movement data for April is yet to be tabled, but sources said that footfalls have dropped at SVPI. “The number of passengers travelling have reduced drastically over the past month and a half and only those who need to address emergencies are travelling. Moreover, the requirement of a mandatory RTPCR negative report imposed by the state authorities to travel to other states has made people more apprehensive about travelling,” said a tour operator based in Ahmedabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/15-flights-cancelled-in-a-single-day/articleshow/82614205.cms||---

---||Nagpur||‘Heatwaves on rise, NMC has no new action plan’||Nagpur: Despite scientists warning of rising instances of heatwaves in the region, the mandatory heat action plan seems to have only remained on paper, point out experts. The heat action plan aims to tackle temperature variability and climatic changes. It focuses on providing a framework for the implementation, coordination and evaluation of extreme heat response activities in a city so that negative health impact of extreme heat conditions can be reduced. According to experts, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) is allegedly putting the old plan on paper, without making the necessary changes every year. “Moreover, the plan doesn’t even seem to get implemented. NMC officials are not taking this seriously despite the situation getting worse,” said Kaustav Chatterjee, founder of NGO Green Vigil Foundation. The existing heat action plans of many cities in the region, which witnesses the highest number of deaths due to heatwaves, are merely dos and don’ts for citizens, said Suresh Chopane, founder of Chandrapur-based Green Planet Society. “Cities are turning into heat islands. Rising temperatures give rise to many viral and other diseases and not just heatstrokes. Taking this seriously, the heat action plans should focus on controlling these diseases and also ensuring medical facilities for the same,” he said. Suggesting some mitigation measures, Chatterjee said, “Installation of roadside safe drinking water facility is a must along with sprinklers for cool mist at railway and bus stations. Shelter and cool jackets and helmets should be provided to the police force standing in scorching heat. The working hours for labourers should also be changed.” Highlighting that green nets should be put up at testing and vaccination centres, Chatterjee said, “The government should release regular heat alerts through various forms of media to keep citizens aware. Implementation of rainwater harvesting and cool roofs which can reduce inside temperature by 2-4 degree Celsius should also be done.” Apart from increasing green cover, the local administration should also look at other aspects like curbing rise in temperature due to construction of cement roads, said Chopane. “Various local departments should come together to implement the plan,” he said. As reported by TOI recently, the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute’s (Neeri) environmental status report for the city stated that the average temperature and instances of heatwaves in Nagpur have been on a constant rise since last two decades. According to it, 80% of the years in 2000-2019 decades have their annual average temperature higher than the baseline value. Advice on heat action plan: - Focus and prepare for health problems due to rising temperature - Install roadside safe drinking water facility - Release regular heat alerts to aware citizens - Adopt cool roofs which reduce inside temperature by 2-4 degree Celsius - Implement rainwater harvesting - Ensure green nets and shelter at testing and vaccination centres - Curb rise in temperature from concretization of roads||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/heatwaves-on-rise-nmc-has-no-new-action-plan/articleshow/82616283.cms||Manka Behl

The order, experts hoped, will cut down time to start medical interventions for critical patients. The order says, “This has become extremely important to expedite the process from collections of RT-PCR Covid-19 testing samples to report generation of clinically unstable patients for quick medical intervention.” The order specifies that for critical patients from the point the collection agent picks up sample and logs in to Specimen Referral Form, it will be labelled in a special box and quickly transported to laboratory for testing. At the lab, such samples must be prioritised, the order says. According to the state, over 70,000 samples are being tested daily in RT-PCR mode in Bengal now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/prioritise-rt-pcr-test-for-serious-patients/articleshow/82614204.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

According to state administration, services like industrial output, medical, medicine, grocery, e-commerce, telecommunication and home delivery are essential and providers don’t require e-pass. Pharmacy owner Sanjay Shrivastav said, “Beat constables aren’t aware that medicine shops are under essential service and we don’t require e-pass to operate. We have to show a printout of the government website to cops.” Surgical equipment distributor Tushar Chawla claimed that downloading e-pass is not easy as the website often hangs and at times, e-pass is not generated. ADCP central zone Chiranjeevi Nath Sinha said, “All cops have been sensitised not to stop vehicles carrying medical equipment. In case of problem, people can contact ACP and ADCP of the area.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/exempt-from-e-pass-but-cops-stop-us/articleshow/82618370.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

They claimed that this could cripple the supply chain of essential commodities to Maharashtra. Abhishek Gupta of Bombay Goods Transport Association (BGTA) said: “The new rule is likely to hamper import-export trade, supply of vegetables, fruits and other essential commodities as it is contradictory to earlier statements for free movement of cargo.” Transport associations such as BGTA, All India Transporters Welfare Association (AITWA) and All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC) have opposed this. In a petition to the CM, Kultaran Singh Atwal of AIMTC said: “RT-PCR test reports are taking 48 hours in other states. The vehicle carrying goods/cargo from Delhi takes 72 hours to reach Maharashtra. Similarly, all south-India bound commercial vehicles coming from Rajasthan or Gujarat pass via Maharashtra only. How will they get the test done en route?” The petition says: “As per the order, drivers and cleaners must do Covid tests en route. They will have to abandon / leave the vehicle on the highway without any security of material, go inside the city, get a test done, wait for the report for 48 hours, then enter into Maharashtra. Frivers are not so capable to search and get the tests done.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-48-hour-rt-pcr-test-rule-for-cargo-carriers-opposed/articleshow/82618420.cms||Somit Sen
---||Kolkata||‘Unregulated oxygen usage at home leading to wastage’||KOLKATA: Unregulated use of medical oxygen for Covid patients in home quarantine is leading to a rampant waste in medical oxygen from portable cylinders leading to early drain out of cylinders and added pressure on refilling. At a time when the Centre as well as state is pleading hospitals to regulate use of medical oxygen in the wake of a nationwide oxygen crisis, wastage of oxygen at home — mostly due to lack of know how on oxygen cylinder operation by Covid patients or their relatives — has been worrying doctors, volunteers and medical fraternity. “Last week, relatives of a 94-year-old patient had drained out a 45-litre oxygen cylinder in less than five hours, which should have ideally lasted a day if used precisely. The family had set the pressure at its highest point which not only wasted a large quantity of gas but had even worsened the woman’s condition,” said Satyajit Das, a volunteer supplying oxygen to patients in need. Doctors have time and again reiterated on how too much oxygen can increase risk of death to patients with acute illness. “When oxygen saturation dips drastically, patient relatives often panic and allow excess oxygen to get in the body. It would temporarily increase the saturation, but in the absence of other therapies the saturation would fall again, which can even lead to sudden death,” said Kaushik Chaudhuri, senior pulmonologist at Beliaghata ID Hospital. Due to the increasing instances of wastage at home, some voluntary organisations have even stopped sending cylinders at home and have set up oxygen parlours at clubs and neighbourhood community centres. “We stabilise 20 patients with 150 litres oxygen over a period of some hours at our oxygen parlour. But once sent at home, a 30-litre cylinder would empty in three hours,” said Sougata Banerjee, a doctor who runs an oxygen parlour at a Behala club.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/unregulated-o2-usage-at-home-leading-to-wastage/articleshow/82614253.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Jewellery is being sold over phone through book entries against the buyers’ names in the accounts. The traders are accepting advance through bank transfer from the buyers, and sale is recorded against their names in books of accounts. The delivery will happen when the restrictions are eased. There have been inquiries from buyers also on possibility of sales. Accepting the orders over phone and noting down sales against the consumers’ name for the day can help in carrying on the tradition, say the jewellers. There are some jewellers who are also offering to deliver gold at the buyer’s doorstep on Akshaya Tritiya. TOI came across some of these messages doing rounds on social media. Rakesh Rokde, president of Nagpur Sarafa Association, said jewellers are accepting up to 90% of the amount as advance. “The buyers are being issued vouchers. The papers mention that the gold has been booked on Akshaya Tritiya,” he said. Gold was quoted at Rs48,100 a tola (per 10 grams) on Thursday at Nagpur. Even as the basic rates are drawn from the online commodity exchanges, each city has its individual price. This is because even as physical trade is not happening, the business continues in local markets throughout the country. “Gold is changing hand through book entries or deliveries at the buyers’ end. Not all cities have lockdown, so trade with such centres is happening through couriers or book entries,” said a trader here. Nitin Khandelwal, a trader from Akola, said the rates were in the range of 48,500 a tola in the city. There have been inquiries from customers about availability of jewellery on Akshaya Tritiya. Bookings are being accepted with delivers to be done once the markets open. Rajesh Thakker, a silver jewellery wholesaler from Akola, said there are some traders who are assuring home delivery on the same day. “It depends on the availability of the bullion for making jewellery. Bullion delivery is slow these days due to the restrictions. Those who have the raw gold can do the home delivery, rest will have to wait till the markets open,” he said. “There was abundant supply of old ornaments for making fresh ones during initial days of the lockdown but now even that has stopped,” said Thakker.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/traders-booking-gold-sales-in-books-on-akshay-tritiya/articleshow/82616302.cms||Shishir Arya

Even as the garment sector decided to shut operations from Friday in Tirupur, six units had to be sealed in the last three days after employees were found infected. Health authorities in Tirupur said that they tested all employees in textile units that have more than 200 workers. They found 18 of 295 employees of an export unit at Kulathuputhur Covid positive. At another unit in Sirupooluvapatti, 33 workers tested positive. In four units functioning on Mangalam Road, Asher Nagar, Andipalayam and Palladam Road, health staff found that eight, 19, 32 and 23 workers were infected respectively. Officials said that the infections were caused because of the failure on the part of the garment units to screen employees for temperature every day, check for symptoms and isolate those with symptoms. Health department staff who visited the spots said in some of the units, social distancing was not followed and workers were allowed to mingle in close proximity. Some of them were not wearing masks. In view of the violations, which resulted in spreading of the virus from one employee to another, the six units were sealed in the last three days. Officials have declared the locality where the garment units were functioning as containment zones. Health authorities said that they would conduct camps in those localities and collect swab samples from all residents living there. Textile manufacturers said that it was because of the rising number of cases that they have decided to close the units from Friday voluntarily for the next 10 days. Across Tirupur district, cases have been increasing over the past days and touched 712 new cases on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/six-garment-units-turn-covid-hotspots-sealed/articleshow/82614329.cms||Mayilvaganan

With the ever rising death toll in the city over the last few weeks, multiple teachers have died and a large number of students as well as teachers have faced losses in their own families that has affected their mental well-being and has even forced readjustments of online classes in several cases. “In most families near and dear ones are dying. There are teachers whose parents have passed away. Such instances are reported from other schools as well which has made the grief counselling session all the more pertinent,” said Meena Kak, director, Lakshmipat Singhania Academy. Kak said the school would begin the workshop with one session per week exclusively for teachers at this moment. They will be held by experts of trauma therapy from the Tata Institute of Social Sciences. “The workshops are aimed at giving reassurance to teachers and staff. Many of them can’t concentrate and are incoherent. They are feeling guilty for not being able to save their parents. The participants will be told how to control emotions and in turn they can also save students. It will ensure their mental well-being,” said Kak. Seema Sapru, the principal of the Heritage School, said such counselling sessions are on in their school for last 3-4 years where students and teachers are told how to deal with losses along with dealing with other mental issues. “Students who may have even lost their pets are told how to overcome such traumas. We are welcoming such sessions even due to loss of near ones due to Covid. For any such session they need to seek an appointment,” said Sapru. South Point School has also hailed the move. “We also have counsellors appointed by the school. We have heard about students and teachers who have undergone personal loss. If they want they can seek counselling from our dedicated cell of counsellors,” said spokesperson Krishna Damani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/grief-counselling-to-help-teachers-students-cope-with-personal-loss/articleshow/82614317.cms||Somdatta Basu

Pune airport sees 30 flight movements on weekdaysEarlier, passengers arriving from states apart from Delhi, Rajasthan, Kerala, Goa, Gujarat and Uttarakhand needed to have an RT-PCR negative report not older than 72 hours. Sources at the airport said that the changes have added to the pressure on passengers. Pune airport has direct flights coming in from Patna, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Bhopal, among other cities.“Instructions pertaining to the two changes are being shared with the airlines concerned so that they can further inform their flyers. The airport has a swab collection facility in the arrival area for those not having the report. We expect many flyers without reports older than 48 hours in the next few days,” another airport official said.Passenger traffic at the airport has drastically reduced to 1,400 from 2,500, each day.Shiva Kumar, who plans to travel from Bhopal to Pune on business next week, is quite confused by the new regulation. “It is less than a week before I travel. How am I supposed to get an RT-PCR negative report? I am worried as no lab will give me a report in time. Although there is a testing facility at the Pune airport, it just adds to the hassle as I might have to wait for long. I hope I will be allowed to board the flight because many airlines are not allowing boarding if a flyer doesn’t have the report,” said Kumar.Rahul Sareen, whose parents were set to travel from Patna to Pune on May 18, was also worried. “Even if there is a testing center at the airport here, it will take a lot of time and my parents are senior citizens. I am now trying to get a report in Patna itself, but things are difficult, and reports are getting delayed,” Sareen said.Another flyer, who was to travel from Chennai, said, “The airline shares a link that has the old regulation about the report needed only for those coming from six states and validity not older than 72 hours. I am really confused,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/new-travel-regulations-catch-many-flyers-on-the-wrong-foot/articleshow/82614290.cms||Joy Sengupta

The number of active cases is also on the rise and surged past the 16,000-mark to 16,271. The test positivity rate has increased to 27% for the first time since the Covid-19 breakout.While the district has so far tested 1,06,030 people positive for the virus, 88,935 of them, including 1,740 patients who were discharged from various treatment centres on the day, have been recovered. The recovery rate has dipped to another low of 83.8%, mainly because of the spike in daily caseload.The Covid-19 toll too continues to spiral in the district. It recorded 13 deaths on the day, taking the total number of fatalities to 824. Among the deceased were a 34-year-old man without any comorbidities who died three days after testing positive, a 30-year-old woman who died a week after hospitalization and a 45-year-old diabetic man who died within 24 hours of admission to hospital.Officials attributed the spike to the insensitivity of people, who continue to move around unnecessarily despite the lockdown measures, increased transmissibility of the virus and hospitals becoming Covid hotspots. An official said, “More people are thronging hospitals to find beds for relatives and family, and take care of them. They don’t know how to protect themselves. They get infected and transmit the virus to their entire family and colleagues at workplaces.”Dr G Ramesh Kumar, deputy director of public health, said 53 people of an industrial unit and 46 inmates of old age home had test positive for the virus.While the bulletin said 13 ICU beds (with ventilators) and 16 oxygen beds were available in the government hospitals, in realty there were none. Even the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital, which received 80 high-flow oxygen beds on Thursday, was filled to the capacity. In the private sector, 45 ventilator beds and 259 oxygen beds were vacant as per the bulletin. But most of the hospital with beds, including Sri Lakshmi Hospital (8) Venketeshwara Hospital (8), Mouthi Nursing Home (7), K J Hospital (5) and Alva Hospital (5), refused to admit patients citing lack of oxygen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/daily-count-soars-to-2835-test-positivity-rate-touches-27/articleshow/82614311.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Court stays mobile app from using Moj trademark||AHMEDABAD: A city civil court here has restrained a Bengaluru-based promotor of ShareChat and Moj applications, for short performance-based video editing application, from using the trademark Moj temporarily after a trademark row. The court issued an interim injunction after Bhavnagar’s Jugaldip Lagdhir claimed infringement of his trademark right by Mohalla Tech. Moj was launched by the company after the central government banned the Chinese mobile application Tik Tok and it became popular. In his civil suit, Lagdhir said that he has been into organising music concerts and performances and into recording and publishing music. He had got the trademark Moj registered in English and Gujarati languages in 2018 and since then he enjoyed exclusive rights to use the mark in the field of music. His advocates Vishal Thakker and Zahid Shaikh submitted that in January, Lagdhir came to know about the use of a similar trademark by Mohalla Tech for its mobile application. Upon inquiry, it was found that the company had filed two applications in August and October 2020 respectively for registration of Moj as trademark. They also submitted that Lagdhir raised objection to registration and the Trademark Registry has opined that they are deceptively similar to the one registered by Lagdhir. It was argued that the company’s use of similar trademark causes confusion among people and it will have adverse effect on the goodwill generated by the applicant in the market. The court was urged to stop the company by way of interim injunction under provisions of Section 135 of the Trademark Act. After hearing the case, chamber judge Hemang Trivedi observed, “…It prima facie appears that defendant (Mohalla Tech) has used deceptively similar and identical trademark to the plaintiff’s product which is likely to cause confusion in the mind of the people…Therefore, considering the prima facie case of the plaintiff, if the defendant is not restrained, it will cause harm, damage and loss to the plaintiff.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/court-stays-mobile-app-from-using-moj-trademark/articleshow/82614303.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Punjab: Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar makes eco-friendly stove for cremations||Ropar: Amid the soaring death toll and grim pandemic situation leading to a shortage of wood for the cremation of bodies in the country, the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Ropar along with Cheema Boilers Limited, Ropar, has developed an eco-friendly traditional cremation technology. It not only creates very little smoke, but also reduces half of the consumption of wood for the cremation of a body, developers said. The researchers said the fuel-intensive nature of the funeral rites has increased the need for the wood alarmingly. Answering the need for environment-friendly disposal of the dead, the technology developed by IIT Ropar researchers is based on the wick stove, in which the wick when lighted glows yellow and this is converted into smokeless blue flame after installing the combustion air system over these wicks. They said it’s a first of its kind technology with high temperature burning at 1,044 degrees Celsius and with 100% sterilisation. “The cart has wheels and can be transported anywhere easily. With the stainless steel trays on both sides for easy ash removable, the cart is equipped with combustion air for primary and secondary hot air system. The disposal is completed within 12 hours, including cooling, as against 48 hours. It requires less cooling time and works on a temperature above 1,000 degrees Celsius that ensures complete sterilisation. It has stainless steel insulation on both sides of the cart to prevent heat loss and less wood consumption,” IIT Ropar’s dean ICSR & II professor Harpreet Singh said. He said, “The wood costs Rs 2,500 for disposing of one body, so poor families sometimes try to get by with much less and end up having to dispose of partially burnt bodies, or even whole corpses, in rivers. A formal Hindu cremation — in which a body in a three-foot-high open-air pyre — can consume more than 400 kg of wood to reduce the body to ashes, this can be reduced with the help of this eco-friendly cremation cart.” Harjinder Singh Cheema, MD, Cheema Boilers, said, “We are providing the simplest way of cremation, which can be performed within half of the wood required.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/iit-makes-eco-friendly-stove-for-cremations/articleshow/82616298.cms||---

Chief judicial magistrate at Mirzapur court, VA Dhadhal, on Thursday granted Patel’s custody to Sola police in connection with the sale of a land in 2015 by office-bearers of Someshwar Darshan Cooperative Housing Society Ltd. An FIR was lodged for the sale which was not permitted then. Patel, who is lodged at Sabarmati central jail as an undertrial in an FIR registered by his daughter-in-law and half-a-dozen other cases of land transactions, opposed police’s request for his remand. But when the court granted custodial interrogation till Monday, he requested the court that there was no fan in the barrack where he is to be kept and that he should be allowed to have tiffin from home. The court asked the police to allow him home-cooked food and provide a ceiling fan in his room. If the authorities cannot arrange for the fan, Patel can use a table fan at his own cost, the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/raman-patel-sent-to-police-custody-again/articleshow/82614306.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Lucknow girls find a ‘sound’ idea to help hospital in pandemic||LUCKNOW: At a time when people were busy seeking help for Covid-19 patients, two students, Nikita Suri and Diya Singh, thought differently and came forward to help a hospital. Nikita and Diya, students of Class 11 at La Martiniere Girls College, collected funds from their friends and relatives to donate a sound system with a microphone to SPM Civil Hospital. The duo received an appreciation mail from the hospital on Thursday. “When we told hospital authorities that we wanted to help, officials appreciated our initiative saying that when everyone is asking for help, it is great that young students want to help others. However, they did not tell us specifically how we can help. After repeated requests, they said that if we can give them a sound system with a microphone, it will help them make announcements for patients coming for vaccination,” said Nikita. The two girls started collecting money from friends, relatives and acquaintances and raised Rs 8,000, which was enough to arrange a public announcement system. “We wanted to help people and the best way to extend support was to provide help to hospitals that are working round the clock to save the lives of thousands of people,” said Diya. “The announcement system was of great utility for smooth functioning of vaccination programme,” she added. Both students have also been actively involved in spreading awareness about Covid 19 safety norms through their Instagram page ‘Covareness’ in which they share selfmade videos to spread awareness. Health workers gave strength to patients to beat coronavirus Shivhare (26) of Indiranagar, who was diagnosed with Covid-19 in April, lost all hopes of survival when his oxygen level started dipping and he had to struggle for every breath. He was admitted to Era’s Lucknow Medical College where he spent nine days in ICU. Initially, he was a bit apprehensive as family members were not allowed in the ward but the care and constant support of the health staff helped him recover fast. “The health staff did not let me feel for a moment that I was away from my family. They took proper care and motivated me to fight on,” he said. Like Shivhare, many critical patients successfully defeated Covid-19, thanks to the efforts and moral support by medical staff. Vikas Mishra (46), an investment banker from Gomtinagar, also spent11 days in ICU after he was diagnosed with severe Covid-19 infection. “Had it not been for the hospital staff, I would certainly have given up. The whole experience was traumatising and even though I am better now, the thought of what could have been happened still frightens me,” he added. Garima (40), a resident of Gomtinagar, who was in ICU for 14 days, said: “The thought of my children and family kept pushing me to recover as soon as possible and return home.” Divyansh Sharma, a resident of Vivek Khand in Gomtinagar, who was hospitalised for 15 days, thanked his parents for emotional support for fighting against the virus. “It took almost a month to recover fully,” he said. Similarly, Pradeep Pandey, a railways employee, who was treated in SGPGIMS said: “My family’s prayers and rigorous efforts of the medical staff helped me recover in 15 days.” (With inputs from Anushka Pandey)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/city-girls-find-a-sound-idea-to-help-hospital-in-pandemic/articleshow/82618471.cms||---
---||Delhi||Why 105 O2 machines on premises, asks HC||New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Thursday asked businessman Navneet Kalra why he had 105 oxygen concentrators stored on his premises when he is neither an importer nor manufacturer. The high court will continue to hear Kalra’s plea for anticipatory bail on Friday. During Thursday’s hearing, justice Subramonium Prasad also sought to know if drugs can be stored without a licence. The high court also asked Kalra, seeking anticipatory bail in connection with alleged black marketing of oxygen concentrators, if he could have held on to and sold hundreds of such devices without a licence under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act. The court pointed out since medical devices, including oxygen concentrators, are also drugs according to the Act, a valid licence is required to manufacture, store or sell them and not having the same amounts to a violation, which entails a jail term of 10 years. Senior advocate Abhishek M Singhvi, appearing for Kalra, said that this was not the focus of the prosecution, whose case has been that he sold the equipment at a price above the cap fixed by the central government and that he cheated those who bought the concentrators from him. He added that unless there is a specific order, there is no requirement of a licence and a window of 18 months is available to register. Appearing for the police, additional solicitor general S V Raju opposed any relief for Kalra, saying it is a classic case of black marketing. He further alleged that customers were being cheated as Kalra claimed these were high-end German-made concentrators when tests revealed these “are Chinese, third-grade concentrators.” The senior law officer said investigations are under way to find out who all were sold the machines. “If we find anyone died, charges can be added,” he told the court, urging it to dismiss the plea as it would send a wrong message to society that “a person who did black marketing and hoarding to exploit was given relief on technical grounds.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-105-o2-machines-on-premises-asks-hc/articleshow/82616365.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Pune||Five dupe sex workers, poor women of state aid; held||Pune: The city police on Wednesday arrested five people, including three women, for cheating underprivileged working women and commercial sex workers (CSW) of state grants. The state government had extended a grant of Rs15,000, per person, for three months to enable the eligible women overcome hardships caused by the lockdown-like restrictions. Senior inspector Krishna Indalkar of Dattawadi police station said, “So far, 75 women have recorded their statement with us to the effect that the arrested persons took Rs10,000 each from the grant given to them. The NGO had created a list of 2,200 women beneficiaries and, prima facie, we suspect the overall amount may be Rs2.20 crore. The verification process is still underway.” A senior representative of the NGO remained unavailable for comment. According to the police, the women were cheated in the last week of April and the incident came to light after revenue authorities checked the accounts and interacted with the beneficiaries. Tehsildar Prakash Vhatkar lodged a complaint and a case of cheating, conspiracy, and criminal breach of trust has been registered against the arrested persons. On Thursday, the police produced the accused, Gauri Gurung (32) of Dhankawadi, Savita Lashkare (26) and Sarika Lashkare (30), both residents of Yerawada, Amol Mali (25) of Dhankawadi and Mahesh Dhadsingh (26) of Aundh Road, before a magisterial court which ordered their custodial remand till May 16.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/five-dupe-sex-workers-poor-women-of-state-aid-held/articleshow/82614348.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Experts question Sputnik V efficacy data||HYDERABAD: Even as India is gearing up to roll out Russian Covid-19 vaccine Sputnik V next week, a group of international experts has raised serious questions about the data discrepancies and substandard reporting of interim data of the vaccine’s phase 3 trials. Raising the red flag on discrepancies in the trials data, changes in the trial protocols, quality and accuracy of data as well as a lack of transparency, they said: “Restricted access to data hampers trust in research. Access to data underpinning study findings is imperative to check and confirm the findings claimed.” These questions come at a time when Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF)’s Indian partner, is preparing to receive the shipment of the second dose from Russia after the first lot of 1.5 lakh first doses arrived in Hyderabad on May 1. “It is even more serious if there are apparent errors and numerical inconsistencies in the statistics and results presented. Regrettably, this seems to be what is happening in the case of the Sputnik V phase 3 trial,” the experts said in a correspondence published in The Lancet’s Online First edition on Wednesday. The experts expressed concern regarding the availability of the data from which the Sputnik investigators drew their conclusions as they had refused to share it. “Data sharing is one of the cornerstones of research integrity; it should not be conditional and should follow the FAIR principles,” they said in the letter. Scientists and researchers also rued the fact that the full trial protocol and the reasons for making changes in the interim analyses as well as the primary outcome were not made public. “Initially the primary outcome was to be assessed after the first dose, but the evaluation was postponed to after the second dose. The presented primary result (efficacy of 91.6%) is dependent on this change but the reasons for the change have not been made public,” they pointed out. They also said the definition of the primary outcome is unclear and several crucial information is lacking such as the clinical parameters determining suspected Covid-19, diagnostic protocols used, when the PCR testing was done, what specific method was used, or how many amplification cycles were used. “The way cases of suspected Covid-19 were defined could have led to bias in PCR testing used to assess the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases, which is crucial for the efficacy determination,” they pointed out. While raising concerns about the enrolment and randomisation of patients and a discrepancy in the numbers shared, they also pointed to several inconsistencies in the data and numerical results reported. “…data for the vaccinated group of day 20 refer to more individuals than at day 10…the number of participants reported for the different vaccinated age cohorts do not add up to the reported total. With such inconsistencies we question the accuracy of the reported data,” they said. In February, while publishing the interim Phase 3 results, a separate article commissioned by Lancet had said that though the development of Sputnik V had been “criticised for unseemly haste, corner cutting, and an absence of transparency”, the outcome reported “is clear and the scientific principle of vaccination is demonstrated”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/experts-question-sputnik-v-efficacy-data/articleshow/82616345.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

---||Nagpur||Black fungus spread triggers blackmarketing of expensive drugs||Nagpur: The black fungus of Mucormycosis is heaping misery on Covid recovered patients. Apart from the high-risk, life-threatening disease, there is acute shortage of key drugs used to treat it, Liposomal Amphotericin B and Posaconazole, which are being sold in the black market. Liposomal Amphotericin B, which costs around Rs7,800 for one injection, is being sold for Rs11,000 to Rs14,000 and even more.With each Mucormycosis patient requiring around 60 injections of Amphotericin B, the bill for just this one injection is between Rs6.60 lakh and Rs8.40 lakh, and even more. Posaconazole too comes at around Rs5,000 for 10 tablets, it’s learnt. The drug is available in the form of injection too.After costly Covid treatment, patients are being forced to cough up huge hospital bills after falling victim to Mucormycosis. It’s the use of steroids to treat Covid that leads to high blood sugar in patients, who become prone to fungal infections like Mucormycosis. In the absence of Liposomal Amphotericin B, doctors are compelled to treat patients with cheaper version, conventional Amphotericin B Deoxycholate, which costs only Rs350 per injection and is readily available. However, this common drug to treat Mucormycosis has high nephrotoxicity, which can affect the kidneys of the patients in the long run, if proper care is not taken. The situation is learnt to be worse for diabetic patients, who are more vulnerable to both Mucormycosis and also renal impairments.Dr Prashant Nikhade, president of Vidarbha Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) Association, said there is something amiss for certain as hospitals are not getting supply from any pharmacies or stockist, but patients are managing to bring the drug from the market at higher prices. “Government must step in immediately and regulate the price and bring it under control mechanism to regulate and distribute Liposomal Amphotericin B and Posaconazole,” he said.“Conventional amphotericin use should be advocated with due monitoring and proper consent from the patient. Use of saline to keep the patient dehydrated can help save the kidney related complications when using the conventional drug,” he said.District collector Ravindra Thakare, who had summoned experts on Mucormycosis this week, has issued instruction to the food and drug administration (FDA) to step in.Sources said FDA had already convened a meeting of drug suppliers and stockist in the city. “Collector may now decide to regulate Amphotericin B and other drugs just like Remdesivir and Tocilizumab,” said a source.Senior ENT specialist Nandu Kolwadkar recommended keeping track of urea creatinine, sodium and potassium levels while administering the conventional Amphotericin B Deoxycholate. Senior pharmacist Murli Kewalramani said there are no supply of Liposomal Amphotericin B and Posaconazole but people are still managing to get it from the market, which is surprising.Hetal Thakkar, president of Nagpur Druggists and Chemists Association, said some distributors have played truant with the stockists by bypassing them and making the supply available to others in a dubious manner, giving rise to shortage and malpractices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/black-fungus-spread-triggers-blackmarketing-of-expensive-drugs/articleshow/82616306.cms||Soumitra Bose

Accused Geeta Pathan currently serves as a police inspector in Patan district. She used to serve as inspector at Sabarmati riverfront (east) and women’s police stations in Ahmedabad. “Following a thorough investigation and the arrest of four members of the gang, the city crime branch arrested Pathan on Thursday,” a crime branch officer said. When she was serving in the city earlier this year, Pathan had allegedly helped the gang extort Rs 26.55 lakh from at least five traders. Pathan allegedly took half the money from the gang and also gave some share to her juniors who helped her intimidate the victims and pressure them into giving money to the gang members to settle the issue, the officer said. In February, a victim had submitted an application to the crime branch, alleging that a gang with some women members had befriended him through Facebook then extorted money from him by threatening to entrap him in a false rape case. Later, officials received four more such applications. In March, the crime branch arrested four persons, including two 19-yearolds, on charges of extortion and criminal conspiracy. The gang members would trap traders using fake Facebook IDs of girls after which the female members would invite them to a hotel or a secluded place. Later, the gang would submit an application against the victims at the woman police station headed by Pathan, it said. On the pretext of recording their statements, Pathan would call the victims to the police station and pressure them to “settle” the matter with applicants, the statement added. Pathan and her staffers would threaten the victims, saying they may get arrested in a rape case if they did not arrive at a compromise formula with the applicant, the release said, adding that the crime branch is also investigating the involvement of other staff members of the women’s police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/pi-held-for-aiding-honey-trap-gang/articleshow/82614475.cms||---

He said that since a large number of people come for Covid testing as well as for vaccination at Valpoi CHC, controlling the crowd and the spread of the virus is difficult. Now people need not have to worry as the new premises at Kadamba is independently for vaccination services and CHC premises will continue to be used for Covid testing. Many people put off taking the vaccine as they fear they may contract the virus while waiting with those come for testing under the same roof. These days Valpoi CHC has witnessed a surge in Covid testing and people have to wait for hours in a queue. Few patients were also seen fainting.

MSEDCL superintendent engineer Bibhishan Nirmal on Thursday said that almost all health institutions from Aurangabad offering healthcare to Covid patients have been asked in writing to put in place back up arrangements at their level ahead of monsoon. “Despite best possible preventive measures, power outage becomes inevitable due to gusty winds and thunderstorms that are synonymous with pre-monsoon period. Such adverse weather conditions can lead to tripping of feeders or transformers and may damage overhead power cables, causing power failure,” he said. Nirmal said that health institutions should ideally have generators or inverters installed with them in case of power outages. “For set-ups manufacturing, supplying and utilising Liquid Medical Oxygen, it is advisable to have double feeder supply. Such an arrangement will ensure uninterrupted power supply while repairing or trouble-shooting power outage during pre-monsoon conditions,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/brace-for-pre-monsoon-conditions-msedcl-to-covid-care-centres/articleshow/82612890.cms||---

In April and May, it reported 88,521 positive cases, compared with 58,777 in the previous whole year. A rapid surge in positivity choked premier hospitals Such as Dr Rajendra Prasad Government Medical College at Kangra, which had 118 patients against 92 beds. Of the state’s 3,162 beds, 2,135 are occupied and 1,027 available. Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur said the outbreak was faster in the urban areas and so the point of Corona Curfew was to save lives first and economy later. He claimed the vaccination process to be smooth and promised to start covering the 18-to-44 age group from May 17, based on first-come-first-served rule and registration. The Himachal Pradesh high court has asked to see the state government’s disaster management plan, along with details of the available beds and oxygen. The high court wants to also know the availability of certain medicines—Remdesivir, Favipiravir, and Tocilizumab. Meanwhile, Solan has 251 beds (180 oxygen, 17 ICU) with 181 taken and 80 vacant. Una has 123 (100/23) with 86 taken and 37 vacant. Sirmaur has 443 beds (190/28) with 140 taken and 303 vacant.

---||Pune||Shutdown could affect state economy by 2%, say experts||PUNE: Industrial representatives have forecast a dip of 2% in state’s economic activity due to the ongoing lockdown-like restrictions. The industries have urged the state government to front-load crucial spending, such as on infrastructure, to soften the blow. They also urged loosening of the regulatory framework for heavily affected industries — food and beverage, hospitality, and tourism — to recover and to widely make vaccines available to their workers. The Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industry, and Agriculture (MCCIA) has estimated that Maharashtra’s GSDP is being impacted by around 0.3% per week because of the increased restrictions, which began around the end of April. In the initial period of the restrictions, in force till May 15, the total impact on the GSDP was estimated to be around 1.5%. With the restrictions now stretching till the end of the month, that impact is likely to be deeper, while still lesser than that of last year’s lockdown. “Overall, the impact on the GSDP can be up to 2% for the year. However, that is much lesser than the impact felt last year. Even if operations have been affected due to the restrictions, industries in the Pune region have been working at up to 70% of their capacity. What is needed now is a rapid pace of vaccinations for all, and the state government should front-load the spending that it had earmarked for infrastructure and other capital expenditure so that the pace of recovery is good after the restrictions are lifted,” MCCIA director-general Prashant Girbane said. The impact on contact-based services, such as hospitality and tourism, however, has been disproportionate due to the pandemic, and according to observers, the authorities at the state level have difficult choices ahead. “Fiscal interventions come with a difficult choice, such as which sectors to help on priority, especially with borrowings ticking upwards. What the government can do is to lessen the regulatory burden on the sector, where some positive steps have been taken, such as according industry status to hospitality and tourism. Also needed is the permission to allow them to operate when possible, and that can be done through the rapid rollout of vaccines,” said an observer based in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/shutdown-could-affect-state-economy-by-2-say-experts/articleshow/82614381.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Partial lockdown fails to deter child marriages||AHMEDABAD: On Tuesday, a joint team of the Abhayam 181 helpline, Childline and city police visited a wedding venue based on a tip-off. The teams in disguise were told that four sisters were getting married in the same ceremony. Surprised, the officials got more details and realized that the gap between the sisters’ births was not adding up – two of the sisters were certainly younger than 18 years. “The father of the brides was questioned, and confessed that two of his daughters were yet to attain the legal age for marriage. He said he had taken the step to save on marriage expenses and it was at par with his community’s traditions. He later gave a written assurance that the girls would not be forced into marriage before they turn 18 years old,” said an Abhayam official. While the state is facing one of the worst spells of the Covid-19 pandemic, under-age marriages continue in different parts of the state, said Abhayam 181 officials. “This was the second instance in two days for us. Earlier, two girls were rescued from another mass wedding. The general modus operandi is to never marry off an underage girl alone, it is too easy to detect. When she is among several brides, it becomes more difficult to discern,” said a senior official. City-based academicians said the pandemic has also increased the uncertainty for fence-sitters. “Parents want to marry off their girls as soon as possible, but on the other hand there are also apprehensions about the economic condition of the families involved,” said a researcher.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/partial-lockdown-fails-to-deter-child-marriages/articleshow/82614400.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Health workers gave strength to patients to beat coronavirus||LUCKNOW: Shivhare (26) of Indiranagar, who was diagnosed with Covid-19 in April, lost all hopes of survival when his oxygen level started dipping and he had to struggle for every breath. He was admitted to Era’s Lucknow Medical College where he spent nine days in ICU. Initially, he was a bit apprehensive as family members were not allowed in the ward but the care and constant support of the health staff helped him recover fast. “The health staff did not let me feel for a moment that I was away from my family. They took proper care and motivated me to fight on,” he said. Like Shivhare, many critical patients successfully defeated Covid-19, thanks to the efforts and moral support by medical staff. Vikas Mishra (46), an investment banker from Gomtinagar, also spent 11 days in ICU after he was diagnosed with severe Covid-19 infection. “Had it not been for the hospital staff, I would certainly have given up. The whole experience was traumatising and even though I am better now, the thought of what could have been happened still frightens me,” he added. Garima (40), a resident of Gomtinagar, who was in ICU for 14 days, said: “The thought of my children and family kept pushing me to recover as soon as possible and return home.” Divyansh Sharma, a resident of Vivek Khand in Gomtinagar, who was hospitalised for 15 days, thanked his parents for emotional support for fighting against the virus. “It took almost a month to recover fully,” he said. Similarly, Pradeep Pandey, a railways employee, who was treated in SGPGIMS said: “My family’s prayers and rigorous efforts of the medical staff helped me recover in 15 days.” (With inputs from Anushka Pandey)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/health-workers-gave-strength-to-patients-to-beat-coronavirus/articleshow/82618516.cms||---

The gruesome incident took place in Maliyon ki Bhagal village of Gundali gram panchayat. Police said Bhurki and her husband Rooplal Gameti had a heated argument. The dual went to such an extent that Rooplal picked up a cricket bat and hit Bhurki with it several times. Their children, who tried to rescue their mother, were also thrashed by their father. Bhurki died on the spot while Rooplal fled from the spot, police said. Bhurki's relatives told police that Rooplal worked in Udaipur and had returned home after three months due to strict lockdown. Since his return, he had been picking up fights with his wife without reason and abused her. On Thursday, too, they both had an argument and Rooplal abused and thrashed her. Bhurki resisted him which infuriated him so much that in a fit of rage, he picked up a cricket bat kept in the house and bludgeoned her to death. Police teams have been set out to search the man while Bhurki’s body was shifted to a mortuary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/udaipur/man-bludgeons-wife-to-death-with-bat-after-heated-quarrel/articleshow/82616347.cms||---
---||Dehradun||After medical oxygen, now it is plasma shortage||DEHRADUN: Despite Uttarakhand recording at least 3,000 cases of recovery from Covid-19 almost every day for the last fortnight, NGOs and volunteers are finding it difficult to arrange plasma for those in need. They say that they have no data of the Covid patients who have recovered and are capable of donating plasma. Over 88,877 people have recovered in the state from April 1 to May 13 - the period when the second wave hit the state. Till now, 184,207 people have recovered. Since the start of the second wave, Government Doon Medical College received only 76 plasma donors while the hospital had treated around 5,000 people in this duration. At IMA’s plasma bank, 92 people have reached for voluntary donations so far. Dr Neha Batra, in-charge of blood bank at Doon hospital, said patients who recover are reluctant to come to Doon hospital again - it is a Covid dedicated facility and they are afraid of getting infected. “So, we have mooted an idea of shifting the blood bank somewhere else. We have a counsellor to motivate recovered patients to donate plasma, but in 90 percent cases, we only hear excuses,” she added. Situation is no different in Sushila Tiwari Medical College in Haldwani as well where the hospital had received a good response from plasma donors in the first Covid wave. “We are trying to motivate people. There is still hope that they will come as the second wave began a few days ago. And people will be able to donate plasma at least 20 to 30 days after recovering fully," said Dr Arun Joshi, chief medical superintendent at Sushila Tiwari hospital. The plasma has become a crucial part of Covid treatment. Even chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat has urged the recovered patients to donate plasma. "In a state where more than 1.8 lakh people have recovered from Covid infection so far, among which over 88,000 have recovered in the last 30 days, we cannot find even 1,000 plasma donors. Initially, government hospitals used to give contacts of the recovered patients to the families in need, but even that is not happening now. We don't want the Covid-affected families to burden themselves with the task of finding plasma donors. We are happy to help but for that we need data of the patients who have recovered," said Harish Kumar, member of Mitti Foundation, a social organisation involved in plasma donation. Kumar claimed that there are at least 60-70 SOS calls for plasma every day. Ishita Thapliyal, an engineering student who is part of a WhatsApp group of 200 people who help Covid patients with medicines, oxygen availability and hospital beds availability tips, also maintained that the volunteers will be able to work in a better way if contacts of recovered patients are provided.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/after-medical-oxygen-now-it-is-plasma-shortage/articleshow/82612878.cms||Ishita Mishra

---||Kolkata||Covid claims pioneer of body donation movement in Bengal||KOLKATA: The face of body donation movement in Bengal succumbed to Covid-19 on Thursday morning. Brojo Roy (85) and his organisation Ganadarpan had helped thousands of medical students in getting bodies that they would dissect to sharpen their surgical hands. Roy died at Sambhunath Pandit Hospital, converted into a Covid hospital, recently. Ironically, his family could not donate his body as he had the infection, despite the fact that he had pledged his body years ago. “It is sad that Roy’s body could not go to the anatomy department of a medical college as per his wish. We understand that this is due to Covid-19 protocol on donating the bodies of infected persons,” said Ratan Das, a fellow member of Ganadarpan. Roy had suffered a cerebral attack at his Bhawanipore home eight days ago. He was immediately rushed to SSKM Hospital where he had tested positive to Covid. Since SSKM does not have Covid treatment facility, he was shifted to the hospital’s annexe unit at Sambhunath Pandit Hospital. Roy also had age-related issues like kidney ailment, according to his family members. “We could have been much at a solace if his body could be donated,” said granddaughter Arundhati Dutta, Roy’s brother’s daughter. Roy is survived by his 88-year-old wife Tripti Chowdhury. “He was a path bearer, a liberal humanist, a man with a mission with towering commitment. We owe him a lot when it comes to body and organ donation,” said SSKM hepatology head, Abhijit Choowdhury, who had teamed up with Roy on several occasions for organ donations.  “I used to get calls from him often with a request to make arrangement for body donations so that the family could get over the process quickly. His contribution to cadaver donation has helped many medical colleges,” said Sudhadhan Batbyal, former principal at RG Kar Medical College who is now heading the newly set up Shantiniketan Medical College. Ganadarpan, though, requested health department to conduct an autopsy on Roy’s body to find out the cause of his death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/covid-claims-pioneer-of-body-donation-movement-in-bengal/articleshow/82614407.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

In the unorganised retail sector, the business loss during lockdown is pegged at Rs 70,000 crore. Retailers Association of India (RAI) in a release said to ease lives and livelihoods, giving their employees jabs and financial assistance should be top priority. Kumar Rajgopalan, CEO of RAI, said ‘Last Mile Workers’ of the retail industry were the constant point of contact for citizens. “It is estimated that each Last Mile Worker meets about 50-100 customers per day. Thus about 100 employees are likely to come in contact with an estimated 7,000 citizens a day,” he pointed out.

Customers can book the gold and make the payment on our website and as soon as the restrictions are lifted, we will deliver the jewellery home. If there is a fluctuation in the rate from now to when the shops open, it will be adjusted against the making charges. However, even with online sales, jewellers are suffering heavy losses for two years in a row,” said Fatehchand Ranka, managing director, Ranka Jewellers. “While we acknowledge that Akshaya Tritiya is a tradition and a sentiment that many of our customers follow, we have decided not to conduct any promotional activities around it this year. However, for our patrons who want to mark the occasion in a traditional manner, we have reintroduced online Gold Ownership Certificate scheme, which customers can redeem when shops open,” said TS Kalyanaraman, chairman and managing director, Kalyan Jewellers. Online sales contributed to only 1-5% of overall sales before the pandemic, and there has been no noticeable difference in the numbers since 2020 in spite of shops remaining shut. Amit Modak, chief executive officer and director, P.N Gadgil & Sons, said, “During last Akshay Tritiya, rates were low, but in August 2020, when the lockdown was eased, it shot up to Rs56,000 per 10 grams. People who expect something similar are booking gold online, so that they can buy at the current rate, irrespective of the prevailing rate in vogue when the restrictions are lifted. They can buy gold on our website between 10am and 5pm and receive the receipt on a messaging platform the same day. Online sales are limited as people prefer purchasing small items ranging between Rs 5000-Rs15000. For heavier jewellery, customers prefer coming to the store.” Atul Ashtekar, partner, Krishna Rajaram Ashtekar Jewellers, is hopeful of sales picking up later this year. “April and May are crucial in terms of sales, and accounts for about 30% of our annual revenue. We have given our store manager’s contact number on our website for customers who want to call and book pure gold at current rates,” he said. Saurabh Awale, a resident of Katraj, who makes it a point to purchase gold every year on Akshay Tritiya, said, “I want to invest my savings in gold. I was sceptical about this time last year, but returns have been good.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/online-offers-from-jewellers-for-akshay-tritiya/articleshow/82614423.cms||---

All Covid hospitals requiring this medicine will apply to the committee, which will meet twice a day (10-11am and 4-5pm) to scrutinise the applications. “The guiding principle of the technical committee will be evidence-based clinically approved parameters as well as principles of equity distributive justice and transparency,” the order states. The director general of health services will monitor the overall management of the drug—from approval till delivery to the hospitals. “It will be the personal responsibility of the hospital administration to ensure the appropriate use and to prevent misuse or pilferage,” the order adds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/expert-panel-to-keep-tabs-on-distribution-of-tocilizumab/articleshow/82616410.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Grieving from the loss, Ranjan and his cousin have visited LMC’s office twice for the death certificate but have not been able to get it. Like Ranjan, family members of many people who died due to various reasons including Covid-19 this month are not getting death certificates from Lucknow Municipal Corporation as many employees are down with the novel coronavirus infection. According to records, the civic body has received about 300 applications for issuing of death certificates in the past 10 days. However, not even a single certificate has been issued so far. “We have visited the office with a slip issued by the crematorium but no one has heard us. We were just moving from one person to another, but no one gave us authentic information about what is required or how we should get the certificate. We need the certificate to claim his office dues,” said Ranjan. Additional municipal commissioner Amit Kumar said, “Death certificates get issued from zonal offices, some of our zonal employees are not coming to office due to Covid-19.” Other officers said that while some employees are themselves infected, some are scared to move out of their houses. A person after performing last rites of their loved one gets a slip from the LMC counter located in cremation and burial grounds. Later, they produce that slip at the LMC office and a death certificate is issued. In case of death at a private hospital, the applicant also has to produce hospital documents. A death certificate issued by any government hospital is recognised all over India and there is no need to take another certificate from LMC. “My mother died at a private hospital in Niralanagar. The staff gave us a receipt confirming the death due to chest congestion. We went to the LMC office zone-3 to get the death certificate, but the guard told us to come later explaining that the department staff is not in yet,” said Vartika Asthana, a resident of Niralanagar.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Death rate falls more than 60% after the first wave||MUMBAI: An analysis of Covid deaths this year in Maharashtra has found a decline of over 60% in case fatality rates (CFR) across age brackets despite a 44% rise in the caseload compared to last year. The only exception are fatalities in children below 10 years which are at nearly the same rate for both 2020 and 2021. CFR is the ratio of coronavirus deaths to the number of patients who have tested positive. Broadly, the distribution of cases and mortality in different age groups has mirrored the trends seen in the first wave. In both waves, the age group 31-40 has seen the maximum infections, while 61-70 has seen the most deaths. Data from the state’s public health department shows CFR in those over 60, who are the worst hit, is 2.6% this year—13,318 confirmed deaths out of 5lakh infections. In 2020, it was 11.2% as nearly 3.5lakh senior citizens were infected and of them 39,192 succumbed. In age brackets above 60, CFR in octogenarians is 3.8% compared to 11.2% last year, followed by 3.06% in septuagenarians (9.3% last year). Epidemiologist Dr Pradeep Awate said there’s almost a three-fold decline in deaths in the elderly. In the 20-50 age groups, CFR this time is 0.28% despite nearly 19lakh infections. In 2020, this group saw nearly 11lakh infections and CFR of 0.82%. Read AlsoIndia reports daily rise in coronavirus cases of 3.43 lakh and 4,000 deathsIndia on Friday reported 3,43,144 new coronavirus cases over the last 24 hours, taking its overall caseload past the 2.40 crore mark. The death toll rose to 2,62,317 by a single-day rise of 4,000 deaths in a day, according to the Union health ministry data.​Experts, however, want to tread with caution before labelling the second wave a milder one. According to epidemiologist Dr Giridhara Babu, an optimistic explanation could be that many senior citizens have taken at least one vaccine dose while others may have been infected in the first wave. Dr Awate, however, thinks better medical management is the more plausible answer, since less than 5% in the 60% age group have been fully vaccinated so far.   Dr Vasant Nagvekar, a member of the state task force, said deaths in young people must be closely analysed as the severity is more. “ICUs are packed with critical cases between 20-50 years. We should wait for all-cause mortality to understand the impact,” he said. A somewhat clearer picture could emerge only by May-end when deaths are expected to recede. “The second wave has overwhelmed systems, particularly private hospitals that may not have managed to report all deaths. Only after data reconciliation from crematoriums or deaths registrations, states would know better,” said Babu. Awate said preliminary signs suggest a drop in mortality. He said September, which was 2020’s peak, had a CFR of 2%, while April 2021’s peak has a CFR of 0.77%. “Even if unreported deaths are added, those are unlikely to be in thousands,” he said. Numbers suggest that the only exception to the pattern is deaths in children below 10, which have not reduced much. Between January and May 9, 108 children succumbed to coronavirus of 87,463 infected in the state. Comparatively, there were 67,110 infections and 97 deaths in the nine months of 2020. CFR this year (0.12%) is only marginally less than last year’s 0.14%. If not deaths, the second wave is ahead in terms of severity, said Dr Sushant Meshram of Government Medical College, Nagpur. “We have seen up to 40-50 deaths in a day, while Nagpur district has seen up to 100 deaths. Young patients in 30s and 40s have died within a day of desaturating. The oxygen requirement was high, and hospitals were overwhelmed, so let’s wait before drawing conclusions,” he said. Dr Avinash Supe, who heads the Covid death audit panel, said in all of 2020, there were over 19.44lakh cases and 48,456 deaths. In 2021, caseload rose to 31.17lakh but confirmed deaths were 24,400-odd. “The disease load was tremendously high this year and ICUs continue to be full. But doctors also know the disease better than last year,” he said, explaining why deaths could be low.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-death-rate-falls-more-than-60-after-the-first-wave/articleshow/82616445.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) is set to start drive-in vaccination programme exclusively for elderly citizens at Glocal Square near MahaMetro Station in Sitabuldi and Trillium Mall in Rambagh on Friday. The centres would be made available in Co-Win app in the morning, officials said. They added the inoculation would start only after the respective inauguration.Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B told TOI that Union minister Nitin Gadkari would flag off the drive at Glocal Square at 11am. Guardian minister Nitin Raut, who is in Mumbai, would be reaching the city a bit late on Friday and hence would be inaugurating the drive at Trillium Mall around 3pm.The civic chief said it is only for senior citizen and registration is mandatory. “Walk-in (on-the-spot registration) are not allowed. Both the facilities have sufficient parking area. We would be taking help of traffic police to regulate movement of vehicles. We will see how it works out tomorrow,” he said.The two facilities would be free of cost.The number of doses are expected to be around 200 as of now. “We need to see what is the response to decide future course of action,” he said.The basement parking at Suresh Bhat hall in Reshimbagh too is under consideration but has not been included in the first phase.Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said that as the rush of 45+ category beneficiaries is increasing at other centres, the drive-in system will ensure elderly citizens don’t have to wait for long. “They need to be seated in the vehicles and wait for some time after inoculation for observation before leaving,” he said.Joshi said that around 400 to 500 jabs can be administered at each of the two facilities in one full day.Earlier, it was expected to start the drive-in facility from Saturday. A team led by Joshi inspected a couple of spaces for drive-in vaccination and finalized the two properties. NMC officials said all arrangements were made for the start.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/drive-in-vax-for-elders-at-two-parking-lots-from-today/articleshow/82616414.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Special counsel for the state Darius Khambata with public prosecutor gave the assurance on a petition by Singh, who has sought quashing of the “malafide” criminal case. The state will file its reply by May 20 to his petition. Senior counsel Mahesh Jethmalani, appearing for Singh, said the investigation is “completely illegal and amounts to reinvestigation which cannot be undertaken without court nod”. The FIR against Singh and about 30 others was registered on April 28 under sections of the IPC for criminal conspiracy and destruction of evidence, the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, and section 7 of the Civil Rights Protection Act, 1955. The incidents in the FIR happened in 2015. Ghadge, who was posted in the Thane Police Commissionerate during 2015-2018, had alleged that Singh pressured him to drop the names of some persons from a case and when he refused to do so, Singh embroiled him in false cases. Last week, the HC had asked Singh to mention his petition before a vacation bench in case of urgency. On Thursday, the vacation bench of Justices P B Varale and N R Borkar heard his plea briefly. In his petition, Singh said the FIR falsely accused him after attempts to pressure him to withdraw his March 20, 2021, letter to the chief minister alleging ‘corrupt malpractices’ against then home minister Anil Deshmukh failed. Ghadge’s counsel Pradnya Talekar cited a Supreme Court ruling to argue that the interim reliefs sought by Singh for protective order and to stay the probe cannot be granted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/will-not-arrest-param-bir-till-may-20-state-tells-bombay-hc/articleshow/82618791.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: ‘Home isolation patients get 29MT oxygen supply’||LUCKNOW: The state government on Thursday supplied 29.1 metric tonnes (MT) oxygen for patients in home isolation against the requirement of 48.9 MT, according to a report based on the data submitted by the district magistrates of all 75 districts. Prepared by divisional commissioner and compiled by the department of food safety and drug administration (FSDA), the report shows that UP has over 1.6 lakh patients in home isolation. The demand for oxygen in home-isolation patients is the highest in Moradabad (8.9 MT) division. The supply of oxygen in this division, however, stood at 4.1 MT. In Lucknow, 2.5 MT oxygen was supplied on Thursday against 4.9 MT sought by the administration. The report shows that four divisions – Chitrakoot, Mirzapur, Prayagraj and Ayodhya – received 100% oxygen for home-isolated patients. Interestingly, out of total 18 divisions, only Varanasi comprising four districts – Varanasi, Jaunpur, Chandauli, and Ghazipur – reported no demand for oxygen for its 14,272 patients who were in home isolation. Gorakhpur division, the home turf of chief minister Yogi Adityanath, received 5.4 MT of oxygen against the requirement of 5.9 MT. Two districts from this division, Kushinagar and Maharajganj, did not seek oxygen. Gorakhpur district alone demanded 5.4 MT oxygen while 0.5 MT was sought from Deoria, the government report shows. As per the report, Lucknow (14,567), Meerut (8,250) and Varanasi (7,713) were top districts with home-isolation patients. At least 7,756 cylinders (including all four types AA, A, B & D) were in demand for home isolated patients across the state on Thursday. Of this, 3,890 cylinders were supplied. In terms of patients, 4,112 were provided cylinders. Overall, 24 districts like Varanasi, Amethi, Hathras, Lalitpur, Kushinagar, Hardoi, Bhadohi, Kaushambi, Baghpat, Kanpur Dehat, Bahraich and Basti, among others, did not seek oxygen cylinders. Principal secretary, food safety and drug administration, Anita Singh, said fluctuations in demand was common. “The demand is based on a rough calculation of the total number of home isolation patients in a district. About 12-15% are moderately ill and require oxygen cylinders,” she said. “In smaller districts where there are no L3 hospitals, the movement of serious or moderately sick patients is towards bigger districts having more medical facilities,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/home-isolation-patients-get-29mt-oxygen-supply/articleshow/82618618.cms||Isha Jain
---||Hyderabad||Telangana likely to float global tenders for vaccine today||HYDERABAD: The Telangana government is likely to float global tenders to procure four crore vaccines for the state’s requirements on Friday. While the health and industries department officials finalised the draft tender document on Thursday, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao is expected to give the green signal to go ahead with the tendering process either on Thursday night or Friday. “We have finalised tender documents and are waiting for CM’s clearance. If the CM decides to give vaccines even for people aged 12+ years, the state may need to procure more than four crore vaccines for two doses,” Telangana principal secretary (industries) Jayesh Ranjan told TOI on Thursday. With severe shortage of vaccines and limited supplies from the Centre, a couple of days ago, the state cabinet decided to follow other states like Uttar Pradesh and Kerala and procure vaccine from global manufacturers. The UP government had invited global tenders for vaccine procurement last week for four crore doses and most of the conditions put by the government in its tender documents will be incorporated by the Telangana government in its bid documents. Telangana industries minister KT Rama Rao, during an interaction with people on Twitter on Thursday, said, “Ideally 70% population being vaccinated should break the chain.” Health department officials said they are ready to order any vaccines available in the country including Covaxin, Covishield, Sputnik and other vaccines like Pfizer, Moderna and other jabs. “Some vaccines need the temperature between 2 to 8 degrees, which is not a problem,” a health department official said. Official sources said the UP government asked the manufacturers to supply at least 60 lakh to 80 lakh doses of the vaccine every month, that the supplies be started within seven days of release of purchase order and be completed within 30 days. The entire four crore doses need to be completed within six months. “Every care should be taken on the quality, shelf life and other standards. The suppliers have to provide special cold storage condition to transport the drugs under cold chain norms from the manufacturing unit to the respective warehouses in districts,” officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/state-likely-to-float-global-tenders-for-vaccine-today/articleshow/82616467.cms||Koride Mahesh

He is a retired policeman (driver) and we suspect that he may have blackmailed others by filing false applications against them in police stations,” said Morbi DySP Radhika Bharai. Police have booked Humbal under various sections including extortion, criminal intimidation and breach of trust. Mahendra’s elder brother Kishor Chikhalia is a BJP leader and serves as president of Morbi district panchayat. In the recent panchayat polls, BJP gave a ticket to Kishor’s wife Ashmita.

Humbal told Mahendra that he will get more than 1,000 votes and challenged the latter to place Rs 1 lakh bet. Humbal received 1,800 votes but he allegedly demanded Rs 10 lakh from Mahendra. “Humbal started filing applications against Mahendra and Kishor with the police. Fearing damage to his reputation, Kishor agreed to pay him Rs 7 lakh. Kishor paid Humbal Rs 1 lakh and promised the rest in 3 months. But, Humbal kept threatening him,” police said.Finally, Mahendra met Morbi SP S R Odedra and narrated the incident on Wednesday.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Local disaster management bodies can impose more curbs if cases rise||MUMBAI: The stringent ‘Break the Chain’ restrictions for Covid-19 in the state were extended till 7am on June 1 with certain modifications, a day after the Maharashtra cabinet made a suggestion to the effect. According to the new order issued on Thursday, anyone entering the state from any part of the country by any mode of transport must carry a negative RT-PCR report. The test must be conducted a maximum of 48 hours before entry into the state. The BMC said air passengers will not be allowed to board flights to Mumbai without negative RT-PCR tests effective May 15, 7 am. In April, the state had put curbs on travellers from six states declared as places of “sensitive origin”. Now, the rule has been extended to all states. Considering the spike in Covid cases in several districts, the state has delegated powers to local disaster management authorities to put in place more curbs in general or in specific areas or for certain sectors depending on the local situation, after prior intimation to the state. The public must be given at least a 48-hour notice before the restrictions are imposed, stated the order issued by the state chief secretary Sitaram Kunte. Other than essential services staff, now individuals engaged in airport, port services and movement of cargo related to medicines or equipment for Covid management will be allowed to board local trains, Mono and Metro Rail. In case of cargo carriers, not more than two persons will be allowed in a vehicle. Milk collection and transport will be allowed, though its retail will be subject to restrictions imposed on essential shops. A disaster management authority will check rural and APMC markets. If found flouting Covid rules, the directorate of municipal administration may shut them or put more curbs. Viren Shah, president, Federation of Retail Traders Welfare Association said, “In the past 40 days, retailers in the state suffered losses to the tune of Rs 50,000 crore, which will increase to Rs 69,500 crore by May 31.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-local-disaster-mgmt-bodies-can-impose-more-curbs-if-cases-rise/articleshow/82614513.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Ghatkesar veggie vendor held for sexual abuse of 19 women||HYDERABAD: A 46-year-old vegetable vendor was arrested in Pedda Amberpet on the charges of sexually exploiting 19 women whom he met at toddy compounds and escaping with their valuables. Though the accused confessed to have committed 19 offences, only two victims have lodged police complaints against him and rape cases have been registered. Rachakonda police commissioner Mahesh Bhagwat said LB Nagar Central Crime Station team identified the offender as Hussain Khan, a vegetable vendor from Narapally in Ghatkesar, and arrested him near Outer Ring Road in Pedda Amberpet at 8 am on Thursday. During the interrogation, the accused confessed to have committed 17 similar offences at isolated places in Meerpet, LB Nagar, Uppal, Chaitanyapuri, Chatrinaka and Kanchanbagh since 2018. He would target women whom he met at the toddy compounds, the CP said. “Hussain takes the women to isolated places on his scooter. Before sexually exploiting the women, he keeps his wallet in the scooter dickey. He convinces the women to keep their jewellery and cash in the dickey saying it will be safe. After exploiting the women, he quickly returns to the scooter and escapes from the spot even before the women could react,” Vanasthalipuram ACP K Purushotham Reddy said. Last year, a 35-year-old woman had lodged a complaint with Hayathnagar police alleging that an unidentified man whom she met at a toddy compound had lured her to have sex with him at an isolated place. After exploiting her, he fled on the scooter with her gold jewellery. After a similar complaint was lodged in April this year in the same police station, a special team analysed the CCTV footage of toddy compounds and surrounding areas. “We identified that the accused was the same person and a manhunt was launched to nab him,” Bhagwat said. Based on Hussain’s confession, police recovered nine tola gold, Rs 45,000 cash, a cellphone and a scooter from his possession. Police are trying to identify the women. Previously, Hussain was arrested in eight property offences committed in Saifabad, Neredmet, Nallakunta, Ghatkesar, Gopalapuram, Karkhana, Chilkalguda and Tukaramgate police stations. “He used to target lovers sitting in isolated places posing as a cop and take away their valuables,” police said. In 2016, Hussain was detained under PD Act by Gopalapuram police.

---||Thane||Thane and Pune on top in giving shots to 18+, Mumbai pushed to number 3||MUMBAI: Thane district tops the state in vaccination of the 18-44 age-group, followed by Pune, relegating Mumbai to the third spot. Surprisingly, smaller districts like Ratnagiri and Yavatmal are at the fourth and fifth spots, leaving behind districts like Nashik and Nagpur. Maharashtra completed vaccination of 6.27 lakh people from the 18-44 age-group in 12 days since the rollout of the drive on May 1. The drive has now been temporarily suspended due to shortage in vaccine supply. According to data compiled by the public health department, Thane district has vaccinated 49,351 beneficiaries, Pune vaccinated 49,280 and Mumbai 46,400 for their first shot. With this leg of the vaccination drive being completely online, city youth were beating their rural counterparts in the race to get vaccinated. Instances of youth from the cities travelling to smaller talukas and even villages to get vaccinated have been reported, upsetting locals. With the online drive, the disparity among districts is wide -- the lowest vaccination was done in Hingoli district, with just 5,138 people vaccinated. Also, the top five districts cumulatively account for 30% of total vaccinations done in the state for the younger age-group. Thane officials said they are happy, but locals are upset about people from cities having grabbed slots. “The idea behind starting vaccination centres in primary health centres and rural hospitals was for better community reach. Instead we saw people travel from as far as Nashik and Pune in their swanky cars and get vaccinated here. The locals are a little miffed, but we had little choice,” said Thane civil surgeon Dr Kailash Pawar. In Pune, officials said they had known that youth of the tech-savvy city would be keen to get vaccinated. Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, deputy director, said they had prepared 220 centres. “As expected, slots would get booked in minutes,” he said. Pune, he said, has a distinct advantage in that vaccines can leave Serum Institute and reach the depot and into a beneficiary’s arm in less than 12 hours. Ratnagiri, which bagged 4th spot, had made videos in Marathi explaining the registering and appointment process. “We launched an awareness campaign in city as well as rural areas. Anganwadi workers were going across villages, giving information. Handbills, pamphlets and cable TV were used to create awareness,” said Dr Babita Kamlapurkar, district health officer. An official from Hingoli district said the online system was hard for people from rural areas to follow and there was a lack of drive among youth to get a vaccine slot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/thane-and-pune-on-top-in-giving-shots-to-18-mumbai-pushed-to-no-3/articleshow/82622750.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Lucknow||DL, PAN & passport valid as residence proof for vaccine shot||LUCKNOW: There are more options of documents now to use as proof of residence for registration on the CoWin portal for Covid-19 vaccination in the 18-44 years category. Till now, Aadhaar was the only document accepted for registration which is mandatory in the category. Now, one can use driving license, PAN card, passport and pension passbook to provide proof of residence. The orders in this regard were issued by managing director, national health mission (NHM), UP, Aparna U late on Wednesday night. Besides, there is no binding to produce domicile proof now. This means that a native of any place in the country living in UP can register to take the Covid-19 vaccine. The move will make things easy for many people especially those living and working in NCR. “Anyone living in Uttar Pradesh can get vaccinated here. There is no binding for the person to be a permanent resident of UP and produce an Aadhaar card. Citizens can show rent/lease agreement, electricity bill, bank passbook and employer certificate at vaccination sites for verification,” the order stated. The clarification followed a previous order issued by the same officer on May 7. That order expressed concern over people of other states getting themselves registered for vaccination in UP and directed them to submit a local address proof. “As the state government is purchasing vaccines for citizens in the age group of 18 to 44 years, only citizens of the state should be inoculated. Therefore, before vaccinating any individual at a government Covid vaccination centre, it should be ensured that the beneficiary is a citizen of Uttar Pradesh. No vaccination of residents of other states should be done at government Covid vaccination centres,” the order had stated. A barrier for many in the vaccination process, the problem was flagged by TOI in a news report on May 10. Embarrassed over the issue, NHM UP issued the clarification on social media and on Wednesday night, the official order was released.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/dl-pan-passport-valid-as-residence-proof-for-vax-shot/articleshow/82618655.cms||Shailvee Sharda

According to the new directive, it would now be12 to16 weeks (three to four months). “Gujarat will recalibrate the system based on the new guidelines. Thus, the vaccination drive is suspended for three days – May 14 to 16. The drive would resume from Monday. However, those who have already got the appointments in 18-44 years age group would be inoculated,” said Jayanti Ravi, principal secretary (health & family welfare). “It is open only for those who have got the SMS confirmation. It would not be extended for the 45+ years age group.” The announcement was met with shock and surprise. Kalpen Lathiya, a construction contractor from Gota, said that he had delayed the second dose of vaccination by a few days despite his family’s suggestion to get inoculated. “The days were increased from four weeks to six. And before we could plan, it’s again increased to three months. The changes are taking place when everyone wants to safeguard against the virus. A warning would have been great,” he said. According to the state health department, as of Thursday evening, Gujarat had vaccinated 1.09 crore persons for the first dose and 37.89 lakh for the second. On Thursday, 72,625 persons were vaccinated for the first dose and 79,147 for the second.

During the review meeting, the matter of frequent power failures at Palla facility was also discussed. DJB has installed about 115 tube wells and 5 ranney wells in Palla. The water production from here is about 30 MGD and is likely to be increased further, an official said. Chadha said that frequent power failures that last anywhere between 2-10 hours on a daily basis, there has been a loss in water production in May. “Similar losses have been observed in earlier months as well,” he said. The VC said he has spoken to the CEO of the power discom and asked him to take necessary measures for reducing power failures, particularly at a time when is Delhi facing acute shortage of water due to reduced supply from Haryana. The vice-chairperson instructed DJB officials to efficiently manage the available water to minimise inconvenience to the public through judicious rationalisation across networks and enhanced tanker supply to the affected areas. DJB has also issued directions to ensure uninterrupted water supply to medical establishments and Covid hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/djb-calls-meet-to-rationalise-water-supply/articleshow/82616634.cms||---

After his visit to the two districts, where he inspected district hospitals and the integrated command and control centres, the CM said, the difference between the first wave and second wave was the degree of infection which led to a sudden surge in demand for oxygen. He said in the first wave, 300 tons of oxygen were sufficient for hospitals, but currently the state is providing as much as 1,030 tons. “We should not make the mistake of taking this as an ordinary flu. It’s crucial to get oneself tested if symptoms surface. Prevention is the best course of action. The state government has launched a massive drive in rural areas to identify people with symptoms and provide treatment,” he said. The CM said, in Agra, active cases had dipped by about 1,750 in the past week and by 600 in Mathura. In the 18-44 age category, more than 10,000 people have been vaccinated in Agra, 6,000 in Mathura and 5,700 in Ferozabad. “We have begun setting up 377 oxygen plants in the country of which 161 are being funded by PM Cares. We have also distributed 20,000 oxygen concentrators in all districts. In Agra division, the positivity rate is coming down and more than 3,800 oxygen beds are available along with 340 ventilators and 162 ambulances. We have sanctioned 20 new oxygen plants for Agra district of which two are operational,” the CM said, adding in Mathura, 11 oxygen plants have been approved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogi-calls-for-unity-to-boost-morale-of-frontline-warriors/articleshow/82618701.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Corporates told to procure vaccine for their employees||AHMEDABAD: At a time when the country is facing constraints in the supply of Covid-19 vaccines, the Gujarat government’s health department has asked corporates and industries in the state to extend their support by vaccinating their employees. At a meeting chaired by principal secretary (health) Jayanti Ravi, the government has asked the corporates to start sourcing of vaccines directly from manufacturers, including from overseas. The meeting was attended by about 500 representatives from corporates and industries across Gujarat, said sources. “This is a welcome move. We think the government should consider expanding the definition of frontline workers and include people from more areas including aviation, traders and even milkmen and vegetable sellers. The government should procure and give vaccines to the industry and corporate houses for the frontline workers employed with them on a priority basis. Of course, it should on a chargeable basis,” said Piruz Khambatta, chairman and managing director Rasna Industries Pvt Ltd. The company aims to vaccinate a total of 5,000 employees, both directly and indirectly working for the company. There are some concerns behind the government’s decision. While some claim that the offer to the corporates to participate in the vaccination drive has come too late and should have been done in the month of January which would have given them enough time till now to procure. “Many corporates are yet to place orders and even when this is done it would take months for them to procure vaccines given the supply crunch the country is facing today,” said a government official aware of Thursday’s meeting. At the meet, industries in the state were encouraged to setup their own private Covid Vaccination Centre at their premises upon fulfilling certain conditions. “Gujarat is leading in vaccination to healthcare, frontline workers, the process of vaccination is now well established and the state wants rapid vaccination in industry workers too, therefore industries are allowed to procure approved vaccines directly from the manufacturers. They can even import them,” Ravi said at the meeting. Already some of the corporates in Gujarat have begun vaccination for their employees. Reliance Industries has vaccinated 26,404, 704, and 2,142employees at their Jamnagar, Bharuch, and Vadodara units, she said. A presentation by the state’s health department at the meeting highlighted how the Private Covid Centre Vaccination (PCVC) program will be conducted and how authorization shall be given to the industry representatives. The module is designed in such a way that complete data from procuring vaccines to vaccination will be stored on the government portal. ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel (AM/NS) India placed an order for vaccinating about 45,000 employees with Serum Institute of India, Pune for the Covishield vaccine. The company, which ordered three weeks ago, is waiting for the vaccines. “One can only import vaccines that have Centre’s clearance,” said a senior corporate official working in Gujarat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/corporates-told-to-procure-vaccine-for-their-employees/articleshow/82614720.cms||---

Black fungus, a life-threatening fungal infection, is being detected among Covid-19 patients having comorbidities (a state of having multiple medical conditions like diabetes, kidney disease, HIV and cancer at the time when the diseases interact with each other causing debilitating effects) and those who are on immunosuppressant medicines. The two confirmed Mucormycosis patients in the district are recuperating at the intensive care unit (ICU) of Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College and Hospital (JLNMCH). A Covid positive senior nurse has also been reportedly affected with black fungus. The family members of the nurse have shifted her to a hospital in Patna for further tests and treatment. Dr Hem Shanker Sharma, associate professor in the department of medicine and nodal officer of Covid care centre at JLNMCH, has confirmed about two Covid positive patients contracting black fungus. “We have sent the samples of the patients for cytological test and tissue biopsy and are awaiting test reports. Tissue biopsy should be conducted immediately if such symptoms are reported. Antifungal therapy should also be started as early as possible,” Dr Sharma said. Asked about some reports about scarcity of the injection used in the treatment of this specific disease in local markets, Dr Sharma said, “We have sufficient medicines at JLNMCH to treat the patients with such fungal disease.” Associate professor in the department of medicine at JLNMCH Dr Raj Kamal Choudhary, who had also worked in World Health Organisation for more than eight years as sub-regional coordinator, said early symptoms of black fungus are swelling and redness in the eyes, cheeks and other body parts, black crusts or blisters on the skin, shortness of breath, fever, sinus congestion and headache. “Amphotericin-B and Voriconazole injections are given to the patients having Covid-triggered black fungus infection,” Dr Choudhary said, adding all the treatments should be under the supervision of expert doctors only. Bhagalpur civil surgeon could not be contacted despite repeated attempts by this newspaper.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/detection-of-2-black-fungus-cases-in-bhagalpur-worries-docs/articleshow/82615205.cms||Kumar Rajesh

But on Wednesday evening when Sakina, who was six-month pregnant, developed labour pain, the couple got anxious. Had they not contacted 108 EMRI ambulance in time, chances were high high that their first child would not have survived. The paramedical staff of the emergency services rushed to the couple’s help and took Sakina to Jabugam health centre. The distance between the couple’s home and the health centre was around 16 km and with every passing minute, Sakina’s pain was becoming unbearable. Rathwa asked the ambulance pilot Jagdish to stop the vehicle by the roadside as he prepared Sakina for delivery. A few minutes later, Sakina gave birth to a baby boy, but since it was a premature delivery, the infant was not responding. “I could not feel the pulse and he was not breathing. But as we are trained to handle such situations, I started CPR on the baby,” said Rathwa. Meanwhile, he also consulted a doctor from the emergency response center and tried to resuscitate the infant with a bag valve mask. “The baby started breathing after a while and it also cried, so our hopes were renewed,” he said. Jagdish then drove the ambulance to Jabugam health centre. “The infant was revived but it was still serious, so we took them to a private hospital in Bodeli town,” Rathwa said .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/premature-infant-boy-revived-with-cpr/articleshow/82612526.cms||---

There were also complaints of people not receiving their pass despite submitting an application and in some cases passes being issued which were only valid for a day. “We have an appointment for a medical procedure on May 17. I am not able to raise an epass since yesterday evening after trying for twenty odd times. Please help and let us know how to proceed further?” Remya Gangadharan asked on Twitter. Similar was the case with Sandeep Dillerao who said: “I am trying to apply for epass on-site, but it is not getting processed. Despite, multiple attempts, I am unable to apply for a pass.” Few complained that despite applying for a pass, their pass had not been approved by police. “My 20 months old baby is at my home with his grand mother in Andhra Pradesh. We, parents of the baby, came to Telangana and are unable to go back due to lockdown. We have applied for epass, but is not yet approved,” said Srilekha Pedasanaganti on Twitter, tagging the DGP, CMO and minister KT Rama Rao. Meanwhile, police have asked people to refrain from applying for e-pass without strong reasons. “We have issued over 3,000 passes so far. Many people are applying for a pass, even for small things. Please apply for a pass only if it is urgent,” said Hyderabad police commissioner, Anjani Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/locals-complain-of-e-pass-app-glitches/articleshow/82616951.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Demand to begin home delivery of alcohol grows louder in Telangana||HYDERABAD: Days after liquor suppliers made an appeal for home delivery of alcohol in the state, the International Spirits and Wine Association of India has now written to the Telangana government, raising a similar plea. Citing the example of states like Maharashtra that has allowed the delivery of alcoholic beverages to the doorstep of consumers, amid a lockdown, the body — representing national and international spirits and wine companies with businesses in India — has urged Telangana to follow suit. As part of the ongoing 10-day lockdown in Telangana, liquor shops have been allowed to stay open between 6am and 10 am. Hearing news of the lockdown, long queues were seen outside the stores, raising fears of the virus spreading in the swelling crowd. “Allowing home delivery by existing licensed retailers will avoid crowding at retail outlets and stop the sale of spurious liquor through illegal supply chains, while simultaneously ensuring the government’s revenue from alcoholic beverages,” the letter addressed to chief secretary, Somesh Kumar stated. It added: “This is the most suitable and most easily implementable model to allow retailers to take orders directly over phone and WhatsApp and use their staff to execute the home deliveries.” Apart from Maharashtra, other states including West Bengal, Odisha, Chhattisgarh and Meghalaya too have adopted the home delivery model for alcohol, the letter stated. Earlier, the Association of Liquor and Beer Suppliers had made a similar pitch to the state, while also highlighting how the move would help protect the “livelihood of lakhs of people employed in this trade”. “We had also proposed that retail outlets be allowed to stay open for a few hours during the day — like 12 pm to 5 pm, for instance — instead of early morning when consumers usually step out to buy essentials not alcohol,” said M Kameshwara Rao, president of the association. The government, however, is yet to take a call on these appeals. “For now, there is no plan to initiate home delivery or consider any other such suggestion. If the lockdown is extended beyond the 10-day-period, then we might consider it. But that will be decided only following discussions with chief minister,” said V Srinivas Goud, excise minister, Telangana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/demand-to-begin-home-delivery-of-alcohol-grows-louder-in-state/articleshow/82616413.cms||Sudipta Sengupta
---||Hyderabad||Covid-19: Social media prescriptions the new headache||HYDERABAD: Apart from the second wave of infections, doctors are now concerned over many taking to vitamins, antibiotics, and steroids based on prescriptions which are being circulated through messages and social media. Doctors fear long-term use of such medication can pose a bigger problem post-pandemic as indiscriminate use is not only causing side-effects but might also interfere with future treatment of other ailments. Instances of toxicity are being reported as a result of people taking vitamin-D for months. In many cases, side-effects like digestive problems, diarrhoea and others which are similar to Covid-19 symptoms can be seen. “Unlike other vitamins, vitamin-D has toxicity and since the pandemic outbreak, many have been taking vitamin-D supplements in high doses for months. The vitamin should not be taken without running tests and not consumed for months at a stretch. Usually, vitamin-D is prescribed for around one to two months. Now, we are getting patients complaining of severe abdominal pain, diarrhoea, unconsciousness,” said Dr Rahul Agarwal, internal medicine consultant at Medicover Hospitals. Dr Agarwal added also pointed out that indiscriminate use of antibiotics can make these drugs less effective in future courses of treatment. Excessive use of unwanted antibiotics and antifungals can lead to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) which is estimated to cause 10 million deaths per year by 2050 across the world. “Certain drugs like Ivermectin and Doxycycline have shown no proven benefit in any major research trials. However, there are lot of prescriptions on social media and most patients tend to take these as initial treatment and rush to hospitals once the disease becomes severe after the first week of illness. This is leading to increased mortality due to a delay in starting appropriate medication,” said Dr Hari Kishan Gonuguntla, lead interventional pulmonologist at Yashoda Hospitals, Secunderabad. Dr Hari Kishan said that while steroids do play an important role in treatment, they have to be taken under medical supervision. “The timing of steroids should be very appropriate as early steroids during viral replication phase can further promote replication,” he said, adding that self-prescribed steroids can lead to major complications which can complicate the viral disease.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/social-media-prescriptions-can-do-more-harm-docs/articleshow/82617174.cms||Amrita Didyala

Shops opened early in the morning on the last day of holy month of Ramzan in Old City and people rushed to the markets to buy essential commodities and other priducts, as social distancing was not maintained and many were seen without masks. The lockdown has greatly affected traders and vendors as the profit and loss is usually decided in the last few days leading to Eid. But the source of income of shopkeepers was marred abruptly by the imposition of lockdown.“I was sure that a lockdown will not be imposed as chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had stated there would be no further lockdown in the state. So, we had stocked many products like clothes, accessories etc. But to our surprise, the government imposed lockdown, causing huge losses. We have incurred loss as more than 80% business was hit,” said Saddam, a vendor at Charminar. Charminar, Gulzar House, Pathergatti, Laadbazar and adjoining localities were seen busy with people purchasing essential commodities for Eid-Ul-Fitr. Grocery stores, barber shops, meat shops, milk outlets etc were busy with customers. People requested the high court to take note of their sufferings due to the lockdown. “We have no option but to step out in case of emergency. Our daily earnings have stopped suddenly. Due to our financial crisis, HC should ask the government to help us out financially as well,” a vendor, Fareed, told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/old-city-residents-flock-to-markets-despite-lockdown/articleshow/82616584.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||After OSD, HCA now mired in CEO mess||Hyderabad: The war of attrition between Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA) president Mohammed Azharuddin and the apex council members continues and is threatening to derail the administration. A week after the appointment of an officer on special duty (OSD) to the Ombudsman and Ethics Officers was shot down by Azharuddin, the former India captain stated on Thursday that the apex council members led by secretary R Vijayanand were reducing the body to a “proprietorship concern and the governance of the HCA to a street shop by their acts of ignorance and arrogance”. The president said that he “will not rest even if it means that everything comes to a standstill for the rest of my tenure because it is now or never”. Azhar’s statement came after Vijayanand declared that Suneel Kante has joined HCA as CEO in the presence of apex council members John Manoj (vice-president), Vijayanand, Naresh Sharma (joint secretary) and Surender Agrawal (treasurer) on Thursday. “He is available at the HCA office during office hours,” the secretary informed the members. Lashing out at his colleagues, Azhar termed the appointment of the CEO illegal and that it suffers from procedural infirmities. First, eligibility conditions as per Rule 23(1) were not met, Azhar said. “I have not been consulted, I have not assessed any candidate to confirm if he meets the eligibility conditions prescribed in 23(1). I’m sure other educated and rule compliant members — at least 3 of them have not been consulted.” Also, according to Azhar, the in-house procedure that needs to be set up for appointing a CEO was not adhered to. “The CEO & CFO positions were advertised in the newspaper on my push, then radio silence. And suddenly this announcement. True reflection of decision making in a proprietorship concern.” In his letter to club secretaries, Azhar urged them “to stop the proprietorship administration currently being practised to promote corruption in HCA. I will be as hard as I can to achieve a clean administration,” he added. A former HCA secretary speaking on condition of anonymity, said: “The president hasn’t appointed a CEO nor is he letting others do it. The HCA has been without a CEO and CFO for some time and that is not the way the association should function.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/after-osd-hca-now-mired-in-ceo-mess/articleshow/82616524.cms||Solomon S Kumar

This was because CoWIN allowed this entry,” says a senior AMC official. The issue was flagged before the state government recently by a few major cities. “While CoWIN is being recalibrated, we will take a day to instruct supervisors, vaccinators and verifiers at various centres to adhere to the new guidelines,” the official said. As of Thursday, a total of 11.08 lakh individuals in the city received their first vaccine dose, while 4 lakh their second dose. Of all who have been vaccinated just 1.32 lakh in the 18-30 age group have received at least one dose of the vaccine, while there are 1.92 lakh such individuals in the 30-45 age group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/4l-receive-second-dose-in-city-so-far/articleshow/82614593.cms||---

It had been brought to the notice of the state government that several patients from different states were being brought to Telangana in ambulances or private vehicles for admission in its hospitals. Following this, the government asked all hospitals to apply in a prescribed format to the control room, and furnish basic details such as name of patient and attendant, age, state, contact and type of treatment required. “On receipt of the proposal from the hospital, control room will issue authorisation to travel, based on which the patient can come to Telangana for hospitalisation,” read a memo issued by chief secretary Somesh Kumar. The memo comes in light of a recent incident wherein few ambulances ferrying patients from AP were restricted from entering Telangana.

It is better to begin treatment with symptoms as the regular flu symptoms are also like Covid- 19. That is our plan,” director of health Dr Srinivasa Rao on Thursday said. Addressing a media conference Rao said over the past week, 24,887 teams touched 70 lakh households as part of its fever survey. Expressing concern over more people coming out during the relaxation of curfew hours, Rao, who was adressing a media conference along with Dr Ramesh Reddy, director of medical education (DME) said the purpose of curfew would be defeated if more than one person from each house comes out to buy essentials. “We also observed that some people are not maintaining social distance protocols at functions. Lockdown has been imposed despite people losing livelihoods as the last resort. So please adhere to guidelines,” he said. Rao added the situation is under control in Telangana and positivity rate is also coming down. Making an appeal to private hospitals over the use of limited supply drugs like Remdesivir and Tocilizumab injections, he said there are many alternative drugs available in the market which give good results. “In the given situation oxygen along with medicines we are conducting oxygen audit both in government and private hospitals. Telangana is currently getting 400 tonnes of oxygen supply, Rao added. Director of medical education Dr Ramesh Reddy said that state has asked the Centre to sanction 71 oxygen generation plants in addition to the 57 sanctioned plants. He also denied cases of black fungus rising in the state. “Very few Covid- 9 patients who have become immuno-suppressant will get that. There are three such cases reported in Gandhi, who were referred by private hospitals,” the medical education director added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-suspects-to-get-immediate-attention/articleshow/82616845.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Many of these applicants, including students, employees and those seeking dependent visas, who had booked their appointments beforehand, were seen queueing up at the VFS centre in Banjara Hills between 6am and 10am on Thursday. The government’s lockdown has led to closure of the VFS centre, has resulted in large scale ambiguity among applicants who were waiting to get their visas processed. “I received my passport request on 1 May for Canadian student visa. I took the premium services from the VFS Hyderabad during the bio-metric. I want to get my passport stamped as it is important to get my education loan from the bank. Please help,” tweeted Suresh, a student. Following many such queries from applicants, the VFS centre opened its doors for those who had booked their slots for UK on Thursday. “My wife works in the UK and I reached out to the VFS centre to process my dependent visa. While my appointment which was due on Thursday was considered, many others who had their appointments booked for May 12 were asked to go back as there was no communication from VFS,” said Sandeep P, an applicant.

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Hussainsagar, 2 other lakes infested with coronavirus||HYDERABAD: Hussainsagar, which is synonymous with chemical and biological cesspool, is now infested with the novel coronavirus, a research study revealed. Apart from the Hussainsagar, other city lakes where the virus has been found are Pedda Cheruvu or Nacharam lake and Nizam Talab or Turka Cheruvu in Pragathinagar near Kukatpally. The coronavirus, however, has not found its way into lakes that are in peri-urban and rural areas around Hyderabad. Edulabad and Potharaju lakes on city outskirts are free of the rogue pandemic germ. Though the lakes are infested with the novel coronavirus, the good news is that there are so far no documented studies to prove Covid-19 can spread through water unlike the polio virus. That the city lakes now harbour the novel coronavirus has come to light in a research study done by scientists of the Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (IICT) and Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad and the Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad. The research team, which earlier scoured sewage and waste water to find out the presence of the pandemic virus shed through human faeces as part of waste water epidemiological (WWE) study, has now included the lakes within the city and outskirts. Referring to faecal-oral transmission, the scientists said unlike the polio virus, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through water contamination is not well established. Only one report showed successful culturing of SARS-CoV-2 virus from waste water. “The independent previous studies showed presence and persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage water and water bodies such as lakes and rivers, because of which the possible faecal-oral transmission cannot be neglected,” they said. Almost all the city lakes are linked to the municipal sewerage network and a major portion of the waste water is let into these water bodies untreated. The study of the city lakes has also revealed that there were early signals of Covid-19 second wave onset in February. The impact was realised only by mid-April. The result of the research study was published in preprint server ‘MedRxiv’ on May 12. “We monitored urban, peri-urban and rural lakes in and around Hyderabad as a long-term surveillance study for presence of enteric virus SARS-CoV-2 (novel coronavirus) gene fragments. The study time of seven months coincided with the first and second wave of Covid-19 infection,” the researchers said. The study depicted differential viral RNA copies in the urban lake with high viral load observed during the peaks of wave I and wave II. The study found a distinct variability in viral genes detection among all five lakes, which were in concordance with the human activity of the catchment area. The SARS-CoV-2 genes were not detected in peri-urban and rural lakes, whereas the urban lakes having direct functional attributes from domestic activity in the community showed presence of viral load.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hussainsagar-2-other-lakes-infested-with-coronavirus/articleshow/82616146.cms||Syed Akbar

A video of the boy along with another youth, purportedly dealing with customers, has gone viral on social media. In the video, Covid-19 norms including wearing of mask and maintaining social distancing were seen being violated at the shop. UP Child Rights Commission has taken cognizance of the incident and ordered a probe into the matter. When asked what he was doing at the shop, the boy said that the license of the shop was issued in the name of Sukhvir Singh, who is his father and the shop belongs to him. He further said that his father had gone back to his home for a break. Speaking to TOI, UP Child Rights Commission’s chairperson Dr Vishesh Kumar Gupta said, “At a time when the government and administration is gearing up for a third wave of Covid-19, which is likely to impact the children, a video has come to the fore where a minor boy was spotted dealing with customers at a liquor shop.” Kumar added, “The commission has written a letter to the UP DGP HC Awasthy, principal secretary of UP, Moradabad district magistrate Rakesh Kumar Singh and Moradabad SSP Prabhakar Chaudhary, to take cognizance. It is a matter of investigation. Such act is punishable offence with an imprisonment of up to five years. Legal action shall be taken up in the case as per the provisions of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015.” The Child Rights Commission said that a probe has been ordered. Based on the investigation report, further legal action will be initiated. Moradabad police, meanwhile, said that police personnel had rushed to the spot after the video had gone viral. SHO Kotwali police station said that an inquiry revealed that the boys, one 17-year-old and the other 21-year-old, had come to meet father at the shop and were just looking after the shop in father’s absence and not dealing customers. Police said that no complaint has been received in the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/minor-found-selling-liquor-at-fathers-shop-child-rights-panel-orders-probe/articleshow/82612927.cms||Maria Khan
---||Hyderabad||Telangana doing all to procure as many vaccines as it can: KT Rama Rao||Telangana industries and municipal minister KT Rama Rao took part in a Twitter Q&A, #AskKTR, to answer citizens’ queries on the pandemic and the government’s strategies to handle the situation. The minister said Telangana was performing better than the national average for vaccination. Koride Mahesh tracks some of the important questions and answers. Q: When you are planning to start vaccines for 18+ age group?KTR: Problem is availability of vaccine. We are making all efforts to procure as much as we can right now. The focus is to get 2nd dose to all those 45-lakh people who have taken the first jab. So far in Telangana out of the total 45 plus population of 92.24 lakhs, we have vaccinated 45.37 lakh people with first dose. Second dose has been given to more than 10.3 lakh people. Vaccine distribution is currently being handled only by GoI. Q: Can we see essentials open later & longer? 6 to 10 window forces shops to get supplies once a day, tonnes of veggies milk and perishables spoil overnight.The 6 am to 10 am window is open every day. Secondly, all e-commerce grocery delivery & food delivery options continue to remain functional. In fact, we are getting criticism for keeping the four-hour window open. But this had been done to minimise inconvenience to people. Q: Oxygen cylinders and Remdesivir are being sold at higher prices. It will benefit the poor if the Telangana government opens counters and sells oxygen cylinders at MRP in all government hospitals.Availability of oxygen is a big challenge across the country. The Centre has taken complete control over distribution by state. On Remdesivir, we are doing an audit by pvt hospital on consumption. Have found some cases of indiscriminate usage. Q: Are you considering higher efficacy vaccines like Pfizer-BioNTech for global procurement in Telangana?Whatever is allowed by Drug Controller General of India is what we can procure. So far only three vaccines are available; Covaxin, Covishield and Sputnik Hopefully Pfizer & Moderna will be allowed. By August I am hearing that another Indian vaccine may also be available from BE. Q: Since many days testing is being done in 70K but there were days we have done 1.2 lakh test daily. Why not conduct 1.5 lakh daily for about 10 to 14 days and then analyse if cases are really decreasing as you are claiming?Even ICMR guidelines state clearly that as soon as anyone has symptoms, whether or not testing proves conclusively, they can get started on vitamin supplements and basic medication. Q: Some corporates are procuring vaccines for their employees, why are we not procuring vaccines directly from manufacturers?The Centre has mandated that 85% of all production be handed over to it. From the remaining 15% all states & institutions have to compete. It’s easier to procure for a few hundred employees but challenge is manifold when your state population is 3.6 crore. However, the government is in discussions with all three vaccine makers; Bharat Biotech, Serum Institute and Dr Reddy Labs. Will do our best to procure as much as we can. Q: Hyd being pharma hub and home to Covaxin, is state govt coordinating with Bharat biotech to share formula and increase production of vaccine with all other pharma companies? If yes, what’s the status quo?This is a decision that has to be taken by Govt of India Q: Is Covid 19 going to impact your brain child setting up the Pharma City in city outskirts?If anything, it showed how important our pharma industry is. Earlier, we had called Hyderabad Pharma City a project of national importance but now clearly it is going to be a project of International importance. Q: We, Telangana Junior Doctors Association members need some self-respect, dignified salaries, proper protection and free qualitative treatment for all health care workers. Will take this to the notice of CM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/state-doing-all-to-procure-as-many-vaccines-as-we-can/articleshow/82617240.cms||Koride Mahesh

The duo was later released. M K Rana, deputy superintendent of police, Gandhinagar, said the police presence was part of routine bandobust. “We have not detained any person, nor have we tried to obstruct the protest,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gmers-staff-allege-detention/articleshow/82614609.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh minister: Can’t do much to check dumping of bodies in Ganga||LUCKNOW: While the spectacle of floating corpses in the Ganga triggered ripples, and sparked off a slugfest between Uttar Pradesh and Bihar governments over alleged dumping of Covid victims’ bodies in rivers, UP cabinet minister for jal shakti and water resources, Mahendra Singh, said on Thursday his department has little option to check the menace. “People know and understand they should not dump bodies in rivers. But what can be done if people clandestinely do it in the dead of night,” Singh asked, during an exclusive chat with TOI. Singh, however, maintained the administration of districts where corpses were found afloat were taking requisite steps. “There is no doubt Ganga needs to be saved from pollution,” he said. On reports of the mass burials alongside river banks in Unnao, Singh said, there were some villages where Hindus still bury their dead. “Many people are unaware about the practice. Even seers and saints are buried and their graves worshipped,” he said. However, Union Jal Shakti Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat on Wednesday took serious note of the issue and tweeted — Centre has taken a serious note of the issue and instituted measures to curb the practice. The Centre through National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) will ensure all unidentified bodies are disposed as per protocol.” Over 100 unidentified bodies – many of them decomposed and bloated – were found floating in the Ganga over the last few days, triggering fears among residents of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh that bodies of Covid victims were being dumped. While 71 bodies have been fished out in Bihar’s Buxar district, at least 25 bodies were found in neighbouring Ghazipur district and 13 near Varanasi in UP. Earlier, Shekhawat had said, floating bodies in the Ganga in Buxar is unfortunate. It is a matter of investigation. “The government is committed to maintaining piety and continuity of mother Ganga. States of Bihar and UP must take cognizance of the matter immediately,” he said. In Ghazipur, the district administration acted swiftly and formed a committee to probe dumping of bodies, said the UP minister. “Preservation of rivers is everyone’s duty and the government and society have to come together to save water bodies,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/floating-corpses-state-jal-shakti-min-says-hands-tied/articleshow/82618769.cms||Pankaj Shah

They are eager to support district administration’s initial plan to introduce tele-medicine for the remote areas of district. Academy of Paediatrics (AOP), sub-branch of Indian Association of Paediatricians, would soon hand over data of the experts of their fields, information of hospitals, infrastructure of paediatric intensive care unit (PICU), oxygen, ventilators and such facilities, support staffers and other relevant facts which can be useful to fight the third wave. “We are eager to shoulder the crucial responsibility of training and grooming the non-paediatric health professionals and support staff on how to handle minor patients and their ailments which is different from the management of adults,” said AOP, Nagpur, vice-president Dr Sanjay Deshmukh. “Paediatricians are already offering services through tele-medicine. We are eager to provide similar service to children exclusively if the administration wants us to,” he said. Top paediatrician Dr Uday Bodhankar, who expressed concern over 30% of the population in America in the age group between 0-18 years of age is already affected with covid. “Around 80-85% of the affected minors would have mild symptoms, 10% moderate and 5% severe. The chunk of 80-85% can be treated with tele-conferencing easily,” said Bodhankar adding that every district must have a ‘Corona child help group’ on WhatsApp offering tele-medicine or tele-consultations. District collector Ravindra Thakare, who held a meeting with city’s paediatricians, said that tele-medicine was part of his effort to build capacity of health team in rural and taluka places. “Our strategic apprehension is rural and minor population getting worst affected,” said the collector. “In that case, bringing the health professionals of the villages on the same level with that of the more experienced and expert lot is the current objective,” said Thakare. Leading paediatrician Dr Satish Deopujari, who is also part of the Covid paediatric task force, said not only the experts from region but even overseas would also be eager to help if the district administration so felt. “If tele-medicine is successful, there would be much less load coming from the rural areas on urban infrastructure,” he said. Dr Dipty Jain, head of the department of the paediatrict department of GMCH Nagpur, said physical examination cannot be replaced all the time. “Ideally, there should be an involvement of a local doctor too for making the concept of tele-medicine successful,” she said. Dr Sandeep Mogre of the Mogre Children Hospital said tele-medicine can be useful for patients with mild symptoms and follow up visits can be curtailed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/admin-ready-to-use-tele-medicine-for-kids-in-remote-areas/articleshow/82618794.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Hyderabad||Two Hyderabad businessmen duped of Rs 22L in social media con job||HYDERABAD: Cyber fraudsters duped two city-based businessmen of Rs 11 lakh each by hacking their close contact’s WhatsApp account. The beneficiary bank accounts are based in Delhi, north-east states, Bengaluru and Kolkata. Police have written to WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, seeking details of the fraudsters. On May 12, Sriram of Gachibowli approached the police saying that he received a WhatsApp message from his US-based cousin Sujatha’s number seeking money for medical attention. Without calling his cousin, he transferred Rs 11 lakh to two bank accounts mentioned by the fraudster posing as his cousin. After the money transfer, Sriram called his cousin and realised that her WhatsApp account was hacked by the fraudsters and he transferred money to their bank accounts. On May 13, Narendra of Kukatpally lodged a similar complaint stating that on May 10 he received a WhatsApp message from a US-based schoolfriend Ravi Srinivas asking for money to help a patient who needed immediate medical attention. Narendra transferred Rs 11 lakh to the bank account mentioned by the fraudsters and realised about it when he called Ravi. Cyber crime inspector K Srinivas said the accused called the businessmen’s US-based friends and relatives from their known contact’s WhatsApp number and in the guise of adding them to a WhatsApp group, asked for an OTP received by them. “The OTP was sent when the fraudster initiated WhatsApp installation with the victim’s phone number and when it was revealed to the fraudster, they key that in their phones and take over the WhatsApp account of the target phone number. Even if the original phone number holder tries to reinstall the WhatsApp on his handset, it takes 24 hours to activate due to the recent activation by the fraudster,” the inspector explained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/two-city-bizmen-duped-of-rs-22l-in-social-media-con-job/articleshow/82616611.cms||Mahesh Buddi

Sessions will start at 1 pm and continue till 5 pm or till vaccines last. Thursday, the first day of vaccination through online appointments- only, was not glitch-free as many complained of a long wait and vaccine stockouts. About 31,377 people in the city took the vaccine on Thursday, which included 6,541 from the 18-44 age bracket who got vaccinated in private centres. More private hospitals in the city have started offering the vaccine. In addition to Nanavati in Juhu and HN Reliance in Charni Road, Criticare in Juhu, Kokilaben in Andheri and Kohinoor Hospital in Kurla have started vaccinating. Since May 1, private hospitals were asked to procure their own vaccines by the state. Many took to Twitter to complain of shortage of doses and wait despite taking an online appointment. “Visited with an appointment with my 90-year-old Dadaji but (was) sent back due to no stock. We were in line for 5 hours without any support from the authorities. Please take accountability,” said one social media user. Another wrote to the BMC handle saying, “A similar horrifying experience.. Had a confirmed appt for my mother 89yrs, mother in law 79yrs, Willingdon Sports drive in Tardeo..60+ drive in facility. Had to travel from Borivli to Tardeo. After reaching there, officials kept us waiting for 2 hours then saying no vaccine.” An official said they had got around 80,000 doses which have been distributed to all centres. “Sometimes there is delay in picking up doses. Doses are few and distributed to many centres. There will be no vaccination on Saturday and Sunday.” AMC Suresh Kakani said the Monday-Wednesday walk-in system and Thursday-Saturday online system was on a trial basis. “We will take a review on Wednesday,” he said.  Meanwhile the state is inching towards administering 2 crore shots.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-walk-ins-but-vax-sessions-from-1-to-5-pm-today-for-45-break-on-sat-sun/articleshow/82616654.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Plea bats for ayurvedic treatment||AHMEDABAD: A petition in the Gujarat high court has sought directions to use ayurvedic medicines for Covid-19 treatment in all government hospitals, and that private hospitals should be encouraged to use them. Petitioner-advocate Nimish Kapadia has filed an application requesting the HC to allow him to join the suo motu PIL on Covid-19. Besides use of ayurvedic medicines, the petitioner has sought various other reliefs. He has urged for preventive detention for black-marketeers of remdesivir and oxygen in this time of crisis. He has demanded that laws like PASA and NSA should be invoked against such criminal elements who seek to profiteer in this humanitarian crisis. In his application, advocate Kapadia stated, “Ayurvedic medicines are also helpful in preventing the infection and also in curing the patients from Covid-19 infection. This also reduces the financial burden of the government authorities as well as on the citizens. It is noticed that a very less thrust is given to the distribution and use of Ayurvedic medicines. Wide publicity is required to be given for using Ayurvedic medicines and for Ayurvedic treatment in the hospitals.” Besides, the petitioner has sought directions to consider making mandatory for all hospitals giving Covid treatment to establish oxygen plants within stipulated time. He has sought to increase number of railway coaches prepared as isolation centres for all major railway stations. The petition is likely to be heard on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/corona-plea-bats-for-ayurvedic-treatment/articleshow/82614709.cms||---

On April 29, accused Ajeet Kumar (23), a labour contractor in a packaging company in Dundigal, and his associate Mukesh Kumar (21), a native of Bihar, followed the ATM cash loading van of Writer Safeguard on a stolen bike and looted Rs 5 lakh when the staff stopped the vehicle at HDFC Bank’s ATM centre at Vijaya Nagar in Kukatpally to load the cash in the ATM. While attempting to loot the cash, Ajeet opened fire at the van security guard, Ali Baig, who succumbed to injury later. Cash loading officer Naveen and ATM officer Srinivas had a scuffle with Ajeet and Mukesh when they tried to steal the money. “During the scuffle, Ajeet’s helmet fell on the floor. After the duo fled from the spot with a Rs 5 lakh bundle, locals alerted us and we rushed to the spot,” said an investigator. “The crime scene was secured and the forensic team was able to collect the fingerprints from the helmet of the accused. When it was fed into the database, Ajeet’s details popped up.” Meanwhile, special teams started scouring through the CCTV footage and they had managed to get visuals of the duo escaping on the bike via Miyapur, Bachupally and Kajipally to Medchal. According to Ajeet’s crime record, he had attempted a robbery at Dundigal in 2018 and subsequently, had violated the bail norms. Police got his photo, native place, previous local stay and employment details, ultimately leading to the arrest. “Ajeet wore a shirt over a T-shirt. While escaping from the crime scene, he removed the shirt to hoodwink investigators who were trying to nab him using the colour of his shirt as a reference. We recovered the shirt also,” police said. At the press conference on Wednesday, Cyberabad police commissioner VC Sajjanar said forensic evidence played a key role in solving the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/helmet-helped-cops-nail-atm-assailants/articleshow/82616658.cms||Mahesh Buddi

Only 1,133 in Andhra Pradesh and 500 people in Telangana in that age group have received the jab. In the entire country, 34.6 lakh have been vaccinated in this age group ever since the programme was rolled out on the first day of the month. According to the Union ministry of health, Maharashtra leads the pack with 6.5 lakh people in 18-44 age group vaccinated, followed by Rajasthan at 5.5 lakh, Delhi at 4.7 lakh and Gujarat (3.8 lakh). The Telangana government has not started vaccination for this age group due to severe shortage of vaccines for administering second doses for people aged 45 years and above. Both AP and Telangana have decided to first give the second shot for people in this category. MAUD minister KT Rama Rao on Thursday admitted that the problem has been accentuated by lack of availability of vaccines. “When it is available, we have the ability and infrastructure to vaccinate the entire state within 45 days. Out of 2.9 crore adult population in Telangana, we need to vaccinate 1.9 crore people. Since it is a two-dose vaccine, we need 3.8 crore doses,” he said. According to Niti Aayog, 216 crore doses will be available between August and December this year. The two Telugu states are demanding that the Centre allocate more vaccine stocks to them. AP chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy wrote a letter to PM Narendra Modi asking for permission for other companies to make Covaxin. While 67% of cumulative doses were given to 10 states, AP had a share of 4.1%. Maharashtra topped with 10.7%, followed by Rajasthan at 8.3 % and Gujarat (8.2%). KTR said whatever is allowed by the Drug Controller General of India, the state is in a position to procure them. “So far, only three vaccines — Covaxin, Covishield and Sputnik — are available. Hopefully, Pfizer and Moderna will be allowed too. By August, I am hearing that another Indian vaccine could be available from BE,” he said.

Earlier this month, DDA had offered 67 of its community centres, apart from open spaces that are provided for weddings and other social functions, for setting up of Covid Care Centres and other Covid-related facilities by hospitals, government organisations, RWAs or NGOs as part of a policy. There was, however, also demand for land parcels to set up Covid-related infrastructure and even if for temporary use, DDA required approval from the ministry of housing and urban affairs to allot vacant land parcels. “DDA has been receiving a lot of requests from hospitals for allotment of land on a temporary basis to set up Covid-related infrastructure. The Delhi LG, who is also DDA’s chairman, had approved and recommended the proposal, which has been approved by the ministry now,” an official said. He said that the proposal for temporary land allotment was examined by multiple departments, including the finance and law departments, and it was found that it needed relaxation of the Nazul Rules, 1981, by the Centre. A letter was sent by DDA to the ministry on May 5 for consideration and approval of the proposal, the official said. According to the letter, the requests that DDA has been receiving included the Delhi government’s request for allotment of land near GTB Hospital for establishing an ICU facility and the East Delhi district magistrate’s request for allotment of an open ground at the CWG complex for setting up an oxygen generation plant for a period of six to seven months. While the approval to allot vacant land for setting up Covid-related infrastructure needed approval of the Centre, DDA is already offering its community halls on as-is-where-is basis for any Covid related infrastructure temporarily, for maximum six months, till such time this corona pandemic is prevalent.

Sawant visited the hospital to review the situation and to solve difficulties faced by doctors. Speaking to reporters later Sawant said that more than 150 Covid patients are admitted at the district hospital and “100% of the patients are on oxygen”. “They (patients) are being treated on low oxygen. We have to set up an ICU at Mapusa. I have already directed the health department to start the ICU so that Covid patients can be treated at the district hospital. We have to upgrade all the government hospitals in the state,” Sawant said. Sawant said that the South Goa district hospital in functioning well and over 500 Covid patients are being treated at the hospital. “Because there is no ICU at the North Goa District Hospital we cannot treat critical Covid patients at Mapusa. Once the ICU is started it would be possible to treat these patients,” he further said. Sawant also urged Covid patients with co-morbidities to get admitted at step-up hospitals functioning across the state. Sawant said that since there is no ICU facility at Mapusa ventilators cannot be used. “Once patients are admitted at a step-up hospital they can avoid further health complications. It is the efforts of the state to decentralise and treat patients which will also benefit Covid patients. This will also reduce the load at hospitals and we want to reduce the load. The efforts of the state government is to reduce the burden on doctors. We will try to provide better health facilities to the people of the state,” the chief minister said. Sawant also visited the step-up hospital at Keshav Seva Sadhana, Bicholim. “I reviewed the medical facilities at the hospital which at present has a capacity of 70 beds. 33 Covid patients are receiving treatment currently of which 10 are on oxygen support. The step-up hospitals are reducing the stress on district hospitals as well as the Goa Medical College to a considerable extent,” Sawant said. TOI had earlier reported that step-up unit hospitals at Shyama Prasad Mukherjee stadium, and at Chicalim, Cansaulim, Pernem, Bicholim, Valpoi, Canacona and Curchorem were being operationalised where Covid patients with co-morbidities can be treated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/have-asked-health-dept-to-set-up-icu-at-mapusa-hospital-cm/articleshow/82618872.cms||---

The positivity rate of the state was also on the decline, down to 17% on Thursday from the 22% last week. Maharashtra on Thursday added 42,582 cases from the 2.5 lakh tests conducted. While there is a drop in cases, fatalities continue to remain high. The state added 850 deaths, taking the total fatalities to 78,857; the state’s total caseload touched 52.6 lakh. Detection of new cases dropped in the city on Thursday, while deaths remained high. A total of 1,952 cases were detected, taking the city’s caseload to 6,83,185. However, there were 68 deaths, which took the city’s overall toll to 14,040. The city has recorded over 915 deaths in the 13 days of May. A senior civic intensivist said that late referrals are turning out to be one of the crucial factors contributing to deaths. “We are getting patients after they have spent about 8-9 days either at home or in other hospitals. Worryingly in young patients, some come with a chest CT scan severity score of 10-13, which rapidly deteriorates to 18-19 in a few days,” the doctor said, adding that in a section of younger patients, the progression was extremely rapid. “But the volume of non-critical patients has certainly dropped,” the doctor added. Deaths continue to be mainly in people with comorbidities. Of the 68 deaths reported on Thursday, 40 had comorbidities. Active cases in Mumbai have dropped to 36,338 from 63,325 on May 1. Dr Pradeep Awate, the state’s surveillance officer, said that Maharashtra’s fatality rate in the second wave is less than 1%. About concerns of under-reporting, he said that numbers are being reconciled as and when they are updated by districts, but the delay is not beyond a few weeks. Tope said that out of the 36 states and Union territories, Maharashtra is at the 31st position in terms of growth of the coronavirus infection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cases-continue-to-slide-in-maharashtra-and-city-but-fatalities-stay-high/articleshow/82616669.cms||Bhavika Jain

Himmatsinh Patel, the Congress MLA from Bapunagar, in the letter said, “Because of an increase in cases of mucormycosis, there is a shortage of Amphotericin B injections in Ahmedabad and other parts of the state. The government has started mucormycosis wards in many government hospitals, but there is a shortage of injections and this problem needs to be addressed urgently.” Patel added, “It has been noted that due to poor treatment of diabetic patients who catch Covid and improper methods of administering oxygen, such patients have been getting the mucormycosis infection. Hospitals have to take utmost care in treating Covid-19 patients.” The Congress also said that the government must ensure adequate supply of oxygen and Covid-19 medicines, to prevent deaths of patients due to unavailability of medicines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cong-tells-govt-to-ensure-mucormycosis-drug-supply/articleshow/82614712.cms||---

Vaccination could have saved lives. The VC raised the demand for additional oxygen, which has been provided,” the CM said. A government spokesperson said, oxygen and medicines have been dispatched and the university brass has been promised every possible assistance in handling the situation. The CM also reviewed the vaccination programme and visited the integrated command and control centre, he said. After inspection and a meeting with AMU VC and staff, the chief minister said, the state government had been working on a system of test, treat and trace that helped bring down active cases by 1.06 lakh over 12 days. Anticipating a third wave, the government has set up a separate team to look at issues, like paediatric services, he said. A virtual seminar on post-Covid infections like black fungus will be held in the next few days. “From the first day, we have worked on this policy and managed to control the second wave. Covid tests are happening across the state. We have carried out more than 4.36 crore tests. Compared to the first wave, the second wave’s biggest problem was the sudden rise in oxygen demand. There was no additional demand in the first wave, but with help from the Centre, Railways and Air Force, we have managed to address the problem and are supplying more than 1,000 tons of oxygen per day,” the CM said. Fourteen new oxygen plants had been approved for Aligarh division of which three are functional. The CM said, active cases began to dip in Aligarh as well and over the past week, reduced by more than 200.

The body of 65-year-old Santosh Kumar was tagged as unclaimed (‘lawaris’) and sent to crematorium even as his family members were under the impression that he was in the ICU of Lala Lajpat Rai Medical College, Meerut. The matter had come to the fore on May 7 when Kumar’s daughter, Shifa Shivangi, in a video appeal to chief minister Yogi Adityanath, alleged that her father mysteriously disappeared from the ICU and she was getting no updates on his whereabouts. The appeal forced the hospital to clarify that Kumar had died on April 23, two days after he was tested positive of Covid-19 and brought to the hospital. The family claimed that it was getting regular health updates over the phone. But they lost complete contact on May 3. To this, principal of the medical college, Gyanendra Kumar, had said, “There was another patient with the same name in the ICU ward. Ward attendant used to give the health update of the same person when queried for Santosh.” But the hospital formed a three-member team to look into the lapses. Principal Gyanendra confirmed to TOI that the team has submitted its report to him based on which he has recommended action against seven hospital staffers, including two senior faculties, a senior resident doctor and three sisters in-charge. “The probe committee submitted its report on Wednesday night. I have recommended action against seven staffers. The report has been forwarded to the Director General of Medical Education (DGME) who will take a final call on it,” Gyanendra said. Kumar, a resident of Bareilly, retired as master craftsman from MES. Since March this year, he has been with his daughter in Ghaziabad for the treatment of his wife who was diagnosed with Cancer. Shivangi, in an emotional appeal to Yogi Adityanath, has said they need to at least find closure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/ex-mes-officers-body-cremated-as-unclaimed-7-staffers-of-meerut-hospital-face-action/articleshow/82612967.cms||Piyush Rai

The court was hearing an NGO’s PIL for special masks for persons with speech and hearing impairment and uniformity of fines for skipping a mask. State advocate Bhupesh Samant mentioned a May 5 circular on free masks to homeless people and beggars, and special logo masks “for deaf and dumb”. “Has it been implemented? What is the proof? Show us one mask designed with a logo,’’ said Chief Justice Datta. The judges said they saw a news report where visitors to a hospital wore PPE to see patients. “All hospital waste was dumped in one corner. Clothes, masks, PPE kits. Would they not be dangerous for everybody?” asked Justice Kulkarni. Samant said the waste has to be disposed of in a scientific way. He said CPCB issued guidelines on July 17, 2020, for handling, treatment and disposal of Covid-19 waste. For the NGO, Advocate Asim Sarode said the state must spell out the process of distribution of special masks. The judges directed that on May 19 Samant “shall place before us a sample mask that the government has designed for use by individuals who are deaf and dumb”. Thet also asked how such masks would be handed over to their intended beneficiaries. Samant said the fine for not wearing a mask is Rs 500. Justice Kulkarni said this is the right time to implement the anti-begging law and rescue beggars and put them in homes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-are-local-bodies-aware-of-protocol-on-disposal-of-covid-biomedical-waste/articleshow/82618879.cms||Rosy Sequeira

The decision was taken after a joint visit of the mayor and officials recently. The municipalities have decided to develop child-care wards at major hospitals as the chances of infection among children is expected to be high in the third Covid-19 wave. North Delhi Municipal Corporation on Wednesday started the arrangements at Mrs Girdhari Lal Maternity Hospital. EDMC mayor Nirmal Jain said that two paediatric Covid wards would be added to the existing dedicated Covid facility at Swami Dayanand. “We are expecting to create 30-40 bedded facilities with oxygen supply through pipelines,” he said. These wards were earlier used as ‘general ward’, but sometime back the municipality started renovating the building. The mayor said that the renovation will be completed in some time after which the medical equipment will be placed. “We have a dedicated maternity and paediatrician wing in our hospital and this facility will be operational under their supervision,” said Jain. Officials said that at present, doctors and paramedical staff have been diverted to 33 vaccination sites and the process will continue in coming months as more centres are expected to provide vaccination facilities to cover all beneficiaries till end of July or beginning of September. “However, once the vaccination programme starts tapering, more doctors will be devoted to tele-counselling services, especially for children,” said the mayor — Vibha Sharma||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/two-wards-in-edmc-hospital-to-be-turned-into-child-covid-facility/articleshow/82616721.cms||Vibha Sharma

It has also commended the state for arranging medical oxygen to meet increased demand after the pandemic surge. “A laudable model for oxygen transport & tracking! UP government has established oxygen hubs and developed a dashboard, OxyTracker, through which tankers can be tracked real-time. This allows quick and smart allocation of oxygen. Result-1000 MT O2 being lifted instead of 250MT before,” the government think tank tweeted on Thursday. A government spokesperson said, the state had developed an OxyTracker on instructions of chief minister Yogi Adityanath to ensure smooth, timely and transparent supply of oxygen to government and private hospitals. The CM said, in the first wave hospitals did not need more than 300 tons of oxygen, which went up exponentially in the second wave. Currently, the state is supplying more than 1,000 tons of oxygen to various parts of the state. Niti Aayog also said, the house-to-house visits undertaken in a mammoth drive in over 90,000 villages to identify, isolate Covid patients and trace contacts should serve as a model for other states to replicate. “Such proactive test-trace-treat model is effective in tackling the surge,” it added. The exercise has been undertaken in the aftermath of the panchayat polls after which concerns were raised about spread of the virus in rural areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/niti-hails-oxy-tracker-test-trace-drive-in-ups-rural-heartland/articleshow/82618892.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Be ready but no evidence that third wave will affect kids more: Doctors||NAGPUR: Anticipating that more kids are likely to be badly hit in the predicted third wave of Covid-19, the government authorities have started pulling up their socks. Doctors said that preparation at the administrative level is a good idea but there is no need to panic or being anxious about the third wave. “There is no documentary or epidemiological evidence that kids will get affected in large numbers in the possible third wave. All is postulation based on statistics,” said Dr Sanjay Marathe, known for his studies on pediatric vaccines. “Government has started preparations in anticipation which is a good thing. We need more pediatric beds and ICUs in the future. But, parents need not panic because of this,” Dr Marathe added. When asked about the experience in other countries, Dr Marathe said that the USA had a surge in the number of children infected in their second wave. “But, we can’t apply the USA parameter in India. Our conditions are different. Moreover, a vaccine for adults is available now. So, a considerable percentage of the population is protected,” he added. Senior pediatrician Dr Sanjay Deshmukh explained the maths behind the prediction. “In the first wave, less than 2% of total patients were kids. In second, this percentage increased up to 11%. Following this trend, about 28-30% patients in the probable third wave will be kids,” he said adding that mathematical projections don’t work as it is on the ground. “There are many clinical factors like natural immunity of kids, Indian immunization schedule, and availability of vaccines by then. But, as pediatric treatment needs special protocol, we have started training our health workers for it. Nothing wrong in preparations,” he said. Pediatrician and vice-president of the Maharashtra Medical Council Dr Vinky Rughwani said that media reports triggered this news and the administration took it proactively. “I appreciate that the district administration has taken it seriously and started preparations. But, all presumptions are based on retrospective studies. The ultimate solution is to bring vaccines for kids and we are moving towards it. Till then, take care but avoid getting anxious,” he said adding that the picture is being created as if only kids will get infected in the third wave which is wrong. Infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde said that kids from 0 to 10 years of age are naturally safe. “Viral receptors are very less in kids below 10 years of age. Even if infected, their viral load is negligible and they recover fast. It’s rare for them to turn serious. Then comes teenagers from 11 to 18 years of age, and we can manage them by capacity building,” he said. Dr Shinde said that pediatric vaccines for 12-18 age groups should be introduced on war footing as a full and final remedy to avoid this possible surge. Epidemiologist Dr Anand Thatte said that the administration has taken a good step of training doctors and increasing pediatric beds. “The present second wave is receding now and will go down in a month. After that too, we must keep vigilance and follow the Covid appropriate behavior. Otherwise, the virus will once again attack the susceptible population. If vaccination gains pace by then, the only under-18 group will be susceptible,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/be-ready-but-no-evidence-that-3rd-wave-will-affect-kids-more-doctors/articleshow/82618959.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The leafy NRI Seawoods Phase-1 complex, designed by famous architect Hafeez Contractor, has about 1,500 flats with 5,000 residents. On Friday, the drive in collaboration with Apollo Hospital at the society is aiming to start with 800 residents across both the 18-44 and 45-plus age groups. Navi Mumbai municipal corporation officials said rules allow private hospitals to procure vaccines and carry out drives for housing societies and corporates. “Apollo or other hospitals are procuring vaccines on their own and the central government has not put any restrictions,” said NMMC commissioner Abhijit Bangar, adding that shortage has meant the state putting the drive for 18-44 on hold to cater to those needing their second doses. He said the government is trying to procure vaccines to ensure a smooth drive. “The Seawoods Estate Limited (SEL) has tied up with Apollo Hospitals for the vaccination camp. We are hoping to vaccinate as many as 1,600 residents and staff in the first go. We are vaccinating even help and drivers employed by residents. The residents will pay for the vaccination of their support staff, while SEL will pay for their staff,” said Sandeep Sarin, chairman of SEL. Apollo hospital in Navi Mumbai is receiving several requests from housing societies and corporates for conducting vaccination camps, but NRI complex is their first camp in a housing society. “We want to ensure that the maximum individuals get their jabs and in Navi Mumbai, we have been administering Covishield at a price of Rs 850,” said hospital chief operating officer Santosh Marathe. The Fortis Hiranandani Hospital in Navi Mumbai, too, is working on several requests from housing societies and corporates for holding vaccination camps. Sandeep Guduru, facility director of the hospital in Vashi, said: “We have to work out the logistics and also work in conjunction with the local authorities.” Apollo has launched two community vaccination centres, one at the Saraswati Engineering College in Kharghar and the other at Modern School in Vashi with NMMC approvals. “We vaccinated about 735 persons at these two centres on Wednesday,” said an Apollo spokesperson.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/navi-mumbai-complex-first-off-blocks-in-holding-vax-camp-with-pvt-hospital/articleshow/82616750.cms||Sanjeev Devasia

Rivali Park Wintergreens is the first investment by the fund and is also the first project to get completed. It is a large project spread over seven acres consisting of 708 apartments of various configurations in six buildings. The project is developed by CCI Projects Pvt Ltd (CCIPPL), an associate company of Cable Corporation of India. The project was sanctioned Rs 180 crore to revive it after the developer faced a cash crunch. SWAMIH is a special window fund to provide priority debt financing for completion of stalled housing projects in the affordable and middle-income housing sector. It was approved by the Union cabinet in November 2019. Rohan Khatau, director, CCI Projects, said: “We have traversed the last mile with timely financial aid and intervention from the SWAMIH Investment Fund. We have obtained occupancy certificates for the entire project and have commenced the possession process that will help us deliver the homes to our homebuyers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-1st-housing-project-to-receive-spl-govt-funds-completed/articleshow/82618942.cms||---
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: When lockdown is wide open||Tamil Nadu is officially under a lockdown from May 10 to 24, but people are yet to treat it as such. Every day, especially the period till noon, is like a normal day ‒ busy roads full of traffic, people either shopping, haggling or talking in groups, with or without masks. With neither voluntary adherence nor stern enforcement, the lockdown is failing miserably even as the daily Covid-19 caseload cross the 30,000 mark. Across the state, more than 91 lakh cases have been registered for various lockdown violations In Chennai, the usual shopping hubs recorded no dip in vehicular and pedestrian movements in the days following the lockdown announcement. Barring a few surprise vehicle checks in some spots, there have been no concerted efforts by law enforcers to prevent non-essential activities on the roads, around neighbourhoods and in markets. Places such as Flower Bazaar, Broadway and Purasawalkam continue to be packed with a large number of vehicles and autorickshaws plying without a semblance of protocol enforcement. Though private cabs and autorickshaws are not allowed to operate, they are the biggest violators, as they carry more number of passengers than permitted. In districts such as Coimbatore, police are coming across illegal activities as well. On Wednesday, a team of personnel in khakhi swooped down on a farm at Kalikkanaickenpalayam near Thondamuthur and arrested 10 people who were holding rooster fights. Violations of a different kind were spotted in the city. Sree Kumaran Thanga Maligai, a leading jewellery outlet, was sealed for allowing customers on Thursday. A Amalraj, Coimbatore police commissioner and west zone inspector general (IG) said that initially they were just warning motorists, but from Friday violators would be photographed and penalty would be levied. Cases would be slapped on repeat violators, he said. Among the more active law enforcers, the Madurai Corporation collected more than ₹1 crore in fines over the past four days for not wearing masks and not adhering to physical distancing. As a result, many people are now wearing masks to avoid being fined in public places. But the scene changes in residential localities, where masks are forgotten, youngsters hang out in groups and play games and people throng the neighbourhood grocery stores. On Thursday, a number of traders gathered at Villapuram Housing Board area for the weekly market. Officials from the Madurai corporation and police had to intervene and stop them from setting up shop. In Trichy city, police registered around 1,600 cases since May 10 for violations ranging from roaming on the streets after noon citing unnecessary reasons to not wearing masks. At grocery stores and medical shops, no one bothers to queue up or practise physical distancing. Similar scenes are seen at the special counter set up for buying Covid-19 drugs by the Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation at the Government Physiotherapy College in Trichy. With every passing day, the number of vehicles on the city roads is increasing, apparently emboldened by the absence of strict action by police. After instructions from top brass to not harass people, police seemed to have stepped back even in enforcement as well. They are adopting a milder approach in places. On Thursday, several motorists in Pollachi were stopped by police and made to take a pledge that they will not step out unnecessarily. In Chennai, the rising number of cases and violations on the ground have made police take notice and warn that from Friday onwards strict action would be taken by deploying personnel across the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/when-lockdown-is-wide-open/articleshow/82614795.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Vax populi? Poor without smartphones feel left out||MUMBAI: Ghanshyam Mishra was among millions who welcomed ‘Tika Utsav,’ a celebration of the mass vaccination programme (April 11-April 14) PM Modi announced. But reality hit home hard last week when Mishra, a rickshaw driver, took a day off from work to queue up outside a vaccination centre, only to be told that he could not get the jab because he was not registered on the CoWin app. He came later, after his college-going son who owns a smartphone booked a slot for him. Mishra, 50, originally from Jaunpur (UP), can be called privileged among his peers as his family owns at least one smartphone and could get the first dose. Thousands of other poor migrants, daily wagers, domestic help and semi-literate workers at construction sites have not got vaccinated yet because they lack access to smartphones. Since they are not techno-savvy, the poor find it tedious to book a slot for vaccination even if they get access to smartphones. Dongri resident Farook Wakanerwala, 50, who worked as a supervisor at a construction site earlier, said he has been using the same phone for over 10 years. “I never felt the need to buy a smartphone as I find it convenient to use this handset. It has been with me for years and is easy to use. Booking a slot for me now seems a problem. I have two kids who are aged 20 and 22 years, but they have no time to sit and search for a slot for me. I am therefore not even trying to go and take the vaccine,” he said. Wadi Bunder housewife, 65-year-old Aparna Jadhav, said there is a vaccination centre in her locality, but she needs to book an appointment online. “I do not have a smartphone, nor does anyone else in my family. Now just for the sake of taking the jab, I will not consider buying one. I would rather wait to see if they allow walk-ins again,” Jadhav said. Lack of smartphones is a handicap for many Tamilians in Dharavi. “60% of migrants from Tamil Nadu do not have access to smartphones,” said Srithar Tamilan of Mumbai Vizhithezhu Iyakkam, an association of Tamil residents of Dharavi. It had sent a list of demands on behalf of Maharashtra’s 25-lakh-odd Tamil migrants to each of the parties contesting the TN elections recently. The letter also sought a separate ministry that would maintain records of migrants outside the state to ease distribution of welfare measures in emergencies. Ravi Raja, opposition leader in BMC, said, “Our party workers sit with computers to register people online, but the problem is people can get a slot anywhere in the city. For instance, people living in F North ward may get a slot in R Central. A person from a Sion slum will have to travel to Borivli for a shot. Many people are now simply waiting for things to ease.” (Inputs from Richa Pinto, Clara Lewis and Sharmila Ganesan Ram)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-vax-populi-poor-without-smartphones-feel-left-out/articleshow/82616804.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin

---||Goa||Every week, Goa registers four crimes against women||PANAJI: The state has seen at least four cases of crimes against women every week since 2017, Goa police data has revealed. According to the data, over 1,000 such cases have been registered from 2017 to February 2021. Over 200 cases have been registered every year except 2020. It was also stated by the chief minister Pramod Sawant in his reply to a question in the last assembly session. In fact, 286 rape cases have been registered over the past four years. Over 200 cases have been registered every year except 2020, he added. A senior police officer said that in most cases, the accused persons are known to the victim, like their family members or neighbours. He added that in most of these cases, the accused persons have already been arrested. Recently, a woman from Delhi alleged that the owner of a popular beachside restaurant in Calangute had raped her. The complaint has been lodged with Delhi police. In December last year, a Chhattisgarh native was arrested for allegedly raping an elderly woman in Goa. The incident took place around 14 days ago, but was not reported as the 65-year-old woman lives alone and was scared to do so. The 34-year-old accused was arrested within 24 hours of registration of the crime. “Goa has a substantial migrant and tourist population,” a senior police officer said. “Crimes committed by them add to the overall crime figures for Goa.” Enumerating measures taken to check these crimes, police said that the 1091 helpline was specifically established to address women’s complaints, and that PCR vans patrolling the towns and villages of Goa respond to emergencies in “record time”. Tourist police, deployed on beaches, respond quickly to incidents involving women, police said, and personnel are regularly sensitised to handle crimes against women.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/every-week-goa-registers-four-crimes-against-women/articleshow/82616855.cms||Murari Shetye

Donning a PPE kit through the day makes her lose a lot of water from her body through excessive sweating. During the month of Ramzan, it becomes all the more difficult for her to remain hydrated. “But I got the strength from the Divine. As a nurse, how can I stay away from duty during roza (fast)? Getting a bit of weakness is very common, but never have I deterred from my duties or from observing the month of Ramzan,” said Zeba. Civil Hospital authorities said that Zeba is a mother of a three-and-a-half-year-old girl, and her mother is a cancer patient. Her husband is a trader in Prantij. She has handled all the fronts with élan, they said. “On ordinary days, we drink about 3-4 litres of water to remain hydrated, but during Ramzan, I used to have my sehri (morning meal) at 3am and iftar (evening meal) at 7 pm. Due to duty, it often used to take place at the hospital, but I got everyone’s support,” she said. “All religions have utmost regard for serving others, and I am proud of saving many lives through my work.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ppe-dehydrating-but-she-observed-roza-served-patients/articleshow/82614828.cms||---

---||Delhi||As pressure eases, Manish Sisodia offers to share Delhi’s oxygen quota with others||NEW DELHI: With Delhi witnessing a steady decline in the number of Covid-19 cases and a consistent fall in the positivity rate, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia requested the central government on Thursday to reduce the allocation of medical oxygen to Delhi and divert it to states that might be needing the gas more than the capital. Though Delhi faced an oxygen scarcity till recently, the decreasing Covid cases has brought a huge respite. The city recorded a positivity rate of 14.2% on Thursday, which is the lowest in a month, apart from a significant reduction in number of active cases. This has resulted in an increase in availability of oxygenated hospital beds. At a press conference on Thursday, Sisodia said that considering the reduction in cases in Delhi and being a ‘responsible government’, he had written to the Centre requesting reduction in the allocation of oxygen to the city. Sisodia said that Covid cases were at a peak in the last week of April and the first week of May and that on a daily basis, more than 80,000 tests were carried out, with around 27,000 returning positive results. “The positivity rate rose to 36% in that period. But now the positivity rate has reduced to around 14%, and 10,400 new cases have been recorded in the last 24 hours,” he said, adding that the oxygen demand was directly proportional to the increase in cases. He said that because the positivity rate and hospitalised cases had reduced, the oxygen requirement had fallen. In the most intense period, Sisodia said, Delhi needed 700 MT of medical oxygen daily, but the requirement had subsequently dropped to 582 MT, as per the formula determined by the Centre. He said the Centre should divert the surplus from Delhi’s quota to other states. Sisodia added that despite the fact that the state government’s demand for 700 MT was met just once, Delhi government was grateful to the interventions of the Supreme Court, Delhi High Court and the Centre. He said that the interventions meant that Delhi got sufficient oxygen and saved precious lives. “During the peak period, we were getting regular distress calls on oxygen from the hospitals. Now, we receive one or two SOS calls a day, which is resolved without delay,” said the deputy CM. “Delhi government is a responsible government, so it requests the central government to reduce the daily oxygen allocation of Delhi to 582 MT and give the rest to other states.” According to the Delhi government, the total average oxygen supply to Delhi is 579.25 MT per day, around 58% of which arrives in Delhi through roadways and 42% via the railways.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/as-pressure-eases-sisodia-offers-to-share-delhis-o2-quota-with-others/articleshow/82614936.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu parties agree to tighten Covid curbs||CHENNAI: Amid rising cases of Covid-19 and tardy implementation of the lockdown measures in force across Tamil Nadu from May 10 to May 24, an all-party meeting chaired by chief minister M K Stalin on Thursday resolved to intensify the existing restrictions and constitute an all-party legislators’ committee to offer suggestions on improving the Covid guidelines. The CM also said that a meeting of a fee fixation committee will be held soon to fix the cost for RT-PCR tests conducted by private laboratories. Five resolutions were passed at the three-hour long meeting in which members of the DMK, the AIADMK, and their allies took part. “The meeting resolved to intensify the existing restrictions as the state has the responsibility to protect lives,” a resolution said. The parties also decided to engage wholeheartedly in Covid relief work and advise people to strictly adhere to guidelines. The DMK government, which organized its first all-party meeting after assuming power, had pressed the previous AIADMK government for such a meeting when it was in the opposition. Chief minister Stalin detailed the steps taken by his government to prevent deaths and control infection. “The government had extended certain relaxations to ensure that the lockdown did not affect people’s livelihood. But a few make use of the relaxations to violate lockdown measures. Hence, you offer suggestions whether to continue with the relaxations or change them,” the CM said. The state government would float global tenders to inoculate those in the age group of 18-45, the CM said, and added that efforts were being taken by the state to source oxygen from states like Odisha and West Bengal. Pressure exerted on the Centre had yielded results, he said. “The government has been taking several measures to increase oxygen stock. I will announce them in the next few days,” Stalin said. Because of the efforts taken by the government, TN got oxygen concentrators from Singapore and Taiwan, several industrial establishments, and also from donors. The CM said a centralized command centre (war room) was set up to augment bed facilities and availability of oxygen and ambulances all through the day. A four-member committee of IAS officers led by industries secretary was also set up to monitor oxygen storage and ensure supply of the gas from other states and industrial establishments. Since a large number of people were getting infected across districts, the demand for oxygen beds was on the rise. In anticipation, new bed facilities were being created at several places, including Chennai Trade Centre in Nandambakkam. The anti-viral drug, remdesivir, was being distributed in other parts of the state as well. A separate siddha covid care centre has been opened in Tambaram, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tn-parties-agree-to-tighten-covid-curbs/articleshow/82614813.cms||---

Sources said Eatala discussed the political situation in the state. Eatala said he met Srinivas to seek his support for his fight against the TRS government. Sources said Eatala also tried to get in touch with former TRS minister Vijaya Ramarao, BJP leader K Swamy Goud and BJP national vice-president DK Aruna over phone. The former minister is reportedly trying to get in touch with all his former TRS colleagues and those in the BJP to enlist their support in his ongoing battle against CM K Chandrasekhar Rao. Speculation was rife that he met Aruna and BJP state chief Bandi Sanjay. Speaking to TOI, BJP state secretary V Prasash Reddy said Eatala did not meet Sanjay, Union minister of state for home G Kishan Reddy and Aruna.  “He might have called some leaders over phone. His meeting with our Nizamabad MP could be personal reasons. He is an elected MLA and is free to meet any leader,” Prakash Reddy said. Brushing aside the threat of a regional party being floated by Eatala, Prakash Reddy said: “We are not threatened by his moves. Despite the presence of regional parties, we came to power in some states. There is no scope for any regional party to grow in Telangana. The BJP will emerge as winner in the next assembly elections.” Meanwhile, on Tuesday Eatala met Congress floor leader in the assembly Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka . Though Vikramarka told TOI that it was only a courtesy call, sources said it was clear from the discussions that Eatala is not going to succumb to the pressure tactics of the ruling TRS and would fight for justice. The meeting assumed significance as Eatala has decided to fight it out with chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/eatala-meets-bjp-mp-arvind-in-touch-with-trs-leaders/articleshow/82587033.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Chennai||War time tales of mariners||By K R A Narasiah This happens to be the centenary year of a marine engineer. Not a celebrity, but remembered as a WWII survivor. Amirapu Ramarao, just passed out of T S Dufferin, had hardly put to sea when, while in Calcutta harbour, he was asked to replace a drunk junior engineer on board SS Malda, a merchant ship on His Majesty’s duty during the war. He was pulled out of his first ship Hatrana, then in KG Dock, and escorted by a police sergeant to Garden Reach Docks, where the ship was waiting. As he boarded Malda, it set sail, heading a convoy under Captain H M Edmondson. On the morning of April 6, 1940, the convoy was sighted by a Japanese aircraft. Soon, a Japanese cruiser and two destroyers began shelling the convoy from behind. The second shell hit Malda in the accommodation area. Water began entering the ship and soon ‘abandon ship’ was ordered. Ramarao was on a life boat that was hit by another shell and he was flung into the air. He landed in the water with burning oil all around and was scalded. He managed to catch hold of a raft and turned towards a man with him. Though unscathed, still impeccably dressed and floating, that man was lifeless. Ramarao and a few more survivors kept floating and after what seemed hours, reached an island near False Point (a low headland in the Bay of Bengal) and were helped by locals. Later they reached Cuttack and treated at a hospital. Ramarao, after a few weeks, was given four weeks’ medical leave. The Shipping Company paid him `711 and 2 annas for having lost his personal effects. Ramarao continued sailing and was associated with training mariners. He held some posts in Port Trusts and deputed to South Indian Railway as engineer superintendent to look after ships sailing between India and Ceylon. Born on May 15, 1921, Ramarao passed away on March 28, 2013. C G K Reddy, also trained in T S Dufferin, began his sailing on the ill-fated merchant ship Chilka as a junior engineer that was torpedoed on March 11, 1942, and reached the Davy Jones Locker. He escaped on a life boat, after four harrowing days Reddy reached Nias Island, 75 miles west of Sumatra. He was rescued and imprisoned, along with a few former INA men, by the Japanese who planted them in India as informers. Captured by the British, they were tried for treason. Four were hanged in September 1943 and one, from the state of Travancore, was let off. Reddy, due to his age, was handed a three-year detention and charged with treason. In 1975, during the Emergency, he was accused of the same crime as he was involved in the Baroda Dynamite case. He was arrested and released only after the Janata Party took over. Reddy established the Research Institute for Newspaper Development (RIND), in Madras. Another marine engineer, again from T S Dufferin, late K Parthasarathy, served as a junior engineer on troop carrier Erinpura that was in a convoy as a hospital ship in the Mediterranean in 1943. The convoy was attacked by German bombers and Erinpura sank within four minutes of the hit. While many died, Parthasarathy jumped overboard. After a struggle, three survivors on a raft rescued him. The merchant navy is truly called the second line of defence.

On Thursday, logistics player Blue Dart announced the setting up of a new entity, Blue Dart Med-Express Consortium, to pilot the usage of drones for delivery of vaccines and emergency medical supplies as part of Telangana’s ‘Medicine from the Sky’ project. Telangana recently received permission to operate drones within the visual line of sight range as well as beyond visual line of sight for vaccine delivery in certain districts of the state. Blue Dart is one of the seven entities selected for carrying out these experiments under the project, which was launched during late 2019 in partnership with World Economic Forum. The company will pilot drones to find alternate logistics route to ensure accurate and reliable pickup and delivery of healthcare items. As per the state government, the drone operations are expected to commence in the fourth week of May or early June, subject to clearances. Ketan Kulkarni, CMO & head (business development), Blue Dart, said: “With efficient systems in place, it can help reduce the current logistics cost, making the healthcare logistics faster and efficient.” Jayesh Ranjan, principal secretary, IT and industries department, said Telangana is one of the most proactive states adopting emerging technologies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/blue-dart-to-test-drones-for-vaccine-delivery-in-t/articleshow/82616874.cms||---

Since the roads in corporations have two layers of dense bituminous macadam (the layer that has stone aggregates and hot mix of asphalt), there is no need to add another layer and increase the height of the surface,” the chief secretary said in an order. Milling is a process in which a portion of the top road surface is removed by a machinery before being relaid.The direction has been issued to all wings of the highways, including road development corporation, construction and maintenance, metro, projects, national highways, research station, project, design and research, Nabard and rural roads, Chennai-Kanyakumari industrial corridor and road infrastructure development corporation.The highways department still maintains several hundred kilometres of roads in the urban local bodies. “Under no circumstances, the road surface in the corporations, municipalities and town panchayat limits shall be enhanced. The portion of the road surface that is milled, should be relaid, to prevent flooding of the adjoining houses.

Heavy rainfall is also very likely at isolated places in the state on May 15, the IMD warned. The development of a low-pressure area over southeast Arabian Sea and adjoining Lakshadweep area on May 13 morning is being attributed as the reason for this weather phenomenon. The IMD has also warned of squally weather, winds, rough sea conditions and has also issued a fishermen alert regarding the same. Squally wind speed reaching 40-50kmph gusting to 60kmph is likely along and off the south Maharashtra and Goa coasts on May 15 and 50-60kmph gusting to 70kmph along and off south Maharashtra and Goa coasts on May 16. Sea conditions will be very rough along and off the Karnataka coast on May 15 and Maharashtra and Goa coasts on May 15 and 16. The fishermen out in the deep sea were earlier advised by the IMD to return to the coast as a result. The fishermen are also advised not to venture into the east central Arabian Sea and along and off Maharashtra and Goa coasts from May 15 and into east central and adjoining northeast Arabian Sea along and off Gujarat coast from May 17.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/orange-alert-imd-warns-of-heavy-rain-on-may-16-17/articleshow/82616961.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Mantralaya staffer takes on 4 armed robbers in local, nabs 1||MUMBAI: A 53-year-old Mantralaya employee turned the tables on a gang of four armed robbers, including a woman, inside a Central Railway train compartment on Wednesday morning. Vijay Wagdhare, the victim, braved their blows and pinned down one of the robbers, eventually handing him over to the cops at CSMT. By Thursday, the police arrested the woman as well. Wagdhare broke a tooth and suffered bruises on his face, chest and back. "My only thought was that if I let them get away, the robbers would get emboldened and target another passenger in the future," Wagdhare told TOI. Wagdhare is an officer with the Revenue and Forest Department of the state government. On Wednesday, he boarded a CSMT bound local around 10am from Currey Road. "About 80% of the compartment was occupied. But by the time the train reached Masjid station, there were just four other passengers left-- a couple seated together and two men standing separately," he said. After the train left Masjid, one of the men came very close to Wagdhare and inquired about the time. Uncomfortable, Wagdhare moved to a seat near the couple. The woman then got up and approached him to ask if there was any trouble. By this time, the train had slowed to a halt at a signal. The gang then proceeded to rain blows on Wagdhare and snatched his gold chain. They ripped his shirt pockets and stole his cash and ID cards. "I was trying to buy time and told them I would co-operate. I started handing them some papers which they flung aside along with my pen drive," he said. Another train passed by and Wagdhare raised an alarm. Passengers in the other train witnessed the mugging. "As my train started to move again, I grabbed one of the robbers who was later identified as Asif Shaikh. He tried to free himself and began hitting me badly. But I held on to Shaikh with all my strength. Soon, the woman yelled to the other two male accomplices to jump off the coach and followed suit. As the train pulled into CSMT, passengers from the other train came forward to help," Wagdhare said, adding that Shaikh quickly swallowed something that he had been carrying in a packet. Later, a police team that hauled Shaikh away confirmed he was a drug abuser. Shaikh led the cops to Sherbano Khan, his 22-year-old female accomplice. "The two men that managed to flee with the loot-- Aamir Sayyad and Akram-- have a previous criminal record. Sayyad masterminded the crime and had invited Khan, his close friend, to join them," said senior inspector Pravin Bhagat of CSMT GRP. All the accused are based out of Cheetah Camp in Trombay. Police suspect the gang might have conducted a recce earlier as they seemed to be aware about where and how long did the train halt between Masjid station and CSMT. They had been surveilling the coach for targets all along, an officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mantralaya-staffer-takes-on-4-armed-robbers-in-local-nabs-1/articleshow/82614961.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Delhi||Delhi seeking to store excess oxygen stocks in other states: Report||NEW DELHI: After a high-pitched battle for liquid oxygen last week, Delhi has been seeking to store “excess stocks” in other states with suppliers told to go slow. In a report, the Petroleum & Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO) has said that the excess liquid medical oxygen (LMO) available with Delhi is hampering the smooth supply from manufacturers, resulting in higher turnaround time due to deployment of tankers. Between May 1 and 10, on an average Delhi received almost 530 metric tonnes of LMO. The Arvind Kejriwal government was demanding over 900 metric tonnes (MT) of liquid medical oxygen until last week and had managed to get its quota enhanced to 700 MT following an order by the Supreme Court on May 5, which was reiterated on May 8 on the Delhi administration’s plea. In a report to the department for promotion of industry and internal trade, PESO has said that since May 9 (Sunday), Delhi has been seeking to get alternate storage space in nearby states, especially with the suppliers. On Sunday, out of the 120 MT shipped, the union territory returned 74 MT to Linde’s Faridabad plant due to non-availability of space in the LMO storage tanks or due to a fall in demand. Similarly, on Monday, the Delhi government lifted 150 MT from Air Liquide’s plants in Panipat and Roorkee, against an allocation of 190 MT, and asking the supplier not to release 40 MT from Panipat and another 20 MT from Roorkee plants due to the absence of storage space.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/report-delhi-seeking-to-store-excess-oxygen-stocks-in-other-states/articleshow/82614969.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Now, a district-level task force to protect the ‘Covid orphans’||Nagpur: The district administration, following supreme court guidelines, on Wednesday formed a 10-member task force, under the chairmanship of the collector, to extend assistance to the minors (0-18 years) who have lost both parents due to Covid-19. The step has been taken to ensure the orphans get their due and do not fall victim to any kind of exploitation, trafficked or inducted as child labour or deviate into anti-social activities. Citizens have been urged to share details of such children to the district women and child development department on helpline 0712-2569991. Police too have been made part of the task force. In each district, a government shelter home for the children and also observation homes would be identified as stopgap accommodation till a more concrete solution for their care and protection is worked out. Special medical teams and also counsellors would be attending the minors who can be given for adoption in future following central adoption resource authority (CARA) guidelines as per the orders of the Child welfare committee. Following the meeting of the task force, district women and child development department has identified five minors from two families whose parents succumbed to Covid. In one of the cases, children had lost both their parents while in the other, they lost their father who was their only guardian as the mother had moved out. District child protection officer Mushtaq Pathan said the information of the five orphaned minors was being collected. It would be submitted to the collector who shall take final decision. “We visited both the families and met the five children,” said Pathan. Apart from the helpline of the department, the citizens can also alert the Childline 1098 regarding Covid orphans. It is learnt the decision to form the task force was taken by the collector Ravindra Thakare following a video conference with the secretary, women and child development, IA Kundan. As per the action plan, every district should have specific helpline. As per the Government Resolution (GR) issued by the women and child development department, the hospitals are set to play a crucial role. The civil surgeon (CS) and district health officer (DHO) would ensure hospitals collect information from their admitted patients regarding their children and arrangement of care for them in their absence. The hospitals are also expected to alert the concerned authorities in case of death of patients having children with no one to care for. Dr Anup Marar, convener of the Vidarbha Hospital Association, said the task force must come up with more practicable means of collecting information from serious patients regarding their children. It may weaken their morale in the already panicked mood. “It will be prudent if the experienced counsellors based in NMC or collector central control room, now empowered to admit patients, also collect this information regarding children and forward it to concerned authorities,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/now-a-district-level-task-force-to-protect-the-covid-orphans/articleshow/82619196.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Chennai||Ex-IT secy, another candidate who lost poll quit MNM as exodus continues||Chennai: Resignations continue to jolt actor Kamal Haasan’s Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) with former IAS official and state IT secretary Santhosh Babu and one more functionary announcing their decisions to resign from the party on Thursday.Santhosh Babu, who was in the news last year for refusing to clear a skewed BharatNet tender under the earlier AIADMK government, cited “personal reasons” for quitting his post and membership in MNM. Having taken VRS from his service, he joined MNM late last year and was its candidate from Velachery assembly segment, where he came third.Within minutes, Padma Priya, a former Youtuber and MNM candidate in Maduravoyal, too announced her resignation from the party. But she just said due to “some reasons” in her tweet announcing her resignation. She was also the party’s state secretary (environment wing).Last Thursday, MNM vice-president R Mahendran resigned from the party citing lack of democracy in its decision-making process. Several senior functionaries including Santhosh Babu and C K Kumaravel submitted their resignation letters to the party president on the same day but it was termed an exercise owning moral responsibility for the defeat of the party in the election.Unlike last Thursday, when Kamal Haasan issued a strongly worded rebuttal to Mahendran, the MNM did not issue any official statement this Thursday. While party insiders expect a statement on Friday, the non-reactionhas prompted a thinking that it could be part of the leadership’s attempt to allow “some more weeds to weed out themselves”.A week after Mahendran’s resignation, no leader or functionary is willing to say on record what is rocking the MNM over the past couple of weeks, especially after Kamal Haasan silently walked out of the counting centre on the night of May 2 after losing to BJP’s Vanathi Srinivasan. “After the April 6 polls, Kamal Sir held a series of zonal meetings and listened to their feedback,” said a source in MNM. But things took a turn after the results and Kamal reportedly sought to blame the functionaries for the defeat, the source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/ex-it-secy-another-candidate-who-lost-poll-quit-mnm-as-exodus-continues/articleshow/82614937.cms||D Govardan
---||Agra||Cremations up 3-fold, urns containing ashes pile up at Agra’s largest crematorium||Agra: Over 600 urns containing ashes of those cremated have piled up at Agra’s largest crematorium in Tajganj. Lockers at the crematorium are full and the urns are now being kept on the floor with a number as per records and the name of the deceased. According to crematorium management officials, many people have not come back to collect the urns for fear of contracting coronavirus. Besides, there are those who have not been able to take away the ashes for immersion due to travel restrictions imposed during the lockdown. Terming the increasing number of cremations as unprecedented, the Tajgang crematorium staff said that in April alone, at least 1,700 cremations were conducted, which is three times more than the average. Earlier, cremations were not conducted after sunset. Now, the last rites are performed round the clock, they said. Caretaker of the Tajganj crematorium Sanjeev Gupta said, “Following the second wave of Covid-19, the number of bodies has increased three-fold. Usually around 450 bodies used to be cremated here in a month. The number increased to 1,700 in April. We have over 600 urns containing ashes stored with us. More than 100 people have refused to take the urns outright. We have decided to immerse ashes in the Ganga at Soron in Kasganj.” The lockers for keeping the urns are normally rented out for a couple of days. “People usually take them away for immersion on the third day of death, but these are unusual times. All the lockers are full and now, we have opened our store room to make space for ashes,” said Gupta. “Since the second week of April, more cremations are taking place. Usually, 15 bodies are cremated every day, but in the last 24 hours, over 50 bodies have arrived here. We have asked the family members of the deceased to wait as no platform is vacant as of now,” the caretaker added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/cremations-up-3-fold-urns-containing-ashes-pile-up-at-agras-largest-crematorium/articleshow/82612134.cms||Deepak Lavania

But as per the Centre’s policy decision, only three vaccines, Covaxin, Covishield and Sputnik-V are permitted in India. And we are yet to get Sputnik-V vaccine. I am surprised and shocked as to how a non-approved vaccine is being administered in a private hospital in Navi Mumbai,” Malik told TOI. When contacted, a spokesperson of Apollo Hospital said: “The French consulate had imported the vaccines, we administered them as per guidelines of the government of India.” TOI’s request to the French embassy for a response on the issue went unanswered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-french-embassy-has-procured-moderna-vax-sans-nod-says-malik/articleshow/82617001.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar
---||Nagpur||No shortage of Remdesivir due to decrease in Covid patients: HC||Nagpur: Quoting its repeated directives to the Centre and state governments to supply Remdesivir to Vidarbha, which had witnessed severe shortage, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court observed on Thursday that adequate quantity of this lifesaving drug is now available in the region due to drop in number of Covid-19 patients. “In several hearings, every time the issue of short supply of Remdesivir drug was raised, some or the other directives were issued to remove it. Today, some of those directions have been complied with. Simultaneously, there is also considerable decrease in the caseload of patients. The combined effect of these factors now is that Remdesivir isn’t in short supply and available all over Vidarbha,” a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Avinash Gharote said. Amicus curiae Shreerang Bhandarkar then pointed out that there is substantial decrease in Remdesivir demand and, therefore, stock with stockists and dealers is lying idle. Indian Medical Association (IMA) counsel Bhanudas Kulkarni informed that all seven manufacturers of the injections had supplied their share of stock to Vidarbha till May 9. While hearing the suo motu PIL based on TOI report on beds shortage during Covid-19 pandemic, the bench orally slammed state FDA for not being aware how much stock of this drug has been allotted to each district. “When you are uploading the daily data on a website, you must know its statistics. Past mistakes shouldn’t be repeated. Don’t waste the court’s time, put your house in order. If you don’t know about the drugs data, imagine the plight of a common man, who will be lost while searching for it on a website.” Reminding FDA of HC’s May 2 order, they said it was directed to upload the Remdesivir production figures along with other lifesaving drugs and all details about the number of vials on the website. “The FDA joint commissioner informed that these figures have been uploaded on the website of the state health department, but only till May 4. Government pleader Ketki Joshi should take instructions as to whether or not this is correct? If yes, then explain why the daily updating is not taking place.” Earlier, the manufacturing companies through their counsels informed the HC about stock they had dispatched for the state. “Although these companies have made statements about supply of Remdesivir according to the quota given to them, it would be necessary for the FDA to verify and confirm this fact and inform HC accordingly. We, therefore, request Joshi to seek instructions in respect of the same and place them on record on the next date of hearing,” the justices said. IIP PVSA oxygen plant to take 10 weeks for installation Advocate Gauri Venkatraman informed the court that the Indian Institute of Petroleum (IIP), Dehradun, had developed ‘oxygen plant technology’ which is available at various places. The DRDO is the coordinating agency between IIP and the licensees to whom the technology has been given by this institution. The bench then interacted with senior counsel Anjan Ray, who was pleading for IIP, through video conferencing. He informed that the cost of a 500 litre per minute capacity oxygen plant is Rs50-60 lakh. He said there are many orders already pending for execution and time required for making these plants available in Nagpur would be around ten weeks. Giving further details, he assured that if anybody contacts him, he would provide required assistance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-shortage-of-remdesivir-due-to-decrease-in-covid-patients-hc/articleshow/82619241.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Pune||MahaMetro completes 50% of viaduct along riverside||Pune: Around 50% of the work on the Metro viaduct, coming up on the Mutha riverbed along the Deccan Gymkhana-Balgandharva Rangmandir-Pune Municipal Corporation stretch, has been completed, the Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited (MahaMetro) said on Thursday. This portion is part of the fully elevated second line of the Pune Metro rail project, connecting Vanaz on Paud Road to Ramwadi. MahaMetro said it aims to complete the other half of the work before the onset of the monsoon. Officials said they have hastened work near the rivers, as these sites would be among the first to get affected when monsoon arrives. Two launching girders have been installed near Deccan Gymkhana to fix the viaduct segments, while the entire viaduct stretch that crosses the Mula-Mutha — connecting Bund Garden and Yerawada — was completed recently. “We have pressed additional manpower and machinery to achieve this objective,” Hemant Sonawane, MahaMetro’s general manager (public relations), told TOI. MahaMetro had initially planned to complete the riverside work in the Deccan Gymkhana area by June. An official said it was now difficult to meet that deadline, and that they were giving it a shot. “Ideally, it will be good if the launching of segments is finished before the monsoon,” the official said. MahaMetro has also initiated the construction of two stations — Deccan Gymkhana and Sambhaji Garden — on the stretch. The work on the stations is expected to continue after the monsoon, the official said. Cabinet nod to lease out 4.75 hectares for project The state cabinet on Wednesday approved a proposal to lease out 4.75 hectares of government land in Balewadi to the concessionaire for comercial use for a 35-year period.

A senior police officer said that the guns are the latest ones and will help ATS commandos to take on terrorists head on in case of any attack. Traning in the use of these guns has started, the officer said. Meanwhile, Goa police will be sending 45 of its new ATS recruits to Haryana for three-month commando training at the National Security Guard (NSG) campus. A senior police officer said this will help Goa police to strengthen the unit to act against any terror threat in the state. He said that they have asked personnel attached to different police stations and other units to join the ATS. Around 95 police personnel showed interest in joining the ATS, and based on the willingness, physical tests were conducted and 45 were selected. The senior officer said that all the 45 police personnel have undergone pre-commando training at the Police Training School at Valpoi. Presently, the ATS has 90 commandos. A senior police officer said that 35 commandos were supposed to join ATS after the completion of basic training, but it has been delayed as they have been posted at various police stations due to Covid. Pointing out that Goa receives frequent terror alerts as it is an international tourist destination, the senior officer said that increasing the squad’s strength will help cover the entire state in the event of any terror threat. Over the years, many anti-social elements and even terrorists have been arrested in Goa, so the ATS needs to be vigilant. Meanwhile, Goa police also conducted the physical proficiency test for ATS commandos to check their physical fitness.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-police-gets-latest-guns-for-ats/articleshow/82617066.cms||---

The children’s trials will be carried out on 525 healthy children volunteers at multiple centres in cities such as Delhi, Patna, Hyderabad and Nagpur. The participants will be administered two doses of the whole virion, inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine at a gap of 28 days through intramuscular shots. The approval for a kids trial of Covaxin comes even as the US drug regulator USFDA gave its nod for use of Pfizer-BioNTech's Covid-19 vaccine on children in the 12-15 years age group earlier this week. However, Covaxin, was the first Covid-19 vaccine globally to begin testing on children as young as 12 years of age way back in September 2020. The Phase II trials, which tested the vaccine on 380 volunteers in the 12-65 years age bracket, included 14 volunteers in the 12-18 years age bracket. Covaxin was approved for emergency use in those aged 18 years and above in the country in January this year. “The national regulator of the country, the DCGI, after careful examination, has accepted the recommendation of Subject Expert Committee (SEC) and accorded permission to conduct the Phase II/III clinical trial of Covaxin (Covid vaccine) in the age group 2 to 18 years, to its manufacturer Bharat Biotech Ltd on 12.05.2021,” the government said on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/dcgi-okays-covaxin-phase-ii/iii-trialson-2-18-year-olds/articleshow/82617031.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

One of the victims, who stays in Kelewadi, lodged an FIR against the constable, who stays in Khadki Bazar police lines. “The constable is accused of taking money from the three women — two sisters and a cousin — in 2018 and failing to deliver on her promise,” senior inspector Datta Chavan said on Thursday. “The three sisters, all kabaddi players, had met the constable — who also plays kabaddi — through a mutual acquaintance,” Chavan said. The constable allegedly told the complainant, Suvarna Yenpure, that she could help them secure clerical posts in PMC’s health department as she claimed she had connections with senior civic officials, Chavan further said. Chavan said the suspect sought Rs2.5 lakh per person, which the complainant and the others paid. “In her complaint, Yenpure said she and others waited for a considerable period to get the jobs, but when nothing happened, Yenpure told the constable to deliver on her promise or return the money. The suspect kept delaying, but eventually, she returned Rs3 lakh to Yenpure and sought time to pay back the rest,” Chavan said. The suspect even signed an undertaking stating she would repay the rest at the earliest, but never did. “After all the efforts to recover their money proved futile, Yenpure filed a complaint application in April. During the preliminary investigation, the constable conceded that she owned Yenpure and others the money,” Chavan said. A cheating and criminal breach of trust case has been registered under the Indian Penal Code.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/woman-constable-booked-in-rs-7-5-lakh-job-fraud-case/articleshow/82613157.cms||---

However, health department officials are still inquiring about the infection. Sources said a 72-year-old woman from Vrindavan and a 40-year-old man, undergoing treatment in a hospital in Jaipur, lost their vision. A 25-year-old youth from Manas Nagar contracted the fungal infection in his jaws. All of them had recovered from Covid-19 and were discharged from hospital. Talking with TOI, the elderly woman’s son, Acharya Rajendra, said the family contacted several doctors but no one was ready to admit her. He was advised to take her either to AIIMS or Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in Delhi. “I don’t have the money for her treatment and no hospital is ready to admit her,” he said. In charge of Covid Control unit Dr Bhudev said the department is aware of all these cases and is inquiring into them. The samples, collected from the patients, will be sent to the lab for testing. He said, “We urge all Covid patients to report to us if any symptoms appear after recovering from the disease.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/three-suspected-black-fungus-cases-detected-in-mathura/articleshow/82612163.cms||---
---||Delhi||Mom-daughter idea: Unused Covid pills can save lives||NEW DELHI: When an 11-year-old asked her mother if they could help Covid-affected people with medicines, there was no hint that this would turn into a crucial intervention to help a lot of people. The daughter-mother duo is not buying medicines to give to the infected people, only collecting medicines left over after recovery from Covid. In just two weeks, the two have been able to collect over 3,200 tablets from 38 people and pass them to an Agra gurudwara, a health camp for the underprivileged in Gurugram and to needy individuals in Mumbai, Hyderabad and Delhi. The initiative, called the Covid Medicine Recycle, has now received a boost with students of St Stephen’s College collaborating to create a database of donors and beneficiaries. Supriya Malik, mother of Sahria Malik, told TOI, “My daughter helps me run the digital aspect of my skin care brand and is, therefore, allowed two hours every day on social media. She saw umpteen messages asking for medicines and asked me if we could do something. She had also seen her father’s entire family contracting Covid. I wondered how I could use our network to help Covid patients.” Two weeks back Malik began picking up unneeded medicines from recovered Covid patients and employing the logistics of her company, Indulgeo Essentials, to ferry them to people who needed them. From Fabiflu to Medrol and Crocin to vitamin tablets, the duo has been given medicines across India. They have even received thermometers, oximeters and nebulisers “In our first collection, eight people gave us 432 basic and critical pills. Then more people came forward and in two weeks we received over 3,200 tablets from 38 people. One person sent 70 Fabiflu tablets, 90 Montair tablets. A Mumbai person sent us 283 Vitamin C tablets,” said Malik. Their first set of medicines were sent to a gurdwara in Agra that had been running oxygen langars. Over 900 medicines were also provided to Gurugram Nagrik Ekta Manch. “The Manch had got everything from volunteer doctors to oxygen but they needed medicines. So, we gave them what we had,” said Malik. One of the beneficiaries, Jasleen Kaur, thanked donor Ankit Sareen on social media for the Fabiflu for her grandmother. “The medicine reached us when we were unable to get it at the pharmacy,” said Kaur. The St Stephen’s students have added over 50 donors to the list. “We are also collecting details of organisations to which we can send the medicines for beneficiaries,” said Anushca Thomas, executive member of the social service league of St Stephen’s.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mom-daughter-idea-unused-covid-pills-can-save-lives/articleshow/82615290.cms||Shradha Chettri

---||Agra||Yogi in AMU after 16 faculty deaths, concern over Covid’s ‘Aligarh strain’||Agra: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday visited AMU’s Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College to review the prevailing Covid-19 situation in the varsity where deaths of several staff members, including 16 serving, 10 retired faculty and several non-teaching staff have been reported. The university has already sent the virus samples to ICMR to assess possibilities of any new variant in Aligarh. Vice-chancellor of the university, Tariq Mansoor, told TOI that the CM assured all possible help in the fight against Covid-19, especially with supply of life-saving drugs, including Remdesivir and Oxygen supply. The CM said, “Vaccination could have saved lives. The VC raised the demand for additional oxygen, which has been provided.” A government spokesperson said, oxygen and medicines have been dispatched and the university brass has been promised every possible assistance in handling the situation. The CM also reviewed the vaccination programme and visited the integrated command and control centre, he said. The AMU VC told TOI, “Though we have an eight-bed paediatric ICU and high dependency unit (HDU) each, CM Yogi has asked us to expand it in view of a possible third wave which could be harmful for children.” During a meeting with the CM, the VC said that many of the faculty members and non-teaching staff, who died due to Covid-19, were not vaccinated and were hospitalized late. He also said there could be possibilities of a new strain of the virus in Aligarh too. The VC said, “Vaccination is very important and I have been urging all staff members to get vaccinated first.” Alarmed by the death of a large number of faculty members, retired professors and non-teaching staff due to Covid, the VC had written a letter to the ICMR on May 9 for urgent genome sampling of the virus samples from their lab to check for mutations. However, the report is still awaited. This was the CM’s first visit to the varsity since he assumed office in 2017. In fact, the last UP chief minister who visited the AMU was ND Tiwari in 1984, said university spokesperson Dr Rahat Abrar. The CM also held a virtual meeting with district officials of Aligarh, Etah, Kasganj and Hathras to review the Covid-19 situation. While addressing media persons, the CM said, “The cases have declined in the past 12 days across the state.” He added, “Shortfall of oxygen supply was the result of a sudden rise in daily consumption from 300 metric tonnes to 1,000 metric tonnes.” Divisional commissioner Guarav Dayal, who was also present in the meeting, said that the CM also interacted with the district magistrates of neighbouring districts and directed them to increase testing, set up more oxygen plants and create paediatric ICUs in each district. “At least 5,000 samples are being tested in the district daily but the CM has asked to increase the numbers to 7,500,” said Aligarh district magistrate CB Singh, adding that they have also been asked to hold virtual meetings with public representatives. After the review meeting in AMU, the CM visited Mathura and Agra too, where he took stock of the situation and also interacted with Covid positive patients to know their health status and assess the situation in hospitals.

In other words, people not having much time duration left for second dose will be given priority over those who just entered the eligibility window for second dose. Current rules of Covaxin specify that second dose has to be taken between four and six weeks of the first dose. According to new guidelines issued by the Centre on Thursday, Covishield second dose could be taken between 12 and 16 weeks. The directives given to vaccinators and PHC-level staff on Wednesday night said: “Among those due for second dose also, please prioritise those who have logged maximum number of days, weeks past the due date. There are beneficiaries who have completed 10 and even 12 weeks. Please give them top priority in this spell... Please capture them for vaccination as priority”. The directives also asked officials to devise a plan to maintain the data of beneficiaries. Reflecting on the new guidelines, several people who went for their second dose in the city on Thursday were asked to come back after the mandated period. Director of public health Dr Srinivasa Rao,on Thursday, said 15 lakh people in the state would have to take their second dose by May-end. “A detailed plan for giving vaccine to people aged between 18 to 45 is being worked out. The vaccine will be given to them once the vaccine supplies improve,” he said. Till the end of the month, vaccine shot would be given to those due for their second dose, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/vaccine-second-dose-priority-rejigged-again/articleshow/82617151.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Baburam Balwan Singh was found tied to a hospital bed in the non-Covid-19 ward of Etah government hospital on Thursday. Taking cognizance of the matter, director general (prisons) Anand Kumar suspended the jail warder and ordered an inquiry. Singh, who was brought to Etah jail on February 6 this year after being convicted in the murder case, is a resident of district’s Kulla Habibpur village. “He was taken to a government hospital on Sunday due to breathing problems and was referred to Aligarh. But there was no bed available there, so he was brought back to Etah, where he was admitted at the district hospital’s non Covid-19 ward. It is not clear under what circumstances he was tied to the bed. The entire matter is being investigated,” jailor Kuldeep Singh Bhadauria said. Warder Ashok Yadav has been suspended, the jailer added. “Those responsible for shackling the elderly inmate will not be spared,” DG Kumar said. Chief medical officer (CMO) of Etah district, Dr Umesh Tripathi, said, “Following a primary investigation, it surfaced that the patient was tied to bed by the jail staffer. I came to know about the entire matter through social media. The jail inmate is suffering from lung infection. He is being provided suitable treatment.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/visuals-of-ailing-jail-inmate-84-tied-to-a-hospital-bed-invites-flak-warder-suspended/articleshow/82612170.cms||Deepak Lavania

The doses would be exclusively given to 45+ category beneficiaries whose second dose is due at all the 96 centres of NMC. The district achieved inoculation of 22,591, indicating half of the new stock was already utilized. Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said NMC has sufficient stock to last till Saturday. “250 doses have been given to each centre. Average inoculation of each of these centres is 100 to 150 per day. Centres running two shifts have been given 500 doses each so they can work for two days. If any one runs out of vaccines, they will be given additional doses,” he said. At several centres, large turnouts are being witnessed in the district as well as other parts of the divison. The division recorded 43,741 innoculations. Long queues of anxious elderly and 45+ category beneficiaries were seen at Wardha, Chandrapur and Bhandara. Many 18 to 44 year beneficiary are still flocking the centres in the hope of getting jabbed early. Meanwhile, Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari appealed to all marriage hall owners to make their facilities available for mass vaccination drive. On Thursday, citizens complained to NMC regarding inconvenience at its Zingabai Takli UPHC during inoculation drive. The NMC requested Pandurang Mangal Karyalaya owner Sachin Raut to open his marriage hall for vaccination. Raut immediately obliged and helped the NMC health staff to rapidly inoculate all the 45+ category beneficiaries who had turned up at the UPHC. In another development, BJP MLC Pravin Datke and NMC ruling party leader Avinash Thakre, in a press conference, demanded that the Uddhav Thackeary-led government allowed the civic body to initiate purchase of vaccines. Datke said the chief minister has permitted BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation to float global tenders for purchase of vaccines. The Nagpur mayor had written to the CM on May 6 seeking the purchase nod but the CM had been dillydallying on the issue, Datke alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/dist-gets-50000-doses-for-second-jab-of-45-group/articleshow/82619259.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Mumbai||Day after TOI’s report, Ajit Pawar scraps Rs 6 crore order||MUMBAI: Deputy CM Ajit Pawar on Thursday scrapped a controversial decision to pay a private agency Rs 6 crore to handle his social media accounts, a day after a TOI report highlighted the move by the cash-starved government. “The DCM office does not need an external agency for handling social media. The government resolution issued on Wednesday for the purpose should be scrapped immediately,” said Pawar in a statement. There was no question of hiring a private firm when a full-fledged Directorate of Information and Public Relations is in operation. “I will continue to interact with people with the help of the DGIPR,” he added. The general administration department had on Wednesday issued an order to appoint a private agency to handle the deputy CM’s Twitter, Facebook, Blogger, YouTube, Instagram, Sound Cloud, WhatsApp, Telegram channel and SMS accounts for nearly Rs 6crore. BJP had blasted the decision, with legislator Atul Bhatkhalkar saying: “The state government has cited funds crunch for its inability to pay doctors and paramedical staff, but it has enough resources for image makeover of Ajit Pawar.” NCP spokesperson and minister Nawab Malik welcomed the scrapping of the order on Thursday and took potshots at BJP. “I am told… then CM Devendra Fadnavis had a battery of media professionals for his image makeover, every cabinet member was given independent media consultants, who were all from the private sector.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-day-after-tois-report-ajit-pawar-scraps-rs-6cr-order/articleshow/82617142.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

---||Goa||Govt depts wrangle over Benaulim beautification||Colva: A tussle between Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation (GSIDC) and the electricity department appears to have surfaced over beautification projects in Benaulim constituency worth Rs 25 crore which are nearing completion after much delay. The electricity department was tasked with shifting the electricity poles which were in the middle of the widened road at Khareband. Widening, re-surfacing, electrification using fancy poles was part of the beautification of the Margao-Benaulim Y-road. The project which started in December 2018 was stuck for a year after GSIDC refused to pay Rs3.5 crore quoted by the power department to shift the poles. The department was of the contention that along with the poles, underground cables also had to be shifted. In January this year only after the intervention of local MLA Churchill Alemao and chief minister Pramod Sawant it was decided to shift the poles. GSIDC and power officials met at the site and finalised the positioning of the poles. However, the department shifted the transmission line by less than half a meter from the middle of widened road to where the road meets the drain. General manager of GSIDC Jude Carvalho said the plan was to have underground cables and GSIDC was to erect street light poles on the railing. Executive engineer of electricity department Rajendra Sawant said that after the joint inspection in January there was a proposal for underground cabling and a detailed project report was prepared which was again dropped and hence overhead cabling was implemented and shifted the poles to where they stand presently. GSIDC officials said that the poles might not be removed since there was a tendency of temporary works becoming permanent and the entire exercise of beautifying the area might look ugly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-depts-wrangle-over-benaulim-beautification/articleshow/82617237.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Two Amravati lecturers get patent for designing new kit for MRSA detection||Nagpur: Two Amravati University (AU) lecturers have been awarded a patent for designing a new kit for detection of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA), an extremely Staphylococcus Aureus which has been rapidly spreading worldwide. The invention by department of biotechnology’s associate teacher Prashant Thakare and department of microbiology’s assistant professor Niraj Ghanwate, gives rapid results in only seven hours for its detection. With this kit, the detection time is reduced significantly and tests can be performed even at facility-constrained laboratories. Earlier, it used to take 24 to 48 hours for its accurate detection and that would require sophisticated equipment and set-up of a clinical laboratory, the teachers claimed. “MRSA is a pus forming bacteria and appears like bunches of grapes when seen through a microscope. It’s one of the major pathogens associated with serious hospital acquired infection. It’s treatment is totally different from the normal disease,” they said. According to AU PRO Vilas Nandurkar, these two scientists had taken an initiative in establishing the Covid-19 molecular diagnostic lab during the start of the pandemic and were currently serving as nodal and technical officers respectively. “The lab has processed over 2.5 lakh samples since inception. Both always seek an opportunity to serve the society through their research and subject knowledge. They are also implementing two projects of Rs 1 crore funded by Rajiv Gandhi Science and Technology Commission, Mumbai. Their research articles are published in highly reputed journals of the Nature Publishing Group,” he told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/two-amravati-lecturers-get-patent-for-designing-new-kit-for-mrsa-detection/articleshow/82617166.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Mumbai||BMC may spend Rs 300 crore to Rs 700 crore on vaccines||MUMBAI: The BMC is looking to spend anywhere between Rs 300 crore and Rs 700 crore to buy vacccines. BMC officials said that while they had not fixed any amount for the purchase of a crore doses, depending on whether domestic or international manufacturers take part in its expression of interest (EOI) the vaccines might cost the civic body Rs 300 to Rs 700 crore. “It is an open EOI, so anyone can bid. Once we receive the proposals we will examine the reasonability of the prices and then go ahead with the order. There could be a price range of Rs 300 crore to Rs 700 crore. We will have to study the offers once we receive the bids,” said P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner (projects). The BMC will also not dip into its contingency funds or break its fixed deposits to buy the vaccines. “The FDs are for the fixed purpose of pensions of the employees and for infrastructure projects. We will have an internal reassignment of the funds within the current budget outlay,” Velrasu said. This year, BMC’s capital expenditure has been pegged at Rs 18,750 crore and money for the vaccines will be pooled from this expenditure. “The proposals will be examined and placed before the Standing Committee for approval like regular purchases,” Velrasu said. Officials said that if the BMC buys vaccines from Indian manufacturers like Serum Institute of India (SII) or Bharat Biotech, vaccines might cost them around Rs 300 crore. If they buy from international vaccine makers like Pfizer, the cost might shoot up to Rs 700 crore. Sources said that Pfizer and Moderna have already committed orders and may have very few doses left. J&J is expected to supply in the fourth quarter. The Pfizerr price in the US is $19.50 per dose and two doses are required per person. The Moderna price is $25-$37 per dose. The J&J price is $10 per dose and only one shot per person is required. Sputnik V costs $10 per dose and two doses person are required.

---||Dehradun||Environmentalists express concern over SC listing Char Dham Project to a vacation bench citing urgency||DEHRADUN: After the Supreme Court’s urgency to decide the fate of the Char Dham all-weather road project by listing it to a vacation bench, activists in Uttarakhand have protested the move, saying that the matter is “intricate and complex and should have gone to a regular bench and not to a vacation bench whose purpose is to hear only immediate, urgent cases.” The environmentalists pointed out that the project, which was first presented in the National Green Tribunal (NGT) because of its strong environmental implications, is now being tagged as a road project related to 'country's security'. The central government has cited national security concerns for listing the project in the vacation bench saying that three roads in this project are “strategic” since they lead to the international border with China. However, environmental experts said that three of the five roads are ‘feeder roads’ to the border, and not border roads. Therefore, they need to be treated like regular national highways, which have been functional since 1962. “The government is pushing the case before the vacation bench citing fake urgency, in order to avoid the regular bench. These roads are national highways, motorable since 1962. They don’t need construction. This project is about road widening; therefore, it doesn’t need to be heard on an urgent basis. The project has so many scientific intricacies involved in it, which are directly linked with the future and coming generations,” said environmentalist Mallika Bhanot. In a similar vein, Ravi Chopra, chairperson of the high-powered committee (HPC) appointed by the SC to assess the environmental impact of the project, expressed surprise over the move. “I was told that the government said during the hearing that the matter was urgent now. It is surprising that since January 18, when the final arguments had to be heard, the government sought adjournment of the hearing on one pretext or the other. It is we who were pushing for a hearing, but now, suddenly, the government comes up with this requirement of urgency at the time of a pandemic. If it was so urgent, why was the matter not taken up earlier?” asked Chopra. Another member of the HPC, geologist Navin Juyal, too, expressed dismay at the way things were being hastened. “Such a sensitive issue of road widening shouldn’t be taken up without all valid clearances and documents in place as the National Green Tribunal had stressed upon understanding the fragile nature of Himalayas, and the government should consider all perspectives before pushing ahead,” said Juyal. The 900-km long all-weather Char Dham road project was announced by the PM in 2016 wherein he had stated that the project envisaged seamless connectivity of the four Himalayan shrines of Kedarnath, Badrinath, Yamunotri and Gangotri. But the project ran into controversy after alleged massive felling of trees, improper hill cutting and muck dumping into rivers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/environmentalists-express-concern-over-sc-listing-char-dham-project-to-a-vacation-bench-citing-urgency/articleshow/82612193.cms||Shivani Azad

The positivity rate had touched 31% in April when nearly every alternate day the district witnessed highest ever cases and deaths. The cases decreased by 308 while five more deaths were recorded as compared to a day before. Recoveries continued to remain high at 5,884, which is nearly three-fold high than the new cases. The active caseload too came down to below 40,000 at 39,616. Interestingly, the cases dipped to 2,224 while over 1,000 more number of tests (15,714) were conducted on Thursday as compared to a day before. The new cases included city’s 1,163 which is around 9 per cent of the 11,908 tests and 1,050 of 3,806 tests from rural. The difference between number of cases of city and rural has narrowed though testing is at a far large scale in municipal limits. Bulk of the tests is now being shouldered by private labs. As per official data, over 9,000 tests were from private labs. Between February 26 and March 4, the city saw testing of 50,592 samples. Of these, 5,872 were found positive for a positivity rate of 11.61%. After this week, the positivity rate kept climbing. From March 5 to 11, the positivity rate shot up to 18.06% followed by 24.14%, and 24.18%. It fell to 22.97% from March 26 to April 1. But again rose to 28.3% in next week. The positivity remained around 28% in subsequent week of April and reached a peak of 31.24% from April 16 to 22. It started declining from April 23 when the percentage dropped to 24.31%. From April 30 to May 6, it further came down to 18.06% and further at 12.02% now. The NMC administration is expecting a further declining in positivity rate in the next to weeks. The ongoing decline is result of strict restrictions on crowded places and lockdown. As the state government has extended the restrictions till May 31, the NMC is hoping the measure will help city bring the situation further under control.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/positivity-rate-dips-to-12-in-dist-as-cases-decline/articleshow/82619307.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Officials of both departments had allegedly turned a blind eye to the scam, and are restless after the crackdown by the CP. Unwillingly, both administrations have now been forced to act. Dr Aarti Singh told TOI, “Police acted suo motu. The action was based purely on our intelligence and by sending a decoy. District administration was not aware of it.” The CP said they had got complaints from people, and proactive policing led to the action by her special squad and crime branch. “We have arrested one more accused and seized four more vials from him on the basis of interrogation of accused arrested earlier,” the CP said. The seventh accused, Vinit Anil Phutane, 21, a resident of Kharada under Chandurbazaar police station, works at PDMC Hospital as an attendant. Police have now traced all 54 vials accused Dr Malusare, medical superintendent of Teosa Rural Hospital, had collected from government pharmacy but did not enter into the stock of the hospital. “We are working on the rest,” the CP said. The police commissioner’s action is likely to expose skeletons in health department cupboard as arrested attendants have told police they have been selling the Rs600 Remdesivir injection for Rs12,000 for months. This could be one of the reasons for several deaths at government Covid hospitals here, said Shivrai Kulkarni, a former journalist and now BJP state spokesperson. He demanded a thorough probe, and also questioned police for not demanding police custody of the accused, alleging a police attempt to hush up the case due to outside pressure. Singh said police did not ask for police custody because one of the accused turned Covid positive. “All accused have been working in Covid hospital and are at risk of infection. But we are opposing their conditional bail. We will grill them to get more info,” said the CP, adding, “We have now recovered all Remdesivir injections from them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/dist-admin-heath-dept-in-hot-seat-after-cops-bust-illegal-remdesivir-racket/articleshow/82619352.cms||---

A yellow alert signifies heavy rains at isolated places, while a green alert indicates light to moderate rain. Light to moderate rains have been forecast for Mumbai and Thane from Friday to Sunday. The change in weather conditions is due to a low pressure area that has formed over southeast Arabian Sea and adjoining Lakshadweep which is likely to concentrate into a depression over the same region by May 15 morning and intensify into a cyclonic storm in the next 24 hours. “It is very likely to intensify and reach near Gujarat coast around May 18 evening,” said the IMD in a release. Meanwhile, maximum temperatures recorded on Thursday by the IMD Colaba and Santacruz observatories were 34 degrees and 33.7 degrees, while the minimum was 27.3 degrees and 28 degrees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-imd-predicts-heavy-rain-on-may-17-issues-yellow-alert/articleshow/82617331.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Cipla files complaint against e-sale of fake Covid medicines||MUMBAI: People trying to order life-saving Covid medicines online are increasingly getting cheated and losing money. They find that instead of Remdesivir, they have been delivered vials filled with water or fake tablets in the name of Tocilizumab. On Wednesday Cipla Pharma filed a complaint with the state cyber cell alleging that fraudsters impersonating as its distributors were using the company’s logo and despatching fake Covid medicines online. The state cyber cell has filed an FIR. Times ViewWhen calamity strikes, swindlers are not far behind. In a grim situation like the ongoing pandemic, people are desperate to procure life-saving drugs from any corner, making them easy victims for these impostors who lurk in cyberspace. Despite warnings from the state cyber cell, many people continue to get duped. One must be cautious and tap only authorised medical dealers to procure these tablets.Cipla Pharma, which has the rights to sell medicines manufactured by US-based Gland Pharma in India, said the fraudsters have posted as many as 34 mobile numbers online under the company’s name. In his complaint, Cipla Pharma’s Lower Parel office manager Vrajesh Bajaj (28) said, “When the victims call on these numbers, they are told to pay 50% advance via online transaction and the rest on delivery. And the medicines they receive are fake.” Since April 27, the drug safety department of Cipla has been flooded with complaints, calls, emails and tags on its social media handles, including one from Pune resident Anirudh Sharma. The complainant collected details of the 34 numbers and that of the 40 bank accounts in nationalised and private banks in Mumbai, Navi Mumbai, Aurangabad, Delhi, Bengaluru, Kolkata, Mangaluru, Tiruchirapalli, and states like Bihar, Jammu & Kashmir, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, and few UPI transfers. “The 40 accounts have been frozen,” said a cyber police officer. “There are multiple fraudsters from different parts of the country who are taking advantage of the pandemic. Recently, our team, along with UP police, seized two lakh Remdesivir vials filled with water. The fraudsters have posted the mobile numbers online—@Cipla_Global, CiplaFoundation (Twitter), Cipla, Cipla Foundation (Facebook page)—and pose as representatives of the firm.” Special inspector general (cyber) Yashasvi Yadav is supervising the operation led by deputy inspector general of police Harish Baijal, superintendent of police Sanjay Shintre and his deputy Vijay Khaire. In a related incident, Khar police on Tuesday filed an FIR against an unknown person after freezing an account in a nationalised bank in Patna. The victim, Khar businessman Kunal Katariya, said he looked up the number of Cipla Foundation online to get Remdesivir and found a supplier. He called him and bought six vials for Rs 40,800, but later found that they were filled with water. Police said Rs 13.4 lakh had been deposited in the account which was opened in the name Cipla Foundation using fake documents, and Rs 10 lakh had already been withdrawn from it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cipla-files-complaint-against-e-sale-of-fake-covid-meds/articleshow/82617384.cms||Narayan Namboodiri
---||Chennai||Chennai: MTC buses to get CCTV, panic buttons||CHENNAI: Eve teasers, pickpockets and burglars beware – Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) buses in the city will soon have CCTV cameras and panic buttons. Accessing the Nirbhaya Funds, the corporation will install cameras and panic buttons in all buses in operation. Cameras will also be fitted in all terminals and important bus stops. To begin with, nearly 60 locations have been identified for installing cameras, an official told TOI. Tenders have already been floated for the work, and the facilities will be in place within the next 7 to 8 months, he said. Only last month, the previous AIADMK government faced the wrath of Madras high court when it said Tamil Nadu had used only 10.7% of the Nirbhaya Funds allotted by the Centre to improve safety of women in the state. Though 425 crore is available under the funds, Tamil Nadu utilised only 45.8 crore since 2018, it said, in response to a PIL filed by advocate-activist A P Suryaprakasam. Now, the transport department has decided to enhance safety quotient on buses by tapping the central funds lying unutilised. In 2015, on trial basis, four cameras each were installed on MTC buses plying on five routes -- 23C (Besant Nagar–Ayanavaram), 29C (Besant Nagar–Perambur), 6D (Tiruvanmiyur–Tollgate), 45B (Guindy Industrial Estate to Anna Square) and 15B (Broadway to CMBT). In February 2020, though the government announced that all government buses in the state would be fitted with CCTV cameras, the proposal was not implemented. The proposal was to identify and nab footboard travellers, students pelting stones on buses and to monitor accidents involving government/MTC buses. Now installing four panic buttons each, besides cameras, is aimed at beefing up safety for women travelling in buses. As the buttons are linked to master control rooms of police and MTC, once it is pressed, the master control room would pass on the info and direct the nearest patrol vehicle to rush to the spot. Syncing it with police control room would help reduce incidents of thefts and eve-teasing cases aboard MTC buses, said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/mtc-buses-to-get-cctv-panic-buttons/articleshow/82615133.cms||P Oppili

He said the financial aid would be utilised to ramp up healthcare infrastructure in government hospitals to treat Covid patients and has assured donors of total transparency in utilising the fund. In a video posted on his Twitter handle on Thursday, Stalin said the government was facing two crises at the same time – the pandemic and financial crisis. The government has enforced a complete lockdown. It has been taking measures to contain the spread of the virus and save the lives of people. The government has extended Covid financial aid to the people to help them overcome financial strain during the lockdown. Knowing the severity of the mutant virus, the government has taken efforts to augment medical infrastructure by increasing the number of oxygen beds and vaccine doses. Apart from this, the government has taken efforts to recruit additional doctors, paramedical staff and supporting staff. This led to a sudden increase in expenditure. The Tamil diaspora in the US and other foreign countries have generously contributed to the chief minister relief fund. They have also been involved in fundraising. Though they migrated and settled in foreign countries, their deeds show their strong connection and affection towards the state and its people, the CM said and thanked them for rendering help during trying times. He said Tamil Nadu people would never forget their help.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/stalin-appeals-to-tamil-diaspora-to-contribute-to-cms-relief-fund/articleshow/82615173.cms||---

The civic body is tying up with a private firm to start the “vaccine-on-wheels” drive from Monday. The initiative is limited to PMC limits. “An MoU has been signed with the private organisation, which has experience of conducting such drives in different cities. It will start vaccination-on-wheels in PMC limits from next week,” said Pune municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar. TimesViewThis is a welcome step by the PMC. Senior citizens and people with disabilities are among the most vulnerable and need protection. We have seen several images of the elderly waiting in queues or struggling to climb stairs at hospital sites. Nobody should be deprived of a vaccine shot. Other civic bodies, municipal councils and zilla parishads should also emulate the PMC and make the Covid-19 vaccination process hassle-free for senior citizens. A flexible approach, coupled with the required medical support, will also boost coverage.Kumar said the programme will be available for a priority section of the city's population. The PMC is reaching out to old-age homes, hospitals and patient care centres for the drive. As per the PMC’s plan, mobile vaccination units will be dispatched to earmarked locations. Each unit will have to administer 150 doses of Covid vaccines daily. The plan involves the setting up of 15 such units. The mobile units will have doctors, nurses and paramedical staff. Ambulances will be on standby at the vaccination site. Officials with the PMC said the target is to vaccinate nearly one lakh beneficiaries who have limited mobility. They added that the project is supported by CSR funding. “We will soon share the details of the locations and number of doses that are to be administered via this drive. The numbers will also depend on availability of vaccine doses,” Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-to-start-vax-on-wheels-for-those-with-mobility-woes/articleshow/82615168.cms||---

---||Kolkata||80% buses go off road, city suffers||KOLKATA: Commute during peak hours has become a challenge with over 80% buses going off the road owing to the steep hike in diesel prices. The demand-supply gap has led to overcrowding in the few buses that are still plying, posing a threat of infection spreading among passengers and conductors. “I have no other option but to board very crowded buses from my home at Thakurpukur to my workplace at Liluah thrice a week. The crowd is getting thicker by the day with a decreasing number of buses on routes. I am always terrified of catching an infection. These days, I am using double masks, it is so difficult to breathe in a crowded bus,” said Anup Tarenia, a private company employee. To break the chain of infection, the state government has suspended suburban train services and lowered the number of buses by 50%. But successive rises of diesel prices have left bus operation unviable. More than 80% of private buses have gone off the road. If you run a bus, it is difficult to even recover the fuel cost,” said Tapan Bandyopapdhyay, secretary, Joint Council of Bus Syndicates (JCBS). “There is a tremendous demand-supply gap and the gap is only widening by the day. Since I board the bus from the terminus, I stand in the queue to ensure a seat for me. The safe distancing norms go for toss as people have no other option but to stand close to each other. I think it is high time the government lifts the 50% cap during peak hours,” said Gaurango Sarkar, a railway employee. “The problem can only be resolved by revising the fare substantially. Bus fare was revised last on September 1, 2018. The diesel price was Rs 74.19 per litre then. Thereafter, diesel prices dropped a bit. The diesel price is now Rs 85.5 a litre and is threatening to breach the Rs 90 mark. Bus operators and bus workers are in financial stress. Majority of bus operators are now seriously thinking of giving up the trade,” said Bandyopadhyay. It is even worse for inter-district buses, where train passengers have suddenly shifted to buses. People from Hooghly, Howrah, North 24 Parganas and South 24 Parganas, who used to catch trains to reach their workplaces in the city, are now travelling by over-crowded buses. “Our earnings have increased, but our fear of catching infection has grown manifold,” said a conductor of Nainan-Esplanade route bus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/80-buses-go-off-road-city-suffers/articleshow/82613248.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

The dashboard can be accessed at www.punevaccination.in. Officials said the location of the vaccine centres have been generated using Google Maps. The dashboard is a joint effort by the PMC and the Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture. Citizens can open the page and fill out details using filters such as age group and type of hospital site (private or government). “People are coming out in large numbers for the Covid shot. This is causing mass confusion and crowding at many vaccination centres. The dashboard will provide information on nearest vaccination centres and the number of doses available," said Pune city mayor Murlidhar Mohol. Experts said the dashboard will be updated twice a day. It will also show the day's updates on the vaccine drive in the city, such as caps on age groups or non-availability of doses for a beneficiary group. Officials said the dashboard will help ease crowding and provide people with enough information to help plan their vaccination date. Many citizens who made trips to vaccination centres said they had to return without jabs due to shortages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/now-a-digital-dashboard-that-shows-vaccine-sites-with-number-of-doses/articleshow/82615215.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: 45-plus? Walk in for vaccination at govt schools||NEW DELHI: Delhiites who are above the age of 45 years will now be able to walkin to get jabs at vaccination centres in government schools instead of hospitals. The direction to scale up the number of vaccination centres at schools and open these up for those aged 45 and above and also allow walk-in vaccination was given by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia in a review meeting on Thursday. The centres at government schools were open only to those in the 18-44 age bracket till now. “After reviewing challenges of citizens with regard to internet accessibility and issues in registering online slots, we have made a decision to allow registration and walk-in vaccination in all vaccination centres of Delhi for individuals above 45 years of age,” Sisodia said. “Further, we have also taken the decision to shift vaccination centres from hospitals to Delhi government school centres for citizens above 45 years of age,” he stated. Sisodia said that those who are finding it difficult to register online would easily be able to register at these centres. The Delhi government is planning to quickly scale up vaccination centres in the capital, which will be open six days a week, barring Sundays. “If Delhi continues to receive the required number of vaccines, we will be able to vaccinate 3 lakh people daily. As many as 1.5 lakh vaccines will be administered to people between 18 and 45 years and 1.5 lakh to citizens above 45 years,” the deputy CM said, adding that out of 57 lakh citizens above 45 years of age, 22 lakh have been vaccinated. He also appealed to the central government to fulfil the vaccine requirement of Delhi to ensure all citizens of Delhi can be vaccinated in a swift manner. Senior Aam Aadmi Party functionary and MLA Atishi also said on Thursday that if vaccines are not supplied to Delhi at the earliest, those above 45 years of age will fail to get their second dose of vaccines. The first dose will become ineffective in such a scenario, she said. Atishi said that on Thursday, Delhi administered 74,448 vaccines, including 50,294 people of the 18-44 age-group and 24,154 people aged more than 45 years. She said that for the healthcare workers, frontline workers and the 45+ age group, Covaxin stock is left only for three days and Covishield stock for two days. “There is no Covaxin for the 18-44 age group and most of the vaccination centres have closed down due to this. There is Covishield stock for eight days.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/45-plus-walk-in-for-vax-at-govt-school/articleshow/82615220.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The building, owned by Calcutta University and known as Goenka hospital, will get an infrastructure upgrade for its conversion into a Covid hospital. A team of KMC engineers on Thursday inspected the site and took note of advantages and disadvantages of the healthcare facility located at a relatively densely populated neighbourhood for its conversion into a Covid hospital. A KMC official said Calcutta University brass had expressed interest in handing over their property for its conversion into a Covid treatment facility. Atin Ghosh, a member in the KMC board of administrators (BoA), later said the civic body was holding talks with the state health department to utilize the existing infrastructure for setting up a Covid facility either in the form of a safe home or a hospital for treatment of Covid positive patients who might turn critical. “In all probability, we may go for setting up a Covid hospital. Several private healthcare groups or NGOs have expressed interest in building an infrastructure for the hospital. But we need to seek advice from the state health department Covid response team before the final decision is taken. We depend on the state health department for an infrastructure upgrade of the existing set-up,” Ghosh said. According to a KMC official, a detailed plan was being drawn by the civic engineers that will be sent to Swasthya Bhawan for approval.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmc-to-upgrade-goenka-hospital-into-a-75-bed-covid-care-facility/articleshow/82613250.cms||Saikat Ray

Stalin also asked the Centre to immediately release the pending GST compensation dues to the states, besides offering ‘ad hoc grants-in aid’ to states from additional revenue earned by the Centre by levying cess on sale of petroleum products. He also urged the Centre to release the PDS subsidy meant for states. In addition, Stalin urged the Centre to increase the borrowing limits of the states by an additional one percent. As of now, the borrowing limit is fixed at 3% of the GSDP. In a letter to Modi, Stalin said the states are now involved in procuring vaccines and related drugs for treating patients in their effort to control the spread of Covid-19. “Taking this into account, I request you to consult the GST Council and set the GST rates of such products at ‘zero rate’ for a fixed period,” Stalin said in his letter. In the wake of lower economic growth due to the impact of the Covid pandemic and reduction in the revenues earned by the states, Stalin said such assistance from the Centre was a dire necessity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/cm-writes-to-pm-demanding-zero-gst-on-covid-vaccines/articleshow/82615200.cms||---
---||Pune||Jabs safe, shots-at-home should get nod: Experts||PUNE: Public health experts have now backed the idea of home vaccination for certain at-risk beneficiaries, adding that door-to-door programmes should be allowed especially when the Centre has declared that both vaccines — Covishield and Covaxin — are completely safe. Experts said senior citizens who’re unable to travel to sites and people with disabilities should not be denied vaccines and should be served through door-to-door vaccination drives. Retired professor of clinical virology from CMC Vellore, Dr Jacob T John, said the public health programme should cover all eligible citizens. He said, “According to the Centre, both vaccines are safe and not associated with any serious adverse events. But it is prudent to be prepared to treat anaphylaxis in each recipient. All it takes for monitoring is a trained healthcare worker such as a nurse or a doctor who can visit those who’re unable to travel to a Covid-19 vaccination centre.” He added that after receiving the jab, instructions for such recipients should be left with caretakers or people who can respond quickly if there is an emergency. Dr Naveen Thacker, president-elect of the International Pediatric Association (IPA), said innovations must be made to ensure people with mobility issues have access to the vaccines. “The decision early on to vaccinate only at health facilities was made due to concerns over adverse events. But we know now there have not been any significant side effects,” Dr Thacker said. He added that many countries have allowed drive-in vaccine drives and programmes at workplaces. “In India, Gujarat successfully carried out a pilot drive for young people in Gandhinagar and Bhuj. Why can’t we be flexible for senior citizens who’re at higher risk of severe Covid,” he said. Dr NK Arora, member of the National Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) committee, said door-to-door Covid vaccines cannot be done because of the risk of anaphylaxis or severe allergic reaction. He reiterated that there have not been any serious side-effects, but added that in some parts of the country, especially rural areas and remote regions, effective response to anaphylaxis can only be possible at health centres. As for door-to-door jabs in Maharashtra, state health secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas said they are only following central directives that haven’t yet permitted home vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/jabs-safe-shots-at-home-should-get-nod-experts/articleshow/82615204.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The limited availability is despite the fact that vaccine drives have been suspended for the massive 18-44 group with shots being diverted to cover those in the 45-plus age group. The shortage has inconvenienced many beneficiaries. Arun Deshmukh, a resident of of Kaspate Wasti near Wakad, said many senior citizens have been impacted. Deshmukh’s mother is 92 years old. “The civic bodies should make special arrangements for such beneficiaries,” he said. On Thursday, the PMC said it will have only 78 operational sites for Friday’s drive — nearly 30 centres have been dropped. All the operational sites will have only 100 doses, officials said. In Pimpri Chinchwad, PCMC officials said eight centres will offer only Covaxin to those in the 45-plus beneficiary group. These eight centres will offer 250 doses, but no first dose will be given. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said the Centre's decision to widen the interval between Covishield doses — to 12 to 16 weeks — will immediately reduce number of beneficiaries who are due for a second dose. He said that on Thursday, the district received around 9,100 Covaxin doses, which will be used for the 45-plus category. Also on Thursday, a total of 25,711 people were vaccinated against Covid-19 in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/shortages-continue-to-impact-drive-for-45-plus/articleshow/82615221.cms||Piyush Bhusari

Though high street shops have been allowed to keep open from noon to 3pm, most customers are preferring to stay away from shops and place their orders over video calls, getting the ones they have shortlisted to be home delivered so that they can take a final call and then buy. Jewellers are happy that some sales are happening despite the odds and said that they never thought that high-value gold jewellery, coins and bars could ever take this route to reach their customers. In some cases, customers are asking for weighing scales to be sent home so that the jewellery items can be weighed and sold at home, with the store managers watching over through another video call as the sales person wraps it up at customers’ residences. “We took baby steps last lockdown and improved upon it this time. People booked Zoom calls and Google Meets to browse jewellery virtually for Akshay Tritiya,” said Suvankar Sen, CEO of Senco Jewellers. From a locale like Burrabazar, connecting with customers for Akshay Trititya over video calls is something that Amit Soni, the owner of Mahabir Danwar Jewellers, never thought was possible. “But I am doing it now with great success. Though people are unable to come out of their homes, the urge to acquire a piece of jewellery or gold coin on a day like Akshay Tritiya will remain. Our long-time customers were happy that they could choose items over personalised Zoom calls and the items were then sent home for a final pick. We have to change with the times,” Soni said. This was echoed by Nilanjan Sen of BC Sen jewellers, which too has been advertising its “video-call facility” to customers.

The nurses have been asked to explain why police complaints were not filed when patients left. A nurse who has been issued notice said that there is no standard operating procedure for filing police complaints in non-MLC cases where patients leave against medical advice. Earlier, mayor Jai Prakash had said that out of the patients reported either as missing or absconding earlier, 12 were found to have left the hospital on day one itself from the medical emergency even before being shifted to wards. Seven patients were found to have left between April 19 and May 6, mostly from the emergency, while four patients have actually been discharged after appropriate treatment. “It is hereby clarified that all these 23 cases have been tracked right from their movement from the hospital to either another one or found to be recuperating in home isolation,” corporation had stated in an official statement. Meanwhile, a section of nurses and paramedical staff have threatened to go on strike over the issue of non-payment of salaries from May 25. Hindu Rao Hospital Nurses Association president Indu Jamwal said that there are around 200 nurses who have not been paid salaries of February, March and April despite serving Covid duties. “We have met the medical superintendent regarding the pending salaries, but no progress has been achieved,” she added. The association has also raised the issue of sub-standard accommodation arrangements for 66 nurses, who have been deployed on a 15-day Covid-duty slot. Doctor Tajender Singh who is working as a paramedic in the hospital said that families can still manage when salaries are delayed for a month or two, but it is impossible to function when salaries are being delayed for over 3 months. The hospital had seen strike of staff last year over the issue of non-payment of salaries and Covid patients had to be shifted to other hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hindu-rao-hospital-issues-notice-to-nurses-under-whom-23-covid-patients-went-missing/articleshow/82615270.cms||---

---||Pune||‘Formalise announcement of free mucormycosis care’||Pune: Healthcare experts have now urged the state to issue a government resolution (GR) to formalise a recent announcement that allowed free treatment for mucormycosis under the Mahatma Phule Jan Arogya Yojana (MPJAY) — the state's health insurance scheme. A GR, experts said, will also make clear which components of multi-specialty treatment, including expensive drugs, will be covered under the scheme. The treatment for mucormycosis — a fungal infection mainly seen in Covid-recovered patients — is expensive and can go on for months. Two days ago, state health minister Rajesh Tope had announced that treatment would be covered under MPJAY. Experts said this oral announcement needs to be formalised via a GR. “After the pandemic broke last year, the state had issued a GR allowing free treatment of those with serious Covid. Similarly, a resolution allowing free treatment of mucormycosis under the MPJAY will help patients and empanelled private hospitals,” said Sanjay Patil, chairman of the IMA’s Hospital Board of India .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/formalise-announcement-of-free-mucormycosis-care/articleshow/82615231.cms||Umesh Isalkar

---||Delhi||States competing over vaccine in foreign market hurts India’s image: Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal||NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday said several states floating global tenders for Covid-19 vaccines was detrimental for India’s image in the world. In a series of tweets, Kejriwal said that there should be centralised procurement of vaccines. “Indian states left to compete/fight with each other in the international market. UP fighting Maha, Maha fighting Orissa, Orissa fighting Delhi. Where is “India”? Portrays such a bad image of India. India, as one country, shud procure vaccines on behalf of all Indian states (sic),” he tweeted. “Also, when we approach vaccine manufacturers and their countries as “India” rather than individual states, our bargaining power is much more, Indian govt has much more diplomatic space to negotiate with their countries,” he added. Later in the day, the CM welcomed the statement of Dr VK Paul, member (health), NITI Aayog, wherein he said that the Centre and Covaxin manufacturing company (Bharat Biotech) are willing to invite other companies that want to produce it. Kejriwal tweeted that it is a very welcome step by the central government, which will help in ramping up vaccine production. Meanwhile, in a video conference with Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan, Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain requested that the Centre should procure vaccines from foreign manufacturers on behalf of the state governments, instead of states being compelled to individually float global tenders. Jain also urged the Centre to cap the price of vaccines at a uniform Rs 150, alleging that the vaccine manufacturers were making a profit of Rs 16,000 crore on 100 crore doses. “The two companies preparing the two vaccines, Covishield and Covaxin, must share the formula for preparation of these vaccines to other companies as well,” Jain said, adding that a number of Indian companies are capable of manufacturing it and mobilising it into the market for the public. “Third point I portrayed in the meeting was that the manufacturers of Covaxin and Covishield have considered this crisis to be an opportunity to generate high profits,” he said. Jain stated that when Covishield was being supplied to the Centre at Rs 150, even then the company was making profit. “The company is manufacturing six crore vaccines every month. Even if we go by a profit of Rs 10 per dose, and they give half of the vaccines to the Centre, which is 3 crore, the estimated profit comes out to be Rs 30 crore,” he said, adding the same vaccine is being sold to state governments at Rs 300, doubling the profit and at Rs 400 to private entities, even though cost of production stays the same and the profit earned goes up to Rs 260 per dose, considering cost of production is Rs 140. “By this entire estimation, the company generates a humongous profit of Rs 960 crore in just one month,” he said. Jain said that the average profit comes to around Rs 160 per dose of vaccine. More than 100 crore Indians are above the age of 18 years and would require at least 200 crore doses. “If we take 100 crore doses from one company and the other 100 crore from another, both of them incur a profit of Rs 16,000 crore each,” he added. Jain further said that Covaxin was being supplied at an even higher rate and their profit would be higher.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/states-competing-over-vax-in-foreign-market-hurts-indias-image-kejriwal/articleshow/82615237.cms||Sidharatha Roy

When she developed fever, cold and other symptoms a week ago, an RT-PCR test confirmed her worst fears. She was advised home quarantine, but when her fever did not subside, she was told to get hospitalised by her husband, who is in charge of the ICU at the same facility. Her admission coincided with the time when salaries of 500 staff members were to be processed. To make sure that the staff members get their salaries on time, she got a laptop and cleared the payments from her hospital bed. Vaishali, mother of 11-year-old daughter, said, “ The hospitalisation coincided with the period when salaries are cleared between the 10 to 15th of every month. There are staffers, who are from other states, cities and salary is important for them.” Sangram Kapale, director of MedBros Healthcare Private Ltd, said they told her to rest, but she was insistent.

---||Nagpur||Covid-19 cases cross 10-lakh mark in Vid, deaths still up||Nagpur: With fewer new cases and more recoveries, the graph of Covid-19 second wave is now surely moving downwards in Vidarbha region. But deaths due to Covid-19 are still not declining. On Thursday, 8,579 new cases were reported while 13,164 patients recovered. With this, total case load of Vidarbha surpassed the 10-lakh mark. Out of them, 88.3 lakh patients have recovered. Death toll due to Covid-19 is still a cause of concern. On Tuesday, 208 patients died of Covid-19 in Vidarbha. These include 41 from Nagpur city, 3 from Chandrapur city, 6 from Amravati city and 5 from Akola city municipal corporation limits. This leaves 153 deaths from rural region of Vidarbha. Cases also are more from rural parts of the region. Many cases in rural Vidarbha might be going unreported and deaths only getting reported as patients reach hospital in serious condition. This indicates that rural spread is still active and administration needs to take care of it. As cities are showing good improvement in Covid-19 scenario, the recovery rate of Vidarbha is also improving rapidly. In first 13 days of May, the recovery rate has improved from 81% to 88%. This recovery rate is equal to the state’s average and better than the national average of 83%. This means the conditions in Vidarbha and Maharashtra are getting better now.

---||Hyderabad||MLC poll deferred; council chief, deputy set to retire||Hyderabad: The Election Commission has deferred elections to the legislative council in view of the prevailing Covid -19 second wave in the state and the country. However, a tricky situation has emerged as both chairman and deputy chairman of the council will retire on June 3. The government may have to either elect a new chairman or appoint an incharge to tide over the crisis. The EC was supposed to issue a notification for filling up six MLC vacancies, to be elected by MLAs. The term of MLCs, including legislative council chairman Gutta Sukhender Reddy, deputy chairman Neti Vidyasagar, former deputy CM Kadiyam Srihari, government whip B Venkateswarlu, Fareeduddin and Akula Lalitha, is scheduled to end on June 3. “The commission has reviewed the matter (on holding election) today and has decided that due to outbreak of the second wave of Covid 19 in the country, it would not be appropriate to hold biennial election to MLCs till the pandemic situation significantly improves and condition become conducive to hold these elections,” the election commission said in an official release. Election Commission deputy secretary Pawan Diwan said the EC would take a decision at an appropriate time in the future after taking inputs from the state and assessing the pandemic situation from mandated authorities like National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA). Sources said if the situation improves, the EC might announce schedule for the election next month i.e., June and hold election in July along with other by-elections in the country. Official sources said a tricky situation emerged as both chairman and deputy chairman would retire on June 3. “If the chairman retires, deputy chairman acts as incharge chairman, but as the term of both chairman and deputy chairman are ending on the same day, which will force the government to elect either a new chairman or appoint incharge chairman till the permanent chairman is elected,” sources in the government said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/mlc-poll-deferred-council-chief-deputy-set-to-retire/articleshow/82615279.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Hyderabad||Revanth wants cross-examination deferred, gets no relief from HC||Hyderabad: Justice G Sridevi of the high court on Thursday issued notices to Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) officials asking them to reply to a petition filed by Congress MP A Revanth Reddy, who is scheduled to face trial at the ACB court soon as a prime accused in the cash-for-vote case. The legislator urged the court to direct the trial court to defer cross-examination till depositions of investigation officers (IOs) and panch witnesses conclude. The trial court, the court of principal special judge for ACB cases, has already recorded the depositions of key prosecution witnesses, including nominated MLA Elvis Stephenson and Malcolm Taylor, who deposed against Revanth Reddy and others narrating their roles in the case. Revanth has to cross-examine them. He is not ready to do that now on the ground that if their cross-examination brings out any defects in the investigation, the IOs would rectify them in their depositions later. Hence, he asked the trial court to defer the ‘cross session’ till the depositions of the investigation team was recorded. The trial court described it as a tactic aimed at dodging the trial. It, however, allowed him to wait till the depositions of Stephenson and Taylor were over. “If you do not cross-examine them on June 2, that amounts to foregoing your opportunity to cross-examine them,” ACB court principal special judge Sambasiva Rao Naidu said in his May 10 order. It was this order that was challenged in the high court by Revanth. Senior counsel V Ravi Kiran Rao appeared for ACB and opposed any relief to Revanth. His sole aim seems to be dodging the trial and hence his plea need not be entertained, he said. Recording the depositions of the investigation officers at the end has been the practice and session of cross-examination need not be deferred for that, he said, while contending that what the trial court has done in this regard was very much in tune with the law and there was no need to interfere in that order. Justice Sridevi posted the case to June 18 for further hearing without giving any interim relief to Revanth.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/revanth-wants-cross-examination-deferred-gets-no-relief-from-hc/articleshow/82615320.cms||---
---||Goa||This Eid-ul-Fitr, Muslims to go without mutton, beef||PANAJI: Muslims in Goa will have to make do with chicken in their biryanis and curries instead of beef or mutton for Eid-ul-Fitr (May 14), this year. With most of the meat shops being in the municipal markets and Goa currently observing a Covid curfew, these shops have downed their shutters leaving little to no beef coming into the state. As a precautionary measure against the spread of the coronavirus, most of the shops in the municipal markets are kept closed. The Panaji market which is otherwise full of hustle bustle wore a dreary look on Thursday, on the eve of the festival, with only a few poultry shops operating and none of the mutton or beef shops being open. “Fresh beef is not available in Goa right now. This time, people might prefer to have chicken biryani instead of beef for Eid,” general secretary of the Quraishi Meat Traders’ Association, Anwar Bepari, said. “Some traders whose shops are not in the municipal market may be able to procure beef but those will be few. However, the majority of the shops selling beef are in municipal markets,” he said. He further said that he has received enquiries by non-Eid celebrators as well over the availability of beef. “About 30% of Goans consume beef which also includes Christians, so people anticipated that at least for the festival season we would procure fresh beef,” he said, adding that traders in Goa decided not to transport from Karnataka in adhering with the SOPs amid rising Covid-19 cases. “The Covid situation in Goa is already very bleak with so many people losing their loved ones. We have therefore cancelled our annual Eid feast and instead will eat a humble meal at home. It doesn’t matter whether or not there is beef biryani being served as long as we have our family together to eat along with.” S Muzawar, a Taleigao resident said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/this-eid-ul-fitr-muslims-to-go-without-mutton-beef/articleshow/82617734.cms||Nida Sayed

Addressing a press conference here, he said the CM should have been firm on this since vaccines are produced locally here. “For instance, Odisha and Tamil Nadu are sending oxygen to other states only after their needs are met. Why cannot Telangana take such a stand,” he wondered. He alleged that the state government was showing less number of Covid-19 cases and deaths deliberately, as a result it is getting less allocation of vaccines and medicines from the Centre.

---||Mumbai||Ensure zero tolerance towards violence against doctors, says Bombay HC||MUMBAI: “We have to protect the medical fraternity and we will be failing in our duties as a state if we don’t protect them,” said Bombay high court on Thursday while hearing a criminal Public Interest Litigation (PIL) for directions to the state to protect doctors and healthcare staff who are in the frontline battling the Covid-19 pandemic. The high court bench agreed with and reiterated directions given by the Bombay HC bench at Goa on May 6 to the state to “take all steps necessary to ensure there is no such violence against healthcare professionals and, if there is any, it is dealt with firmly under law.” Advocate Rui Rodrigues for Association of Medical Consultants had drawn the court’s attention to the Goa bench order. He sought similar protection be granted by the HC for doctors and healthcare professionals in Maharashtra. “We further direct that adequate police personnel be posted at hospitals, wards, etc. and that they be sensitised and instructed so that any act of crime against medical and healthcare professionals can be nipped in the bud,” said a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni.  It added, “Sufficient boards or posters must also be put up at such places to make it clear that there will be zero tolerance towards any form of violence against medical and healthcare professionals. At the same time, it would be obligatory for the hospital administration to ensure that the patients and their relatives are furnished with proper information on the line of treatment and possible risks…” These directions to protect medical professionals are to be complied with by the state immediately, said the high court. Advocate Nitin Deshpande appearing for petitioner Dr Rajeev Joshi contended that though the police lodge complaints, FIRs are not registered under the Epidemic Diseases Act of 1897 which has non-bailable offences, but instead the state doctors’ protection Act of 2010 is invoked under which offences are bailable, making it easy for the offender to get off the hook easily. The HC found prima facie there was no factual foundation presented by Deshpande, but it directed public prosecutor F R Shaikh to indicate the number of cases registered across the state under the Epidemic Diseases Act by doctors and other medical staff. The high court also directed Deshpande, Rodrigues as well as Sudeep Nargolkar for Association of Hospitals in Pune to submit a comprehensive set of suggestions to the state lawyer regarding effective implementation of the law to protect doctors which the state shall, without waiting for the HC nod, implement those which they accept. The high court will next hear the batch of matters on May 19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/ensure-zero-tolerance-towards-violence-against-docs-says-bombay-hc/articleshow/82617719.cms||Swati Deshpande

---||Delhi||Hand to mouth: Many eateries in Delhi skip home delivery, shut shop||NEW DELHI: This year the lockdown hasn't led to restaurants looking at innovative approaches to selling food like they did last year. Many outlets that had applied for delivery passes or sought permissions for longer delivery hours have totally shut shop. Instead of trying ideas like DIY kits and personalised deliveries, eateries have simply shut shop due to almost zero business with potential customers spooked by the relentless spread of Covid-19. "A lot of restaurants are not delivering because there are very few orders," reported restaurateur Varun Khera, who also heads the Noida chapter of National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI). Khera has stopped delivery services at his two outlets and said the safety of the employees is also a big concern this year because of the virulence of the infection. "In 2020, people were initially hesitant, but eventually started ordering food. This year, the situation is sombre. Customers are wary about ordering from outside and our staff is scared to report to work," said Khera. Inderjit Banga, NRAI Gurgaon chapter head, too no longer delivers. He said most restaurateurs were planning to stay shut for the next two months or at least till this Covid wave ebbed. Keeping our outlets open in a bid to survive on delivery is too big a risk for very little returns, he said, adding, "We will request a waiver of various fees for the first quarter of 2021-22, a period when most restaurants will remain totally shut." However, the few outlets that are fully operational in the city are seeing decent results. Jaydeep Mukherjee, brand head, Smoke House Deli and director, cloud kitchens, Impresario Handmade Restaurants, reasoned that people would order from "credible" outlets. While surmising that a third of restaurants had ceased functioning, he said his own outlets, especially in Vasant Kunj and Nehru Place, have seen substantial orders. Hyatt Regency Delhi too is depending on food delivery for revenue generation at the moment. Julian Ayers, general manager, said people ordering from the hotel are those looking for 'experiential dining'. Apart from variety, customers considered discounts and offers and the orders were always good on the day Hyatt Regency offered such discounts. "We have a huge base of repeat customers who are aware of our offers and order regularly from us. Even on a day-to-day basis, we see 40-50% of repeat orders," Ayers claimed. The going is tougher for smaller eateries though. Restaurant consultant Ramminder Bakshi reminded that outlets in markets such as Greater Kailash, Connaught Place and Khan Market were shut. He also pointed out many families were impacted by Covid and were avoiding anything except home food. Almost 75% of restaurants in the city were shuttered, maintained Dinesh Arora, president, Delhi Restaurants and Clubs Association. He said 2021 had dealt the worst blow to the hospitality industry. He noted that many brands whose delivery earnings touched Rs 50,000 a day last year are barely touching Rs 10,000 this time. "For such low sales, an outlet has to have a functional kitchen, delivery staff, electricity cost and rental. This doesn't make sense," said Arora. With most restaurants having paid excise fees in advance in anticipation of a positive impact of Delhi's new excise policy, the shutdown is a big dampener. Arora expected help for the industry from the central government such as availability of loans at cheaper rates and waiver of fees and GST. "This year is worse than 2020. Our industry is on ventilator and we will need all the possible support from every authority in the state and Centre to resuscitate ourselves. Without support, a majority of restaurants might not have the strength to reopen," cautioned Arora.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hand-to-mouth-many-eateries-skip-home-delivery-shut-shop/articleshow/82615482.cms||Amin Ali
---||Delhi||BJP targets Delhi govt on deaths for lack of oxygen||New Delhi: BJP on Friday alleged that Delhi government “failed” in proper distribution and storage of oxygen, leading to many deaths, and that “criminal liability” of deaths of patients in two Delhi hospitals due to lack of oxygen was on CM Arvind Kejriwal. At a virtual press conference, party spokesperson Sambit Patra cited a report by Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation and said Delhi government had returned liquid medical oxygen supplied to the capital on a few occasions because it had no storage capacity and even asked neighbouring states like Haryana and UP to keep the additional quota in reserve. “All this while, Kejriwal and his deputy Manish Sisodia kept blaming the Centre and other states for the oxygen crisis and accused the Centre of meting out step-motherly treatment to the city,” Patra said, adding that it was the CM who treated his people in a “step-motherly” way. “The way you work has been exposed today. The (oxygen) crisis could have been averted and managed. I am sorry to tell Arvind Kejriwal that the crisis was grossly mismanaged by you. I hope you and Sisodia will answer and apologise. Your work has been all about spreading confusion,” Patra said. Citing one incident, the BJP member said the Linde plant in Faridabad was expected to supply 120MT oxygen to Delhi on May 9, but the state government sent 74MT back due to non-availability of storage space or low demand. TOI tried to reach out to Delhi government for a reaction, but failed to get any response on the allegations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-targets-delhi-govt-on-deaths-for-lack-of-oxygen/articleshow/82643579.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Namazis to offer prayers at home to check Covid surge||JAMSHEDPUR: On the eve of Eid-ul-Fitr, Muslim clerics, seminary heads and community leaders issued a set of dos and don’ts for festival enthusiasts. Appealing to the minority community to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour, the clerics said that there shouldn’t be any public demonstration of the celebrations. “Special prayers on Eid should be offered at home like they were offered on Alvida Jumma (last Friday),” the chief of Imarat-e-Shariah, Saud Alam Kasmi, said. The cleric of Jugsalai mosque, Kazi Mustak Ahmed, said citizens should not visit the house of relatives and friends to exchange festival greetings and they should also not invite anyone to home to join the feast on Eid. Imam Ansar Ahmed said shaking hands to greet each other should be avoided completely. The socio-religious leader added that wearing face mask and maintaining social distancing should be followed compulsorily. A functionary of Tahreek Paigham-e-Islam said the community heads have given a clear advice to observe the festival in accordance with the Covid protocols of the government. “If we compare with last year, the situation is more dangerous in 2021. The present variant of Covid has proved to be more infectious. Therefore, the community leaders and religious heads have shown more concern,” said a school teacher, Arshad Ali. Entrepreneur Mohamed Wakiluddin said digital platforms such as Facebook and WhatsApp were being used to communicate the message. “Last year social media platforms were not used effectively, but this year it has been different,” said Tata Steel employee Kafil Khan, who is resident of Dhatkidih. Saher-e-kazi Abid Hussein Noori said helping the economically vulnerable sections of the community to observe Eid will be an important aspect of the festivities this year. The district administration, meanwhile, deployed police outside the mosques in the city to prevent any congregation during Eid. Adequate police force has been put on law and order duty across the sensitive areas under the supervision of 45 magistrates, sources said. The ADM (law and order), N K Lal has been made the overall in-charge of the law and order machinery. In Garhwa, too, similar appeals were made to people on Thursday. The president of Madrasa Tablighul Islam, M Yasin Ansari, suggested the people to offer Eid namaz at home. He also suggested them not to wear new clothes and save money to help the needy and the poor. “Eid is an occasion to celebrate with fellow citizens but at a time when the country is reeling under a pandemic, people should be cautious. Even a little error can lead to a catastrophe,” Ansari said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/namazis-to-offer-prayers-at-home-to-check-covid-surge/articleshow/82612636.cms||B Sridhar

For mobility within or between different districts in the state, people will have to secure transit passes online from https://epassjharkhand.nic.in whereas those coming to the state from outside will have to seek movement passes from jharkhandtravel.nic.in. A user will have to upload his/her mobile number, valid ID-card and select the purpose of visit from a host of options to submit request for travel. The permit will thereafter be sent via sms, officials said. Ranchi’s district transport officer (DTO) Praveen Kumar Prakash said that they were ready to implement the new lockdown rules from next week to ensure that people in dire need of travel don’t face any hassles. “Last year, too, similar gateways were used to issue passes,” he said over the phone. The online portal had come under severe criticism from different quarters as many had faced issues in getting registered or receiving online permits. Another official, however, said that in case of technical glitches, people can approach competent authorities in their respective districts to get offline permits. Both the websites are currently in English. Many citizens have, therefore, complained that the language issue would make it difficult for them to use the sites in spite of having smartphones. On Wednesday, the state government extended its ongoing partial lockdown (health safety week) by another fortnight till May 27 with additional curbs including restriction on movements to break the chain of Covid-19 transmission. While both inter- and intra-state buses will be off the roads during this period, people can travel in private vehicles with valid e-passes. However, those going out of the state or vehicles crossing through Jharkhand on way to another state won’t have the need to secure passes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/e-passes-must-for-inter-dist-inter-state-travel-from-may-16/articleshow/82613962.cms||ASRP Mukesh

The drive was scheduled to begin from May 1 but it was postponed till May 15 as the Centre along with the manufacturers of Covaxin and Covishield expressed their inability to deliver the doses. State health department officials said a consignment of 1.8 lakh doses will arrive in Ranchi by air on Friday morning. The officials further said the ongoing vaccination drive for people above 45 years will continue and nearly six lakh doses provided by the Centre are still in stock. Meanwhile, the state department of health, medical education and family welfare said a little over 30,000 people among the 1.57 crore eligible beneficiaries for the third phave have registered themselves through CoWIN portal and Arogya Setu application to take their jabs since registrations opened on April 28. On the eve of the drive’s launch, 27,539 people had booked their slots at the session sites. As many as 496 new session sites have been set up for inoculating the beneficiaries. The most number of sites are in Simdega (161) while the least are in Sahebganj. Ranchi has 10 session sites while Bokaro has 37. Dhanbad has 34 sites while East Singhbhum and Hazaribag have 13 and 14 sites respectively. The sites will open for vaccination from 10 am. “Each site in Ranchi will inoculate 150 beneficiaries in a day. The beneficiaries will have to register themselves beforehand with CoWIN and Arogya Setu. No offline registration at the sites will be allowed,” Ranchi civil surgeon Dr Vinod Kumar said, adding that all session sites are fully booked till May 20. Dr Kumar added, "The drive will not be conducted in private hospitals for now." Health department officials said as many as 999 people have already booked slots in Ranchi district while nearly 4,000 have booked themselves for the jabs in Bokaro. In East Singhbhum, 3,674 people have booked themselves for their first dose. However, there is no clarity about further chances to be given to the beneficiaries who have booked their slots but failed to turn up for the jab. “Since there is a shortage of vaccine, we do not know whether we can allow walk-ins at a later date for those who miss their slots,” a health official said. He further said the poor response to the third phase vaccination drive is a cause of concern for the government. A statement issued by the government said, "Although there is excitement among the beneficiaries in Ranchi, Bokaro and a few other districts, there are several other districts which still lack awareness. Hence, we have stepped up our efforts and campaigns are planned in local languages to break the stereotypes.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/state-to-begin-covid-vax-drive-for-1-57cr-adults-from-today/articleshow/82626675.cms||Dhritiman Ray

Sources said the district administration has identified around 50 places as sensitive where magistrates along with police force will be deployed. This is in addition to the 96 spots of Ranchi district where round-the-clock deployment of force has been made to enforce the norms of the safety week. Police informed that already 1,200 personnel were engaged in implementing the health safety week norms, adding 600 more would be deployed in view of the Eid. DSP (city) Amit Singh said, “Apart from making elaborate security arrangements, the administration is also in touch with religious heads and other leaders to ensure pandemic norms are followed. We are getting full cooperation from them.” A cleric of a mosque located in Harmu, Maulana Abdul Majid, asked people to pray for the early elimination of Covid. General secretary of the central Muharram Committee Akil ul Rehman appealed to devotees to offer prayers and celebrate the festival at home. He said crowding must be avoided in view of the Covid pandemic. Secretary of Serve India Saiful Haque also appealed to devotees to follow the government advisory, including social distancing. The schedules for Namaz of each mosque, a common practice every year, have not been issued owing to existing government directives. It may be stated here that last year the devotees had largely observed the festival at home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/addl-force-deployed-to-ensure-compliance-of-cov-norms-on-eid/articleshow/82612687.cms||---

While a preliminary probe by the forest department suggested the elephants were struck by lightning, a section of conservationists sought a detailed inquiry to rule out the possibility of the animals dying of some other cause. Assam’s chief wildlife warden MK Yadava said he would be visiting Kundoli, around 125km from Guwahati, with a team of veterinary doctors on Friday to carry out the post-mortem. Dr Rahul Mahanta of the physics department of Cotton University in Guwahati said the “thermodynamical character” of the atmosphere over the Brahmaputra Valley was conducive to severe thunderstorm activity at dawn that could lead to “explosive events”. However, Rituraj Phukan, secretary general of the Green Guard Nature Organization, contested the theory that lightning killed the herd.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/18-elephants-die-in-suspected-lightning-strike-in-assam-forest/articleshow/82621847.cms||Prabin Kalita
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Covid labs under strain, results delayed||AMARAVATI: Due to a steep rise in the screening of Covid-19 suspects, laboratories are struggling to process results in time. Shortage of lab technicians with expertise to diagnose Covid-19 strains is also hampering laboratories attached to government hospitals and medical colleges. Although a few private laboratories are also handling Covid-19 tests, government laboratories are taking over 95 per cent of the burden of the caseload resulting in severe delay in releasing results. According to a report submitted by the health department to the group of ministers (GoM) on Covid-19, nearly 60,000 samples were pending at labs for over seven days. Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy had directed the officials to ensure that the test results should be delivered to patients within 24 hours to ensure that people who test positive can start treatment and initiate quarantine. The delay in delivering Covid-19 test results is letting people roam around streets with little regard for guidelines. “Every day samples are being collected from about 1 lakh people and total caseload on the labs are around 1.5 lakh with backlog. This is resulting in delay in releasing the results,” confirmed a senior official in the health department. The official report said that about 85,000 samples were pending for at least three days. Nearly 75,000 samples were pending for about 24 hours even after releasing nearly 1 lakh reports. Sources said that nearly 2 lakh samples were pending for delivery of reports over a week. Experts said that the delay in completion of the sample analysis might also give false negatives or false positives. In some of the cases, the samples were going beyond analysis prompting the lab authorities to reject the samples. “My mother gave samples following mild-symptoms. We got a message from the lab that the test has been rejected. Unable to understand the meaning ‘rejected,’ we consulted many officials for clarity and it took another two days to get information,” said C Prasad of Kadapa. Health minister Alla Nani said that the government is ramping up infrastructure and human resources at all the laboratories to match the increasing caseload. He said that they have deployed teams to work almost 24x7 to clear the backlog as delivery of results is crucial to contain the virus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/covid-labs-under-strain-results-delayed/articleshow/82612587.cms||Samdani MN

TOI, in its columns on Monday, had highlighted the illegal practices of brokers charging up to Rs 45,000 for cremation of Covid-19 bodies. Mayor R Bhagya Lakshmi and municipal commissioner Prasanna Venkatesh asked people to make use of electric crematorium and Muthavarapu Venkateswara Rao gas crematorium at Swargapuri for free cremation. Electric crematoriums at Bhavanipuram and Ajith Singh Nagar will start functioning from Friday. The civic body asked people to complain if any staff demands money for cremation there. “People should help each other. Unfortunately, many middlemen are looting the public during this tough time. We have reported a number of incidents where brokers are making money out of Covid-19 deaths. We will initiate action against those who charge huge amount for cremation of patients who died of Covid-19,” said Bhagya Lakshmi. The VMC has deployed sanitation inspectors to burial grounds across the city to control middlemen from cheating public, especially at Gunadala and Ajith Singh Nagar burial grounds. Meanwhile, the taskforce wing of city police are cracking down on ambulance drivers who charge hefty fee to shift bodies of Covid-19 patients for funeral. The city police asked public to complain if ambulance drivers are violating the rate card fixed by the district administration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/vmc-organises-free-cremations-in-city/articleshow/82612619.cms||Venu Lanka

BJP MP Nisith Pramanik, who accompanied Dhankhar, was seen asking police to lathicharge the mob and make way for the governor. Dhankhar blamed inadequate police arrangements made during his journey via Dinhata. “I am being gheraoed repeatedly,” he told the police. “Trinamool rogues came in my way. It points to collapse of the rule of law,” he said adding he had never dreamt of such a “nanga raj” in Bengal.

---||Amaravati||Andhra Pradesh: Pandemic hits outsourced govt employees hard||AMARAVATI: About two lakh employees working in different government departments on outsourcing basis are left to struggle as the government is not extending any financial assistance even to those tested positive for Covid-19. The government is granting them loss of pay leave when tested positive for Covid-19. Heads of the departments (HoDs) have asked the district unit managers not to allow the employees to attend duties for 14 days even if their family members tested positive. Such instructions would help the regular employees to tide over the crisis since they would be getting their salary as usual in addition to the medical benefits under employees’ health insurance scheme. However, the departmental chiefs have ignored grievances of outsourcing employees. According to Outsourced and Contract Employees’ Union leader E Madhubabu, about 60 outsourced employees in different departments died due to Covid-19 in the last two months. “The families of outsourced employees who lost their breadwinners are virtually on the streets as they were not getting any financial assistance either ex-gratia or medical benefits,” said Madhubabu. He demanded that the government should extend the health insurance scheme and ex-gratia benefits to the outsourced employees as they were handling more work than the regular employees. He said that at least 10 to 15 employees were turning positive to Covid-19 every day as they were the most exposed to the virus in the system. Regular employees by virtue of their seniority are making outsourced employees scapegoats by assigning them field work leaving them to work under stress. “Facing pay cut during the leave period after testing positive is very painful when we are unable to manage the medical costs,” said K Nageswara Rao, an outsourced data entry operator in the health department. He urged the chief minister to consider granting full pay when someone availed leave after getting tested positive. AP Corporation for Outsourced Services (APCOS) managing director Sanjay Prabhakar had died of Covid-19 last week. The state government appointed additional director Vasudeva Rao as managing director of APCOS following the sudden death of Sanjay Prabhakar. Although APCOS is managing the services of the outsourced employees, it is just implementing the policies of different departments which are hiring the staff on outsourcing basis. “The decision to grant full salary and medical benefits to the outsourced employees should be taken by the respective departments,” said a senior official of APCOS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/pandemic-hits-outsourced-govt-employees-hard/articleshow/82612684.cms||Samdani MN

The incident happened at around 4 am in the morning when Dr B Vengamma, the director of Sri Venkateswara Institute of Medical Sciences (SVIMS), a tertiary care referral centre run by the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams in the temple city, informed the district collector about the depleting oxygen stocks at the hospital. The district administration immediately swung into action. After they were told that the oxygen tanker from Chennai would not be able to reach Tirupati till Thursday afternoon, they started searching for alternative medical oxygen sources in nearby areas and found one at Srikrishna gas agency. An oxygen tanker was immediately arranged and police set up a green channel to ensure that the vehicle reached SVIMS in just 25 minutes to refill the nearly depleted oxygen tank. SVIMS is one of the major hospitals in the district with treatment facilities for Covid-19 patients. The facility has 145 ventilator beds and 328 oxygen beds, all of which are occupied as of now. On May 7, police managed to trace and help an oxygen tanker reach the Vijayawada government general hospital within minutes by setting up a green channel for its fast transport. There was panic for some time when the oxygen tanker from Odisha went off the radar and couldn’t be tracked on the GPS system. Police later found the truck parked near a dhaba in East Godavari district, woke up the driver who was resting owing to fatigue, and set up a green channel to ensure that it reached Vijayawada GGH in short time. Over 400 Covid patients were on oxygen support at the hospital at the time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/green-channel-for-o2-tanker-helps-avert-mishap-at-svims/articleshow/82612718.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

As fitness centers across the city are closed due to Covid-19 lockdown many prefer morning walk at the walking tracks. The stretch of walking track from Ramavarappadu to Siddhartha Medical College is in a bad shape and people blame it on the VMC horticulture department. Over a period, huge dumps of garbage have been piled up and many plants damaged with inadequate watering. “Doctors prefer exercise to improve immunity. But walking tracks are in a bad shape. Huge dump of garbage is seen in many parts of the track and benches and lighting at the track were demolished by miscreants,” said Challapalli Ranga Rao, a walker from Currency Nagar. Protective fencing at the track is damaged by the miscreants and officials have ignored repair works, he added. On the other hand, relatives of Covid-19 patients are using the walking track as a waiting place at Government Hospital and are dumping food packets and other garbage on track which is also causing inconvenience to the walkers. The horticulture wing of VMC said that they are watering the greenery regularly. Officials said they will repair the walking track soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/vijayawadas-walking-tracks-in-bad-shape-as-garbage-piles-up/articleshow/82612752.cms||Venu Lanka

All India Lawyers Union (AILU), Andhra Pradesh committee, moved the high court seeking directions to both central and state governments over several issues pertaining to treatment of Covid-19 patients. The petitioners argued that as the prevailing conditions on the ground are no less than health emergency, all private hospitals should be taken over by the government for treating Covid-19 patients. It was alleged that the private hospitals are fleecing patients with exorbitant prices for treatment. Many patients are being denied admission because of non-availability of beds. There have been severe lapses in making essential drugs like Remdesivir and Tocilizumab injections, alleged the petitioners. In view of the serious lapses in the handling of Covid-19 situation, the petitioners sought directions from the high court to the governments to take over all private and corporate hospitals, ramp up medical staff for providing effective treatment, to regulate the supply of essential drugs, ensure universal vaccination to all irrespective of age group, to enforce social distancing norms by banning all political and other gatherings and to ensure insurance companies and hospitals provide cashless treatment for policy holders. The high court is likely to take up the petition for hearing on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/pil-seeks-govt-takeover-of-pvt-hosps-for-covid-treatment/articleshow/82612773.cms||Srikanth Aluri

Under fire over the decision, Ajit Pawar said there was no need to appoint any external agency to handle the social media of his office and issued instructions to cancel the government order in this regard. The general administration department of the state government had issued an order on Wednesday for the appointment of an external agency to disseminate information to people through various social media platforms about the public-oriented decisions, initiatives, policies and also the announcements made by the deputy chief minister. The government had pegged the expenses at Rs 5.98 crore for 2021-22. Criticising the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, BJP MLA Atul Bhatkhalkar sought cancellation of this decision meant for the “public relations exercise of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and Ajit Pawar.” “There are news reports that crores of rupees will be spent on their public relations exercise.

Of the 11-floor structure, five floors will be earmarked for parking, which could accommodate 450 four-wheelers and 600 two-wheelers. This is going to be the biggest multi-level car parking facility in the public sector in Visakhapatnam, perhaps in Andhra Pradesh. The urban development authority has 1.35 acres of vacant land situated adjacent to its present office premises ‘Udyog Bhavan’ in Siripuram. The plot is a contiguous parcel with roads on three sides and the VMRDA building on the other side. This major commercial node of the city largely comprises commercial, office, institutional and residential activities such as Andhra University, HSBC call centre, Children’s Arena, Dutt Island building, branded showrooms, etc. All these factors make it essential to have a high capacity car parking facility to reduce roadblocks and stagnancy in traffic movement. The VMRDA has engaged Andhra Pradesh Urban Infrastructure Asset Management Ltd. (APUIAML) as the end-to-end project manager and transaction advisor for the project about two years ago. Consequently, the APUIAML prepared a detailed project report for Rs.65.31 crore. In response to the tenders floated by the VMRDA in February 2021, three bidders submitted their proposals within the stipulated time. After opening the financial bids and tender–cum-reverse auctioning on March 2, the last bid was quoted for Rs 67.57 crore, which represents a 3.45% excess over the estimated contract value (ECV) of Rs 65.31 crore. VMRDA metropolitan commissioner P Koteswara Rao said that the reverse-auctioning process saved about Rs 68 lakh to the exchequer of the urban development authority. “The state government after careful examination of the proposal from the technical committee-2 has accorded permission to the VMRDA to award the project to the lowest bid offered by Vijay Nirman Company Pvt. Ltd. for Rs 67.57 crore. The project is planned to be completed within 18 months from the date of signing agreement with the contractor. The construction progress, quality, and timely delivery of the project activities would be supervised by APUIAML,” said Koteswara Rao. The VMRDA had proposed the parking facility long ago but it did not make any headway due to feasibility issues and finances involved in the project. Due to the same, the VMRDA later incorporated the commercial space aspect in the project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/vmrda-finalises-tenders-for-multi-level-car-parking/articleshow/82612818.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Though the incident happened about two weeks ago, it came to light on Thursday when the victim and her parents approached the police and filed a complaint. Police said the victim, along with a male friend, had gone to a beach near Komaragiripatnam Kadadari in the district when they were accosted by the three youths. When the girl and her friend protested, they beat them up, tied the boy and raped the girl in front of her friend. They also took pictures of the act on their mobile phones. The victim did not lodge a police complaint out of fear and social stigma. Recently, one of the accused managed to get the phone number of the victim and started blackmailing her. He threatened to upload her nude pictures on social media platforms if she did not fulfil his desire. Unable to bear the harassment, the victim confided everything to her family members, who immediately lodged a complaint at the police station. Amalapuram DSP Y Madhava Reddy said that they have registered a case under relevant sections and the victim has been sent to hospital for medical tests. “Based on the descriptions given by the victim, we have formed a special team to arrest the accused. We will nab them soon. We will ensure that they get the strictest punishment from the court,” he said.

Baburam Balwan Singh was found tied to a hospital bed in the non-Covid-19 ward of Etah government hospital on Thursday. Taking cognizance of the matter, director general (prisons) Anand Kumar suspended the jail warder and ordered an inquiry. Singh, who was brought to Etah jail on February 6 this year after being convicted in a murder case, is a resident of district’s Kulla Habibpur village. “He was taken to a government hospital on Sunday due to breathing problems and was referred to Aligarh. But there was no bed available there, so he was brought back to Etah, where he was admitted at the district hospital’s non Covid-19 ward. It is unclear under what circumstances he was tied to the bed. The entire matter is being investigated,” jailor Kuldeep Singh Bhadauria said. Warder Ashok Yadav has been suspended, the jailer added. “Those responsible for shackling the inmate will not be spared,” DG Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ailing-84-year-old-inmate-chained-to-hosp-bed-jail-warder-punished/articleshow/82622083.cms||Deepak Lavania

Sources said that the teachers of the two hospitals met state government officials, but except for commitments made to resolve the remaining issues, important issues remained unresolved. The agitation at SSGH is being conducted by the Gujarat Medical Teachers Association (GMTA) while that of teachers at the college affiliated to the Gotri hospital is being conducted by the GMERS Faculty Association. The nurses at the Gotri hospital have also rallied together under the banner of the GMERS Nurses Association. The medical teachers and nurses at the Gotri hospital are already on a strike. SSGH doctors have stayed away from non-Covid duties and have threatened to boycott Covid duties as well. At the other end, nurses of SSGH have also threatened to go on an agitation. The doctors as well as nurses are unhappy over their long-pending demands not being fulfilled. In case of GMTA, the government agreed to some demands but is dragging its feet on four major demands. GMTA has decided to continue its agitation for now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/stir-continues-at-ssg-gmers-hospitals/articleshow/82612582.cms||---

Police found the post during its social media monitoring activity after which the accused was booked. Police arrested construction contractor Sanjay alias Sanjaytori Talaviya (Dangar), a resident of Punagam for allegedly posting the image. The accused has been booked under various sections including 505(1)(b) relating to ‘whoever makes, publishes or circulates any statement, rumour or report, likely to cause, fear or alarm to the public, or to any section of the public whereby any person may be induced to commit an offence against the State or against the public tranquility’. The accused had posted the image on May 10 along with an objectionable write up, police said. “The post came to our knowledge during social media monitoring and we found the write up derogatory. The accused told the police that he did not create the image but received it as a forward,” said an official in cyber-crime cell. Talaviya was earlier vice-president of Surat district AAP unit, but was removed by the party leader for sharing objectionable materials on social media. “Talaviya may be supporting AAP and continuing as a worker but is not holding any post,” said Batuk Vadodariya, president AAP, Surat district. “Police are keeping close watch on multiple social media accounts which are being used to post inflammatory messages.

---||Vijayawada||CM Jagan bats for increase in vaccine manufacturing||Vijayawada: Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy on Thursday emphasised the need to increase vaccine manufacture in the country to meet the Covid-19 challenge. Speaking to the officials at his Tadepalli residence, the chief minister said that vaccination was the only answer to the pandemic. The country has two variants of vaccine, Covaxin developed by the Bharat Biotech and Covishield developed by Serum Institute, he said and added that the two companies were not able to meet the country’s requirement. He said that the country has over 26 crore people above the age of 45 years, who are to be vaccinated. This would require 52 crore doses of the vaccine. If the country has to give vaccine to people in the age group of 18-45 years, whose population is 60 crore, the country would require 120 crore doses of the vaccine, he said. Thus, the country would require 172 crore doses of vaccine to give vaccination to every person in the country. However, the country has given only 18 crore doses, which is less than 10 per cent of the requirement, he said. Jagan Mohan Reddy said that Bharat Biotech was manufacturing one lakh doses per month, while the Serum Institute was producing six lakh doses. At this rate, the country would take several years to give vaccination to every citizen, the chief minister said. Keeping this in mind, the chief minister sought to advise the central government to think of alternatives to increase the production of doses to meet the country’s requirement. He also appealed to the people to strictly follow the Covid-19 protocol to avoid contacting the virus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/cm-jagan-bats-for-increase-in-vaccine-manufacturing/articleshow/82612972.cms||Gopi Dara

Police said Crimsun Organics, which was part of Sipcot industrial cluster, was functioning with 50% workforce as per Covid-19 protocol when the boiler exploded due to a valve malfunction. Some of the workers, who inhaled the gas, swooned after complaining of breathlessness. Rs 3L solatium announced for kin of victimsA team of fire and rescue services personnel rescued and admitted them to the Cuddalore government hospital.

---||Delhi||Give food, transport to stranded migrants in Delhi-NCR: SC||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday ordered the Centre, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana governments to immediately provide dry ration or cooked food to migrant workers struck in Delhi-NCR because of the curfew and semi-lockdowns declared by the states in a bid to curb the second surge of Covid-19. It also asked these governments to arrange transport for those keen to return home. The court passed the interim directions after advocate Prashant Bhushan urged it to direct the Centre to resume last year’s Atmanirbhar Bharat scheme for the migrant workers. TimesViewMigrant workers have been at the receiving end of the coronavirus intermittently for over a year now. Many lost their source of livelihood and remain trapped in helpless situations. The apex court is rightly trying to ensure that governments take care of them in these distressing times. Unlike the last time, no administrative authority can use the pretext of being caught by surprise.‘Migrants being fleeced by pvt transporters’Bhushan told the court migrant workers were being fleeced by private transporters who demanded four to five times the normal fare from the distressed and jobless workers. Appearing for the Centre, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said the government has not declared a complete lockdown like last year and transport utilities are functioning as usual. He said state governments have advised industrial units to incentivise workers so that there is no exodus. “If the court directs the governments to provide free transportation back home, it could incentivise a reverse migration which would be detrimental to industrial production,” he said. The bench said, “We have to deal with hard reality and not ifs and buts. Why can't the Atmanirbhar Bharat scheme be extended to stranded migrant workers like last year?” Bhushan said there were eight crore identified migrant workers who could be given some financial assistance as Delhi government has done for construction workers. He also said the governments must give details of social welfare and food schemes extended to migrant workers who have reached their homes in various states. The bench said, “We direct the central government as well as the governments of NCT of Delhi, UP and Haryana (for the districts included in the NCR) to file a reply to the application suggesting means and measures by which they shall ameliorate miseries of stranded migrant labourers. We also issue notice to Maharashtra, Gujarat and Bihar to file responses giving details of measures which they propose to take to ameliorate the miseries of migrant workers, including transportation of stranded ones and providing dry ration or cooked meals to them.” The court passed the following interim order to the Centre, and governments of Delhi, UP and Haryana concerning stranded migrant workers in NCR districts: Give dry ration to them under Atmanirbhar Bharat scheme or any other scheme immediately without insisting on identity or ration cards; ensure adequate transport facilities for those wanting to go back home, states to identify such migrant workers and Centre to pitch in with railway facilities; open community kitchens at well advertised places so that workers and their family members can get two meals a day. Justices Bhushan and Shah recalled that the SC last year had passed a slew of directions for registration of migrant workers who had returned home because of the national lockdown and for a skill mapping exercise to provide them with work commensurate to their abilities. It had also asked states to detail steps taken under three enactments — Interstate Migrant Workmen (Regulations of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 1979; Construction Workers (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 1996; and, Unorganised Workers’ Social Security Act, 2008. It had said that states must make migrant workers aware of their rights and entitlements under various welfare schemes and Acts. The SC said on Thursday, “It appears that most states have not filed their specific responses on the aforesaid issues and if filed, they are inadequate. Therefore, as a last chance, we give further 10 days’ time to Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Bihar, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Odisha to file specific responses on the aforesaid issues, more particularly referred to in our earlier orders dated June 9 and July 31 last year and steps taken or to be taken and within how much time.” It posted the matter for further hearing on May 24.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/give-food-transport-to-stranded-migrants-in-delhi-ncr-sc/articleshow/82622089.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The ECI had earlier decided to defer all by-elections to various state assemblies due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The ECI on Thursday released a note stating that the three vacancies coming up in AP assembly besides six in Telangana assembly would not be filled till the situation returns to normalcy. The ECI said, “it would not be appropriate to hold biennial elections… till the pandemic situation significantly improves and conditions become conducive.” The ECI said that the commission would take a decision at appropriate time in future after taking inputs from the states concerned and assessing the pandemic situation from mandated authorities like National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA). Meanwhile, the AP Legislative Council would see the retirement of three members, including its chairman M A Shariff and BJP AP state president Somu Veerraju. The third member, Devasani Chinna Govinda Reddy, is from the ruling YSR Congress. Shariff was elected to the Legislative Council in 2015, after the state was bifurcated and TDP formed the government in 2014. He was the government whip in the council before he was elevated as chairman on February 7, 2019, after incumbent N Md Farooq was inducted into the cabinet. Somu Veerraju was elected to the council in alliance with the TDP in 2015 and was the first MLC for the BJP in the state after bifurcation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ec-defers-mlc-polls-in-ap-due-to-covid-19/articleshow/82612998.cms||Gopi Dara

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka to ramp up testing again||BENGALURU: While the state’s daily Covid-19 data bulletin over the past couple of days shows that the number of fresh cases in the state – even some of the worst-hit districts – has been falling, experts, who have been monitoring the pandemic situation closely suggest the curve may not be flattening just yet. This, they say, because the number of tests conducted in the state has decreased significantly. They say the curve will flatten only if the positivity rate is low while testing is high. An analysis of daily testing and infection data across districts, including Bengaluru, suggests that the recent drop in infections is largely due to a decline in testing. The number of RT-PCR tests conducted has decreased by about 30,000 over the past few days. While the state conducted around 1.5 lakh tests between the last week of April and the first week of May, the number began to dip to 1.2 lakh tests per day from May 9. As a result, the number of positive cases being reported had also fallen. In Bengaluru alone, cases have dropped from around 24,000 on May 5 to 16,000 on May 12. The drop in testing comes just when experts have recommended testing to be ramped up to ensure early detection of infection and quick treatment to avoid hospitalization and deaths. While shortage of testing kits is one reason for the drop in testing, some private labs claim that since Sunday, the health department had withdrawn login access for staff on the pretext of discrepancies in details of RT-PCR tests conducted. Each lab must enter details of the person being tested along with his/ her Aadhaar and mobile numbers on the website. An SRF number is then generated which acts as the reference number of the patient. This helps the government keep track of those who test positive. “In our lab, 10 staff had login access but for the past four days only three had access. As a result, there was a significant decline in testing,” said a doctor in charge of a private lab in Bengaluru. However, the government began restoring login credentials of staff late on Wednesday after questions were raised. “Last night, two of our staff whose login access was suspended was restored,” said a staff member at a diagnostic centre. In a statement submitted to the Karnataka high court, the government has said iat has about 10.5 lakh RAT kits in stock and this will be enough for seven days. A total of 50,000 RAT kits are being supplied every day. In addition to this, it has decided to procure 37 lakh RT-PCR kits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-to-ramp-up-testing-again/articleshow/82622126.cms||Anil Gejji
---||Vijayawada||HC ruling may come as breather for elected representatives facing trial in special courts||Vijayawada: Public representatives would not come under the jurisdiction of special courts if the occurrence of crime was prior to their election as public representatives, the AP high court said in a recent judgement.  The ruling can come as a breather for many politicians against whom cases are pending in special courts set up for speedy trial of cases against elected public representatives. The high court passed the order in the petition filed by Penamaluru MLA K Pardasarathi, challenging the transfer of a case against him to the special court for trial of cases against MPs and MLAs. He also sought quashing of the case against him. A complaint was filed before the first metropolitan magistrate in 2012, alleging that Pardasarathi suppressed facts in his election affidavit filed in 2009, about two pending cases against him before the special judge for economic offences in Hyderabad under the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act. The court took cognizance of the matter under Representation of People’s Act and section 177 of IPC against Pardasarathi. While the case is under trial, it was transferred to a special court constituted for trial of cases against MPs and MLAs in 2018. Pardasarathi moved the high court contending that he was not an elected people’s representative at the time of occurrence of the alleged crime and hence the special court does not have the jurisdiction to try the case. He further sought quashing of the case against him stating that the charges framed against him are not maintainable. The high court agreed with the argument that at the time of occurrence of the alleged crime, he was only an aspirant but not an elected public representative. Justice U Durga Prasad Rao noted that as the special court was constituted for the trial of cases against present or former MPs and MLAs only, it does not have jurisdiction over the case. However, the court observed that on the basis that the special court is not having jurisdiction, the cases cannot be quashed, and the original court which started the trial has to complete the process and should decide the matter based on facts and evidence. The judgement can come as breather for many MPs and MLAs facing criminal charges against them as many of those cases are now being heard by special courts. Hearing of these cases has been put on fast track after a Supreme Court direction that cases against MPs and MLAs should be disposed expeditiously in a time bound manner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hc-ruling-may-come-as-breather-for-elected-representatives-facing-trial-in-special-courts/articleshow/82613015.cms||Srikanth Aluri

The deceased were identified as V Eswara Rao (36), V Annapurna (33), Aradasi Swami (55) and the unnamed infant. All of them were residents of Pedavalasa in Tallarevu mandal of East Godavari district. Police said the driver may have dozed off or lost control due to overspeeding, due to which the car rammed head-on into a lorry coming from the opposite direction.

---||Goa||Goa: Positivity rate drops to 35%, 63 succumb||PANAJI: In the last 24-hours, 63 people lost their lives due to Covid-19, taking the mortality count to 1,938 in the state. The case positivity rate dropped to 35% as the state reported 2,491 new infections and 2,266 people were cured. Goa has nearly 33,000 active cases. In the last seven days, 436 people have succumbed to the virus, and the state government has not been able to reduce mortalities. While 15-20% of patients are hospitalised few hours before they die, a considerable number reach a hospital a week or 10 days after falling ill. A health official said that, with a considerable rise in caseload, it has become difficult to monitor patients in home isolation. As of Thursday, only 248 patients were placed in Covid care centres. “It is difficult to monitor patients in home isolations and many move about before their isolation period ends increasing the risk of spreading the infection. I feel the government ought to have shifted people living in congested areas or those having big families to the Covid care centre. There is no guarantee that all people will behave responsibly,” he said. The official said that people with comorbidities, and especially senior citizens with no resources to take care of themselves, should be shifted to a Covid care centre. If any patient’s parameters appear unstable, she/he could be shifted to the hospital before it is too late. “It is humanly impossible to keep a tab of 30,000-odd people in home isolation,” he said. A sarpanch of a village panchayat in North Goa said that some people from one big family in his village roamed about the village when they should actually have to be in isolation. “Their neighbours were not aware that several people from the family had tested positive. Within eight to 10 days we had many cases, and in some cases whole families testing positive. We could not do anything against the culprit family,” the sarpanch said. Some stay indoors for a few days and then start going out, he added.

The deceased were identified as Veeranki Dasu and Jatti Dinesh Varma — both residents of SC colony in Kolluru.

AP is the first state in the country to set up such institutions, which will provide food, shelter and education to these children. Two helpline numbers — 181 and 1098 — have been set up for assistance pertaining to these centres. Any child or guardian in need of assistance can contact the helpline numbers, post which teams will be sent to the residence of the child and transport them to the nearest CCI where they would be provided the required care, support and protection. “Three siblings were recently rescued by a district team, as their father had tested positive and was receiving treatment at a government hospital in Anantapur. Their mother tested positive as well and is currently taking medication for symptoms. She wanted to send her children to their relatives’ place in Hindupur, but the relatives were reluctant due to fear of contracting the virus,” Krithika Batra, director of women development and child welfare, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/govt-sets-up-32-child-care-institutions/articleshow/82613053.cms||---

The Centre also announced that an oxygen tanker will be supplied to Goa on a daily basis. With the growing stress on the medical system, the Goa government appealed to the Union minister of state for defence Shripad Naik. “All the states, including Goa, are facing this major epidemic. Oxygen scarcity has been a headache for the government. The need for oxygen is increasing day by day. The Union government is making every effort to meet the demands of the states,” said Naik. Two IAF An-32 aircraft landed at INS Hansa with 323 oxygen concentrators. The ministry of defence is also exploring the means to set up an oxygen generating plant in Goa as soon as possible. “The planes arrived from Baroda and left around 2.45pm,” a source said. Chief minister Pramod Sawant said that the Government of India has made an additional allocation of 20 MT of liquid medical oxygeb, thereby raising the overall supply to 46 MT to the state of Goa. Oxygen shortage is crippling the state, particularly Goa Medical College, with at least 62 lives being lost in the last three days because of the oxygen shortage. Union minister Nitin Gadkari issued directions for one tanker of oxygen to be supplied to Goa on a daily basis. “Also, seeing the increasing demand for oxygen in Goa, and after the discussions with chief minister Pramod Sawant, Nitin Gadkari has instructed to send one tanker of oxygen to Goa every day,” said Gadkari’s office in a tweet. Chief minister Pramod Sawant approached the Centre and Gadkari asking for additional oxygen. Goa’s advocate general Devidas Pangam on Thursday informed the high court of Bombay at Goa that the Central government has increased the quota of oxygen supplies for Goa, “having regard to the overwhelming number of Covid victims” in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-gets-o2-concentrators-centre-assures-daily-tanker/articleshow/82616957.cms||---

---||India||Government refutes bench ‘avoidance’ charge in border road case||The Supreme Court on Thursday deferred a hearing on widening of roads in border areas amidst a verbal duel with Citizen for Green Doon, an NGO, alleging that the Centre is resorting to bench “avoidance” by insisting the case be adjudicated by a vacation bench instead of the regular bench and the Centre rubbishing the allegations as delaying tactics. At the outset of the proceedings, senior advocate Colin Gonsalves, appearing for the NGO, told a bench of Justices Vineet Saran and Dinesh Maheshwari that he had filed a written submission and pleaded the bench to go through it. But Attorney General K K Venugopal, appearing for the Centre, immediately took strong objection and submitted that the petitioner not be allowed to raise baseless and motivated allegations. In the written submission, the NGO said, “The application under consideration is for the modification of the order dated September 8, 2020, passed by a three-judge bench. It is humbly submitted that any modification of this order would be required to be done by a threejudge bench. It is further humbly submitted that the matter be placed before the regular bench for the reason that the Union of India is engaging in the most unfortunate activity of Bench avoidance.” It further said there is no urgency to hear the matter during vacation when the Centre had requested for adjournments repeatedly before the regular bench which had heard the matter on 18 dates. Questioning the motive of the NGO, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said there is some other “source of inspiration” for the NGO to raise such objections when the country urgently needed to improve military infrastructure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/government-refutes-bench-avoidance-charge-in-border-road-case/articleshow/82622172.cms||---

At the end of the day, there were 1.8 lakh active cases in the state. Although fresh cases in hotspot Chennai dropped from 7,564 on Wednesday to 6991 on Thursday, the active cases increased from 40,613 to 42,579. All districts in the state reported more than 150 cases each, while cases in at least six of them were in four digits. More than 92% of oxygen beds in the state were occupied through the day several private hospitals were turning away patients or referring them to other hospitals. The oxygen supply to these hospitals come from the Government. After visiting GHs in the morning, Subramanian said patients were waiting in queues inside ambulances because private hospitals refer them when they need oxygen. “They admit patients with mild or no symptoms and when they develop complications, they are referred to GHs. Hospitals have to make basic arrangements and can’t play with the lives of people during pandemic,” he told reporters. The state has allotted 450 from the 1,300 fleet Covid ambulances exclusively for Covid patients. Another 2000 vehicles come from private services.”All 108 ambulances have oxygen cylinders. In addition private ambulances get 50 lts of biogas from Reliance,” he said The state receives only 419 metric tonnes of oxygen and has asked the centre to provide at least 100 more tonnes to meet the demand, he said. The state now allots medical oxygen to different hospitals as per demand and admissions. He praised Hande Hospital for opening a 40-bed facility to treat Covid-19 patients. “The hospital management says they will be able to manage patients on their own. Like government hospitals, private hospitals should also develop facilities to stay self-dependent,” he said. The state is also ramping up oxygen and covid care beds, he said. Chennai reported 88 deaths followed by 32 in Chengalpet and 22 in Tiruvallur and 18 in Kanyakumari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/30621-new-cases-297-deaths-from-covid-19-in-tamil-nadu/articleshow/82622165.cms||---

A special division bench comprising chief justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and justice Aravind Kumar gave this direction after the additional solicitor general (ASG) Aishwarya Bhati assured the court that the necessary decision towards bridging the gap visa-vis availability of vaccines in Karnataka is expected to be taken at a meeting scheduled to be held on May 14. Observing it will be a great national waste if those who have taken the first dose are required to take the first dose again owing to non-availability of vaccines, the bench pointed out that if the figures given by the state government are correct, the state will not be able to cater to the need of all those who have already taken the first dose even if it receives more than 40 lakh doses in the second half of May. The court also directed the state government to place on record all facts and figures (districtwise) regarding the second dose administered throughout the state. InconsistentThe bench, after perusing the latest written submissions placed on record by the state government, noted that the figures are inconsistent vis-avis the last status update. The state government stated that the second dose is due for 14,87,000 Covishield beneficiaries and 5,10,000 Covaxin beneficiaries, totalling 19,97,000 doses.

---||Nagpur||BJP, PM responsible for loss of lives due to Covid-19: Patole||Nagpur: Censuring the BJP-led central government for its failure in tackling the Covid-19 pandemic, state Congress president Nana Patole on Thursday squarely blamed the saffron party and Prime Minister Narendra Modi for lakhs of deaths due to the deadly virus. “Our leader Rahul Gandhi had last year warned of such an unprecedented crisis in India. Yesterday also he highlighted the plight of citizens, who’re suffering due to lack of oxygen and lifesaving drugs like Remdesivir. But the BJP activists made fun of it. Now, the entire population is reiterating the same thing that he had said, but the PM isn’t uttering a single word and is not visible. He and his party have caused increasing deaths and despair in the country.” Blaming Modi for the current precarious condition in the country due to the contagion, the Sakoli MLA said now even the media abroad was accusing him of failure to take steps to prevent the pandemic. “It was only after Congress’ call that Serum Institute of India (SII) chief Adar Poonawala had informed that the NDA government had given him an order to manufacture additional vaccines on April 23. They had enough time since last October, but the government failed to pay heed to warnings of Covid second wave. As a result, SII took orders from other countries and supplied injections to them.” On shortage of vaccines, the former speaker said the BJP-led government failed to come out with a concrete policy, despite such a big calamity. “They’re claiming that about 17 crore people have been vaccinated so far. The BJP members must understand that we’ve a population of 130 crore and we would need about 300 crore doses, if every citizen needs two injections and wastage is taken into account. Congress had demanded to inoculate the citizens at their homes and it was later reiterated by the high court as well. Even Nagpur is facing tremendous shortage, but its leaders in NMC are only interested in flashing their pictures in the media,” Patole said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bjp-pm-responsible-for-loss-of-lives-due-to-covid-19-patole/articleshow/82631996.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||India||Supreme Court rejects UP’s prisoner-release policy||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has disapproved of the practice of the Uttar Pradesh government releasing life convicts who are eligible for remission of sentence only on the Republic Day. The court said the exercise must be done throughout the year and set a deadline of four weeks for the state to decide the plea of prisoners seeking premature release. While deciding a batch of petitions filed by over 30 life convicts lodged in different jails in Uttar Pradesh, a bench of Justices Navin Sinha and V Ramasubramanian also held that the state government should itself find out prisoners who are fulfilling the criteria for premature release as per its 2018 policy and release them. The state framed the policy on the directions of the Allahabad HC. “Curiously, contrary to the direction of the HC, the state government arbitrarily restricted it to premature release of prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment on the Republic Day each year only. The restricted policy is patently bad for being in derogation of the orders of the HC,” the bench said. “Additionally, it is also discriminatory in nature as there is no nexus to be achieved by providing for premature release only on a specified date, when those eligible to be considered for premature release form a class of persons sentenced to life imprisonment. There is no criteria laid down on the basis of which a convict shall be considered for release on the opportune date in contradistinction to another who may be relegated to consideration in normal course,” the bench said. Times View: A prisoner should not be in jail even for a day more than his term requires. Waiting for a particular designated day could end up extending his or her prison term several months by default. Apart from being a gross violation of human rights, such an act also adds to overcrowding of jails and burdens state finances. It is about time the system is abandoned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/supreme-court-rejects-ups-prisoner-release-policy/articleshow/82622270.cms||---

The new cases were detected through 73,675 tests carried out in the past 24 hours at a positivity rate of 14.24%, the lowest in a month since Delhi recorded 13.14% on April 13. Covid-19 fatalities, however, remained high at 308. The number of vacant ICU beds more than doubled to 211 on Thursday evening, compared with 84 on Wednesday evening, as per the Delhi Corona App. Over 100 were available on Thursday evening at GTB Hospital (88), where a new Covid care centre with ICU beds has been set up at an adjacent Ramlila Ground, apart from the nearby Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty hospital (24). Meanwhile, 15,189 patients recovered in the last 24 hours. Active cases came down from 82,725 on Wednesday to 77,717. With more people recovering every day than the number of new cases reported, the count of active cases has dipped by 22% from the all-time high of 99,725 reported a fortnight ago on April 29. Positivity rate below 20% for fourth day, 5,212 beds vacantAfter a high of 36.24% recorded on April 22, the positivity rate in the capital has been on a steady decline with Thursday being the fourth day in a row that the positivity rate has been below 20%. The steady dip in number of active cases and positivity rate has resulted in more beds being now available at hospitals and the availability of even the hard-to-find ICU beds has improved. From just 1,199 vacant hospital beds on April 30, the number has gone up to 5,212 on Thursday, according to the health bulletin shared by the Delhi government. While 78,035 tests were carried out on Wednesday, the number came down slightly to 73,675 on Thursday, out of which 58,709 were RT-PCR tests and 14,966 were rapid antigen tests. On April 13, for instance, when Delhi last reported a lower positivity rate of 13.14%, a total of 13,468 cases had been reported from 1,02,460 tests. Delhi’s health minister, Satyendar Jain, reiterated on Thursday that the reason for the dip in the number of tests, which hovered around one lakh a day last month, is due to the ongoing lockdown. He told reporters at a press briefing that most people are not stepping out of their homes, and as a result, a large number of random tests that used to be carried out at public places like markets earlier are no longer taking place. The total number of deaths due to Covid-19 in the national capital has reached 20,618 and the month of May has already recorded 4,471 Covid-19 fatalities till Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-19-delhi-cases-continue-to-dip-positivity-rate-drops-to-14-3-more-beds-free/articleshow/82622267.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu parties agree to tighten Covid curbs||CHENNAI: Amid rising cases of Covid-19 and tardy implementation of the lockdown measures in force across TN from May 10 to May 24, an all party meet chaired by chief minister M K Stalin on Thursday resolved to intensify the existing restrictions. It was also agreed to constitute an all party legislators’ committee to offer suggestions on improving the Covid guidelines. The CM also said that a meeting of a fee fixation committee will be held soon to fix the cost for RT-PCR tests conducted by private laboratories. Five resolutions were passed at the three-hour long meeting in which members of the DMK, the AIADMK, and their allies took part. A resolution said, “The meeting resolved to intensify the existing restrictions as the state has the responsibility to protect lives.” The parties also decided to engage wholeheartedly in Covid relief work and advise people to strictly adhere to guidelines. The DMK government, which organized its first all-party meeting after assuming power, had pressed the previous AIADMK government for such a meeting when it was in the opposition. The chief minister detailed the steps taken by his government to prevent deaths and control infection. “The government had extended certain relaxations to ensure that the lockdown did not affect people’s livelihood. But a few make use of the relaxations to violate lockdown measures. Hence, you offer suggestions whether to continue with the relaxations or change them,” the CM said. The state government would float global tenders to inoculate those in the age group of 18-45, the CM said, and added that efforts were being taken by the state to source oxygen from states like Odisha and West Bengal. Pressure exerted on the Centre had yielded results, he said. “The government has been taking several measures to increase oxygen stock. I will announce them in the next few days,” Stalin said. Because of the efforts taken by the government, TN got oxygen concentrators from Singapore and Taiwan, several industrial establishments, and also from donors. The CM said a centralized command centre (war room) was set up to augment bed facilities and availability of oxygen and ambulances all through the day. A four-member committee of IAS officers led by industries secretary was also set up to monitor oxygen storage and ensure supply of the gas from other states and industrial establishments. Since a large number of people were getting infected across districts, the demand for oxygen beds was on the rise. In anticipation, new bed facilities were being created at several places, including Chennai Trade Centre in Nandambakkam. The anti-viral drug, remdesivir, was being distributed in other parts of the state as well. A separate siddha covid care centre has been opened in Tambaram, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-parties-agree-to-tighten-covid-curbs/articleshow/82622281.cms||---

Narayan said five lakh home isolation kits are being procured for the purpose. “In most cases, by the time Covid test results arrive, the infection will be in the inflammation stage,” the minister said. “So, what is needed mainly is anti-inflammatory treatment. This medical kit will mainly comprise antibiotic and antiviral tablets and vitamin supplements that are prescribed to reduce inflammation. In addition, it will also contain steroid tablets which could be used in the later stage if the symptoms are not mitigated.” Narayan said: “Those who have Covid symptoms need not wait to start taking anti-inflammatory medicines till the result arrives. People who have cough, cold, vomiting or diarrhoea should not be misled and take these symptoms lightly. They should not think it is a common health problem. In this changed situation, most of these cases are turning out to be Covid positive.” The minister said authorities have been directed to ensure systematic delivery of home isolation medical kits. Narayan insisted the allocation of oxygen made for the state is sufficient for the existing number of oxygenated beds. “If and when the number of beds is increased, we will need additional supply of oxygen,” he said. “To meet this possible higher demand, action will be taken to procure oxygen,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-isolation-kits-from-tomorrow-says-deputy-chief-minister-cn-ashwath-narayan/articleshow/82622297.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengalureans seeking jab in other districts face locals’ ire||BENGALURU/KOLAR: Youngsters from Bengaluru travelling to inoculation centres in surrounding districts such as Chikkaballapura, Tumakuru, Kolar and pockets of Bengaluru Rural like Nelamangala to get the Covid-19 shot, are increasingly running into resistance from locals, who say they are consuming their share of doses. While arguments have broken out, no untoward incident has taken place. District administrations are deploying police at session sites such as government hospitals, where vaccines are being administered. Police say locals are miffed with Bengalureans taking “their share” of doses, leaving them with a shortage. A senior officer said there is “no way” to stop anyone from going anywhere to take the vaccine. “The most we can do is pacify both sides,” he said. The officer cited the example of a young woman who got into an argument with a software professional from Bengaluru outside Nelamangala government hospital. “The woman said her mother is unable to get the vaccine due to a shortage caused by increasing visitors from the city. The software professional replied saying that she should speak to the authorities concerned and that he was helpless. Similar scenes are being witnessed at other health centres outside Bengaluru,” he said. However, Bengalureans say they have no choice. Nitish Kumar and Kameshwari, who are from Koramangala, travelled nearly 80km to get the jab at a site in Chikkaballapura. Nitish, a tech company employee, told TOI that though he wanted to get the shot in Bengaluru, the only available slot showing on the CoWIN app was in Chikkaballapura. Since he was desperate to get the shot, he opted to travel there. Local residents from these districts had approached senior police, requesting them to send back vaccine seekers from Bengaluru. “We told them we don’t have the right to stop anyone seeking the vaccine. They then asked us to arrange vaccines for them, but this again is not in our hand,” another senior officer from Chikkaballapura said. In Kolar on Wednesday, hours before the government suspended the drive for people between 18 and 44 years, district in-charge minister Aravinda Limbavali said they were halting vaccinations for people below 44 years to streamline the process and to give locals priority. Scores of youth from Bengaluru are visiting far off places like Gudibande and Bagepalli in Kolar and Chikkaballapura for the jab. Dr Jagadish, district surgeon, Kolar, told TOI that since there were complaints that people from Bengaluru got most of the doses on Monday, authorities decided to halt the drive with a view to give local youth priority. Dr PV Ramesh, district surgeon, Chikkaballapura, said the vaccine drive is continuing in the district but admitted that most beneficiaries in the last couple of days were from Bengaluru.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengalureans-seeking-jab-in-other-districts-face-locals-ire/articleshow/82622207.cms||Rajiv Kalkod

Hospital administrators too made frequent calls to the government for oxygen refills. The long line of ambulances outside city hospitals meant patients had to wait up to six hours for admission. The state’s been allotted 419 tonnes of oxygen, but public health authorities say they need more. “It’s touch and go. We don’t have any buffer,” said a senior official. Sterlite in Tuticorin sent its first consignment on Thursday and the state is awaiting the oxygen express from Odisha by Friday. “We don’t yet know if all this will suffice as the cases go up,” said a senior official. Subsidy for manufacturersTo boost supply, the Tamil Nadu government on Thursday announced special incentives including 30% capital subsidy for fresh investments made for manufacturing ventilators and oxygen cylinders and producing medical oxygen. In the case of large investments needed to set up liquid oxygen plants with a capacity of at least10 tonnes, the 30% capital subsidy will be paid across five years. While TIIC will extend loan with 6% interest subvention, Sipcot and Sidco will allot plots on a priority basis. Such units will get single window clearance without any fee, an official release said. CII working groupsTo aid the government in the war on Covid, the Tamil Nadu chapter of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has set up six special working groups. CII has roped in its past chairmen as well as sector-specific experts to be part of these groups, which will assist the state in ramping up oxygen production, increasing number of beds in government hospitals and achieving 100% vaccination for all employees of member companies in 3-4 months. “The six working groups will individually focus on oxygen, adding number of beds, creating awareness about Covid among the public, ensuring vaccination for all employees, establishing a helpline for the public and coordinating efforts through CSR activities. We are constantly interacting with the state government and have even met the chief minister and senior officials in the government, who has been very receptive to our initiatives,” S Chandrakumar, chairman, CII TN told TOI. “We have already supplied 1,000 oxygen concentrators and have placed orders for 5,000 regulators. In addition, we are sourcing 5,000 oxygen cylinders. We are sourcing filled oxygen cylinders including 3,000 from Dubai and 1,000 from Singapore. These will be shipped soon to the state,” Chandrakumar said. In addition, CII member companies are establishing small oxygen plants in government hospitals including Chengalpet and Sriperumbudur and other parts of Tamil Nadu. “These plants will cater to the oxygen needs of 25-30 patients at a time,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-offers-incentives-for-firms-producing-oxygen-ventilators/articleshow/82622305.cms||D Govardan
---||India||From September to April, PM in 6 meets with CMs warned them of 2nd wave: BJP||NEW DELHI: Rebutting the opposition’s allegation that the government ignored the risk of a second surge of infections, BJP on Thursday circulated details of the times when the Modi government alerted states about the imminence of a second wave, when it issued advisories and took other measures. The party said PM Narendra Modi, in his interactions with chief ministers, repeatedly raised the issue of rising infections in certain parts and asked them to take measures to handle the surge. The party also circulated a video of Modi’s meetings with CMs on March 17 where he had sounded an alert about a fresh spike in infections after they had plateaued and asked them to take urgent steps before it was too late. “We are confident about our Covid management but our confidence should not become overconfidence,” Modi had said and urged states to become proactive in order to contain the spread of the virus and insisted on micro containment zones. In fact, from September 2020 to April this year, the PM held six interactions with chief ministers, starting from September 23 last year to the latest one on April 23. BJP said even in September last year, the PM had asked chief ministers to focus on 60 districts with a high burden of cases and increase testing substantially. During the same meeting, the PM had informed chief ministers that the limit of using the state disaster response fund for Covid-specific infrastructure had been increased from 35% to 50%. “Moreover, the PM’s interaction with CMs on March 17 took place when India had only 30,000 new cases per day,” the party said and circulated a ‘Narrative vs Truth’ chart, which was shared by its senior leaders and supporters. The party alleged that opposition CMs like Mamata Banerjee (West Bengal) and Bhupesh Baghel (Chhattisgarh) skipped these interactions as they were busy with assembly polls. Baghel had a long stay in Assam as a key campaigner for Congress. It also said the Centre had dispatched teams to various parts as soon as states like Maharashtra and Kerala started showing a steady increase in people testing positive. BJP took on Congress for the latter’s criticism of the vaccination policy, saying the opposition party’s functionaries like Lok Sabha MP Manish Tewari, spokesperson Randeep Surjewala and health ministers of Congress-ruled states, such as T S Singh Deo (Chhattisgarh) and Bana Gupta (Jharkhand), sought to promote vaccine resistance by raising questions about the efficacy of “made-in India” Covaxin. “India is in the midst of a pandemic. Its scientists raced against time to produce a vaccine. They were reviewed at different levels before being given emergency use approval so that lives could be saved. But the opposition, Congress in particular, mocked it. Result: people died,” BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya tweeted, sharing videos of Congress leaders’ reservations about use of Covaxin. Referring to claims that India had the highest number of cases in the word, the party said, “India has more people than Europe and North America put together. So, in absolute numbers, India will obviously be higher. But in terms of cases and deaths per million population, India stands at 110th in the world so far.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/from-september-to-april-pm-in-6-meets-with-cms-warned-them-of-2nd-wave-bjp/articleshow/82622310.cms||Akhilesh Singh
---||Kolkata||Guv faces black flags, blames ‘collapse of law’||Cooch Behar/Kolkata: Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar was greeted with black flags by Trinamool Congress supporters during his Sitalkuchi visit on Thursday. Trinamool men mobbed his car quite a few times following which the governor admonished the Dinhata inspector-in-charge (IC). BJP MP Nisith Pramanik was seen asking police to lathicharge the mob and make way for Dhankhar. Dismayed with the repeated mobbing, the governor blamed inadequate police arrangements made during his journey via Dinhata. “I am being gheraoed repeatedly,” he said to the IC. The police officer tried to convey that adequate arrangements had been made for the governor in Sitalkuchi but Dhankhar didn’t buy the argument. “What arrangements have been made for the governor? You have excuses. But why law and order is not maintained,” Dhankhar said, adding the repeated mobbing was a breach of law and order. “Trinamool rogues came in my way. It points to the total collapse of the rule of law,” Dhankhar further said and added that he had never dreamt of such a “nanga raj”. Dhankhar said he saw the pain of people as houses had been looted and materials stored for marriages had not been spared. “Even items stored for last rites were looted,” the governor said in Sitalkuchi. Earlier in the day, Dhankhar visited Mathabhanga area’s Choto Khater Bari, where houses of BJP workers had been vandalised. At Mathabhanga, the governor spoke his mind on the state of affairs in Bengal where he couldn’t move freely. “In a democracy, all have the right to move. It is my constitutional duty,” he said in response to the chief minister’s letter that the head of state was crossing his brief by deciding his itinerary without holding prior consultations with the council of ministers. “In time of such an unprecedented crisis, there was a need to act in togetherness with all concerned, including the Governor. It was no time for optics or playing to the gallery when we are in the midst of unprecedented post-poll retributive violence,” Dhankhar tweeted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/guv-faces-black-flags-blames-collapse-of-law/articleshow/82617275.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Murshidabad’s zilla parishad chief quits, Malda’s faces trust vote||Malda/Berhampore: Trinamool Congress’s resounding victory in Malda and Murshidabad in the recently concluded Bengal assembly elections has propelled winds of change in the top echelons of the three-tier rural administration in the two districts. Murshidabad zilla sabhadhipati Mosharraf Hossain, who had switched to Congress from Trinamool ahead of the polls, tendered his resignation on Thursday while Trinamool members of Malda zilla parishad are bringing a no-confidence motion against sabhadhipati Gour Mandal, who is known to be a Suvendu Adhikari loyalist. Hossain decided to step down after he lost from Naoda. Trinamool, on the other hand, bagged 18 of the 22 assembly seats in the district. The party didn’t waste time in crying no-confidence against 11 “gaddars (traitors)”, including Hossain. The meeting on the motion is scheduled on May 24. “I submitted my resignation because my party (the Congress) lost the assembly polls. I have no moral right to continue as sabhadhipati. I will start from scratch to strengthen Congress in the district,” Hossain said. Trinamool district president Abu Taher Khan said: “Some of the defectors tried to find their way back into the party, but we are not entertaining them.” In the 70-member Murshidabad zilla parishad, 68 owe allegiance to Trinamool and one to Congress on paper. In Malda, Adhikari supporter Mandal had joined the BJP ahead of the elections to become a candidate from Manikchak, where he lost to Trinamool. Former sabhadhipati Sarala Murmu too had joined the BJP even though Trinamool had given the leader a poll ticket from Habibpur. Trinamool is now all set to remove Mandal from his post because members are not in a mood to give the BJP a foothold in the zilla parishad. “We are bringing a no-confidence motion not only against him, but also his loyalists. We have the majority,” said Trinamool’s Malda president Mousam Noor. However, Mandal — unlike his counterpart in Murshidabad — isn’t willing to go down without a fight. “I am not resigning because I enjoy the support of a majority of the members. The board is with the BJP. Most of the members are with us,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/murshidabads-zilla-parishad-chief-quits-maldas-faces-trust-vote/articleshow/82617246.cms||Subhro Maitra
---||Kolkata||NCSC team on ‘fact-finding’ mission in East Burdwan||Nabagram: A National Commission for Scheduled Castes team on Thursday met family members of three persons killed at Nabagram in East Burdwan. It is in Bengal on a two-day “fact-finding” visit in the wake of post-poll violence. The team, led by NCSC chairperson Vijay Sampla, will go to South 24 Parganas on Friday. “We had a complaint that a woman was raped and murdered. But we could not talk to anyone in the family nor could we meet neighbours. It seems people have fled their houses. We will talk to the administration and it is part of the investigation,” Sampla said. According to sources, NCSC has received more than 1,600 complaints of post-poll violence in the state and the panel is looking into each. Answering questions on whether the team would pay a visit to Trinamool victims’ families as well, Sampla said he would reach out to every family that had complained to the panel. “NCSC will intervene when it gets a complaint from a Dalit family. However, we had a word with the district magistrate and he assured rehabilitation of families within five days,” he added. “We do not get into their political identities. I cannot comment on what others have said about the commission’s visit,” Sampla added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ncsc-team-on-fact-finding-mission-in-east-burdwan/articleshow/82617434.cms||Mohammad Asif
---||Kolkata||TMC: Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar acting on BJP’s post-poll script||KOLKATA: Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar’s visit to Cooch Behar on Thursday accompanied by BJP MP Nisith Pramanik prompted Trinamool Congress to ask if Raj Bhavan was exceeding its constitutional norms and acting on a post-poll script authored by PM Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah, who were still unable to “accept their miserable defeat” in the just-concluded Bengal polls. Former finance minister Yashwant Sinha said: “The West Bengal governor is acting according to a script provided to him by Modi and Shah, who have not yet accepted their miserable defeat in the elections and who have no respect for the Constitution of India. They will never leave Mamata Banerjee in peace.” MP Saugata Roy said, “He has shattered to pieces all constitutional norms and decorum. The governor may have forgotten the constitutional provisions from Article 153 to 162, which makes it incumbent that he acts on the aide and advice of the chief minister and her council of ministers. He has blatantly violated that by proceeding to Cooch Behar, without the consent of the state, and levelling imaginary charges against the chief minister.” “Why would a BJP MP accompany him? Is he there to serve the interest of people or a political party? We had earlier gone to the President against him and even now, if the party leader wants, we will move again. This is unpardonable,” Roy added. TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh accused the governor of taking a partisan attitude and claimed that Dhankhar visited the houses of some BJP workers selectively. He also claimed that Dhankhar was working at the bidding of the BJP and taking its leaders along during his visit. Trinamool Congress Lok Sabha chief whip Kalyan Banerjee, addressing the governor in a media statement, said: “Throughout your tenure as governor, you have criticised Ms. Mamata Banerjee-led state govt and tried to install BJP govt in the state of WB, but the people, by their mandate in the just-concluded election, rejected your opinion and effort to install BJP in the state. You cannot post any tweet criticising the state government. Your actions are unconstitutional and unethical. Kindly restrain yourself from being BJP’s flag-bearer and act in accordance with constitutional laws.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tmc-dhankhar-acting-on-bjps-post-poll-script/articleshow/82617343.cms||---

I’ll be spending the day at home with my family. We’ll pray together, eat together and spend some quality time with each other. It doesn’t feel like a celebration this year because of what’s happening across the country. I think we must all pray together and hope for better times. In pre-COVID times, we’d have many parties for Eid. All of our friends and relatives would gather and we’d hug each other and celebrate together. I’ll be missing all those hugs and parties this year. Having said that, I’m fortunate enough to be with my family and spend Eid with them. When we sit down for lunch, we’ll just be grateful to have each other and be safe during this tough times. – Ali Reza, actor ‘This Eid is going to be all about gratitude and family time’Every year, we get dressed up on Eid, binge on sheer khurma, visit our relatives and have some more sheer khurma. This year, I’ll be missing out on meeting all my relatives and friends for Eid. I won’t even be meeting my grandmother since she lives far away and we don’t think it’s safe to travel at this point. So this year, it’s going to be a quiet celebration for us at home. I will be spending the day with my mom and younger sister Inaaya. This Eid is all about gratitude, so we’ll celebrate the fact that we have each other in our lives. I’m a spiritual person, so I’ll be doing a lot of meditation — it’s my way of praying. I will wish for a world without conflict and bloodshed and pray for peace and prosperity. – Faria Abdullah, actor ‘ This pandemic has helped us form new connections, I look forward to celebrating Eid with my neighbours’Eid is the one time of the year when all of us get together and meet. So it’s very disappointing to be locked in again and not be able to meet my family. Our celebrations will be virtual once again. However, I’d like to look at the positive side of things. Since we haven’t been able to meet family members, I’ve connected with my neighbours in a way I never would have pre-COVID. We’re all going through this crisis and it has allowed us to forge new connections. My neighbours have been there for me during tough times and we have helped each other. I look forward to spending my Eid with them this year – Baseer Ali ‘It’s imperative that we resolve to do whatever it takes to weather this pandemic’In the face of the unimaginable hardships that the COVID-19 pandemic has unleashed on humanity, it is easy to lose hope and get swept away by all the fear, anxiety and negativity around. The last two years have been a trial of faith, as life as we knew it turned on its head. Who would’ve thought that a day will come when you wouldn’t be able to meet and greet your loved ones on Eid? But it is imperative that in the true spirit of the festival, we all resolve to do whatever it takes to weather this storm. Celebrating Eid in a safe and simple way is the need of the hour. So many common folk have risen to the occasion to do whatever they can to help ease the pain of those worse off than us. This Eid is going to be all about keeping the faith that we will overcome this virus. — Munawwar Ali Mukhtasar, Deccani humourist ‘We’re looking forward to an intimate celebration with family this Eid’Considering the rapid spread of new variant of the virus, the government’s decision for lockdown was essential for the safety of all citizens. Right now, we must be thankful for our health and just being in the company of our loved ones. After a Ramzan filled with fasting and prayer, celebrating Eid intimately with family is what we are looking forward to this year. Post-pandemic, we can Inshallah look forward to once again festively celebrating Eid in a grander way but right now safeguarding our health and that of our friends and family is our priority. — Anjum Babu Khan, educationist ‘This Eid, we must all introspect, help the needy and offer a silent prayer to those we lost’This year, we won’t be celebrating Eid. Yes, we will gather as a family, pray and eat together, but it won’t be a celebration. How can we celebrate when there is so much suffering in the world right now? Over the last few weeks, we have all lost people that we know. This year, we must offer a silent prayer for all those who lost their lives to COVID and for their families. We must also introspect and seek to become better people once this is all over. We must do our bit to help out those who are in distress during this crisis. Through my charitable organisation, I’m trying to raise vaccine awareness in the city and we’re working to encourage people to take the vaccine as and when possible. We must all do our bit to overcome this crisis together. — MA Faiz Khan, Paigah scion ‘Eid celebrations at our home are set to turn virtual this year’Ours is an open house every Eid. Right through the day, friends and family members and well-wishers visit us and we dine and celebrate together. In fact, people from across different cities and cultures come to celebrate with us. So Eid has always been a multicultural celebration. While COVID has played spoilsport yet again this year, we will continue or ritual of celebrating the festival with all our friends, albeit virtually. I have virtual calls lined up with all our relatives as well as friends living in different parts of the world. We will all be praying together as a family and have a virtual celebration. — Aamer Javeed, politician ‘I’m just praying that the pandemic ends and life gets back to normal soon’I live in Charminar and celebrating with my extended family in Old City is what Eid has meant for me all my life. All of Old City comes alive during the month of Ramzan, especially during the iftar. I miss the food walks the most. But over the last two years, all the pomp and festivity has just disappeared and all the streets look abandoned. Of course, we have a celebration at home, and my mom is making all the Eid delicacies. But it is going to be muted. Last year I decided to visit orphanages and old age homes to drop some goodies, just to cheer the up. I’m just praying that this pandemic ends soon and life gets back to normal as soon as possible. — Zubair Ali, Food blogger||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyderabadis-to-have-quiet-eid-celebrations-with-family/articleshow/82606283.cms||---

(The Tamil Nadu government hasn’t opened vaccination for people aged between 18 and 45 years.) “Vaccination will be done at apartment complexes, markets, residential localities and companies. At a marriage hall, traders and associations will be called and administered the vaccine,” said a zonal health officer. Greater Chennai Corporation, which has a stock of 1.2 lakh doses of Covishield doses and 16,000 of Covaxin, will keep about 20% as reserve for second doses and administer the rest. “We want to finish the stocks we have and vaccinate the maximum number of people in a short time to cut the rate of transmission. What is the use of the vaccines if we do not use them?” corporation commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi said. Harminder Singh, principal secretary to municipal administration department, said the government was procuring more vaccines and there won’t be any shortage. All zonal medical officers and zonal health officers were called for a meeting on Thursday to review vaccine coverage. Many zones in the north such as Thiruvottiyur (42%), Tondiarpet (29%) and Thiru Vi Ka Nagar (31%), which had low coverage of those above 45, will be the major focus, said an official. Some like Adyar (75%), Anna Nagar (70%) and Ambattur (63%) had better coverage. Of the 16.4 lakh doses administered so far, Covishield accounted for12 lakh (8.7 lakh 1st dose and 3.3 lakh 2nd dose) and Covaxin 4.3 lakh (2.6 lakh 1st dose and1.7 lakh 2nd dose). In the drive that began in February, about 16.38 lakh have been vaccinated (including both doses). Of the nearly 22 lakh people above 45 years in a population of 80 lakh, about 50% got the first dose. “We vaccinated about 35,000 a day earlier. Since May, there has been a fall in numbers. To ensure 35,000-40,000 are vaccinated daily, we will vaccinate them all,” said Bedi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-corporation-to-run-major-vaccination-drive-for-three-days/articleshow/82622314.cms||Komal Gautham

The Bhupesh Baghel-led government attributed the decision to the rise in coronavirus cases in the state, and added that it would take even more stringent measures for austerity. The idea seemed to be to neutralise BJP’s criticism and highlight the Centre’s persistence with the Central Vista project. “In this regard, extending the measures already being taken, the construction work of new Raj Bhavan, assembly house, CM house, and new Circuit House under construction in Naya Raipur has now been stopped with immediate effect,” a government statement said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bhupesh-baghel-reacts-to-jp-nadda-letter-stops-work/articleshow/82622336.cms||Swati Mathur
---||India||US ‘undercounted’ 3.4 lakh deaths, India 4.3 lakh: Study||BENGALURU: As multiple countries continue to deal with Covid-19, a new analysis from the University of Washington Institute For Health Metrics & Evaluation (IHME) shows how various countries may be under-reporting or undercounting deaths. According to the analysis in the study “Estimation of total mortality due to Covid-19”, the US and India together may have 7.7 lakh more deaths due to Covid-19 than they officially reported. Analysis shows that the US may have undercounted deaths by at least 3.4 lakh, while it is 4.3 lakh in India. Among the top six countries with a high number of reported deaths, the UK’s reporting is the best, while Russia’s is the worst (see graphic). “In the IHME estimation of Covid-19 infections, hospitalisations, and deaths to date, we used to use officially reported Covid-19 deaths for nearly all locations. As of today, we are switching to a new approach that relies on the estimation of total mortality due to Covid-19,” the researchers said. Several reasons that have led them to adopt this new approach: These reasons include the fact that testing capacity varies markedly across countries and within countries over time, which means that the reported Covid-19 deaths as a proportion of all deaths due to Covid-19 also vary markedly across countries and within countries over time. “Our approach to estimating the total Covid-19 death rate is based on measurement of the excess death rate during the pandemic week by week compared to what would have been expected based on past trends and seasonality. However, the excess death rate does not equal the total Covid-19 death rate,” the researchers said. According to IHME, excess mortality is a function of six potential drivers, the most important of which is the total Covid-19 death rate. “...Deaths that are directly due to Covid-19 are likely underreported in many locations, particularly in settings where Covid-19 testing is in short supply. Most excess mortality is likely misclassified Covid-19 deaths,” the analysis reads. The second driver of excess mortality was reduced health care utilization for many causes; however, the impact of reduced health care use on health outcomes is harder to prove. Third, convincing evidence has been found that rates of anxiety and depression have increased, which might in turn lead to increases in deaths from suicide, the analysis reads. “Fourth, researchers reviewed evidence on decreases in injuries as a result of reductions in mobility. Fifth, some infectious causes of death may have declined during the pandemic due to the behavioral changes associated with control of the pandemic, including mask use and reduced contact with others. Sixth, deaths from some chronic conditions such as ischemic heart disease or chronic respiratory disease declined in some months of 2020,” the analysis reads. According to Statista, a German data company that does analysis and collates data from various sources, IHME estimates show that the total number of deaths from Covid-19 in India is almost three times as high as reported. The situation is similar in Mexico, which has an estimated 180% additional non-reported deaths. Russia is even suspected to have an actual death toll almost 5.5 times as high as its reported one.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/us-undercounted-3-4-lakh-deaths-india-4-3-lakh-study/articleshow/82622386.cms||Chethan Kumar

The lockdown, which was to have concluded on May 17, was extended by another week with Covid-19 cases consistently rising and the East Khasi Hills district currently having 2121 active cases. “In view of the increasing trend of active cases and based on the report received from districts, the government has decided to extend the lockdown in East Khasi Hills till 24th May, 2021,” chief minister Conrad K Sangma informed after holding a review meeting this evening. On the availability of medical oxygen, the chief minister informed that oxygen stocks in the State were “manageable”. “Installation of 6 units of oxygen generators will be carried out in Civil Hospital, Shillong and will be made functional by next week. This will cut down the use of oxygen cylinders in the hospital which will be sent to other parts of the State,” the chief minister informed. “Oxygen generators for Tura, Jowai and Nongpoh are on their way to the state. Installations will be done immediately upon their arrival and they will be made functional by June 2021,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/lockdown-extended-in-shillong-as-cases-mount/articleshow/82622395.cms||Manosh Das
